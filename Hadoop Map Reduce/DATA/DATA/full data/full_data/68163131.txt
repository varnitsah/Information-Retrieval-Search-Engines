skippers in my time said the nightwatchman them that go down in big ships see the wonders o’ the deep you know he added with a sudden chuckle but the one i’m going to tell you about ought never to have been trusted out without ’is ma a good many o’ my skippers had fads but this one was the worst i ever sailed under  it’s some few years ago now i’d shipped on his barque the john elliott as slowgoing an old tub as ever i was aboard of when i wasn’t in quite a fit an’ proper state to know what i was doing an’ i hadn’t been in her two days afore i found out his ’obby through overhearing a few remarks made by the second mate who came up from dinner in a hurry to make ’em ’i don’t mind saws an’ knives hung round the cabin’ he ses to the fust mate ’but when a chap has a ’uman ’and alongside ’is plate studying it while folks is at their food it’s more than a christian man can stand’  ’that’s nothing’ ses the fust mate who had sailed with the barque afore ’he’s half crazy on doctoring we nearly had a mutiny aboard once owing to his wanting to hold a postmortem on a man what fell from the masthead wanted to see what the poor feller died of’  ’i call it unwholesome’ ses the second mate very savage’ he offered me a pill at breakfast the size of a small marble quite put me off my feed it did’  of course the skipper’s fad soon got known for’ard but i didn’t think much about it till one day i seed old dan’l dennis sitting on a locker reading every now and then he’d shut the book an’ look up closing ’is eyes an’ moving his lips like a hen drinking an’ then look down at the book again  ’why dan’ i ses ’what’s up you ain’t larning lessons at your time o’ life’  ’yes i am’ ses dan very soft ’you might hear me say it it’s this one about heart disease’  he hands over the book which was stuck full o’ all kinds o’ diseases and winks at me ’ard  ’picked it up on a bookstall’ he ses then he shut ’is eyes an’ said his piece wonderful it made me quite queer to listen to ’im ’that’s how i feel’ ses he when he’d finished ’just strength enough to get to bed lend a hand bill an’ go an’ fetch the doctor’  then i see his little game but i wasn’t going to run any risks so i just mentioned permiscous like to the cook as old dan seemed rather queer an’ went back an’ tried to borrer the book being always fond of reading old dan pretended he was too ill to hear what i was saying an’ afore i could take it away from him the skipper comes hurrying down with a bag in his ’and  ’what’s the matter my man’ ses he ’what’s the matter’  ’i’m all right sir’ ses old dan ’cept that i’ve been swoonding away a little’  ’tell me exactly how you feel’ ses the skipper feeling his pulse  then old dan said his piece over to him an’ the skipper shook his head an’ looked very solemn  ’how long have you been like this’ he ses  ’four or five years sir’ ses dan ’it ain’t nothing serious sir is it’  ’you lie quite still’ ses the skipper putting a little trumpet thing to his chest an’ then listening ’um there’s serious mischief here i’m afraid the prognotice is very bad’  ’prog what sir’ ses dan staring  ’prognotice’ ses the skipper at least i think that’s the word he said ’you keep perfectly still an’ i’ll go an’ mix you up a draught and tell the cook to get some strong beeftea on’  well the skipper ’ad no sooner gone than cornish harry a great big lumbering chap o’ six feet two goes up to old dan an’ he ses ’gimme that book’  ’go away’ says dan ’don’t come worrying ’ere you ’eard the skipper say how bad my prognotice was’  ’you lend me the book’ ses harry ketching hold of him ’or else i’ll bang you first and split to the skipper arterwards i believe i’m a bit consumptive anyway i’m going to see’  he dragged the book away from the old man and began to study there was so many complaints in it he was almost tempted to have something else instead of consumption but he decided on that at last an’ he got a cough what worried the fo’c’sle all night long an’ the next day when the skipper came down to see dan he could ’ardly ’ear hisself speak  ’that’s a nasty cough you’ve got my man’ ses he looking at harry  ’oh it’s nothing sir’ ses harry careless like ’i’ve ’ad it for months now off and on i think it’s perspiring so of a night does it  ’what’ ses the skipper ’do you perspire of a night’  ’dredful’ ses harry ’you could wring the clo’es out i s’pose it’s healthy for me ain’t it sir’  ’undo your shirt’ ses the skipper going over to him an’ sticking the trumpet agin him ’now take a deep breath don’t cough’  ’i can’t help it sir’ ses harry ’it will come seems to tear me to pieces’  ’you get to bed at once says the skipper taking away the trumpet an’ shaking his ’ed ’it’s a fortunate thing for you my lad you’re in skilled hands with care i believe i can pull you round how does that medicine suit you dan’  ’beautiful sir’ says dan ’it’s wonderful soothing i slep’ like a newborn babe arter it’  ’i’ll send you some more’ ses the skipper ’you’re not to get up mind either of you’  ’all right sir’ ses the two in very faint voices an’ the skipper went away arter telling us to be careful not to make a noise  we all thought it a fine joke at first but the airs them two chaps give themselves was something sickening being in bed all day they was naturally wakeful of a night and they used to call across the fo’c’sle inquiring arter each other’s healths an’ waking us other chaps up an’ they’d swop beeftea an’ jellies with each other an’ dan ’ud try an’ coax a little port wine out o’ harry which he ’ad to make blood with but harry ’ud say he hadn’t made enough that day an’ he’d drink to the better health of old dan’s prognotice an’ smack his lips until it drove us a’most crazy to ’ear him  arter these chaps had been ill two days the other fellers began to put their heads together being maddened by the smell o’ beeftea an’ the like an’ said they was going to be ill too and both the invalids got into a fearful state of excitement  ’you’ll only spoil it for all of us’ ses harry ’and you don’t know what to have without the book’  ’it’s all very well doing your work as well as our own’ ses one of the men ’it’s our turn now it’s time you two got well’  ’well ses harry ’well why you silly iggernerant chaps we shan’t never get well people with our complaints never do you ought to know that’  ’well i shall split ’ses one of them ’you do’ ses harry ’you do an’ i’ll put a ’ed on you that all the port wine and jellies in the world wouldn’t cure ’sides don’t you think the skipper knows what’s the matter with us’  ’afore the other chap could reply the skipper hisself comes down accompanied by the fust mate with a look on his face which made harry give the deepest and hollowest cough he’d ever done  ’what they reely want’ ses the skipper turning to the mate ’is keerful nussing’  ’i wish you’d let me nuss ’em’ ses the fust mate ’only ten minutes—i’d put ’em both on their legs an’ running for their lives into the bargain in ten minutes’  ’hold your tongue sir’ ses the skipper ’what you say is unfeeling besides being an insult to me do you think i studied medicine all these years without knowing when a man’s ill’  the fust mate growled something and went on deck and the skipper started examining of ’em again he said they was wonderfully patient lying in bed so long an’ he had ’em wrapped up in bedclo’es and carried on deck so as the pure air could have a go at ’em we had to do the carrying an’ there they sat breathing the pure air and looking at the fust mate out of the corners of their eyes if they wanted anything from below one of us had to go an’ fetch it an’ by the time they was taken down to bed again we all resolved to be took ill too  only two of ’em did it though for harry who was a powerful uglytempered chap swore he’d do all sorts o’ dreadful things to us if we didn’t keep well and hearty an’ all ’cept these two did one of ’em mike rafferty laid up with a swelling on his ribs which i knew myself he ’ad ’ad for fifteen years and the other chap had paralysis i never saw a man so reely happy as the skipper was he was up an down with his medicines and his instruments all day long and used to make notes of the cases in a big pocketbook and read ’em to the second mate at mealtimes  the fo’c’sle had been turned into hospital about a week an’ i was on deck doing some odd job or the other when the cook comes up to me pulling a face as long as a fiddle  ’nother invalid’ ses he ’fust mate’s gone stark staring mad’  ’mad’ ses i  ’yes’ ses he ’he’s got a big basin in the galley an’ he’s laughing like a hyener an’ mixing bilgewater an’ ink an’ paraffin an’ butter an’ soap an’ all sorts o’ things up together the smell’s enough to kill a man i’ve had to come away’  curiouslike i jest walked up to the galley an’ puts my ’ed in an’ there was the mate as the cook said smiling all over his face and ladling some thick sticky stuff into a stone bottle  ’how’s the pore sufferers sir’ ses he stepping out of the galley jest as the skipper was going by  ’they’re very bad but i hope for the best ses the skipper looking at him hard ’i’m glad to see you’ve turned a bit more feeling’  ’yes sir’ ses the mate ’i didn’t think so at fust but i can see now them chaps is all very ill you’ll s’cuse me saying it but i don’t quite approve of your treatment’  i thought the skipper would ha’ bust  ’my treatment’ ses he ’my treatment what do you know about it’  ’you’re treating ’em wrong sir’ ses the mate ’i have here’ patting the jar ’a remedy which ’ud cure them all if you’d only let me try it’  ’pooh’ ses the skipper ’one medicine cure all diseases the old story what is it where’d you get it from’ ses he  ’i brought the ingredients aboard with me’ ses the mate ’it’s a wonderful medicine discovered by my grandmother an’ if i might only try it i’d thoroughly cure them pore chaps’  ’rubbish’ ses the skipper  ’very well sir’ ses the mate shrugging his shoulders ’o’ course if you won’t let me you won’t still i tell you if you’d let me try i’d cure ’em all in two days that’s a fair challenge’  well they talked and talked and talked until at last the skipper give way and went down below with the mate and told the chaps they was to take the new medicine for two days jest to prove the mate was wrong  ’let pore old dan try it first sir’ ses harry starting up an’ sniffing as the mate took the cork out ’he’s been awful bad since you’ve been away’  ’harry’s worse than i am sir’ ses dan ’it’s only his kind heart that makes him say that’  ’it don’t matter which is fust’ ses the mate filling a tablespoon with it ’there’s plenty for all now harry’  ’take it’ ses the skipper  harry took it an’ the fuss he made you’d ha’ thought he was swallering a football it stuck all round his mouth and he carried on so dredful that the other invalids was half sick afore it came to them  by the time the other three ’ad ’ad theirs it was as good as a pantermime an’ the mate corked the bottle up and went an’ sat down on a locker while they tried to rinse their mouths out with the luxuries which had been given ’em  ’how do you feel’ ses the skipper  ’i’m dying’ ses dan  ’so’m i’ ses harry ’i b’leeve the mate’s pisoned us  the skipper looks over at the mate very stern an’ shakes his ’ed slowly  ’it’s all right’ ses the mate ’it’s always like that the first dozen or so doses’  ’dozen or so doses’ ses old dan in a faraway voice  ’it has to be taken every twenty minutes’ ses the mate pulling out his pipe and lighting it an’ the four men groaned all together  ’i can’t allow it’ ses the skipper ’i can’t allow it men’s lives mustn’t be sacrificed for an experiment’  ’’t ain’t a experiment’ ses the mate very indignant ’it’s an old family medicine’  ’well they shan’t have any more’ ses the skipper firmly  ’look here’ ses the mate ’if i kill any one o’ these men i’ll give you twenty pound honour bright i will’  ’make it twentyfive’ ses the skipper considering  ’very good’ ses the mate ’twentyfive i can’t say no fairer than that can i it’s about time for another dose now’  he gave ’em another tablespoonful all round as the skipper left an’ the chaps what wasn’t invalids nearly bust with joy he wouldn’t let ’em have anything to take the taste out ’cos he said it didn’t give the medicine a chance an’ he told us other chaps to remove the temptation an’ you bet we did  after the fifth dose the invalids began to get desperate an’ when they heard they’d got to be woke up every twenty minutes through the night to take the stuff they sort o’ give up old dan said he felt a gentle glow stealing over him and strengthening him and harry said that it felt like a healing balm to his lungs all of ’em agreed it was a wonderful sort o’ medicine an’ arter the sixth dose the man with paralysis dashed up on deck and ran up the rigging like a cat he sat there for hours spitting an’ swore he’d brain anybody who interrupted him an’ arter a little while mike rafferty went up and j’ined him an’ it the fust mate’s ears didn’t burn by reason of the things them two pore sufferers said about ’im they ought to  they was all doing full work next day an’ though o’course the skipper saw how he’d been done he didn’t allude to it not in words that is but when a man tries to make four chaps do the work of eight an’ hits ’em when they don’t it’s a easy job to see where the shoe pinches     a love passage     the mate was leaning against the side of the schooner idly watching a few redcoated linesmen lounging on the tower quay careful mariners were getting out their sidelights and careless lightermen were progressing by easy bumps from craft to craft on their way up the river a tug half burying itself in its own swell rushed panting by and a faint scream came from aboard an approaching skiff as it tossed in the wash  jessica ahoy bawled a voice from the skiff as she came rapidly alongside  the mate roused from his reverie mechanically caught the line and made it fast moving with alacrity as he saw that the captain’s daughter was one of the occupants before he had got over his surprise she was on deck with her boxes and the captain was paying off the watermen  you’ve seen my daughter hetty afore haven’t you said the skipper she’s coming with us this trip you’d better go down and make up her bed jack in that spare bunk  ay ay said the mate dutifully moving off  thank you i’ll do it myself said the scandalised hetty stepping forward hastily  as you please said the skipper leading the way below let’s have a light on jack  the mate struck a match on his boot and lit the lamp  there’s a few things in there’ll want moving said the skipper as he opened the door i don’t know where we’re to keep the onions now jack  we’ll find a place for ’em said the mate confidently as he drew out a sack and placed it on the table  i’m not going to sleep in there said the visitor decidedly as she peered in ugh there’s a beetle ugh  it’s quite dead said the mate reassuringly i’ve never seen a live beetle on this ship  i want to go home said the girl you’ve no business to make me come when i don’t want to  you should behave yourself then said her father magisterially what about sheets jack and pillers  the mate sat on the table and grasping his chin pondered then as his gaze fell upon the pretty indignant face of the passenger he lost the thread of his ideas  she’ll have to have some o’ my things for the present said the skipper  why not said the mate looking up again—why not let her have your stateroom  ’cos i want it myself replied the other calmly  the mate blushed for him and the girl leaving them to arrange matters as they pleased the two men by borrowing here and contriving there made up the bunk the girl was standing by the galley when they went on deck again an object of curious and respectful admiration to the crew who had come on board in the meantime she stayed on deck until the air began to blow fresher in the wider reaches and then with a brief goodnight to her father retired below  she made up her mind to come with us rather suddenly didn’t she inquired the mate after she had gone  she didn’t make up her mind at all said the skipper we did it for her me an’ the missus it’s a plan on our part  wants strengthening said the mate suggestively  well the fact is said the skipper it’s like this jack there’s a friend o’ mine a provision dealer in a large way o’ business wants to marry my girl and me an’ the missus want him to marry her so o’ course she wants to marry someone else me an’ ’er mother we put our ’eads together and decided for her to come away when she’s at ’ome instead o’ being out with towson direckly her mother’s back’s turned she’s out with that young sprig of a clerk  nicelooking young feller i s’pose said the mate somewhat anxiously  not a bit of it said the other firmly looks as though he had never had a good meal in his life now my friend towson he’s all right he’s a man of about my own figger  she’ll marry the clerk said the mate with conviction  i’ll bet you she don’t said the skipper i’m an artful man jack an’ i generally speaking get my own way i couldn’t live with my missus peaceable if it wasn’t for management  the mate smiled safely in the darkness the skipper’s management consisting chiefly of slavish obedience  i’ve got a cabinet fortygraph of him for the cabin mantelpiece jack continued the wily father he gave it to me o’ purpose she’ll see that when she won’t see the clerk an’ byandbye she’ll fall into our way of thinking anyway she’s going to stay here till she does  you know your way about cap’n said the mate in pretended admiration  the skipper laid his finger on his nose and winked at the mainmast there’s few can show me the way jack he answered softly very few now i want you to help me too i want you to talk to her a great deal  ay ay said the mate winking at the mast in his turn  admire the fortygraph on the mantelpiece said the skipper  i will said the other  tell her about a lot o’ young girls you know as married young middleaged men an’ loved ’em more an’ more every day of their lives continued the skipper  not another word said the mate i know just what you want she shan’t marry the clerk if i can help it  the other turned and gripped him warmly by the hand if ever you are a father your elf jack he said with emotion i hope as how somebody’ll stand by you as you’re standing by me  the mate was relieved the next day when he saw the portrait of towson he stroked his moustache and felt that he gained in good looks every time he glanced at it  breakfast finished the skipper who had been on deck all night retired to his bunk the mate went on deck and took charge watching with great interest the movements of the passenger as she peered into the galley and hotly assailed the cook’s method of washing up  don’t you like the sea he inquired politely as she came and sat on the cabin skylight  miss alsen shook her head dismally i’ve got to it she remarked  your father was saying something to me about it said the mate guardedly  did he tell the cook and the cabin boy too inquired miss alsen flushing somewhat what did he tell you  told me about a man named towson said the mate becoming intent on the sails and—another fellow  i took a little notice of him just to spoil the other said the girl not that i cared for him i can’t understand a girl caring for any man great clumsy ugly things  you don’t like him then said the mate  of course not said the girl tossing her head  and yet they ’ve sent you to sea to get out of his way said the mate meditatively well the best thing you can do—his hardihood failed him at the pitch  go on said the girl  well it’s this way said the mate coughing they’ve sent you to sea to get you out of this fellow’s way so if you fall in love with somebody on the ship they’ll send you home again  so they will said the girl eagerly i’ll pretend to fall in love with that nicelooking sailor you call harry what a lark  i shouldn’t do that said the mate gravely  why not said the girl  ’tisn’t discipline said the mate very firmly it wouldn’t do at all he’s before the mast  oh i see remarked miss alsen smiling scornfully  i only mean pretend of course said the mate colouring just to oblige you  of course said the girl calmly well how are we to be in love  the mate flushed darkly i don’t know much about such things he said at length but we’ll have to look at each other and all that sort of thing you know  i don’t mind that said the girl  then we’ll get on by degrees said the other i expect we shall both find it come easier after a time  anything to get home again said the girl rising and walking slowly away  the mate began his part of the lovemaking at once and fixing a gaze of concentrated love on the object of his regard nearly ran down a smack as he had prognosticated it came easy to him and other wellmarked symptoms such as loss of appetite and a partiality for bright colours developed during the day between breakfast and tea he washed five times and raised the ire of the skipper to a dangerous pitch by using the ship’s butter to remove tar from his fingers  by ten o’clock that night he was far advanced in a profound melancholy all the looking had been on his side and as he stood at the wheel keeping the schooner to her course he felt a fellowfeeling for the hapless towson his meditations were interrupted by a slight figure which emerged from the companion and after a moment’s hesitation came and took its old seat on the skylight  calm and peaceful up here isn’t it said he after waiting some time for her to speak stars are very bright tonight  don’t talk to me said miss alsen snappishly  why doesn’t this nasty little ship keep still i believe it’s you making her jump about like this  me said the mate in amazement  yes with that wheel  i can assure you —began the mate  yes i knew you’d say so said the girl  come and steer yourself said the mate then you’ll see  much to his surprise she came and leaning limply against the wheel put her little hands on the spokes while the mate explained the mysteries of the compass as he warmed with his subject he ventured to put his hands on the same spokes and gradually becoming more venturesome boldly supported her with his arm every time the schooner gave a lurch  thank you said miss alsen coldly extricating herself as the male fancied another lurch was coming goodnight  she retired to the cabin as a dark figure which was manfully knuckling the last remnant of sleep from its eyelids stood before the mate chuckling softly  clear night said the seaman as he took the wheel in his great paws  beastly said the mate absently and stifling a sigh went below and turned in  he lay awake for a few minutes and then well satisfied with the day’s proceedings turned over and fell asleep he was pleased to discover when he awoke that the slight roll of the night before had disappeared and that there was hardly any motion on the schooner the passenger herself was already at the breakfasttable  cap’n’s on deck i s’pose said the mate preparing to resume negotiations where they were broken off the night before i hope you feel better than you did last night  yes thank you said she  you’ll make a good sailor in time said the mate  i hope not said miss alsen who thought it time to quell a gleam of peculiar tenderness plainly apparent in the mate’s eyes i shouldn’t like to be a sailor even if i were a man  why not inquired the other  i don’t know said the girl meditatively but sailors are generally such scrubby little men aren’t they  scubby repeated the mate in a dazed voice  i’d sooner be a soldier she continued i like soldiers—they’re so manly i wish there was one here now  what for inquired the mate in the manner of a sulky schoolboy  if there was a man like that here now said miss alsen thoughtfully i’d dare him to mustard old towson’s nose  do what inquired the astonished mate  mustard old towson’s nose said miss alsen glancing lightly from the cruetstand to the portrait  the infatuated man hesitated a moment and then reaching over to the cruet took out the spoon and with a pale determined face indignantly daubed the classic features of the provision dealer his indignation was not lessened by the behaviour of the temptress who instead of fawning upon him for his bravery crammed her handkerchief to her mouth and giggled foolishly  where’s father she said suddenly as a step sounded above oh you will get it  she rose from her seat and standing aside to let her father pass went on deck the skipper sank on to a locker and raising the teapot poured himself out a cup of tea which he afterwards decanted into a saucer he had just raised it to his lips when he saw something over the rim of it which made him put it down again untasted and stare blankly at the mantelpiece  who the—what the—who the devil’s done this he inquired in a strangulated voice as he rose and regarded the portrait  i did said the mate  you did roared the other you what for  i don’t know said the mate awkwardly something seemed to come over me all of a sudden and i felt as though i must do it  but what for where’s the sense of it said the skipper  the mate shook his head sheepishly  but what did you want to do such a monkeytrick for roared the skipper  i don’t know said the mate doggedly but it’s done ain’t it and it’s no good talking about it  the skipper looked at him in wrathful perplexity you’d better have advice when we get to port jack he said at length the last few weeks i’ve noticed you’ve been a bit strange in your manner you go an’ show that ’ed of yours to a doctor  the mate grunted and went on deck for sympathy but finding miss alsen in a mood far removed from sentiment and not at all grateful drew off whistling matters were in this state when the skipper appeared wiping his mouth  i’ve put another portrait on the mantelpiece jack he said menacingly it’s the only other one i’ve got an’ i wish you to understand that if that only smells mustard there’ll be such a row in this ’ere ship that you won’t be able to ’ear yourself speak for the noise  he moved off with dignity as his daughter who had overheard the remark came sidling up to the mate and smiled on him agreeably  he’s put another portrait there she said softly  you’ll find the mustardpot in the cruet said the mate coldly  miss alsen turned and watched her father as he went forward and then to the mate’s surprise went below without another word a prey to curiosity but too proud to make any overture he compromised matters by going and standing near the companion  mate said a stealthy whisper at the foot of the ladder  the mate gazed calmly out to sea  jack said the girl again in a lower whisper than before  the mate went hot all over and at once descended he found miss alsen her eyes sparkling with the mustardpot in her left hand and the spoon in her right executing a wardance in front of the second portrait  don’t do it said the mate in alarm  why not she inquired going within an inch of it  he’ll think it’s me said the mate  that’s why i called you down here said she you don’t think i wanted you do you  you put that spoon down said the mate who was by no means desirous of another interview with the skipper  shan’t said miss alsen  the mate sprang at her but she dodged round the table he leaned over and catching her by the left arm drew her towards him then with her flushed laughing face close to his he forgot everything else and kissed her  oh said hetty indignantly  will you give it to me now said the mate trembling at his boldness  take it said she she leaned across the table and as the mate advanced dabbed viciously at him with the spoon then she suddenly dropped both articles on the table and moved away as the mate startled by a footstep at the door turned a flushed visage ornamented with three streaks of mustard on to the dumbfounded skipper  sakes alive said that astonished mariner as soon as he could speak if he ain’t amustarding his own face now—i never ’card of such a thing in all my life don’t go near ’im hetty jack  well said the mate wiping his smarting face with his handkerchief  you’ve never been took like this before queried the skipper anxiously  o’course not said the mortified mate  don’t you say o’course not to me said the other warmly after behaving like this a straight weskit’s what you want i’ll go an’ see old ben about it he’s got an uncle in a ’sylum you come up too my girl  he went in search of ben oblivious of the fact that his daughter instead of following him came no farther than the door where she stood and regarded her victim compassionately  i’m so sorry she said does it smart  a little said the mate don’t you trouble about me  you see what you get for behaving badly said miss alsen judicially  it’s worth it said the mate brightening  i’m afraid it’ll blister said she she crossed over to him and putting her head on one side eyed the traces wisely three marks she said  i only had one suggested the mate  one what enquired hetty  those said the mate  in full view of the horrified skipper who was cautiously peeping at the supposed lunatic through the skylight he kissed her again  you can go away ben said the skipper huskily to the expert d’ye hear you can go away and not a word about this mind  the expert went away grumbling and the father after another glance which showed him his daughter nestling comfortably on the mate’s right shoulder stole away and brooded darkly over this crowning complication an ordinary man would have run down and interrupted them the master of the jessica thought he could attain his ends more certainly by diplomacy and so careful was his demeanour that the couple in the cabin had no idea that they had been observed—the mate listening calmly to a lecture on incipient idiocy which the skipper thought it advisable to bestow  until the midday meal on the day following he made no sign if anything he was even more affable than usual though his wrath rose at the glances which were being exchanged across the table  by the way jack he said at length what’s become of kitty loney  who inquired the mate who’s kitty loney  it was now the skipper’s turn to stare and he did it admirably  kitty loney he said in surprise the little girl you are going to marry  who are you getting at said the mate going scarlet as he met the gaze opposite  i don’t know what you mean said the skipper with dignity i’m allooding to kitty loney the little girl in the red hat and white feathers you introduced to me as your future  the mate sank back in his seat and regarded him with openmouthed horrified astonishment  you don’t mean to say you’ve chucked ’er pursued the heartless skipper after getting an advance from me to buy the ring with too didn’t you buy the ring with the money  no said the mate i—oh no—of course—what on earth are you talking about  the skipper rose from his seat and regarded him sorrowfully but severely i’m sorry jack he said stiffly if i’ve said anything to annoy you or anyway hurt your feelings o’ course it’s your business not mine p’raps you’ll say you never heard o’ kitty loney  i do say so said the bewildered mate i do say so  the skipper eyed him sternly and without another word left the cabin if she’s like her mother he said to himself chuckling as he went up the companionladder i think that’ll do  there was an awkward pause after his departure i’m sure i don’t know what you must think of me said the mate at length but i don’t know what your father’s talking about  i don’t think anything said hetty calmly pass the potatoes please  i suppose it’s a joke of his said the mate complying  and the salt said she thank you  but you don’t believe it said the mate pathetically  oh don’t be silly said the girl calmly what does it matter whether i do or not  it matters a great deal said the mate gloomily it’s life or death to me  oh nonsense said hetty she won’t know of your foolishness i won’t tell her  i tell you said the mate desperately there never was a kitty loney what do you think of that  i think you are very mean said the girl scornfully don’t talk to me any more please  just as you like said the mate beginning to lose his temper  he pushed his plate from him and departed while the girl angry and resentful put the potatoes back as being too floury for consumption in the circumstances  for the remainder of the passage she treated him with a politeness and good humour through which he strove in vain to break to her surprise her father made no objection at the end of the voyage when she coaxingly suggested going back by train and the mate as they sat at dummywhist on the evening before her departure tried in vain to discuss the journey in an unconcerned fashion  it’ll be a long journey said hetty who still liked him well enough to make him smart a bit what’s trumps  you’ll be all right said her father spades  he won for the third time that evening and feeling wonderfully well satisfied with the way in which he had played his cards generally could not resist another gibe at the crestfallen mate  you’ll have to give up playing cards and all that sort o’ thing when you’re married jack said he  ay ay said the mate recklessly kitty don’t like cards  i thought there was no kitty said the girl looking up scornfully  she don’t like cards repeated the mate lord what a spree we had cap’n when we went to the crystal palace with her that night  ay that we did said the skipper  remember the roundabouts said the mate  i do said the skipper merrily i’ll never forget ’em  you and that friend of hers bessie watson lord how you did go on continued the mate in a sort of ecstasy the skipper stiffened suddenly in his chair what on earth are you talking about he inquired gruffly  bessie watson said the mate in tones of innocent surprise little girl in a blue hat with white feathers and a blue frock that came with us  you’re drunk said the skipper grinding his teeth as he saw the trap into which he had walked  don’t you remember when you two got lost an’ me and kitty were looking all over the place for you demanded the mate still in the same tones of pleasant reminiscence  he caught hetty’s eye and noticed with a thrill that it beamed with soft and respectful admiration  you’ve been drinking repeated the skipper breathing hard how dare you talk like that afore my daughter  it’s only right i should know said hetty drawing herself up i wonder what mother’ll say to it all  you say anything to your mother if you dare said the now maddened skipper you know what she is it’s all the mate’s nonsense  i’m very sorry cap’n said the mate if i’ve said anything to annoy you or anyway hurt your feelings o’ course it’s your business not mine perhaps you’ll say you never heard o’ bessie watson  mother shall hear of her said hetty while her helpless sire was struggling for breath  perhaps you’ll tell us who this bessie watson is and where she lives he said at length  she lives with kitty loney said the mate simply  the skipper rose and his demeanour was so alarming that hetty shrank instinctively to the mate for protection in full view of his captain the mate placed his arm about her waist and in this position they confronted each other for some time in silence then hetty looked up and spoke  i’m going home by water she said briefly     the captain’s exploit     it was a wet dreary night in that cheerless part of the great metropolis known as wapping the rain which had been falling heavily for hours still fell steadily on to the sloppy pavements and roads and joining forces in the gutter rushed impetuously to the nearest sewer the two or three streets which had wedged themselves in between the docks and the river and which as a matter of fact really comprise the beginning and end of wapping were deserted except for a belated van crashing over the granite roads or the chance form of a docklabourer plodding doggedly along with head bent in distaste for the rain and hands sunk in trouserpockets  beastly night said captain bing as he rolled out of the private bar of the sailor’s friend and ignoring the presence of the step took a little hurried run across the pavement not fit for a dog to be out in  he kicked as he spoke at a shivering cur which was looking in at the crack of the bardoor with a hazy view of calling its attention to the matter and then pulling up the collar of his rough peajacket stepped boldly out into the rain three or four minutes’ walk or rather roll brought him to a dark narrow passage which ran between two houses to the waterside by a slight tack to starboard at a critical moment he struck the channel safely and followed it until it ended in a flight of old stone steps half of which were under water  where for inquired a man starting up from a small penthouse formed of rough pieces of board  schooner in the tier smiling jane said the captain gruffly as he stumbled clumsily into a boat and sat down in the stern why don’t you have better seats in this ’ere boat  they’re there if you’ll look for them said the waterman and you’ll find ’em easier sitting than that bucket  why don’t you put ’em where a man can see ’em inquired the captain raising his voice a little  the other opened his mouth to reply but realising that it would lead to a long and utterly futile argument contented himself with asking his fare to trim the boat better and pushing off from the steps pulled strongly through the dark lumpy water the tide was strong so that they made but slow progress  when i was a young man said the fare with severity i’d ha’ pulled this boat across and back afore now  when you was a young man said the man at the oars who had a local reputation as a wit there wasn’t no boats they was all noah’s arks then  stow your gab said the captain after a pause of deep thought  the other whose besetting sin was certainly not loquacity ejected a thin stream of tobaccojuice over the side spat on his hands and continued his laborious work until a crowd of dark shapes surmounted by a network of rigging loomed up before them  now which is your little barge he inquired tugging strongly to maintain his position against the fastflowing tide  smiling jane said his fare  ah said the waterman smiling jane is it you sit there cap’n an’ i’ll row round all their sterns while you strike matches and look at the names we’ll have quite a nice little evening  there she is cried the captain who was too muddled to notice the sarcasm there’s the little beauty steady my lad  he reached out his hand as he spoke and as the boat jarred violently against a small schooner seized a rope which hung over the side and swaying to and fro fumbled in his pocket for the fare  steady old boy said the waterman affectionately he had just received twopencehalfpenny and a shilling by mistake for threepence easy up the side you ain’t such a pretty figger as you was when your old woman made such a bad bargain  the captain paused in his climb and poising himself on one foot gingerly felt for his tormentor’s head with the other not finding it he flung his leg over the bulwark and gained the deck of the vessel as the boat swung round with the tide and disappeared in the darkness  all turned in said the captain gazing owlishly at the deserted deck well there’s a good hour an’ a half afore we start i’ll turn in too  he walked slowly aft and sliding back the companionhatch descended into a small evilsmelling cabin and stood feeling in the darkness for the matches they were not to be found and growling profanely he felt his way to the stateroom and turned in all standing  it was still dark when he awoke and hanging over the edge of the bunk cautiously felt for the floor with his feet and having found it stood thoughtfully scratching his head which seemed to have swollen to abnormal proportions  time they were getting under weigh he said at length and groping his way to the foot of the steps he opened the door of what looked like a small pantry but which was really the mate’s boudoir  jem said the captain gruffly  there was no reply and jumping to the conclusion that he was above the captain tumbled up the steps and gained the deck which as far as he could see was in the same deserted condition as when he left it anxious to get some idea of the time he staggered to the side and looked over the tide was almost at the turn and the steady clank clank of neighbouring windlasses showed that other craft were just getting under weigh a barge its red light turning the water to blood with a huge wall of dark sail passed noiselessly by the indistinct figure of a man leaning skilfully upon the tiller  as these various signs of life and activity obtruded themselves upon the skipper of the smiling jane his wrath rose higher and higher as he looked around the wet deserted deck of his own little craft then he walked forward and thrust his head down the forecastle hatchway  as he expected there was a complete sleeping chorus below the deep satisfied snoring of halfadozen seamen who regardless of the tide and their captain’s feelings were slumbering sweetly in blissful ignorance of all that the lancet might say upon the twin subjects of overcrowding and ventilation  below there you lazy thieves roared the captain tumble up tumble up  the snores stopped ay ay said a sleepy voice what’s the matter master  matter repeated the other choking violently ain’t you going to sail tonight  tonight said another voice in surprise why i thought we wasn’t going to sail till wen’sday  not trusting himself to reply so careful was he of the morals of his men the skipper went and leaned over the side and communed with the silent water in an incredibly short space of time five or six dusky figures pattered up on to the deck and a minute or two later the harsh clank of the windlass echoed far and wide  the captain took the wheel a fat and very sleepy seaman put up the sidelights and the little schooner detaching itself by the aid of boathooks and fenders from the neighbouring craft moved slowly down with the tide the men in response to the captain’s fervent orders climbed aloft and sail after sail was spread to the gentle breeze  hi you there cried the captain to one of the men who stood near him coiling up some loose line  sir said the man  where is the mate inquired the captain  man with red whiskers and pimply nose said the man interrogatively  that’s him to a hair answered the other  ain’t seen him since he took me on at eleven said the man how many new hands are there  i b’leeve we’re all fresh was the reply i don’t believe some of ’em have ever smelt salt water afore  the mate’s been at it again said the captain warmly that’s what he has he’s done it afore and got left behind them what can’t stand drink my man shouldn’t take it remember that  he said we wasn’t going to sail till wen’sday remarked the man who found the captain’s attitude rather trying  he’ll get sacked that’s what he’ll get said the captain warmly i shall report him as soon as i get ashore  the subject exhausted the seaman returned to his work and the captain continued steering in moody silence  slowly slowly darkness gave way to light the different portions of the craft instead of all being blurred into one took upon themselves shape and stood out wet and distinct in the cold grey of the breaking day but the lighter it became the harder the skipper stared and rubbed his eyes and looked from the deck to the flat marshy shore and from the shore back to the deck again  here come here he cried beckoning to one of the crew  yessir said the man advancing  there’s something in one of my eyes faltered the skipper i can’t see straight everything seems mixed up now speaking deliberate and without any hurry which side o’ the ship do you say the cook’s galley’s on  starboard said the man promptly eyeing him with astonishment  starboard repeated the other softly he says starboard and that’s what it seems to me my lad yesterday morning it was on the port side  the seaman received this astounding communication with calmness but as a slight concession to appearances said lor  and the watercask said the skipper what colour is it  green said the man  not white inquired the skipper leaning heavily upon the wheel  whitishgreen said the man who always believed in keeping in with his superior officers  the captain swore at him  by this time two or three of the crew who had overheard part of the conversation had collected aft and now stood in a small wondering knot before their strange captain  my lads said the latter moistening his dry lips with his tongue i name no names—i don’t know ’em yet—and i cast no suspicions but somebody has been painting up and altering this ’ere craft and twisting things about until a man ’ud hardly know her now what’s the little game  there was no answer and the captain who was seeing things clearer and clearer in the growing light got paler and paler  i must be going crazy he muttered is this the smiling jane or am i dreaming  it ain’t the smiling jane said one of the seamen leastways he added cautiously it wasn’t when i came aboard  not the smiling jane roared the skipper what is it then  why the mary ann chorused the astonished crew  my lads faltered the agonised captain after a long pause my lads— he stopped and swallowed something in his throat i’ve been and brought away the wrong ship he continued with an effort that’s what i’ve done i must have been bewitched  well who’s having the little game now inquired a voice  somebody else’ll be sacked as well as the mate said another  we must take her back said the captain raising his voice to drown these mutterings stand by there  the bewildered crew went to their posts the captain gave his orders in a voice which had never been so subdued and mellow since it broke at the age of fourteen and the mary ann took in sail and dropping her anchor waited patiently for the turning of the tide            · · · · · · ·     the church bells in wapping and rotherhithe were just striking     the hour of midday though they were heard by few above the     noisy din of workers on wharves and ships as a short stout     captain and a mate with red whiskers and a pimply nose stood     up in a waterman’s boat in the centre of the river and gazed at     each other in blank astonishment  she’s gone clean gone murmured the bewildered captain  clean as a whistle said the mate the new hands must ha’ run away with her  then the bereaved captain raised his voice and pronounced a pathetic and beautiful eulogy upon the departed vessel somewhat marred by an appendix in which he consigned the new hands their heirs and descendants to everlasting perdition  ahoy said the waterman who was getting tired of the business addressing a grimylooking seaman hanging meditatively over the side of a schooner where’s the mary ann  went away at halfpast one this morning was the reply  ’cos here’s the cap’n an’ the mate said the waterman indicating the forlorn couple with a bob of his head  my eyes said the man i s’pose the cook’s in charge then we was to have gone too but our old man hasn’t turned up  quickly the news spread amongst the craft in the tier and many and various were the suggestions shouted to the bewildered couple from the different decks at last just as the captain had ordered the waterman to return to the shore he was startled by a loud cry from the mate  look there he shouted  the captain looked fifty or sixty yards away a small shamefacedlooking schooner so it appeared to his excited imagination was slowly approaching them a minute later a shout went up from the other craft as she took in sail and bore slowly down upon them then a small boat put off to the buoy and the mary ann was slowly warped into the place she had left ten hours before  but while all this was going on she was boarded by her captain and mate they were met by captain bing supported by his mate who had hastily pushed off from the smiling jane to the assistance of his chief in the two leading features before mentioned he was not unlike the mate of the mary ann and much stress was laid upon this fact by the unfortunate bing in his explanation so much so in fact that both the mates got restless the skipper who was a plain man and given to calling a spade a spade using the word pimply with what seemed to them unnecessary iteration  it is possible that the interview might have lasted for hours had not bing suddenly changed his tactics and begun to throw out dark hints about standing a dinner ashore and settling it over a friendly glass the face of the mary ann’s captain began to clear and as bing proceeded from generalities to details a soft smile played over his expressive features it was reflected in the faces of the mates who by these means showed clearly that they understood the table was to be laid for four  at this happy turn of affairs bing himself smiled and a little while later a ship’s boat containing four boon companions put off from the mary ann and made for the shore of what afterwards ensued there is no distinct record beyond what may be gleaned from the fact that the quartette turned up at midnight arminarm and affectionately refused to be separated—even to enter the ship’s boat which was waiting for them the sailors were at first rather nonplussed but by dint of much coaxing and argument broke up the party and rowing them to their respective vessels put them carefully to bed     contraband of war     a small but strong lamp was burning in the fo’c’sle of the schooner greyhound by the light of which a middleaged seaman of sedate appearance sat crocheting an antimacassar two other men were snoring with deep content in their bunks while a small brighteyed boy sat up in his reading adventurous fiction  here comes old dan said the man with the antimacassar warningly as a pair of sea boots appeared at the top of the companionladder better not let him see you with that paper billee  the boy thrust it beneath his blankets and lying down closed his eyes as the newcomer stepped on to the floor  all asleep inquired the latter  the other man nodded and dan without any further parley crossed over to the sleepers and shook them roughly  eh wha’s matter inquired the sleepers plaintively  git up said dan impressively i want to speak to you something important  with sundry growls the men complied and thrusting their legs out of their bunks rolled on to the locker and sat crossly waiting for information  i want to do a pore chap a good turn said dan watching them narrowly out of his little black eyes an’ i want you to help me an’ the boy too it’s never too young to do good to your fellowcreatures billy  i know it ain’t said billy taking this as permission to join the group i helped a drunken man home once when i was only ten years old an’ when i was only—  the speaker stopped not because he had come to the end of his remarks but because one of the seamen had passed his arm around his neck and was choking him  go on said the man calmly i’ve got him spit it out dan and none of your sermonising  well it’s like this joe said the old man here’s a pore chap a young sojer from the depot here an’ he’s cut an’ run he’s been in hiding in a cottage up the road two days and he wants to git to london and git honest work and employment not shooting an’ stabbing an’ bayoneting—  stow it said joe impatiently  he daren’t go to the railway station and he dursen’t go outside in his uniform continued dan my ’art bled for the pore young feller an’ i’ve promised to give ’im a little trip to london with us the people he’s staying with won’t have him no longer they’ve only got one bed and directly he sees any sojers coming he goes an’ gits into it whether he’s got his boots on or not  have you told the skipper inquired joe sardonically  i won’t deceive you joe i ’ave not replied the old man he’ll have to stay down here of a daytime an’ only come on deck of a night when it’s our watch i told ’im what a lot of good’arted chaps you was and how—  how much is he going to give you inquired joe impatiently  it’s only fit and proper he should pay a little for the passage said dan  how much demanded joe banging the little triangular table with his fist and thereby causing the man with the antimacassar to drop a couple of stitches  twentyfive shillings said old dan reluctantly an’ i’ll spend the odd five shillings on you chaps when we git to limehouse  i don’t want your money said joe there’s a empty bunk he can have and mind you take all the responsibility—i won’t have nothing to do with it  thanks joe said the old man with a sigh of relief he’s a nice young chap you’re sure to take to him i’ll go and give him the tip to come aboard at once  he ran up on deck again and whistled softly and a figure which had been hiding behind a pile of empties came out and after looking cautiously around dropped noiselessly on to the schooner’s deck and followed its protector below  good evening mates said the linesman gazing curiously and anxiously round him as he deposited a bundle on the table and laid his swagger cane beside it  what’s your height inquired joe abruptly seven foot  no only six foot four said the new arrival modestly i’m not proud of it it’s much easier for a small man to slip off than a big one  it licks me said joe thoughtfully what they want ’em back for—i should think they’d be glad to git rid o’ such—he paused a moment while politeness struggled with feeling and added skunks  p’raps i’ve a reason for being a skunk p’raps i haven’t retorted private smith as his face fell  this’ll be your bunk interposed dan hastily put your things in there and when you are in yourself you’ll be as comfortable as a oyster in its shell  the visitor complied and first extracting from the bundle some tins of meat and a bottle of whiskey which he placed upon the table nervously requested the honour of the present company to supper with the exception of joe who churlishly climbed back into his bunk the men complied all agreeing that boys of billy’s age should be reared on strong teetotal principles  supper over private smith and his protectors retired to their couches where the former lay in much anxiety until two in the morning when they got under way  it’s all right my lad said dan after the watch had been set as he came and stood by the deserter’s bunk i ’ve saved you—i’ve saved you for twentyfive shillings  i wish it was more said private smith politely  the old man sighed—and waited  i’m quite cleaned out though continued the deserter except fi’pence ha’penny i shall have to risk going home in my uniform as it is  ah you’ll get there all right said dan cheerfully and when you get home no doubt you ’ve got friends and if it seems to you as you ’d like to give a little more to them as assisted you in the hour of need you won’t be ungrateful my lad i know you ain’t the sort  with these words old dan patting him affectionately retired and the soldier lay trying to sleep in his narrow quarters until he was aroused by a grip on his arm  if you want a mouthful of fresh air you ’d better come on deck now said the voice of joe it’s my watch you can get all the sleep you want in the daytime  glad to escape from such stuffy quarters private smith clambered out of his bunk and followed the other on deck it was a fine clear night and the schooner was going along under a light breeze the seaman took the wheel and turning to his companion abruptly inquired what he meant by deserting and worrying them with six foot four of underdone lobster  it’s all through my girl said private smith meekly first she jilted me and made me join the army now she’s chucked the other fellow and wrote to me to go back  an’ now i s’pose the other chap’ll take your place in the army said joe why a gal like that could fill a regiment if she liked pah they’ll nab you too in that uniform and you’ll get six months and have to finish your time as well  it’s more than likely said the soldier gloomily i’ve got to tramp to manchester in these clothes as far as i can see  what did you give old dan all your money for inquired joe  i was only thinking of getting away at first said smith and i had to take what was offered  well i’ll do what i can for you said the seaman if you’re in love you ain’t responsible for your actions i remember the first time i got the chuck i went into a publichouse bar and smashed all the glass and bottles i could get at i felt as though i must do something if you were only shorter i’d lend you some clothes  you’re a brick said the soldier gratefully  i haven’t got any money i could lend you either said joe i never do have any somehow but clothes you must have  he fell into deep thought and cocked his eye aloft as though contemplating a cuttingout expedition on the sails while the soldier sitting on the side of the ship waited hopefully for a miracle  you’d better get below again said joe presently  there seems to be somebody moving below and if the skipper sees you you’re done he’s a regular tartar and he’s got a brother what’s a sergeantmajor in the army he’d give you up d’rectly if he spotted you  i’m off said smith and with long catlike strides he disappeared swiftly below  for two days all went well and dan was beginning to congratulate himself upon his little venture when his peace of mind was rudely disturbed the crew were down below having their tea when billy who had been to the galley for hot water came down white and scared  look here he said nervously i’ve not had anything to do with this chap being aboard have i  what’s the matter inquired dan quickly  it’s all found out said billy  what cried the crew simultaneously  leastways it will be said the youth correcting himself you’d better chuck him overboard while you’ve got time i heard the cap’n tell the mate as he was coming down in the fo’c’sle tomorrow morning to look round he’s going to have it painted  this said dan in the midst of a painful pause this is what comes of helping a fellowcreature what’s to be done  tell the skipper the fo’c’sle don’t want painting suggested billy  the agonised old seaman carefully putting down his saucer of tea cuffed his head spitefully  it’s a smooth sea said he looking at the perturbed countenance of private smith ’an there’s a lot of shipping about if i was a deserter sooner than be caught i would slip overboard tonight with a lifebelt and take my chance  i wouldn’t said mr smith with much decision  you wouldn’t not if you was quite near another ship cooed dan  not if i was near fifty blooming ships all trying to see which could pick me up first replied mr smith with some heat  then we shall have to leave you to your fate said dan solemnly if a man’s unreasonable his best friends can do nothing for him  chuck all his clothes overboard anyway said billy  that’s a good idea o’ the boy’s you leave his ears alone said joe stopping the ready hand of the exasperated dan he’s got more sense than any of us can you think of anything else billy what shall we do then  the eyes of all were turned upon their youthful deliverer those of mr smith being painfully prominent it was a proud moment for billy and he sat silent for some time with a look of ineffable wisdom and thought upon his face at length he spoke  let somebody else have a turn he said generously  the voice of the antimacassar worker broke the silence  paint him all over with stripes of differentcoloured paint and let him pretend he’s mad and didn’t know how he got here he said with an uncontrollable ring of pride at the idea which was very coldly received private smith being noticeably hard on it  i know said billy shrilly clapping his hands i’ve got it i ’ve got it after he’s chucked his clothes overboard tonight let him go overboard too with a line  and tow him the rest o’ the way and chuck biscuits to him i suppose snarled dan  no said the youthful genius scornfully pretend he’s been upset from a boat and has been swimming about and we heard him cry out for help and rescued him  it’s about the best way out of it said joe after some deliberation it’s warm weather and you won’t take no harm mate do it in my watch and i’ll pull you out directly  wouldn’t it do if you just chucked a bucket of water over me and said you’d pulled me out suggested the victim the other thing seems a downright lie  no said billy authoritatively you’ve got to look halfdrowned and swallow a lot of water and your eyes be all bloodshot  everybody being eager for the adventure except private smith the arrangements were at once concluded and the approach of night impatiently awaited it was just before midnight when smith who had forgotten for the time his troubles in sleep was shaken into wakefulness  cold water sir said billy gleefully  in no mood for frivolity private smith rose and followed the youth on deck the air struck him as chill as he stood there but for all that it was with a sense of relief that he saw her majesty’s uniform go over the side and sink into the dark water  he don’t look much with his padding off does he said billy who had been eyeing him critically  you go below said dan sharply  garn said billy indignantly i want to see the fun as well as you do i thought of it  fun said the old man severely fun to see a feller creature suffering and perhaps drowned—  i don’t think i had better go said the victim it seems rather underhand  yes you will said joe wind this line round an’ round your arm and just swim about gently till i pull you in  sorely against his inclination private smith took hold of the line and hanging over the side of the schooner felt the temperature with his foot and slowly and tenderly with many little gasps committed his body to the deep joe paid out the line and waited letting out more line when the man in the water who was getting anxious started to come in hand over hand  that’ll do said dan at length  i think it will said joe and putting his hand to his mouth gave a mighty shout it was answered almost directly by startled roars from the cabin and the skipper and mate came rushing hastily upon deck to see the crew in their sleeping gear forming an excited group round joe and peering eagerly over the side  what’s the matter demanded the skipper  somebody in the water sir said joe relinquishing the wheel to one of the other seamen and hauling in the line i heard a cry from the water and threw a line and by gum i’ve hooked it  he hauled in lustily aided by the skipper until the long white body of private smith blanched with the cold came bumping against the schooner’s side  it’s a mermaid said the mate who was inclined to be superstitious as he peered doubtfully down at it let it go joe  haul it in boys said the skipper impatiently and two of the men clambered over the side and stooping down raised it from the water  in the midst of a puddle which he brought with him private smith was laid on the deck and waving his arms about fought wildly for his breath  fetch one of them empties said the skipper quickly as he pointed to some barrels ranged along the side  the men rolled one over and then aided the skipper in placing the long fair form of their visitor across it and to trundle it lustily up and down the deck his legs forming convenient handles for the energetic operators  he’s coming round said the mate checking them he’s speaking how do you feel my poor fellow  he put his ear down but the action was unnecessary private smith felt bad and in the plainest english he could think of at the moment said so distinctly  he’s swearing said the mate he ought to be ashamed of himself  yes said the skipper austerely and him so near death too how did you get in the water  went for a—swim panted smith surlily  swim echoed the skipper why we’re ten miles from land  his mind’s wandering pore feller interrupted joe hurriedly what boat did you fall out of matey  a rowboat said smith trying to roll out of reach of the skipper who was down on his knees flaying him alive with a rollertowel i had to undress in the water to keep afloat i’ve lost all my clothes  pore feller said dan  a gold watch and chain my purse and three of the nicest fellers that ever breathed continued smith who was now entering into the spirit of the thing  poor chaps said the skipper solemnly any of ’em leave any family  four said smith sadly  children queried the mate  families said smith  look here said the mate but the watchful joe interrupted him  his mind’s wandering said he hastily he can’t count pore chap we ’d better git him to bed  ah do said the skipper and assisted by his friends the rescued man was half led half carried below and put between the blankets where he lay luxuriously sipping a glass of brandy and water sent from the cabin  how’d i do it he inquired with a satisfied air  there was no need to tell all them lies about it said dan sharply instead of one little lie you told halfadozen i don’t want nothing more to do with you you start afresh now like a newborn babe  all right said smith shortly and being very much fatigued with his exertions and much refreshed by the brandy fell into a deep and peaceful sleep  the morning was well advanced when he awoke and the fo’c’sle empty except for the faithful joe who was standing by his side with a heap of clothing under his arm  try these on said he as smith stared at him half awake they’ll be better than nothing at any rate  the soldier leaped from his bunk and gratefully proceeded to dress himself joe eyeing him critically as the trousers climbed up his long legs and the sleeves of the jacket did their best to conceal his elbows  what do i look like he inquired anxiously as he finished  six foot an’ a half o’ misery piped the shrill voice of billy promptly as he thrust his head in at the fo’c’sle you can’t go to church in those clothes  well they’ll do for the ship but you can’t go ashore in ’em said joe as he edged towards the ladder and suddenly sprang up a step or two to let fly at the boy the old man wants to see you be careful what you say to him  with a very unsuccessful attempt to appear unconscious of the figure he cut smith went up on deck for the interview  we can’t do anything until we get to london said the skipper as he made copious notes of smith’s adventures as soon as we get there i’ll lend you the money to telegraph to your friends to tell ’em you’re safe and to send you some clothes and of course you’ll have free board and lodging till it comes and i’ll write out an account of it for the newspapers  you’re very good said smith blankly  and i don’t know what you are said the skipper interrogatively but you ought to go in for swimming as a profession—six hours’ swimming about like that is wonderful  you don’t know what you can do till you have to said smith modestly as he backed slowly away but i never want to see the water again as long as i live  the two remaining days of their passage passed all too quickly for the men who were casting about for some way out of the difficulty which they foresaw would arise when they reached london  if you’d only got decent clothes said joe as they passed gravesend you could go off and send a telegram and not come back but you couldn’t go five yards in them things without having a crowd after you  i shall have to be taken i s’pose said smith moodily  an’ poor old dan’ll get six months hard for helping you off said joe sympathetically as a bright idea occurred to him  rubbish said dan uneasily he can stick to his tale of being upset anyway the skipper saw him pulled out of the water he’s too honest a chap to get an old man into trouble for trying to help him  he must have a new rig out dan said joe softly you an’ me’ll go an’ buy ’em i’ll do the choosing and you’ll do the paying why it’ll be a reg’lar treat for you to lay out a little money dan we’ll have quite an evening’s shopping everything of the best  the infuriated dan gasped for breath and looked helplessly at the grinning crew  i’ll see him—overboard first he said furiously  please yourself said joe shortly if he’s caught you’ll get six months as it is you’ve got a chance of doing a nice kind little christian act becos o’ course that twentyfive bob you got out of him won’t anything like pay for his toggery  almost beside himself with indignation the old man moved off and said not another word until they were made fast to the wharf at limehouse he did not even break silence when joe taking him affectionately by the arm led him aft to the skipper  me an’ dan sir said joe very respectfully would like to go ashore for a little shopping dan has very kindly offered to lend that pore chap the money for some clothes and he wants me to go with him to help carry them  ay ay said the skipper with a benevolent smile at the aged philanthropist you’d better go at once afore the shops shut  we’ll run sir said joe and taking dan by the arm dragged him into the street at a trot  nearly a couple of hours passed before they returned and no child watched with greater eagerness the opening of a birthday present than smith watched the undoing of the numerous parcels with which they were laden  he’s a reg’lar fairy godmother ain’t he said joe as smith joyously dressed himself in a very presentable tweed suit serviceable boots and a bowler hat we had a dreadful job to get a suit big enough an’ the only one we could get was rather more money than we wanted to give wasn’t it dan  the fairy godmother strove manfully with his feelings  you’ll do now said joe i ain’t got much but what i have you’re welcome to he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some loose coin what have you got mates  with decent good will the other men turned out their pockets and adding to the store heartily pressed it upon the reluctant smith who after shaking hands gratefully followed joe on deck  you’ve got enough to pay your fare said the latter an’ i’ve told the skipper you are going ashore to send off telegrams if you send the money back to dan i’ll never forgive you  i won’t then said smith firmly but i’ll send theirs back to the other chaps goodbye  joe shook him by the hand again and bade him go while the coast was clear advice which smith hastened to follow though he turned and looked back to wave his hand to the crew who had come up on deck silently to see him off all but the philanthropist who was down below with a stump of leadpencil and a piece of paper doing sums     a black affair     i didn’t want to bring it said captain gubson regarding somewhat unfavourably a grey parrot whose cage was hanging against the mainmast but my old uncle was so set on it i had to he said a seavoyage would set its ’elth up  it seems to be all right at present said the mate who was tenderly sucking his forefinger best of spirits i should say  it’s playful assented the skipper the old man thinks a rare lot of it i think i shall have a little bit in that quarter so keep your eye on the beggar  scratch poll said the parrot giving its bill a preliminary strop on its perch scratch poor polly  it bent its head against the bars and waited patiently to play off what it had always regarded as the most consummate practical joke in existence the first doubt it had ever had about it occurred when the mate came forward and obligingly scratched it with the stem of his pipe it was a wholly unforeseen development and the parrot ruffling its feathers edged along its perch and brooded darkly at the other end of it  opinion before the mast was also against the new arrival the general view being that the wild jealousy which raged in the bosom of the ship’s cat would sooner or later lead to mischief  old satan don’t like it said the cook shaking his head the blessed bird hadn’t been aboard ten minutes before satan was prowling around the blooming image waited till he was about a foot off the cage and then he did the perlite and asked him whether he’d like a glass o’ beer i never see a cat so took aback in all my life never  there’ll be trouble between ’em said old sam who was the cat’s special protector mark my words  i’d put my money on the parrot said one of the men confidently it’s ’ad a crool bit out of the mate’s finger where ’ud the cat be agin that beak  well you’d lose your money said sam if you want to do the cat a kindness every time you see him near that cage cuff his ’ed  the crew being much attached to the cat which had been presented to them when a kitten by the mate’s wife acted upon the advice with so much zest that for the next two days the indignant animal was like to have been killed with kindness on the third day however the parrot’s cage being on the cabin table the cat stole furtively down and at the pressing request of the occupant itself scratched its head for it  the skipper was the first to discover the mischief and he came on deck and published the news in a voice which struck a chill to all hearts  where’s that black devil got to he yelled  anything wrong sir asked sam anxiously  come and look here said the skipper he led the way to the cabin where the mate and one of the crew were already standing shaking their heads over the parrot  what do you make of that demanded the skipper fiercely  too much dry food sir said sam after due deliberation  too much what bellowed the skipper  too much dry food repeated sam firmly a parrot—a grey parrot—wants plenty o’ sop if it don’t get it it moults  it’s had too much cat said the skipper fiercely and you know it and overboard it goes  i don’t believe it was the cat sir interposed the other man it’s too softhearted to do a thing like that  you can shut your jaw said the skipper reddening who asked you to come down here at all  nobody saw the cat do it urged the mate  the skipper said nothing but stooping down picked up a tail feather from the floor and laid it on the table he then went on deck followed by the others and began calling in seductive tones for the cat no reply forth coming from the sagacious animal which had gone into hiding he turned to sam and bade him call it  no sir i won’t ’ave no ’and in it said the old man putting aside my liking for the animal i’m not going to ’ave anything to do with the killing of a black cat  rubbish said the skipper  very good sir said sam shrugging his shoulders you know best o’ course you’re eddicated and i’m not an’ p’raps you can afford to make a laugh o’ such things i knew one man who killed a black cat an’ he went mad there’s something very pecooliar about that cat o’ ours  it knows more than we do said one of the crew shaking his head that time you—i mean we—ran the smack down that cat was expecting of it ’ours before it was like a wild thing  look at the weather we’ve ’ad—look at the trips we’ve made since he’s been aboard said the old man tell me it’s chance if you like but i know better  the skipper hesitated he was a superstitious man even for a sailor and his weakness was so well known that he had become a sympathetic receptacle for every ghost story which by reason of its crudeness or lack of corroboration had been rejected by other experts he was a perfect reference library for omens and his interpretations of dreams had gained for him a widespread reputation  that’s all nonsense he said pausing uneasily still i only want to be just there’s nothing vindictive about me and i’ll have no hand in it myself joe just tie a lump of coal to that cat and heave it overboard  not me said the cook following sam’s lead and working up a shudder not for fifty pun in gold i don’t want to be haunted  the parrot’s a little better now sir said one of the men taking advantage of his hesitation he’s opened one eye  well i only want to be just repeated the skipper i won’t do anything in a hurry but mark my words if the parrot dies that cat goes overboard  contrary to expectations the bird was still alive when london was reached though the cook who from his connection with the cabin had suddenly reached a position of unusual importance reported great loss of strength and irritability of temper it was still alive but failing fast on the day they were to put to sea again and the fo’c’sle in preparation for the worst stowed their pet away in the paintlocker and discussed the situation  their council was interrupted by the mysterious behaviour of the cook who having gone out to lay in a stock of bread suddenly broke in upon them more in the manner of a member of a secret society than a humble but useful unit of a ship’s company  where’s the cap’n he asked in a hoarse whisper as he took a seat on the locker with the sack of bread between his knees  in the cabin said sam regarding his antics with some disfavour what’s wrong cookie  what d’ yer think i’ve got in here asked the cook patting the bag  the obvious reply to this question was of course bread but as it was known that the cook had departed specially to buy some and that he could hardly ask a question involving such a simple answer nobody gave it  it come to me all of a sudden said the cook in a thrilling whisper i’d just bought the bread and left the shop when i see a big black cat the very image of ours sitting on a doorstep i just stooped down to stroke its ’ed when it come to me  they will sometimes said one of the seamen  i don’t mean that said the cook with the contempt of genius i mean the idea did ses i to myself ’you might be old satan’s brother by the look of you an’ if the cap’n wants to kill a cat let it be you’ i ses and with that before it could say jack robinson i picked it up by the scruff o’ the neck and shoved it in the bag  what all in along of our bread said the previous interrupter in a pained voice  some of yer are ’ard ter please said the cook deeply offended  don’t mind him cook said the admiring sam you’re a masterpiece that’s what you are  of course if any of you’ve got a better plan—said the cook generously  don’t talk rubbish cook said sam fetch the two cats out and put ’em together  don’t mix ’em said the cook warningly for you’ll never know which is which agin if you do  he cautiously opened the top of the sack and produced his captive and satan having been relieved from his prison the two animals were carefully compared  they’re as like as two lumps o’ coal said sam slowly lord what a joke on the old man i must tell the mate o’ this he’ll enjoy it  it’ll be all right if the parrot don’t die said the dainty pessimist still harping on his pet theme all that bread spoilt and two cats aboard  don’t mind what he ses said sam you’re a brick that’s what you are i’ll just make a few holes in the lid o’ the boy’s chest and pop old satan in you don’t mind do you billy  of course he don’t said the other men indignantly  matters being thus agreeably arranged sam got a gimlet and prepared the chest for the reception of its tenant who convinced that he was being put out of the way to make room for a rival made a frantic fight for freedom  now get something ’eavy and put on the top of it said sam having convinced himself that the lock was broken and billy put the noo cat in the paintlocker till we start it’s homesick  the boy obeyed and the understudy was kept in durance vile until they were off limehouse when he came on deck and nearly ended his career there and then by attempting to jump over the bulwark into the next garden for some time he paced the deck in a perturbed fashion and then leaping on the stern mewed plaintively as his native city receded farther and farther from his view  what’s the matter with old satan said the mate who had been let into the secret he seems to have something on his mind  he’ll have something round his neck presently said the skipper grimly  the prophecy was fulfilled some three hours later when he came up on deck ruefully regarding the remains of a bird whose vocabulary had once been the pride of its native town he threw it overboard without a word and then seizing the innocent cat who had followed him under the impression that it was about to lunch produced half a brick attached to a string and tied it round his neck the crew who were enjoying the joke immensely raised a howl of protest  the skylark’ll never have another like it sir said sam solemnly that cat was the luck of the ship  i don’t want any of your old woman’s yarns said the skipper brutally if you want the cat go and fetch it  he stepped aft as he spoke and sent the gentle stranger hurtling through the air there was a plomp as it reached the water a bubble or two came to the surface and all was over  that’s the last o’ that he said turning away  the old man shook his head you can’t kill a black cat for nothing said he mark my words  the skipper who was in a temper at the time thought little of them but they recurred to him vividly the next day the wind had freshened during the night and rain was falling heavily on deck the crew stood about in oilskins while below the boy in his new capacity of gaoler was ministering to the wants of an ungrateful prisoner when the cook happening to glance that way was horrified to see the animal emerge from the fo’c’sle it eluded easily the frantic clutch of the boy as he sprang up the ladder after it and walked leisurely along the deck in the direction of the cabin just as the crew had given it up for lost it encountered sam and the next moment despite its cries was caught up and huddled away beneath his stiff clammy oilskins at the noise the skipper who was talking to the mate turned as though he had been shot and gazed wildly round him  dick said he can you hear a cat  cat said the mate in accents of great astonishment  i thought i heard it said the puzzled skipper  fancy sir said dick firmly as a mewing appalling in its wrath came from beneath sam’s coat  did you hear it sam called the skipper as the old man was moving off  hear what sir inquired sam respectfully without turning round  nothing said the skipper collecting himself nothing all right  the old man hardly able to believe in his good fortune made his way forward and seizing a favourable opportunity handed his ungrateful burden back to the boy  fancy you heard a cat just now inquired the mate casually  well between you an’ me dick said the skipper in a mysterious voice i did and it wasn’t fancy neither i heard that cat as plain as if it was alive  well i’ve heard of such things said the other but i don’t believe ’em what a lark if the old cat comes back climbing up over the side out of the sea tonight with the brick hanging round its neck  the skipper stared at him for some time without speaking if that’s your idea of a lark he said at length in a voice which betrayed traces of some emotion it ain’t mine  well if you hear it again said the mate cordially you might let me know i’m rather interested in such things  the skipper hearing no more of it that day tried hard to persuade himself that he was the victim of imagination but in spite of this he was pleased at night as he stood at the wheel to reflect on the sense of companionship afforded by the lookout in the bows on his part the lookout was quite charmed with the unwonted affability of the skipper as he yelled out to him two or three times on matters only faintly connected with the progress of the schooner  the night which had been dirty cleared somewhat and the bright crescent of the moon appeared above a heavy bank of clouds as the cat which had by dint of using its back as a lever at length got free from that cursed chest licked its shapely limbs and came up on deck after its stifling prison the air was simply delicious  bob yelled the skipper suddenly  ay ay sir said the lookout in a startled voice  did you mew inquired the skipper  did i wot sir cried the astonished bob  mew said the skipper sharply like a cat  no sir said the offended seaman what ’ud i want to do that for  i don’t know what you want to for said the skipper looking round him uneasily there’s some more rain coming bob  ay ay sir said bob  lot o’ rain we’ve had this summer said the skipper in a meditative bawl  ay ay sir said bob sailingship on the port bow sir  the conversation dropped the skipper anxious to divert his thoughts watching the dark mass of sail as it came plunging out of the darkness into the moonlight until it was abreast of his own craft his eyes followed it as it passed his quarter so that he saw not the stealthy approach of the cat which came from behind the companion and sat down close by him for over thirty hours the animal had been subjected to the grossest indignities at the hands of every man on board the ship except one that one was the skipper and there is no doubt but that its subsequent behaviour was a direct recognition of that fact it rose to its feet and crossing over to the unconscious skipper rubbed its head affectionately and vigorously against his leg  from simple causes great events do spring the skipper sprang four yards and let off a screech which was the subject of much comment on the barque which had just passed when bob who came shuffling up at the double reached him he was leaning against the side incapable of speech and shaking all over  anything wrong sir inquired the seaman anxiously as he ran to the wheel  the skipper pulled himself together a bit and got closer to his companion  believe me or not bob he said at length in trembling accents just as you please but the ghost of that—cat i mean the ghost of that poor affectionate animal which i drowned and which i wish i hadn’t came and rubbed itself up against my leg  which leg inquired bob who was ever careful about details  what the blazes does it matter which leg demanded the skipper whose nerves were in a terrible state ah look—look there  the seaman followed his outstretched finger and his heart failed him as he saw the cat with its back arched gingerly picking its way along the side of the vessel  i can’t see nothing he said doggedly  i don’t suppose you can bob said the skipper in a melancholy voice as the cat vanished in the bows it’s evidently only meant for me to see what it means i don’t know i’m going down to turn in i ain’t fit for duty you don’t mind being left alone till the mate comes up do you  i ain’t afraid said bob  his superior officer disappeared below and shaking the sleepy mate who protested strongly against the proceedings narrated in trembling tones his horrible experiences  if i were you —said the mate  yes said the skipper waiting a bit then he shook him again roughly  what were you going to say he inquired  say said the mate rubbing his eyes nothing  about the cat suggested the skipper  cat said the mate nestling lovingly down in the blankets again wha’ ca’—goo’ ni’—  then the skipper drew the blankets from the mate’s sleepy clutches and rolling him backwards and forwards in the bunk patiently explained to him that he was very unwell that he was going to have a drop of whiskey neat and turn in and that he the mate was to take the watch from this moment the joke lost much of its savour for the mate  you can have a nip too dick said the skipper proffering him the whiskey as the other sullenly dressed himself  it’s all rot said the mate tossing the spirits down his throat and it’s no use either you can’t run away from a ghost it’s just as likely to be in your bed as anywhere else goodnight  he left the skipper pondering over his last words and dubiously eyeing the piece of furniture in question nor did he retire until he had subjected it to an analysis of the most searching description and then leaving the lamp burning he sprang hastily in and forgot his troubles in sleep  it was day when he awoke and went on deck to find a heavy sea running and just sufficient sail set to keep the schooner’s head before the wind as she bobbed about on the waters an exclamation from the skipper as a wave broke against the side and flung a cloud of spray over him brought the mate’s head round  why you ain’t going to get up he said in tones of insincere surprise  why not inquired the other gruffly  you go and lay down agin said the mate and have a cup o’ nice hot tea an’ some toast  clear out said the skipper making a dash for the wheel and reaching it as the wet deck suddenly changed its angle i know you didn’t like being woke up dick but i got the horrors last night go below and turn in  all right said the mollified mate  you didn’t see anything inquired the skipper as he took the wheel from him  nothing at all said the other  the skipper shook his head thoughtfully then shook it again vigorously as another showerbath put its head over the side and saluted him  i wish i hadn’t drowned that cat dick he said  you won’t see it again said dick with the confidence of a man who had taken every possible precaution to render the prophecy a safe one  he went below leaving the skipper at the wheel idly watching the cook as he performed marvellous feats of jugglery between the galley and the fo’c’sle with the men’s breakfast  a little while later leaving the wheel to sam he went below himself and had his own talking freely to the discomfort of the consciousstricken cook about his weird experiences of the night before  you won’t see it no more sir i don’t expect he said faintly i b’leeve it come and rubbed itself up agin your leg to show it forgave you  well i hope it knows it’s understood said the other i don’t want it to take any more trouble  he finished the breakfast in silence and then went on deck again it was still blowing hard and he went over to superintend the men who were attempting to lash together some empties which were rolling about in all directions amidships a violent roll set them free again and at the same time separated two chests in the fo’c’sle which were standing one on top of the other this enabled satan who was crouching in the lower one half crazed with terror to come flying madly up on deck and give his feelings full vent three times in full view of the horrified skipper he circled the deck at racing speed and had just started on the fourth when a heavy packingcase which had been temporarily set on end and abandoned by the men at his sudden appearance fell over and caught him by the tail sam rushed to the rescue  stop yelled the skipper  won’t i put it up sir inquired sam  do you see what’s beneath it said the skipper in a husky voice  beneath it sir said sam whose ideas were in a whirl  the cat can’t you see the cat said the skipper whose eyes had been riveted on the animal since its first appearance on deck  sam hesitated a moment and then shook his head  the case has fallen on the cat said the skipper i can see it distinctly  he might have said heard it too for satan was making frenzied appeals to his sympathetic friends for assistance  let me put the case back sir said one of the men then p’raps the vision ’ll disappear  no stop where you are said the skipper i can stand it better by daylight it’s the most wonderful and extraordinary thing i’ve ever seen do you mean to say you can’t see anything sam  i can see a case sir said sam speaking slowly and carefully with a bit of rusty iron band sticking out from it that’s what you’re mistaking for the cat p’raps sir  can’t you see anything cook demanded the skipper  it may be fancy sir faltered the cook lowering his eyes but it does seem to me as though i can see a little misty sort o’ thing there ah now it’s gone  no it ain’t said the skipper the ghost of satan’s sitting there the case seems to have fallen on its tail it appears to be howling something dreadful  the men made a desperate effort to display the astonishment suitable to such a marvel whilst satan who was trying all he knew to get his tail out cursed freely how long the superstitious captain of the skylark would have let him remain there will never be known for just then the mate came on deck and caught sight of it before he was quite aware of the part he was expected to play  why the devil don’t you lift the thing off the poor brute he yelled hurrying up towards the case  what can you see it dick said the skipper impressively laying his hand on his arm  see it retorted the mate d’ye think i’m blind listen to the poor brute i should—oh  he became conscious of the concentrated significant gaze of the crew five pairs of eyes speaking as one all saying idiot plainly the boy’s eyes conveying an expression too great to be translated  turning the skipper saw the byeplay and a light slowly dawned upon him but he wanted more and he wheeled suddenly to the cook for the required illumination  the cook said it was a lark then he corrected himself and said it wasn’t a lark then he corrected himself again and became incoherent meantime the skipper eyed him stonily while the mate released the cat and goodnaturedly helped to straighten its tail  it took fully five minutes of unwilling explanation before the skipper could grasp the situation he did not appear to fairly understand it until he was shown the chest with the ventilated lid then his countenance cleared and taking the unhappy billy by the collar he called sternly for a piece of rope  by this statesmanlike handling of the subject a question of much delicacy and difficulty was solved discipline was preserved and a practical illustration of the perils of deceit afforded to a youngster who was at an age best suited to receive such impressions that he should exhaust the resources of a youthful but powerful vocabulary upon the crew in general and sam in particular was only to be expected they bore him no malice for it but when he showed signs of going beyond his years held a hasty consultation and then stopped his mouth with sixpencehalfpenny and a broken jackknife  the skipper of the osprey      it was a quarter to six in the morning as the mate of the     sailingbarge osprey came on deck and looked round for the     master who had been sleeping ashore and was somewhat overdue     ten minutes passed before he appeared on the wharf and the mate     saw with surprise that he was leaning on the arm of a pretty     girl of twenty as he hobbled painfully down to the barge  here you are then said the mate his face clearing i began to think you weren’t coming  i’m not said the skipper i’ve got the gout crool bad my darter here’s going to take my place an’ i’m going to take it easy in bed for a bit  i’ll go an’ make it for you said the mate  i mean my bed at home said the skipper sharply i want good nursing an’ attention  the mate looked puzzled  but you don’t really mean to say this young lady is coming aboard instead of you he said  that’s just what i do mean said the skipper she knows as much about it as i do she lived aboard with me until she was quite a big girl you’ll take your orders from her what are you whistling about can’t i do as i like about my own ship  o’ course you can said the mate drily an’ i s’pose i can whistle if i like—i never heard no orders against it  gimme a kiss meg an’ git aboard said the skipper leaning on his stick and turning his cheek to his daughter who obediently gave him a perfunctory kiss on the left eyebrow and sprang lightly aboard the barge  cast off said she in a businesslike manner as she seized a boathook and pushed off from the jetty ta ta dad and go straight home mind the cab’s waiting  ay ay my dear said the proud father his eye moistening with paternal pride as his daughter throwing off her jacket ran and assisted the mate with the sail lord what a fine boy she would have made  he watched the barge until she was well under way and then waving his hand to his daughter crawled slowly back to the cab and being to a certain extent a believer in homeopathy treated his complaint with a glass of rum  i’m sorry your father’s so bad miss said the mate who was still somewhat dazed by the recent proceedings as the girl came up and took the wheel from him he was complaining a goodish bit all the way up  a wilful man must have his way said miss cringle with a shake of her head it’s no good me saying anything because directly my back’s turned he has his own way again  the mate shook his head despondently  you’d better get your bedding up and make your arrangements forward said the new skipper presently there was a look of indulgent admiration in the mate’s eye and she thought it necessary to check it  all right said the other plenty of time for that the river’s a little bit thick just now  what do you mean inquired the girl hastily  some o’ these things are not so careful as they might be said the mate noting the ominous sparkle of her eye an’ they might scrape the paint off  look here my lad said the new skipper grimly if you think you can steer better than me you’d better keep it to yourself that’s all now suppose you see about your bedding as i said  the mate went albeit he was rather surprised at himself for doing so and hid his annoyance and confusion beneath the mattress which he brought up on his head his job completed he came aft again and sitting on the hatches lit his pipe  this is just the weather for a pleasant cruise he said amiably after a few whiffs you’ve chose a nice time for it  i don’t mind the weather said the girl who fancied that there was a little latent sarcasm somewhere i think you’d better wash the decks now  washed ’em last night said the mate without moving  ah after dark perhaps said the girl well i think i’ll have them done again  the mate sat pondering rebelliously for a few minutes then he removed his jacket put on in honour of the new skipper and fetching the bucket and mop silently obeyed orders  you seem to be very fond of sitting down remarked the girl after he had finished can’t you find something else to do  i don’t know replied the mate slowly i thought you were looking after that  the girl bit her lip and was looking carefully round her when they were both disturbed by the unseemly behaviour of the master of a passing craft  jack he yelled in a tone of strong amazement jack  halloa cried the mate  why didn’t you tell us yelled the other reproachfully  tell you what roared the mystified mate  the master of the other craft holding on to the stays with one hand jerked his thumb expressively towards miss cringle and waited  when was it he screamed anxiously as he realised that his craft was rapidly carrying him out of earshot  the mate smiled feebly and glanced uneasily at the girl who with a fine colour and an air of vast unconcern was looking straight in front of her and it was a relief to both of them when they found themselves hesitating and dodging in front of a schooner which was coming up  do you want all the river demanded the exasperated master of the latter vessel running to the side as they passed why don’t you drop anchor if you want to spoon  perhaps you ’d better let me take the wheel a bit said the mate not without a little malice in his voice  no you can go an’ keep a lookout in the bows said the girl serenely it’ll prevent misunderstandings too better take the potatoes with you and peel them for dinner  the mate complied and the voyage proceeded in silence the steering being rendered a little nicer than usual by various nautical sparks bringing their boats a bit closer than was necessary in order to obtain a good view of the fair steersman  after dinner the tide having turned and a stiff headwind blowing they brought up off sheppey it began to rain hard and the crew of the osprey having made all snug above retired to the cabin to resume their quarrel  don’t mind me said miss cringle scathingly as the mate lit his pipe  well i didn’t think you minded replied the mate the old man—  who interrupted miss cringle in a tone of polite inquiry  captain cringle said the mate correcting himself smokes a great deal and i’ve heard him say that you liked the smell of it  there’s pipes and pipes said miss cringle oracularly  the mate flung his on the floor and crunched it beneath his heel then he thrust his hands in his pockets and leaning back scowled darkly up at the rain as it crackled on the skylight  if you are going to show off your nasty temper said the girl severely you’d better go forward it’s not quite the thing after all for you to be down here—not that i study appearances much  i shouldn’t think you did retorted the mate whose temper was rapidly getting the better of him i can’t think what your father was thinking of to let a pret—to let a girl like you come away like this  if you were going to say pretty girl said miss cringle with calm selfabnegation don’t mind me say it the captain knows what he’s about he told me you were a milksop he said you were a good young man and a teetotaller  the mate allowing the truth of the captain’s statement as to his abstinence hotly denied the charge of goodness i can understand your father’s hurry to get rid of you for a spell he concluded being goaded beyond all consideration of politeness his gout ’ud never get well while you were with him more than that i shouldn’t wonder if you were the cause of it  with this parting shot he departed before the girl could think of a suitable reply and went and sulked in the dingy little fo’c’sle  in the evening the weather having moderated somewhat and the tide being on the ebb they got under way again the girl coming on deck fully attired in an oilskin coat and sou’wester to resume the command the rain fell steadily as they ploughed along their way guided by the bright eye of the mouse as it shone across the darkening waters the mate soaked to the skin was at the wheel  why don’t you go below and put your oilskins on inquired the girl when this fact dawned upon her  don’t want ’em said the mate  i suppose you know best said the girl and said no more until nine o’clock when she paused at the companion to give her last orders for the night  i’m going to turn in said she call me at two o’clock goodnight  goodnight said the other and the girl vanished  left to himself the mate who began to feel chilly felt in his pockets for a pipe and was in all the stress of getting a light when he heard a thin almost mild voice behind him and looking round saw the face of the girl at the companion  i say are these your oilskins i’ve been wearing she demanded awkwardly  you’re quite welcome said the mate  why didn’t you tell me said the girl indignantly i wouldn’t have worn them for anything if i had known it  well they won’t poison you said the mate resentfully your father left his at ipswich to have ’em cobbled up a bit  the girl passed them up on the deck and closing the companion with a bang disappeared it is possible that the fatigues of the day had been too much for her for when she awoke and consulted the little silver watch that hung by her bunk it was past five o’clock and the red glow of the sun was flooding the cabin as she arose and hastily dressed  the deck was drying in white patches as she went above and the mate was sitting yawning at the wheel his eyelids red for want of sleep  didn’t i tell you to call me at two o’clock she demanded confronting him  it’s all right said the mate i thought when you woke would be soon enough you looked tired  i think you’d better go when we get to ipswich said the girl tightening her lips i’ll ship somebody who’ll obey orders  i’ll go when we get back to london said the mate i’ll hand this barge over to the cap’n and nobody else  well we’ll see said the girl as she took the wheel i think you’ll go at ipswich  for the remainder of the voyage the subject was not alluded to the mate in a spirit of sulky pride kept to the fore part of the boat except when he was steering and as far as practicable the girl ignored his presence in this spirit of mutual forbearance they entered the orwell and ran swiftly up to ipswich  it was late in the afternoon when they arrived there and the new skipper waiting only until they were made fast went ashore leaving the mate in charge she had been gone about an hour when a small telegraph boy appeared and after boarding the barge in the unsafest manner possible handed him a telegram the mate read it and his face flushed with even more than the curtness customary in language at a halfpenny a word it contained his dismissal  i’ve had a telegram from your father sacking me he said to the girl as she returned soon after laden with small parcels  yes i wired him to she replied calmly i suppose you’ll go now  i’d rather go back to london with you he said slowly  i daresay said the girl as a matter of fact i wasn’t really meaning for you to go but when you said you wouldn’t i thought we’d see who was master i’ve shipped another mate so you see i haven’t lost much time  who is he inquired the mate  man named charlie lee replied the girl the foreman here told me of him  he’d no business too said the mate frowning he’s a loose fish take my advice now and ship somebody else he’s not at all the sort of chap i’d choose for you to sail with  you’d choose said the girl scornfully dear me what a pity you didn’t tell me before  he’s a publichouse loafer said the mate meeting her eye angrily and about as bad as they make ’em but i s’pose you’ll have your own way  he won’t frighten me said the girl i’m quite capable of taking care of myself thank you good evening  the mate stepped ashore with a small bundle leaving the remainder of his possessions to go back to london with the barge the girl watched his wellknit figure as it strode up the quay until it was out of sight and then inwardly piqued because he had not turned round for a parting glance gave a little sigh and went below to tea  the docile and respectful behaviour of the newcomer was a pleasant change to the autocrat of the osprey and cargoes were worked out and in without an unpleasant word they laid at the quay for two days the new mate whose home was at ipswich sleeping ashore and on the morning of the third he turned up punctually at six o’clock and they started on their return voyage  well you do know how to handle a craft said lee admiringly as they passed down the river the old boat seems to know it’s got a pretty young lady in charge  don’t talk rubbish said the girl austerely  the new mate carefully adjusted his red necktie and smiled indulgently  well you’re the prettiest cap’n i’ve ever sailed under he said what do they call that red cap you’ve got on tamo’shanter is it  i don’t know said the girl shortly  you mean you won’t tell me said the other with a look of anger in his soft dark eyes  just as you like said she and lee whistling softly turned on his heel and began to busy himself with some small matter forward  the rest of the day passed quietly though there was a freedom in the new mate’s manner which made the redoubtable skipper of the osprey regret her change of crew and to treat him with more civility than her proud spirit quite approved of there was but little wind and the barge merely crawled along as the captain and mate with surreptitious glances took each other’s measure  this is the nicest trip i’ve ever had said lee as he came up from an unduly prolonged tea with a strongsmelling cigar in his mouth i’ve brought your jacket up  i don’t want it thank you said the girl  better have it said lee holding it up for her  when i want my jacket i’ll put it on myself said the girl  all right no offence said the other airily what an obstinate little devil you are  have you got any drink down there inquired the girl eyeing him sternly  just a little drop o’ whiskey my dear for the spasms said lee facetiously will you have a drop  i won’t have any drinking here said she sharply if you want to drink wait till you get ashore  you won’t have any drinking said the other opening his eyes and with a quiet chuckle he dived below and brought up a bottle and a glass here’s wishing a better temper to you my dear he said amiably as he tossed off a glass come you’d better have a drop it’ll put a little colour in your cheeks  put it away now there’s a good fellow said the captain timidly as she looked anxiously at the nearest sail some two miles distant  it’s the only friend i’ve got said lee sprawling gracefully on the hatches and replenishing his glass look here are you on for a bargain  what do you mean inquired the girl  give me a kiss little spitfire and i won’t take another drop tonight said the new mate tenderly come i won’t tell  you may drink yourself to death before i’ll do that said the girl striving to speak calmly don’t talk that nonsense to me again  she stooped over as she spoke and made a sudden grab at the bottle but the new mate was too quick for her and snatching it up jeeringly dared her to come for it  come on come and fight for it said he hit me if you like i don’t mind your little fist won’t hurt  no answer being vouchsafed to this invitation he applied himself to his only friend again while the girl now thoroughly frightened steered in silence  better get the sidelights out said she at length  plenty o’ time said lee  take the helm then while i do it said the girl biting her lips  the fellow rose and came towards her and as she made way for him threw his arm round her waist and tried to detain her her heart beating quickly she walked forward and not without a hesitating glance at the drunken figure at the wheel descended into the fo’c’sle for the lamps  the next moment with a gasping little cry she sank down on a locker as the dark figure of a man rose and stood by her  don’t be frightened it said quietly  jack said the girl  that’s me said the figure you didn’t expect to see me did you i thought perhaps you didn’t know what was good for you so i stowed myself away last night and here i am  have you heard what that fellow has been saying to me demanded miss cringle with a spice of the old temper leavening her voice once more  every word said the mate cheerfully  why didn’t you come up and stand by me inquired the girl hotly  the mate hung his head  oh said the girl and her tones were those of acute disappointment you’re afraid  i’m not said the mate scornfully  why didn’t you come up then instead of skulking down here inquired the girl  the mate scratched the back of his neck and smiled but weakly well i—i thought—he began and stopped  you thought—prompted miss cringle coldly  i thought a little fright would do you good said the mate speaking quickly and that it would make you appreciate me a little more when i did come  ahoy maggie maggie came the voice of the graceless varlet who was steering  i’ll maggie him said the mate grinding his teeth why what the—why you ’re crying  i’m not sobbed miss cringle scornfully i’m in a temper that’s all  i’ll knock his head off said the mate you stay down here  maggie came the voice again mag—hullo  were you calling me my lad said the mate with dangerous politeness as he stepped aft ain’t you afraid of straining that sweet voice o’ yours leave go o’ that tiller  the other let go and the mate’s fist took him heavily in the face and sent him sprawling on the deck he rose with a scream of rage and rushed at his opponent but the mate’s temper which had suffered badly through his treatment of the last few days was up and he sent him heavily down again  there’s a little dark dingy hole forward said the mate after waiting some time for him to rise again just the place for you to go and think over your sins in if i see you come out of it until we get to london i’ll hurt you now clear  the other cleared and carefully avoiding the girl who was standing close by disappeared below  you’ve hurt him said the girl coming up to the mate and laying her hand on his arm what a horrid temper you’ve got  it was him asking you to kiss him that upset me said the mate apologetically  he put his arm round my waist said miss cringle blushing  what said the mate stuttering put his—put his arm—round—your waist—like—  his courage suddenly forsook him  like what inquired the girl with superb innocence  like that said the mate manfully  that’ll do said miss cringle softly that’ll do you’re as bad as he is only the worst of it is there is nobody here to prevent you     in borrowed plumes     the master of the sarah jane had been missing for two days and all on board with the exception of the boy whom nobody troubled about were full of joy at the circumstance twice before had the skipper whose habits might perhaps be best described as irregular missed his ship and word had gone forth that the third time would be the last his berth was a good one and the mate wanted it in place of his own which was wanted by ted jones a b  two hours more said the mate anxiously to the men as they stood leaning against the side and i take the ship out  under two hours’ll do it said ted peering over the side and watching the water as it slowly rose over the mud what’s got the old man i wonder  i don’t know and i don’t care said the mate you chaps stand by me and it’ll be good for all of us mr pearson said distinct the last time that if the skipper ever missed his ship again it would be his last trip in her and he told me afore the old man that i wasn’t to wait two minutes at any time but to bring her out right away  he’s an old fool said bill loch the other hand and nobody’ll miss him but the boy and he’s been looking reg’lar worried all the morning he looked so worried at dinner time that i give ’im a kick to cheer him up a bit look at him now  the mate gave a supercilious glance in the direction of the boy and then turned away the boy who had no idea of courting observation stowed himself away behind the windlass and taking a letter from his pocket perused it for the fourth time  dear tommy it began i take my pen in and to inform you that i’m stayin here and cant get away for the reason that i lorst my cloes at cribage larst night also my money and everything beside don’t speek to a living sole about it as the mate wants my birth but pack up sum cloes and bring them to me without saying nuthing to noboddy the mates cloths will do becos i havent got enny other soot dont tell ’im you needen’t trouble about soks as i’ve got them left my bed is so bad i must now conclude your affecshunate uncle and captin joe bross ps dont let the mate see you come or else he wont let you go  two hours more sighed tommy as he put the letter back in his pocket how can i get any clothes when they’re all locked up and aunt said i was to look after ’im and see he didn’t get into no mischief  he sat thinking deeply and then as the crew of the sarah jane stepped ashore to take advantage of a glass offered by the mate he crept down to the cabin again for another desperate look round the only articles of clothing visible belonged to mrs bross who up to this trip had been sailing in the schooner to look after its master at these he gazed hard  i’ll take ’em and try an’ swop ’em for some men’s clothes said he suddenly snatching the garments from the pegs she wouldn’t mind and hastily rolling them into a parcel together with a pair of carpet slippers of the captain’s he thrust the lot into an old biscuit bag then he shouldered his burden and going cautiously on deck gained the shore and set off at a trot to the address furnished in the letter  it was a long way and the bag was heavy his first attempt at barter was alarming for the pawnbroker who had just been cautioned by the police was in such a severe and uncomfortable state of morals that the boy quickly snatched up his bundle again and left sorely troubled he walked hastily along until in a small bye street his glance fell upon a baker of mild and benevolent aspect standing behind the counter of his shop  if you please sir said tommy entering and depositing his bag on the counter have you got any castoff clothes you don’t want  the baker turned to a shelf and selecting a stale loaf cut it in halves one of which he placed before the boy  i don’t want bread said tommy desperately but mother has just died and father wants mourning for the funeral he’s only got a new suit with him and if he can change these things of mother’s for an old suit he’d sell his best ones to bury her with  he shook the articles out on the counter and the baker’s wife who had just come into the shop inspected them rather favourably  poor boy so you’ve lost your mother she said turning the clothes over it’s a good skirt bill  yes ma’am said tommy dolefully  what did she die of inquired the baker  scarlet fever said tommy tearfully mentioning the only disease he knew  scar—take them things away yelled the baker pushing the clothes on to the floor and following his wife to the other end of the shop take ’em away directly you young villain  his voice was so loud his manner so imperative that the startled boy without stopping to argue stuffed the clothes pellmell into the bag again and departed a farewell glance at the clock made him look almost as horrified as the baker  there’s no time to be lost he muttered as he began to run either the old man’ll have to come in these or else stay where he is  he reached the house breathless and paused before an unshaven man in timeworn greasy clothes who was smoking a short clay pipe with much enjoyment in front of the door  is cap’n bross here he panted  he’s upstairs said the man with a leer sitting in sackcloth and ashes more ashes than sackcloth have you got some clothes for him  look here said tommy he was down on his knees with the mouth of the bag open again quite in the style of the practised hawker give me an old suit of clothes for them hurry up there’s a lovely frock  blimey said the man staring i’ve only got these clothes wot d’yer take me for a dook  well get me some somewhere said tommy if you don’t the cap’n ’ll have to come in these and i’m sure he won’t like it  i wonder what he’d look like said the man with a grin damme if i don’t come up and see  get me some clothes pleaded tommy  i wouldn’t get you clothes no not for fifty pun said the man severely wot d’yer mean wanting to spoil people’s pleasure in that way come on come and tell the cap’n what you’ve got for ’im i want to ’ear what he ses he’s been swearing ’ard since ten o’clock this morning but he ought to say something special over this  he led the way up the bare wooden stairs followed by the harassed boy and entered a small dirty room at the top in the centre of which the master of the sarah jane sat to deny visitors in a pair of socks and last week’s paper  here’s a young gent come to bring you some clothes cap’n said the man taking the sack from the boy  why didn’t you come before growled the captain who was reading the advertisements  the man put his hand in the sack and pulled out the clothes what do you think of ’em he asked expectantly  the captain strove vainly to tell him but his tongue mercifully forsook its office and dried between his lips his brain rang with sentences of scorching iniquity but they got no further  well say thank you if you can’t say nothing else suggested his tormentor hopefully  i couldn’t bring nothing else said tommy hurriedly all the things was locked up i tried to swop ’em and nearly got locked up for it put these on and hurry up  the captain moistened his lips with his tongue  the mate’ll get off directly she floats continued tommy put these on and spoil his little game it’s raining a little now nobody’ll see you and as soon as you git aboard you can borrow some of the men’s clothes  that’s the ticket cap’n said the man lord lumme you’ll ’ave everybody falling in love with you  hurry up said tommy dancing with impatience hurry up  the skipper dazed and wildeyed stood still while his two assistants hastily dressed him bickering somewhat about details as they did so  he ought to be tightlaced i tell you said the man  he can’t be tightlaced without stays said tommy scornfully you ought to know that  ho can’t he said the other discomfited you know too much for a youngun well put a bit o’ line round ’im then  we can’t wait for a line said tommy who was standing on tiptoe to tie the skipper’s bonnet on now tie the scarf over his chin to hide his beard and put this veil on it’s a good job he ain’t got a moustache  the other complied and then fell back a pace or two to gaze at his handiwork strewth though i sees it as shouldn’t you look a treat he remarked complacently now youngun take ’old of his arm go up the back streets and if you see anybody looking at you call ’im mar  the two set off after the man who was a born realist had tried to snatch a kiss from the skipper on the threshold fortunately for the success of the venture it was pelting with rain and though a few people gazed curiously at the couple as they went hastily along they were unmolested and gained the wharf in safety arriving just in time to see the schooner shoving off from the side  at the sight the skipper held up his skirts and ran ahoy he shouted wait a minute  the mate gave one look of blank astonishment at the extraordinary figure and then turned away but at that moment the stern came within jumping distance of the wharf and uncle and nephew moved with one impulse leaped for it and gained the deck in safety  why didn’t you wait when i hailed you demanded the skipper fiercely  how was i to know it was you inquired the mate surlily as he realised his defeat i thought it was the empress of rooshia  the skipper stared at him dumbly  an’ if you take my advice said the mate with a sneer you’ll keep them things on i never see you look so well in anything afore  i want to borrow some o’ your clothes bob said the skipper eyeing him steadily  where’s your own asked the other  i don’t know said the skipper i was took with a fit last night bob and when i woke up this morning they were gone somebody must have took advantage of my helpless state and taken ’em  very likely said the mate turning away to shout an order to the crew who were busy setting sail  where are they old man inquired the skipper  how should i know asked the other becoming interested in the men again  i mean your clothes said the skipper who was fast losing his temper  oh mine said the mate well as a matter o’ fact i don’t like lending my clothes i’m rather pertickler you might have a fit in them  you won’t lend ’em to me asked the skipper  i won’t said the mate speaking loudly and frowning significantly at the crew who were listening  very good said the skipper ted come here where’s your other clothes  i’m very sorry sir said ted shifting uneasily from one leg to the other and glancing at the mate for support but they ain’t fit for the likes of you to wear sir i’m the best judge of that said the skipper sharply fetch ’em up  well to tell the truth sir said ted i’m like the mate i’m only a poor sailorman but i wouldn’t lend my clothes to the queen of england  you fetch up them clothes roared the skipper snatching off his bonnet and flinging it on the deck fetch ’em up at once d’ye think i’m going about in these petticuts  they’re my clothes muttered ted doggedly  very well then i’ll have bill’s said the skipper but mind you my lad i’ll make you pay for this afore i’ve done with you bill’s the only honest man aboard this ship gimme your hand bill old man  i’m with them two said bill gruffly as he turned away  the skipper biting his lips with fury turned from one to the other and then with a big oath walked forward before he could reach the fo’c’sle bill and ted dived down before him and by the time he had descended sat on their chests side by side confronting him to threats and appeals alike they turned a deaf ear and the frantic skipper was compelled at last to go on deck again still encumbered with the hated skirts  why don’t you go an’ lay down said the mate an’ i’ll send you down a nice cup o’ hot tea you’ll get histericks if you go on like that  i’ll knock your ’ead off if you talk to me said the skipper  not you said the mate cheerfully you ain’t big enough look at that pore fellow over there  the skipper looked in the direction indicated and swelling with impotent rage shook his fist fiercely at a redfaced man with grey whiskers who was wafting innumerable tender kisses from the bridge of a passing steamer  that’s right said the mate approvingly don’t give ’im no encouragement love at first sight ain’t worth having  the skipper suffering severely from suppressed emotion went below and the crew after waiting a little while to make sure that he was not coming up again made their way quietly to the mate  if we can only take him to battlesea in this rig it’ll be all right said the latter you chaps stand by me his slippers and sou’wester is the only clothes he’s got aboard chuck every needle you can lay your hands on overboard or else he’ll git trying to make a suit out of a piece of old sail or something if we can only take him to mr pearson like this it won’t be so bad after all  while these arrangements were in hand above the skipper and the boy were busy over others below various startling schemes propounded by the skipper for obtaining possession of his men’s attire were rejected by the youth as unlawful and what was worse impracticable for a couple of hours they discussed ways and means but only ended in diatribes against the mean ways of the crew and the skipper whose head ached still from his excesses fell into a state of sullen despair at length and sat silent  by jove tommy i’ve got it he cried suddenly starting up and hitting the table with his fist where’s your other suit  that ain’t no bigger that this one said tommy  you git it out said the skipper with a knowing toss of his head ah there we are now go in my stateroom and take those off  the wondering tommy who thought that great grief had turned his kinsman’s brain complied and emerged shortly afterwards in a blanket bringing his clothes under his arm  now do you know what i’m going to do inquired the skipper with a big smile  no  fetch me the scissors then now do you know what i’m going to do  cut up the two suits and make ’em into one hazarded the horrorstricken tommy here stop it leave off  the skipper pushed him impatiently off and placing the clothes on the table took up the scissors and with a few slashing strokes cut them garments into their component parts  what am i to wear said tommy beginning to blubber you didn’t think of that  what are you to wear you selfish young pig said the skipper sternly always thinking about yourself go and git some needles and thread and if there’s any left over and you’re a good boy i’ll see whether i can’t make something for you out of the leavings  there ain’t no needles here whined tommy after a lengthened search  go down the fo’c’sle and git the case of sailmakers’ needles then said the skipper don’t let anyone see what you’re after an’ some thread  well why couldn’t you let me go in my clothes before you cut ’em up moaned tommy i don’t like going up in this blanket they’ll laugh at me  you go at once thundered the skipper and turning his back on him whistled softly and began to arrange the pieces of cloth  laugh away my lads he said cheerfully as an uproarious burst of laughter greeted the appearance of tommy on deck wait a bit  he waited himself for nearly twenty minutes at the end of which time tommy treading on his blanket came flying down the companionladder and rolled into the cabin  there ain’t a needle aboard the ship he said solemnly as he picked himself up and rubbed his head i’ve looked everywhere  what roared the skipper hastily concealing the pieces of cloth here ted ted  ay ay sir said ted as he came below  i want a sailmaker’s needle said the skipper glibly i’ve got a rent in this skirt  i broke the last one yesterday said ted with an evil grin  any other needle then said the skipper trying to conceal his emotion  i don’t believe there’s such a thing aboard the ship said ted who had obeyed the mate’s thoughtful injunction nor thread i was only saying so to the mate yesterday  the skipper sank again to the lowest depths waved him away and then getting on a corner of the locker fell into a gloomy reverie  it’s a pity you do things in such a hurry said tommy sniffing vindictively you might have made sure of the needle before you spoiled my clothes there’s two of us going about ridiculous now  the master of the sarah jane allowed this insolence to pass unheeded it is in moments of deep distress that the mind of man naturally reverting to solemn things seeks to improve the occasion by a lecture the skipper chastened by suffering and disappointment stuck his right hand in his pocket after a lengthened search for it and gently bidding the blanketed urchin in front of him to sit down began  you see what comes of drink and cards he said mournfully instead of being at the helm of my ship racing all the other craft down the river i’m skulkin’ down below here like—like—  like an actress suggested tommy  the skipper eyed him all over tommy unconscious of offence met his gaze serenely  if continued the skipper at any time you felt like taking too much and you stopped with the beermug halfway to your lips and thought of me sitting in this disgraceful state what would you do  i dunno replied tommy yawning  what would you do persisted the skipper with great expression  laugh i s’pose said tommy after a moment’s thought  the sound of a wellboxed ear rang through the cabin  you’re an unnatural ungrateful little toad said the skipper fiercely you don’t deserve to have a good kind uncle to look after you  anybody can have him for me sobbed the indignant tommy as he tenderly felt his ear you look a precious sight more like an aunt than an uncle  after firing this shot he vanished in a cloud of blanket and the skipper reluctantly abandoning a hastilyformed resolve of first flaying him alive and then flinging him overboard sat down again and lit his pipe  once out of the river he came on deck again and ignoring by a great effort the smiles of the crew and the jibes of the mate took command the only alteration he made in his dress was to substitute his sou’wester for the bonnet and in this guise he did his work while the aggrieved tommy hopped it in blankets the three days at sea passed like a horrid dream so covetous was his gaze that the crew instinctively clutched their nether garments and looked to the buttoning of their coats as they passed him he saw coats in the mainsail and fashioned phantom trousers out of the flying jib and towards the end began to babble of blue serges and mixed tweeds oblivious of fame he had resolved to enter the harbour of battlesea by night but it was not to be near home the wind dropped and the sun was well up before battlesea came into view a grey bank on the starboard bow  until within a mile of the harbour the skipper held on and then his grasp on the wheel relaxed somewhat and he looked round anxiously for the mate  where’s bob he shouted  he’s very ill sir said ted shaking his head  ill gasped the startled skipper here take the wheel a minute  he handed it over and grasping his skirts went hastily below the mate was half lying half sitting in his bunk groaning dismally  what’s the matter inquired the skipper  i’m dying said the mate i keep being tied up all in knots inside i can’t hold myself straight  the other cleared his throat you’d better take off your clothes and lie down a bit he said kindly let me help you off with them  no—don’t—trouble panted the mate  it ain’t no trouble said the skipper in a trembling voice  no i’ll keep ’em on said the mate faintly i’ve always had an idea i’d like to die in my clothes it may be foolish but i can’t help it  you’ll have your wish some day never fear you infernal rascal shouted the overwrought skipper you’re shamming sickness to make me take the ship into port  why shouldn’t you take her in asked the mate with an air of innocent surprise it’s your duty as cap’n you’d better get above now the bar is always shifting  the skipper restraining himself by a mighty effort went on deck again and taking the wheel addressed the crew he spoke feelingly of the obedience men owed their superior officers and the moral obligation they were under to lend them their trousers when they required them he dwelt on the awful punishments awarded for mutiny and proved clearly that to allow the master of a ship to enter port in petticoats was mutiny of the worst type he then sent them below for their clothing they were gone such a long time that it was palpable to the meanest intellect that they did not intend to bring it meantime the harbour widened out before him  there were two or three people on the quay as the sarah jane came within hailing distance by the time she had passed the lantern at the end of it there were two or three dozen and the numbers were steadily increasing at the rate of three persons for every five yards she made kindhearted humane men anxious that their friends should not lose so great and cheap a treat bribed small and reluctant boys with pennies to go in search of them and by the time the schooner reached her berth a large proportion of the population of the port was looking over each other’s shoulders and shouting foolish and hilarious inquiries to the skipper the news reached the owner and he came hurrying down to the ship just as the skipper regardless of the heated remonstrances of the sightseers was preparing to go below  mr pearson was a stout man and he came down exploding with wrath then he saw the apparition and mirth overcame him it became necessary for three stout fellows to act as buttresses and the more indignant the skipper looked the harder their work became finally he was assisted in a weak state and laughing hysterically to the deck of the schooner where he followed the skipper below and in a voice broken with emotion demanded an explanation  it’s the finest sight i ever saw in my life bross he said when the other had finished i wouldn’t have missed it for anything i’ve been feeling very low this last week and it’s done me good don’t talk nonsense about leaving the ship i wouldn’t lose you for anything after this but if you like to ship a fresh mate and crew you can please yourself if you’ll only come up to the house and let mrs pearson see you—she’s been ailing—i’ll give you a couple of pounds now get your bonnet and come     the boatswain’s watch     captain polson sat in his comfortable parlour smiling benignly upon his daughter and sister his ship after an absence of eighteen months was once more berthed in the small harbour of barborough and the captain was sitting in that state of goodnatured affability which invariably characterised his first appearance after a long absence  no news this end i suppose he inquired after a lengthy recital of most extraordinarily uninteresting adventures  not much said his sister jane looking nervously at her niece young metcalfe has gone into partnership with his father  i don’t want to hear about those sharks said the captain waxing red tell me about honest men  joe lewis has had a month’s imprisonment for stealing fowls said miss polson meekly mrs purton has had twins—dear little fellows they are fat as butter—she has named one of them polson after you the greedy one  any deaths inquired the captain snappishly as he eyed the innocent lady suspiciously  poor old jasper wheeler has gone said his sister he was very resigned he borrowed enough money to get a big doctor from london and when he heard that there was no hope for him he said he was just longing to go and he was sorry he couldn’t take all his dear ones with him mary hewson is married to jack draper and young metcalfe’s banns go up for the third time next sunday  i hope he gets a tartar said the vindictive captain who’s the girl some silly little fool i know she ought to be warned  i don’t believe in interfering in marriages said his daughter chrissie shaking her head sagely  oh said the captain staring you don’t now you’ve put your hair up and taken to wearing long frocks i suppose you’re beginning to think of it  yes auntie wants to tell you something said his daughter rising and crossing the room  no i don’t said miss polson hastily  you’d better do it said chrissie giving her a little push there’s a dear i’ll go upstairs and lock myself in my room  the face of the captain whilst this conversation was passing was a study in suppressed emotions he was a firm advocate for importing the manners of the quarterdeck into private life the only drawback being that he had to leave behind him the language usual in that locality to this omission he usually ascribed his failures  sit down chrissie he commanded sit down jane now miss what’s all this about  i don’t like to tell you said chrissie folding her hands in her lap i know you’ll be cross you’re so unreasonable  the captain stared—frightfully  i’m going to be married said chrissie suddenly—there to jack metcalfe—there so you’ll have to learn to love him he’s going to try and love you for my sake to his sister’s dismay the captain got up and brandishing his fists walked violently to and fro by these simple but unusual means decorum was preserved  if you were only a boy said the captain when he had regained his seat i should know what to do with you  if i were a boy said chrissie who having braced herself up for the fray meant to go through with it i shouldn’t want to marry jack don’t be silly father  jane said the captain in a voice which made the lady addressed start in her chair what do you mean by it  it isn’t my fault said miss polson feebly i told her how it would be and it was so gradual he admired my geraniums at first and of course i was deceived there are so many people admire my geraniums whether it is because the window has a south aspect—  oh said the captain rudely that’ll do jane if he wasn’t a lawyer i’d go round and break his neck chrissie is only nineteen and she’ll come for a year’s cruise with me perhaps the sea air’ll strengthen her head we’ll see who’s master in this family  i’m sure i don’t want to be master said his daughter taking a weapon of fine cambric out of her pocket and getting ready for action i can’t help liking people auntie likes him too don’t you auntie  yes said miss polson bravely  very good said the autocrat promptly i’ll take you both for a cruise  you’re making me very un—unhappy said chrissie burying her face in her handkerchief  you’ll be more unhappy before i’ve done with you said the captain grimly and while i think of it i’ll step round and stop those banns his daughter caught him by the arm as he was passing and laid her face on his sleeve you’ll make me look so foolish she wailed  that’ll make it easier for you to come to sea with me said her father don’t cry all over my sleeve i’m going to see a parson run upstairs and play with your dolls and if you’re a good girl i’ll bring you in some sweets he put on his hat and closing the front door with a bang went off to the new rector to knock two years off the age which his daughter kept for purposes of matrimony the rector grieved at such duplicity in one so young met him more than half way and he came out from him smiling placidly until his attention was attracted by a young man on the other side of the road who was regarding him with manifest awkwardness  good evening captain polson he said crossing the road  oh said the captain stopping i wanted to speak to you i suppose you wanted to marry my daughter while i was out of the way to save trouble just the manly thing i should have expected of you i’ve stopped the banns and i’m going to take her for a voyage with me you’ll have to look elsewhere my lad  the ill feeling is all on your side captain said metcalfe reddening  ill feeling snorted the captain you put me in the witnessbox and made me a laughingstock in the place with your silly attempts at jokes lost me five hundred pounds and then try and marry my daughter while i’m at sea ill feeling be hanged  that was business said the other  it was said the captain and this is business too mine i’ll look after it i’ll promise you i think i know who’ll look silly this time i’d sooner see my girl in heaven than married to a rascal of a lawyer  you’d want good glasses retorted metcalfe who was becoming ruffled  i don’t want to bandy words with you said the captain with dignity after a long pause devoted to thinking of something worth bandying you think you’re a clever fellow but i know a cleverer you’re quite welcome to marry my daughter—if you can  he turned on his heel and refusing to listen to any further remarks went on his way rejoicing arrived home he lit his pipe and throwing himself into an armchair related his exploits chrissie had recourse to her handkerchief again more for effect than use but miss polson who was a tender soul took hers out and wept unrestrainedly at first the captain took it well enough it was a tribute to his power but when they took to sobbing one against the other his temper rose and he sternly commanded silence  i shall be like—this—every day at sea sobbed chrissie vindictively only worse making us all ridiculous  stop that noise directly vociferated the captain  we cccan’t sobbed miss polson  and we ddon’t want to said chrissie it’s all we can do and we’re going to do it you’d better ggo out and stop something else you can’t stop us  the captain took the advice and went and in the billiardroom of the george heard some news which set him thinking and which brought him back somewhat earlier than he had at first intended a small group at his gate broke up into its elements at his approach and the captain following his sister and daughter into the room sat down and eyed them severely  so you’re going to run off to london to get married are you miss he said ferociously well we’ll see you don’t go out of my sight until we sail and if i catch that pettifogging lawyer round at my gate again i’ll break every bone in his body mind that  for the next three days the captain kept his daughter under observation and never allowed her to stir abroad except in his company the evening of the third day to his own great surprise he spent at a dorcas the company was not congenial several of the ladies putting their work away and glaring frigidly at the intruder and though they could see clearly that he was suffering greatly made no attempt to put him at his ease he was very thoughtful all the way home and the next day took a partner into the concern in the shape of his boatswain  you understand tucker he concluded as the hapless seaman stood in a cringing attitude before chrissie that you never let my daughter out of your sight when she goes out you go with her  yessir said tucker and suppose she tells me to go home what am i to do then  you’re a fool said the captain sharply it doesn’t matter what she says or does unless you are in the same room you are never to be more than three yards from her  make it four cap’n said the boatswain in a broken voice  three said the captain and mind she’s artful all girls are and she’ll try and give you the slip i’ve had information given me as to what’s going on whatever happens you are not to leave her  i wish you’d get somebody else sir said tucker very respectfully there’s a lot of chaps aboard that’d like the job  you’re the only man i can trust said the captain shortly when i give you orders i know they’ll be obeyed it’s your watch now  he went out humming chrissie took up a book and sat down utterly ignoring the woebegone figure which stood the regulation three yards from her twisting its cap in its hands  i hope miss said the boatswain after standing patiently for threequarters of an hour as ’ow you won’t think i sought arter this ’ere little job  no said chrissie without looking up  i’m just obeying orders continued the boatswain i always git let in for these ’ere little jobs somehow the monkeys i’ve had to look arter aboard ship would frighten you there never was a monkey on the monarch but what i was in charge of that’s what a man gets through being trustworthy  just so said chrissie putting down her book well i’m going into the kitchen now come along nursie  ’ere i say miss remonstrated tucker flushing  i don’t know how susan will like you going in her kitchen said chrissie thoughtfully however that’s your business  the unfortunate seaman followed his fair charge into the kitchen and leaning against the doorpost doubled up like a limp rag before the terrible glance of its mistress  ho said susan who took the state of affairs as an insult to the sex in general and what might you be wanting  cap’n’s orders murmured tucker feebly  i’m captain here said susan confronting him with her bare arms akimbo  and credit it does you said the boatswain looking round admiringly  is it your wish miss chrissie that this image comes and stalks into my kitchen as if the place belongs to him demanded the irate susan  i didn’t mean to come in in that way said the astonished tucker i can’t help being big  i don’t want him here said her mistress what do you think i want him for  you hear that said susan pointing to the door now go i don’t want people to say that you come into this kitchen after me  i’m here by the cap’n’s orders said tucker faintly i don’t want to be here—far from it as for people saying that i come here after you them as knows me would laugh at the idea  if i had my way said susan in a hard rasping voice i’d box your ears for you that’s what i’d do to you and you can go and tell the cap’n i said so spy  this was the first verse of the first watch and there were many verses to add to his discomfort he was confined to the house as his charge manifested no desire to go outside and as neither she nor her aunt cared about the trouble of bringing him to a fit and proper state of subjection the task became a labour of love for the energetic susan in spite of everything however he stuck to his guns and the indignant chrissie who was in almost hourly communication with metcalfe through the medium of her faithful handmaiden was rapidly becoming desperate  on the fourth day time getting short chrissie went on a new tack with her keeper and susan sorely against her will had to follow suit chrissie smiled at him susan called him mr tucker and miss polson gave him a glass of her best wine from the position of an outcast he jumped in one bound to that of confidential adviser miss polson told him many items of family interest and later on in the afternoon actually consulted him as to a bad cold which chrissie had developed  he prescribed halfapint of linseed oil hot but miss polson favoured chlorodyne the conversation then turned on the deadly qualities of that drug when taken in excess of the fatal sleep in which it lulled its victims so disastrous were the incidents cited that half an hour later when her aunt and susan being out chrissie took a small bottle of chlorodyne from the mantelpiece the boatswain implored her to try his nastier but safer remedy instead  nonsense said chrissie i’m only going to take twenty drops—one—two—three—  the drug suddenly poured out in a little stream  i should think that’s about it said chrissie holding the tumbler up to the light  it’s about five hundred said the horrified tucker don’t take that miss whatever you do let me measure it for you  the girl waved him away and before he could interfere drank off the contents of the glass and resumed her seat the boatswain watched her uneasily and taking up the phial carefully read through the directions after that he was not at all surprised to see the book fall from his charge’s hand on to the floor and her eyes close  i knowed it said tucker in a profuse perspiration i knowed it them blamed gals are all alike always knows what’s best miss polson miss polson  he shook her roughly but to no purpose and then running to the door shouted eagerly for susan no reply forthcoming he ran to the window but there was nobody in sight and he came back and stood in front of the girl wringing his huge hands helplessly it was a great question for a poor sailorman if he went for the doctor he deserted his post if he didn’t go his charge might die he made one more attempt to awaken her and seizing a flowerglass splashed her freely with cold water she did not even wince  it’s no use fooling with it murmured tucker i must get the doctor that’s all  he quitted the room and dashing hastily downstairs had already opened the hall door when a thought struck him and he came back again chrissie was still asleep in the chair and with a smile at the clever way in which he had solved a difficulty he stooped down and raising her in his strong arms bore her from the room and downstairs then a hitch occurred the triumphant progress was marred by the behaviour of the hall door which despite his efforts refused to be opened and encumbered by his fair burden he could not for some time ascertain the reason then full of shame that so much deceit could exist in so fair and frail a habitation he discovered that miss polson’s foot was pressing firmly against it her eyes were still closed and her head heavy but the fact remained that one foot was acting in a manner that was full of intelligence and guile and when he took it away from the door the other one took its place by a sudden manoeuvre the wily tucker turned his back on the door and opened it and at the same moment a hand came to life again and dealt him a stinging slap on the face  idiot said the indignant chrissie slipping from his arms and confronting him how dare you take such a liberty  the astonished boatswain felt his face and regarded her openmouthed  don’t you ever dare to speak to me again said the offended maiden drawing herself up with irreproachable dignity i am disgusted with your conduct most unbearable  i was carrying you off to the doctor said the boatswain how was i to know you was only shamming  shamming said chrissie in tones of incredulous horror i was asleep i often go to sleep in the afternoon  the boatswain made no reply except to grin with great intelligence as he followed his charge upstairs again he grinned at intervals until the return of susan and miss polson who trying to look unconcerned came in later on both apparently suffering from temper susan especially amid the sympathetic interruptions of these listeners chrissie recounted her experiences while the boatswain despite his better sense felt like the greatest scoundrel unhung a feeling which was fostered by the remarks of susan and the chilling regards of miss poison  i shall inform the captain said miss polson bridling it’s my duty  oh i shall tell him said chrissie i shall tell him the moment he comes in at the door  so shall i said susan the idea of taking such liberties  having fired this broadside the trio watched the enemy narrowly and anxiously  if i’ve done anything wrong ladies said the unhappy boatswain i am sorry for it i can’t say anything fairer than that and i’ll tell the cap’n myself exactly how i came to do it when he comes in  pah telltale said susan  of course if you are here to fetch and carry said miss polson with withering emphasis  the idea of a grown man telling tales said chrissie scornfully baby  why just now you were all going to tell him yourselves said the bewildered boatswain  the two elder women rose and regarded him with looks of pitying disdain miss polson’s glance said fool plainly susan a simple child of nature given to expressing her mind freely said blockhead with conviction  i see ’ow it is said the boatswain after ruminating deeply well i won’t split ladies i can see now you was all in it and it was a little job to get me out of the house  what a head he has got said the irritated susan isn’t it wonderful how he thinks of it all nobody would think he was so clever to look at him  still waters run deep said the boatswain who was beginning to have a high opinion of himself  and pride goes before a fall said chrissie remember that mr tucker  mr tucker grinned but remembering the fable of the pitcher and the well pressed his superior officer that evening to relieve him from his duties he stated that the strain was slowly undermining a constitution which was not so strong as appearances would warrant and that his knowledge of female nature was lamentably deficient on many important points you’re doing very well said the captain who had no intention of attending any more dorcases very well indeed i am proud of you  it isn’t a man’s work objected the boatswain besides if anything happens you’ll blame me for it  nothing can happen declared the captain confidently we shall make a start in about four days now you’re the only man i can trust with such a difficult job tucker and i shan’t forget you  very good said the other dejectedly i obey orders then  the next day passed quietly the members of the household making a great fuss of tucker and thereby filling him with forebodings of the worst possible nature on the day after when the captain having business at a neighbouring town left him in sole charge his uneasiness could not be concealed  i’m going for a walk said chrissie as he sat by himself working out dangerous moves and the best means of checking them would you care to come with me tucker  i wish you wouldn’t put it that way miss said the boatswain as he reached for his hat  i want exercise said chrissie i’ve been cooped up long enough  she set off at a good pace up the high street attended by her faithful follower and passing through the small suburbs struck out into the country beyond after four miles the boatswain who was no walker reminded her that they had got to go back  plenty of time said chrissie we have got the day before us isn’t it glorious do you see that milestone tucker i’ll race you to it come along  she was off on the instant with the boatswain who suspected treachery after her  you can run she panted thoughtfully as she came in second we’ll have another one presently you don’t know how good it is for you tucker  the boatswain grinned sourly and looked at her from the corner of his eye the next three miles passed like a horrible nightmare his charge making a race for every milestone in which the labouring boatswain despite his want of practice came in the winner the fourth ended disastrously chrissie limping the last ten yards and seating herself with a very woebegone face on the stone itself  you did very well miss said the boatswain who thought he could afford to be generous you needn’t be offended about it  it’s my ankle said chrissie with a little whimper oh i twisted it right round  the boatswain stood regarding her in silent consternation  it’s no use looking like that said chrissie sharply you great clumsy thing if you hadn’t have run so hard it wouldn’t have happened it’s all your fault  if you don’t mind leaning on me a bit said tucker we might get along  chrissie took his arm petulantly and they started on their return journey at the rate of about four hours a mile with little cries and gasps at every other yard  it’s no use said chrissie as she relinquished his arm and limping to the side of the road sat down the boatswain pricked up his ears hopefully at the sound of approaching wheels  what’s the matter with the young lady inquired a groom who was driving a little trap as he pulled up and regarded with interest a grimace of extraordinary intensity on the young lady’s face  broke her ankle i think said the boatswain glibly which way are you going  well i’m going to barborough said the groom but my guvnor’s rather pertickler  i’ll make it all right with you said the boatswain  the groom hesitated a minute and then made way for chrissie as the boatswain assisted her to get up beside him then tucker with a grin of satisfaction at getting a seat once more clambered up behind and they started  have a rug mate said the groom handing the reins to chrissie and passing it over put it round your knees and tuck the ends under you  ay ay mate said the boatswain as he obeyed the instructions  are you sure you are quite comfortable said the groom affectionately  quite said the other  the groom said no more but in a quiet businesslike fashion placed his hands on the seaman’s broad back and shot him out into the road then he snatched up the reins and drove off at a gallop  without the faintest hope of winning mr tucker who realised clearly appearances notwithstanding that he had fallen into a trap rose after a hurried rest and started on his fifth race that morning the prize was only a secondrate groom with plated buttons who was waving cheery farewells to him with a dingy top hat but the boatswain would have sooner had it than a silver teaservice  he ran as he had never ran before in his life but all to no purpose the trap stopping calmly a little further on to take up another passenger in whose favour the groom retired to the back seat then with a final wave of the hand to him they took a road to the left and drove rapidly out of sight the boatswain’s watch was over     low water     it was a calm clear evening in late summer as the elizabeth ann of pembray scorning the expensive aid of a tug threaded her way down the london river under canvas the crew were busy forward and the master and partowner—a fussy little man deeply imbued with a sense of his own importance and cleverness—was at the wheel chatting with the mate while waiting for a portion of his cargo he had passed the previous week pleasantly enough with some relatives in exeter and was now in a masterful fashion receiving a report from the mate  there’s one other thing said the mate i dessay you’ve noticed how sober old dick is tonight  i kept him short o’ purpose said the skipper with a satisfied air  tain’t that said the mate you’ll be pleased to hear that ’im an’ sam has been talked over by the other two and that all your crew now ’cept the cook who’s still roman catholic has j’ined the salvation army  salvation army repeated the skipper in dazed tones i don’t want none o’ your gammon bob  it’s quite right said the other you can take it from me how it was done i don’t know but what i do know is none of ’em has touched licker for five days they’ve all got red jerseys an’ i hear as old dick preaches a hexcellent sermon he’s redhot on it and t’others follow ’im like sheep  the drink’s got to his brain said the skipper sagely after due reflection well i don’t mind so long as they behave theirselves  he kept silence until woolwich was passed and they were running along with all sails set and then his curiosity being somewhat excited he called old dick to him with the amiable intention of a little banter  what’s this i hear about you j’ining the salvation army he asked  it’s quite true sir said dick i feel so happy you can’t think—we all do  glory said one of the other men with enthusiastic corroboration  seems like the measles said the skipper facetiously four of you down with it at one time  it is like the measles sir said the old man impressively an’ i only hope as you’ll catch it yourself bad  hallelujah bawled the other man suddenly he’ll catch it  hold that noise you joe shouted the skipper sternly how dare you make that noise aboard ship  he’s excited sir said dick it’s love for you in ’is ’eart as does it  let him keep his love to hisself said the skipper churlishly  ah that’s just what we can’t do said dick in highpitched tones which the skipper rightly concluded to be his preaching voice we can’t do it—an’ why can’t we do it becos we feel good an’ we want you to feel good too we want to share it with you oh dear friend—  that’s enough said the master of the elizabeth ann sharply don’t you go ’dear friending’ me go for’ard go for’ard at once  with a melancholy shake of his head the old man complied and the startled skipper turned to the mate who was at the wheel and expressed his firm intention of at once stopping such behaviour on his ship  you can’t do it said the mate firmly  can’t do it queried the skipper  not a bit of it said the other they’ve all got it bad an’ the more you get at ’em the wuss they’ll be mark my words best let ’em alone  i’ll hold my hand a bit and watch ’em was the reply but i’ve always been cap’n on my own ship and i always will  for the next twentyfour hours he retained his sovereignty undisputed but on sunday morning after breakfast when he was at the wheel and the crew below the mate who had been forward came aft with a strange grin struggling for development at the corners of his mouth  what’s the matter inquired the skipper regarding him with some disfavour  they’re all down below with their red jerseys on replied the mate still struggling and they’re holding a sort o’ consultation about the lost lamb an’ the best way o’ reaching ’is ’ard ’eart  lost lamb repeated the skipper unconcernedly but carefully avoiding the other’s eye  you’re the lost lamb said the mate who always went straight to the point  i won’t have it said the skipper excitably how dare they go on in this way go and send ’em up directly  the mate whistling cheerily complied and the four men neatly attired in scarlet came on deck  now what’s all this nonsense about demanded the incensed man what do you want  we want your pore sinful soul said dick with ecstasy  ay an’ we’ll have it said joe with deep conviction  so we will said the other two closing their eyes and smiling rapturously so we will  the skipper alarmed despite himself at their confidence turned a startled face to the mate  if you could see it now continued dick impressively you’d be frightened at it if you could—  get to your own end of the ship spluttered the indignant skipper get before i kick you there  better let sam have a try said one of the other men calmly ignoring the fury of the master his efforts have been wonderfully blessed come here sam  there’s a time for everything said sam cautiously let’s go for’ard and do what we can for him among ourselves  they moved off reluctantly dick throwing such affectionate glances at the skipper over his shoulders that he nearly choked with rage  i won’t have it he said fiercely i’ll knock it out of ’em  you can’t said the mate you can’t knock sailor men about nowadays the only thing you can do is to get rid of ’em  i don’t want to do that was the growling reply they’ve been with me a long time and they’re all good men why don’t they have a go at you i wonder  me said the mate in indignant surprise why i’m a seventh day baptist they don’t want to waste their time over me i’m all right  you’re a pretty seventh day baptist you are replied the skipper fust i’ve heard of it  you don’t understand about such things said the mate  it must be a very easy religion continued the skipper  i don’t make a show of it if that’s what you mean rejoined the other warmly i’m one o’ them as believe in ’iding my light under a bushel  a pint pot’ud do easy sneered the skipper it’s more in your line too  anyway the men reckernise it said the mate loftily they don’t go an’ sit in their red jerseys an’ hold mothers’ meetings over me  i’ll knock their blessed heads off growled the skipper i’ll learn ’em to insult me  it’s all for your own good said the other they mean it kindly well i wish ’em luck  with these hardy words he retired leaving a seething volcano to pace the deck and think over ways and means of once more reducing his crew to what he considered a fit and proper state of obedience and respect  the climax was reached at teatime when an anonymous hand was thrust beneath the skylight and a fullbodied tract fluttered wildly down and upset his tea  that’s the last straw he roared fishing out the tract and throwing it on the floor i’ll read them chaps a lesson they won’t forget in a hurry and put a little money in my pocket at the same time i’ve got a little plan in my ’ed as come to me quite sudden this afternoon come on deck bob  bob obeyed grinning and the skipper taking the wheel from sam sent him for the others  did you ever know me break my word dick he inquired abruptly as they shuffled up  never said dick  cap’n bowers’ word is better than another man’s oath asseverated joe  well said captain bowers with a wink at the mate i’m going to give you chaps a little selfdenial week all to yourselves if you all live on biscuit and water till we get to port and don’t touch nothing else i’ll jine you and become a salvationist  biscuit and water said dick doubtfully scratching a beard strong enough to scratch back  it wouldn’t be right to play with our constitooshuns in that way sir objected joe shaking his head  there you are said bowers turning to the mate with a wave of his hand they’re precious anxious about me so long as it’s confined to jawing and dropping tracts into my tea but when it comes to a little hardship on their part see how they back out of it  we ain’t backing out of it said dick cautiously but s’pose we do how are we to be certain as you’ll jine us  you ’ve got my word for it said the other an’ the mate an’ cook witness it  o’ course you jine the army for good sir said dick still doubtfully  o’ course  then it’s a bargain sir said dick beaming ain’t it chaps  ay ay said the others but not beaming quite so much oh what a joyful day this is said the old man a salvation crew an’ a salvation cap’n we’ll have the cook next bad as he is  you’ll have biskit an’ water said the cook icily as they moved off an’ nothing else i’ll take care  they must be uncommon fond o’ me said the skipper meditatively  uncommon fond o’ having their own way growled the mate nice thing you’ve let yourself in for  i know what i ’m about was the confident reply  you ain’t going to let them idiots fast for a week an’ then break your word said the mate in surprise  certainly not said the other wrathfully i’d sooner jine three armies than do that and you know it  they’ll keep to the grub don’t you fear said the mate i can’t understand how you are going to manage it  that’s where the brains come in retorted the skipper somewhat arrogantly  fust time i’ve heard of ’em murmured the mate softly but i s’pose you’ve been using pint pots too  the skipper glared at him scornfully but being unprovided with a retort forbore to reply and going below again mixed himself a stiff glass of grog and drank success to his scheme  three days passed and the men stood firm and realising that they were slowly undermining the skipper’s convictions made no effort to carry him by direct assault the mate made no attempt to conceal his opinion of his superior’s peril and in gloomy terms strove to put the full horror of his position before him  what your missis’ll say the first time she sees you prancing up an’ down the road tapping a tambourine i can’t think said he  i shan’t have no tambourine said captain bowers cheerfully  it’ll also be your painful dooty to stand outside your fatherinlaw’s pub and try and persuade customers not to go in continued bob nice thing that for a quiet family  the skipper smiled knowingly and rolling a cigar in his mouth leaned back in his seat and cocked his eye at the skylight  don’t you worry my lad said he don’t you worry i’m in this job an’ i’m coming out on top when men forget what’s due to their betters and preach to ’em they’ve got to be taught what’s what if the wind keeps fair we ought to be home by sunday night or monday morning  the other nodded  now you keep your eyes open said the skipper and going to his stateroom he returned with three bottles of rum and a corkscrew all of which with an air of great mystery he placed on the table and then smiled at the mate the mate smiled too  what’s this inquired the skipper drawing the cork and holding a bottle under the other’s nose  it smells like rum said the mate glancing round possibly for a glass  it’s for the men said the skipper but you may take a drop  the mate taking down a glass helped himself liberally and having made sure of it sympathetically but politely expressed his firm opinion that the men would not touch it under any conditions whatever  you don’t quite understand how firm they are said he you think it’s just a new fad with ’em but it ain’t  they’ll drink it said the skipper taking up two of the bottles bring the other on deck for me  the mate complied wonderingly and laden with prime old jamaica ascended the steps  what’s this inquired the skipper crossing over to dick and holding out a bottle  pison sir said dick promptly  have a drop said the skipper jovially  not for twenty pounds said the old man with a look of horror  not for two million pounds said sam with financial precision  will anybody have a drop asked the owner waving the bottle to and fro  as he spoke a grimy paw shot out from behind him and before he quite realised the situation the cook had accepted the invitation and was hurriedly making the most of it  not you growled the skipper snatching the bottle from him i didn’t mean you well my lads if you won’t have it neat you shall have it watered  before anybody could guess his intention he walked to the watercask and removing the cover poured in the rum in the midst of a profound silence he emptied the three bottles and then with a triumphant smile turned and confronted his astonished crew  what’s in that cask dick he asked quietly  rum and water groaned dick but that ain’t fair play sir we’ve kep’ to our part o’ the agreement sir an’ you ought to ha’ kep’ to yours  so i have was the quick reply so i have an’ i still keep to it don’t you see this my lads when you start playing antics with me you’re playing a fool’s game an’ you’re bound to come a cropper some men would ha’ waited longer afore they spiled their game but i think you’ve suffered enough now there’s a lump of beef and some taters on an’ you’d better go and make a good square meal an’ next time you want to alter the religion of people as knows better than you do think twice  we don’t want no beef sir biskit’ll do for us said dick firmly  all right please yourselves said the skipper but mind no hankypanky no coming for drink when my back’s turned this cask’ll be watched but if you do alter your mind about the beef you can tell the cook to get it for you any time you like  he threw the bottles overboard and ignoring the groaning and headshaking of the men walked away listening with avidity to the respectful tributes to his genius tendered by the mate and cook—flattery so delicate and so genuine withal that he opened another bottle  there’s just one thing said the mate presently won’t the rum affect the cooking a good deal  i never thought o’ that admitted the skipper still we musn’t expect to have everything our own way  no no said the mate blankly admiring the other’s choice of pronouns  up to friday afternoon the skipper went about with a smile of kindly satisfaction on his face but in the evening it weakened somewhat and by saturday morning it had vanished altogether and was replaced by an expression of blank amazement and anxiety for the crew shunned the water cask as though it were poison without appearing to suffer the slightest inconvenience a visible air of proprietorship appeared on their faces whenever they looked at the skipper and the now frightened man inveighed fiercely to the mate against the improper methods of conversion patronised by some religious bodies and the aggravating obstinacy of some of their followers  it’s wonderful what enthusiasm’ll do for a man said bob reflectively i knew a man once—  i don’t want none o’ your lies interposed the other rudely  an’ i don’t want your blamed rum and water if it comes to that said the mate firing up when a man’s tea is made with rum an’ his beef is biled in it he begins to wonder whether he’s shipped with a seaman or a—a—  a what shouted the skipper say it  i can’t think o’ nothing foolish enough was the frank reply it’s all right for you becos it’s the last licker as you’ll be allowed to taste but it’s rough on me and the cook  damn you an’ the cook said the skipper and went on deck to see whether the men’s tongues were hanging out  by sunday morning he was frantic the men were hale and well enough though perhaps a trifle thin and he began to believe with the cook that the age of miracles had not yet passed  it was a broiling hot day and to add to his discomfort the mate who was consumed by a raging thirst lay panting in the shade of the mainsail exchanging condolences of a most offensive nature with the cook every time he looked his way  all the morning he grumbled incessantly until at length warned by an offensive smell of rum that dinner was on the table he got up and went below  at the foot of the ladder he paused abruptly for the skipper was leaning back in his seat gazing in a fascinated manner at some object on the table  what’s the matter inquired the mate in alarm  the other who did not appear to hear the question made no answer but continued to stare in a most extraordinary fashion at a bottle which graced the centre of the table  what is it inquired the mate not venturing to trust his eyes water where did it come from  cook roared the skipper turning a bloodshot eye on that worthy as his pallid face showed behind the mate what’s this if you say it’s water i’ll kill you  i don’t know what it is sir said the cook cautiously but dick sent it to you with his best respects and i was to say as there’s plenty more where that came from he’s a nasty under’anded deceitful old man is dick sir an’ it seems he laid in a stock o’ water in bottles an’ the like afore you doctored the cask an’ the men have had it locked up in their chests ever since  dick’s a very clever old man remarked the mate pouring himself out a glass and drinking it with infinite relish ain’t he cap’n it’ll be a privilege to jine anything that man’s connected with won’t it  he paused for a reply but none came for the cap’n with dim eyes was staring blankly into a future so lonely and uncongenial that he had lost the power of speech—even of that which at other crises had never failed to afford him relief the mate gazed at him curiously for a moment and then imitating the example of the cook quitted the cabin     in midatlantic     no sir said the nightwatchman as he took a seat on a post at the end of the jetty and stowed a huge piece of tobacco in his cheek no man an’ boy i was at sea forty years afore i took on this job but i can’t say as ever i saw a real downright ghost  this was disappointing and i said so previous experience of the power of bill’s vision had led me to expect something very different  not but what i’ve known some queer things happen said bill fixing his eyes on the surrey side and going off into a kind of trance queer things  i waited patiently bill’s eyes after resting for some time on surrey began to slowly cross the river paused midway in reasonable hopes of a collision between a tug with its flotilla of barges and a penny steamer and then came back to me  you heard that yarn old cap’n harris was telling the other day about the skipper he knew having a warning one night to alter his course an’ doing so picked up five live men and three dead skeletons in a open boat he inquired  i nodded  the yarn in various forms is an old one said i  it’s all founded on something i told him once said bill i don’t wish to accuse cap’n harris of taking another man’s true story an’ spoiling it he’s got a bad memory that’s all fust of all he forgets he ever heard the yarn secondly he goes and spoils it  i gave a sympathetic murmur harris was as truthful an old man as ever breathed but his tales were terribly restricted by this circumstance whereas bill’s were limited by nothing but his own imagination  it was about fifteen years ago now began bill getting the quid into a byeway of his cheek where it would not impede his utterance i was a b on the swallow a barque trading wherever we could pick up stuff on this v’y’ge we was bound from london to jamaica with a general cargo  the start of that v’y’ge was excellent we was towed out of the st katherine’s docks here to the nore an’ the tug left us to a stiff breeze which fairly raced us down channel and out into the atlantic everybody was saying what a fine v’y’ge we was having an’ what quick time we should make an’ the fust mate was in such a lovely temper that you might do anything with him a’most  we was about ten days out an’ still slipping along in this spanking way when all of a sudden things changed i was at the wheel with the second mate one night when the skipper whose name was brown came up from below in a uneasy sort o’ fashion and stood looking at us for some time without speaking then at last he sort o’ makes up his mind and ses he—  ’mr mcmillan i’ve just had a most remarkable experience an’ i don’t know what to do about it’  ’yes sir’ ses mr mcmillan  ’three times i ’ve been woke up this night by something shouting in my ear steer nor’nor’west’ ses the cap’n very solemnly ’steer nor’nor’west’ that’s all it says the first time i thought it was somebody got into my cabin skylarking and i laid for ’em with a stick but i’ve heard it three times an’ there’s nothing there’  ’it’s a supernatural warning’ ses the second mate who had a great uncle once who had the second sight and was the most unpopular man of his family because he always knew what to expect and laid his plans according  ’that’s what i think’ ses the cap’n ’there’s some poor shipwrecked fellow creatures in distress  ’it’s a verra grave responsebeelity’ ses mr mcmillan ’i should just ca’ up the fairst mate’  ’bill’ ses the cap’n ’just go down below and tell mr salmon i ’d like a few words with him partikler’  well i went down below and called up the first mate and as soon as i’d explained to him what he was wanted for he went right off into a fit of outrageous bad language an’ hit me he came right up on deck in his pants an’ socks a most disrespekful way to come to the cap’n but he was that hot and excited he didn’t care what he did  ’mr salmon’ ses the cap’n gravely ’i’ve just had a most solemn warning and i want to—’  ’i know’ says the mate gruffly  ’what have you heard it too’ ses the cap’n in surprise ’three times’ i heard it from him’ ses the mate pointing to me ’nightmare sir nightmare’  ’it was not nightmare sir’ ses the cap’n very huffy ’an if i hear it again i ’m going to alter this ship’s course’  well the fust mate was in a hole he wanted to call the skipper something which he knew wasn’t discipline i knew what it was an’ i knew if the mate didn’t do something he’d be ill he was that sort of man everything flew to his head he walked away and put his head over the side for a bit an’ at last when he came back he was comparatively speaking calm  ’you mustn’t hear them words again sir’ ses he ’don’t go to sleep again tonight stay up an’ we’ll have a hand o’ cards and in the morning you take a good stiff dose o’ rhoobarb don’t spoil one o’ the best trips we’ve ever had for the sake of a pennyworth of rhoobarb’ ses he pleadinglike  ’mr salmon’ ses the cap’n very angry ’i shall not fly in the face o’ providence in any such way i shall sleep as usual an’ as for your rhoobarb’ ses the cap’n working hisself up into a passion—’damme sir i’ll—i’ll dose the whole crew with it from first mate to cabinboy if i have any impertinence’  well mr salmon who was getting very mad stalks down below followed by the cap’n an’ mr mcmillan was that excited that he even started talking to me about it halfanhour arterwards the cap’n comes running up on deck again  ’mr mcmillan’ ses he excitedly ’steer nor’nor’west until further orders i’ve heard it again an’ this time it nearly split the drum of my ear’  the ship’s course was altered an’ after the old man was satisfied he went back to bed again an’ almost directly arter eight bells went an’ i was relieved i wasn’t on deck when the fust mate come up but those that were said he took it very calm he didn’t say a word he just sat down on the poop and blew his cheeks out  as soon as ever it was daylight the skipper was on deck with his glasses he sent men up to the masthead to keep a good lookout an’ he was dancing about like a cat on hot bricks all the morning  ’how long are we to go on this course sir’ asks mr salmon about ten o’clock in the morning  ’i’ve not made up my mind sir’ ses the cap’n very stately but i could see he was looking a trifle foolish  at twelve o’clock in the day the fust mate got a cough and every time he coughed it seemed to act upon the skipper and make him madder and madder now that it was broad daylight mr mcmillan didn’t seem to be so creepy as the night before an’ i could see the cap’n was only waiting for the slightest excuse to get into our proper course again  ’that’s a nasty bad cough o’ yours mr salmon’ ses he eyeing the mate very hard  ’yes a nasty irritating sort o’ cough sir’ ses the other ’it worries me a great deal it’s this going up nor’ards what’s sticking in my throat’ ses he  the cap’n give a gulp and walked off but he comes back in a minute and ses he—  ’mr salmon i should think it a great pity to lose a valuable officer like yourself even to do good to others there’s a hard ring about that cough i don’t like an’ if you really think it’s going up this bit north why i don’t mind putting the ship in her course again’  well the mate thanked him kindly and he was just about to give the orders when one o’ the men who was at the masthead suddenly shouts out—  ’ahoy small boat on the port bow’  the cap’n started as if he’d been shot and ran up the rigging with his glasses he came down again almost direckly and his face was all in a glow with pleasure and excitement  ’mr salmon’ ses he ’here’s a small boat with a lug sail in the middle o’ the atlantic with one pore man lying in the bottom of her what do you think o’ my warning now’  the mate didn’t say anything at first but he took the glasses and had a look an’ when he came back anyone could see his opinion of the skipper had gone up miles and miles  ’it’s a wonderful thing sir’ ses he ’and one i’ll remember all my life it’s evident that you’ve been picked out as a instrument to do this good work’  i’d never heard the fust mate talk like that afore ’cept once when he fell overboard when he was full and stuck in the thames mud he said it was providence though as it was low water according to the tidetable i couldn’t see what providence had to do with it myself he was as excited as anybody and took the wheel himself and put the ship’s head for the boat and as she came closer our boat was slung out and me and the second mate and three other men dropped into her an’ pulled so as to meet the other  ’never mind the boat we don’t want to be bothered with her’ shouts out the cap’n as we pulled away—’save the man’  i’ll say this for mr mcmillan he steered that boat beautifully and we ran alongside o’ the other as clever as possible two of us shipped our oars and gripped her tight and then we saw that she was just an ordinary boat partly decked in with the head and shoulders of a man showing in the opening fast asleep and snoring like thunder  ’puir chap’ ses mr mcmillan standing up ’look how wasted he is’  he laid hold o’ the man by the neck of his coat an’ his belt an’ being a very powerful man dragged him up and swung him into our boat which was bobbing up and down and grating against the side of the other we let go then an’ the man we’d rescued opened his eyes as mr mcmillan tumbled over one of the thwarts with him and letting off a roar like a bull tried to jump back into his boat  ’hold him’ shouted the second mate ’hold him tight he’s mad puir feller’  by the way that man fought and yelled we thought the mate was right too he was a short stiff chap hard as iron and he bit and kicked and swore for all he was worth until at last we tripped him up and tumbled him into the bottom of the boat and held him there with his head hanging back over a thwart  ’it’s all right my puir feller’ ses the second mate ’ye’re in good hands—ye’re saved’  ’damme’ ses the man ’what’s your little game where’s my boat—eh where’s my boat’  he wriggled a bit and got his head up and when he saw it bowling along two or three hundred yards away his temper got the better of him and he swore that if mr mcmillan didn’t row after it he’d knife him  ’we can’t bother about the boat’ ses the mate ’we’ve had enough bother to rescue you’  ’who the devil wanted you to rescue me’ bellowed the man ’i’ll make you pay for this you miserable swabs if there’s any law in amurrica you shall have it’  by this time we had got to the ship which had shortened sail and the cap’n was standing by the side looking down upon the stranger with a big kind smile which nearly sent him crazy  ’welcome aboard my pore feller’ ses he holding out his hand as the chap got up the side  ’are you the author of this outrage’ ses the man fiercely ’i don’t understand you’ ses the cap’n very dignified and drawing himself up  ’did you send your chaps to sneak me out o’ my boat while i was having forty winks’ roars the other ’damme that’s english ain’t it’  ’surely’ ses the cap’n ’surely you didn’t wish to be left to perish in that little craft i had a supernatural warning to steer this course on purpose to pick you up and this is your gratitude’  ’look here’ ses the other ’my name’s cap’n naskett and i’m doing a record trip from new york to liverpool in the smallest boat that has ever crossed the atlantic an’ you go an’ bust everything with your cussed officiousness if you think i’m going to be kidnapped just to fulfil your beastly warnings you’ve made a mistake i’ll have the law on you that’s what i’ll do kidnapping’s a punishable offence’  ’what did you come here for then’ ses the cap’n  ’come’ howls cap’n naskett ’come a feller sneaks up alongside o’ me with a boatload of streetsweepings dressed as sailors and snaps me up while i’m asleep and you ask me what i come for look here you clap on all sail and catch that boat o’ mine and put me back and i’ll call it quits if you don’t i’ll bring a lawsuit agin you and make you the laughingstock of two continents into the bargain’  well to make the best of a bad bargain the cap’n sailed after the cussed little boat and mr salmon who thought more than enough time had been lost already fell foul o’ cap’n naskett they was both pretty talkers and the way they went on was a education for every sailorman afloat every man aboard got as near as they durst to listen to them but i must say cap’n naskett had the best of it he was a sarkastik man and pretended to think the ship was fitted out just to pick up shipwrecked people an’ he also pretended to think we was castaways what had been saved by it he said o’ course anybody could see at a glance we wasn’t sailormen an’ he supposed mr salmon was a butcher what had been carried out to sea while paddling at margate to strengthen his ankles he said a lot more of this sort of thing and all this time we was chasing his miserable little boat an’ he was admiring the way she sailed while the fust mate was answering his reflexshuns an’ i’m sure that not even our skipper was more pleased than mr salmon when we caught it at last and shoved him back he was ungrateful up to the last an’ just before leaving the ship actually went up to cap’n brown and advised him to shut his eyes an’ turn round three times and catch what he could  i never saw the skipper so upset afore but i heard him tell mr mcmillan that night that if he ever went out of his way again after a craft it would only be to run it down most people keep pretty quiet about supernatural things that happen to them but he was about the quietest i ever heard of an’ what’s more he made everyone else keep quiet about it too even when he had to steer nor’nor’west arter that in the way o’ business he didn’t like it an’ he was about the most cruelly disappointed man you ever saw when he heard afterwards that cap’n naskett got safe to liverpool     after the inquest     it was a still fair evening in late summer in the parish of wapping the hands had long since left and the night watchman having abandoned his trust in favour of a neighbouring bar the wharf was deserted  an elderly seaman came to the gate and paused irresolute then seeing all was quiet stole cautiously on to the jetty and stood for some time gazing curiously down on to the deck of the billyboy psyche lying alongside  with the exception of the mate who since the lamented disappearance of its late master and owner was acting as captain the deck was as deserted as the wharf he was smoking an evening pipe in all the pride of a first command his eye roving fondly from the blunt bows and untidy deck of his craft to her clumsy stern when a slight cough from the man above attracted his attention  how do george said the man on the jetty somewhat sheepishly as the other looked up  the mate opened his mouth and his pipe fell from it and smashed to pieces unnoticed  got much stuff in her this trip continued the man with an obvious attempt to appear at ease  the mate still looking up backed slowly to the other side of the deck but made no reply  what’s the matter man said the other testily you don’t seem overpleased to see me  he leaned over as he spoke and laying hold of the rigging descended to the deck while the mate took his breath in short exhilarating gasps  here i am george said the intruder turned up like a bad penny an’ glad to see your handsome face again i can tell you  in response to this flattering remark george gurgled  why said the other with an uneasy laugh did you think i was dead george ha ha feel that  he fetched the horrified man a thump in the back which stopped even his gurgles  that feel like a dead man asked the smiter raising his hand again feel—  the mate moved back hastily that’ll do said he fiercely ghost or no ghost don’t you hit me like that again  a’ right george said the other as he meditatively felt the stiff grey whiskers which framed his red face what’s the news  the news said george who was of slow habits and speech is that you was found last tuesday week off st katherine’s stairs you was sat on a friday week at the town o’ ramsgate publichouse and buried on monday afternoon at lowestoft  buried gasped the other sat on you’ve been drinking george  an’ a pretty penny your funeral cost i can tell you continued the mate there’s a headstone being made now—’lived lamented and died respected’ i think it is with ’not lost but gone before’ at the bottom  lived respected and died lamented you mean growled the old man well a nice muddle you have made of it between you things always go wrong when i’m not here to look after them  you ain’t dead then said the mate taking no notice of this unreasonable remark where’ve you been all this long time  no more than you’re master o’ this ’ere ship replied mr harbolt grimly i—i’ve been a bit queer in the stomach an’ i took a little drink to correct it foolish like i took the wrong drink and it must have got into my head  that’s the worst of not being used to it said the mate without moving a muscle  the skipper eyed him solemnly but the mate stood firm  arter that continued the skipper still watching him suspiciously i remember no more distinctly until this morning when i found myself sitting on a step down poplar way and shiverin’ with the morning newspaper and a crowd round me  morning newspaper repeated the mystified mate what was that for  decency i was wrapped up in it replied the skipper where i came from or how i got there i don’t know more than adam i s’pose i must have been ill i seem to remember taking something out of a bottle pretty often some old gentleman in the crowd took me into a shop and bought me these clothes an’ here i am my own clo’es and thirty pounds o’ freight money i had in my pocket is all gone  well i’m hearty glad to see you back said the mate it’s quite a homecoming for you too your missis is down aft  my missis what the devil’s she aboard for growled the skipper successfully controlling his natural gratification at the news  she’s been with us these last two trips replied the mate she’s had business to settle in london and she’s been going through your lockers to clear up like  my lockers groaned the skipper good heavens there’s things in them lockers i wouldn’t have her see for the world women are so fussy an’ so fond o’ making something out o’ nothing there’s a pore female touched a bit in the upper storey what’s been writing love letters to me george  three pore females said the precise mate the missis has got all the letters tied up with blue ribbon very far gone they was too poor creeters  george said the skipper in a broken voice i’m a ruined man i’ll never hear the end o’ this i guess i’ll go an’ sleep for’ard this voyage and lie low be keerful you don’t let on i’m aboard an’ after she’s home i’ll take the ship again and let the thing leak out gradual come to life bit by bit so to speak it wouldn’t do to scare her george an’ in the meantime i’ll try an’ think o’ some explanation to tell her you might be thinking too  i’ll do what i can said the mate  crack me up to the old girl all you can tell her i used to write to all sorts o’ people when i got a drop of drink in me say how thoughtful i always was of her you might tell her about that gold locket i bought for her an’ got robbed of  gold locket said the mate in tones of great surprise what gold locket fust i’ve heard of it  any gold locket said the skipper irritably anything you can think of you needn’t be pertikler arter that you can drop little hints about people being buried in mistake for others so as to prepare her a bit—i don’t want to scare her  leave it to me said the mate  i’ll go an’ turn in now i’m dead tired said the skipper i s’pose joe and the boy’s asleep  george nodded and meditatively watched the other as he pushed back the forescuttle and drew it after him as he descended then a thought struck the mate and he ran hastily forward and threw his weight on the scuttle just in time to frustrate the efforts of joe and the boy who were coming on deck to tell him a new ghost story the confusion below was frightful the skipper’s cry of it’s only me joe not possessing the soothing effect which he intended they calmed down at length after their visitor had convinced them that he really was flesh and blood and fists and the boy’s attention being directed to a small rug in the corner of the foc’s’le the skipper took his bunk and was soon fast asleep  he slept so soundly that the noise of the vessel getting under way failed to rouse him and she was well out in the open river when he awoke and after cautiously protruding his head through the scuttle ventured on deck for some time he stood eagerly sniffing the cool sweet air and then after a look round gingerly approached the mate who was at the helm  give me a hold on her said he  you had better get below again if you don’t want the missis to see you said the mate she’s gettin’ up—nasty temper she’s in too  the skipper went forward grumbling send down a good breakfast george said he  to his great discomfort the mate suddenly gave a low whistle and regarded him with a look of blank dismay  good gracious he cried i forgot all about it here’s a pretty kettle of fish—well well  forgot about what asked the skipper uneasily  the crew take their meals in the cabin now replied the mate ’cos the missis says it’s more cheerful for ’em and she’s l’arning ’em to eat their wittles properly  the skipper looked at him aghast you’ll have to smuggle me up some grub he said at length i’m not going to starve for nobody  easier said than done said the mate the missis has got eyes like needles still i’ll do the best i can for you look out here she comes  the skipper fled hastily and safe down below explained to the crew how they were to secrete portions of their breakfast for his benefit the amount of explanation required for so simple a matter was remarkable the crew manifesting a denseness which irritated him almost beyond endurance they promised however to do the best they could for him and returned in triumph after a hearty meal and presented their enraged commander with a few greasy crumbs and the tail of a bloater  for the next two days the wind was against them and they made but little progress mrs harbolt spent most of her time on deck thereby confining her husband to his evilsmelling quarters below matters were not improved for him by his treatment of the crew who resenting his rough treatment of them were doing their best to starve him into civility most of the time he kept in his bunk—or rather jemmy’s bunk—a prey to despondency and hunger of an acute type venturing on deck only at night to prowl uneasily about and bemoan his condition  on the third night mrs harbolt was later in retiring than usual and it was nearly midnight before the skipper who had been indignantly waiting for her to go was able to get on deck and hold counsel with the mate  i’ve done what i could for you said the latter fishing a crust from his pocket which harbolt took thankfully i’ve told her all the yarns i could think of about people turning up after they was buried and the like  what’d she say queried the skipper eagerly between his bites  told me not to talk like that said the mate said it showed a want o’ trust in providence to hint at such things then i told her what you asked me about the locket only i made it a bracelet worth ten pounds  that pleased her suggested the other hopefully  the mate shook his head she said i was a born fool to believe you’d been robbed of it he replied she said what you’d done was to give it to one o’ them pore females she’s been going on frightful about it all the afternoon—won’t talk o’ nothing else  i don’t know what’s to be done groaned the skipper despondently i shall be dead afore we get to port this wind holds go down and get me something to eat george i’m starving  everything’s locked up as i told you afore said the mate  as the master of this ship said the skipper drawing himself up i order you to go down and get me something to eat you can tell the missus it’s for you if she says anything  i’m hanged if i will said the mate sturdily why don’t you go down and have it out with her like a man she can’t eat you  i’m not going to said the other shortly i’m a determined man and when i say a thing i mean it it’s going to be broken to her gradual as i said i don’t want her to be scared poor thing  i know who’d be scared the most murmured the mate  the skipper looked at him fiercely and then sat down wearily on the hatches with his hands between his knees rising after a time to get the dipper and drink copiously from the watercask then replacing it with a sigh he bade the mate a surly goodnight and went below  to his dismay he found when he awoke in the morning that what little wind there was had dropped in the night and the billyboy was just rising and falling lazily on the water in a fashion most objectionable to an empty stomach it was the last straw and he made things so uncomfortable below that the crew were glad to escape on deck where they squatted down in the bows and proceeded to review a situation which was rapidly becoming unbearable  i’ve ’ad enough of it joe grumbled the boy i’m sore all over with sleeping on the floor and the old man’s temper gets wuss and wuss i’m going to be ill  whaffor queried joe dully  you tell the missus i’m down below ill say you think i’m dying responded the infant machiavelli then you’ll see somethink if you keep your eyes open  he went below again not without a little nervousness and clambering into joe’s bunk rolled over on his back and gave a deep groan  what’s the matter with you growled the skipper who was lying in the other bunk staving off the pangs of hunger with a pipe  i’m very ill—dying said jemmy with another groan  you’d better stay in bed and have your breakfast brought down here then said the skipper kindly  i don’t want no breakfast said jem faintly  that’s no reason why you shouldn’t have it sent down you unfeeling little brute said the skipper indignantly you tell joe to bring you down a great plate o’ cold meat and pickles and some coffee that’s what you want  all right sir said jemmy i hope they won’t let the missus come down here in case it’s something catching i wouldn’t like her to be took bad  eh said the skipper in alarm certainly not here you go up and die on deck hurry up with you  i can’t i’m too weak said jemmy  you get up on deck at once d’ye hear me hissed the skipper in alarm  i ccccan’t help it sobbed jemmy who was enjoying the situation amazingly i b’lieve it’s sleeping on the hard floor’s snapped something inside me  if you don’t go i’ll take you said the skipper and he was about to rise to put his threat into execution when a shadow fell across the opening and a voice which thrilled him to the core said softly jemmy  yes ’m said jemmy languidly as the skipper flattened himself in his bunk and drew the clothes over him  how do you feel inquired mrs harbolt  bad all over said jemmy oh don’t come down mum—please don’t  rubbish said mrs harbolt tartly as she came slowly and carefully down backwards what a dark hole this is jemmy no wonder you’re ill put your tongue out  jemmy complied  i can’t see properly here murmured the lady but it looks very large s’pose you go in the other bunk jemmy it’s a good bit higher than this and you’d get more air and be more comfortable altogether  joe wouldn’t like it mum said the boy anxiously the last glimpse he had had of the skipper’s face did not make him yearn to share his bed with him  stuff an’ nonsense said mrs harbolt hotly who’s joe i’d like to know out you come  i can’t move mum said jemmy firmly  nonsense said the lady i’ll just put it straight for you first then in it you go  no don’t mum shouted jemmy now thoroughly alarmed at the success of his plot there there’s a gentleman in that bunk a gentleman we brought from london for a change of sea air  my goodness gracious ejaculated the surprised mrs harbolt i never did why what’s he had to eat  he—he—didn’t want nothing to eat said jemmy with a woeful disregard for facts  what’s the matter with him inquired mrs harbolt eyeing the bunk curiously what’s his name who is he  he’s been lost a long time said jemmy and he’s forgotten who he is—he’s a oldish man with a red face an’ a little white whisker all round it—a very nicelooking man i mean he interposed hurriedly i don’t think he’s quite right in his head ’cos he says he ought to have been buried instead of someone else oh  the last word was almost a scream for mrs harbolt staggering back pinched him convulsively  jemmy she gasped in a trembling voice as she suddenly remembered certain mysterious hints thrown out by the mate who is it  the captain said jemmy and breaking from her clasp slipped from his bed and darted hastily on deck just as the pallid face of his commander broke through the blankets and beamed anxiously on his wife            · · · · · · · ·     five minutes later as the crew gathered aft were curiously     eyeing the foc’s’le mrs harbolt and the skipper came on deck     to the great astonishment of the mate the eyes of the     redoubtable woman were slightly wet and regardless of the     presence of the men she clung fondly to her husband as they     walked slowly to the cabin ere they went below however she     called the grinning jemmy to her and to his private grief and     public shame tucked his head under her arm and kissed him     fondly     in limehouse reach     it was the mate’s affair all through he began by leaving the end of a line dangling over the stern and the propeller though quite unaccustomed to that sort of work wound it up until only a few fathoms remained it then stopped and the mischief was not discovered until the skipper had called the engineer everything that he and the mate and three men and a boy could think of the skipper did the interpreting through the tube which afforded the sole means of communication between the wheel and the engineroom and the indignant engineer did the listening  the gem was just off limehouse at the time and it was evident she was going to stay there the skipper ran her ashore and made her fast to a roomy old schooner which was lying alongside a wharf he was then able to give a little attention to the real offender and the unfortunate mate who had been the most inventive of them all realised to the full the old saying of curses coming home to roost they brought some strangers with them too  i’m going ashore said the skipper at last we won’t get off till next tide now when it’s low water you’ll have to get down and cut the line away a new line too i’m ashamed o’ you harry  i’m not surprised said the engineer who was a vindictive man  what do you mean by that demanded the mate fiercely  we don’t want any of your bad temper interposed the skipper severely nor bad language the men can go ashore and the engineer too provided he keeps steam up but be ready for a start about five you’ll have to mind the ship  he looked over the stern again shook his head sadly and after a visit to the cabin clambered over the schooner’s side and got ashore the men after looking at the propeller and shaking their heads went ashore too and the boy after looking at the propeller and getting ready to shake his caught the mate’s eye and omitted that part of the ceremony from a sudden conviction that it was unhealthy  left alone the mate who was of a sensitive disposition after a curt nod to captain jansell of the schooner aquila who had heard of the disaster and was disposed to be sympathetically inquisitive lit his pipe and began moodily to smoke  when he next looked up the old man had disappeared and a girl in a print dress and a large straw hat sat in a wicker chair reading she was such a pretty girl that the mate forgot his troubles at once and after carefully putting his cap on straight strolled casually up and down the deck  to his mortification the girl seemed unaware of his presence and read steadily occasionally looking up and chirping with a pair of ravishing lips at a blackbird which hung in a wicker cage from the mainmast  that’s a nice bird said the mate leaning against the side and turning a look of great admiration upon it  yes said the girl raising a pair of dark blue eyes to the bold brown ones and taking him in at a glance  does it sing inquired the mate with a show of great interest  it does sometimes when we are alone was the reply  i should have thought the sea air would have affected its throat said the mate reddening are you often in the london river miss i don’t remember seeing your craft before  not often said the girl  you’ve got a fine schooner here said the mate eyeing it critically for my part i prefer a sailer to a steamer  i should think you would said the girl  why inquired the mate tenderly pleased at this show of interest  no propeller said the girl quietly and she left her seat and disappeared below leaving the mate gasping painfully  left to himself he became melancholy as he realised that the great passion of his life had commenced and would probably end within a few hours the engineer came aboard to look at the fires and the steamer being now on the soft mud goodnaturedly went down and assisted him to free the propeller before going ashore again then he was alone once more gazing ruefully at the bare deck of the aquila  it was past two o’clock in the afternoon before any signs of life other than the blackbird appeared there then the girl came on deck again accompanied by a stout woman of middle age and an appearance so affable that the mate commenced at once  fine day he said pleasantly as he brought up in front of them  lovely weather said the mother settling herself in her chair and putting down her work ready for a chat i hope the wind lasts we start tomorrow morning’s tide you’ll get off this afternoon i s’pose  about five o’clock said the mate  i should like to try a steamer for a change said the mother and waxed garrulous on sailing craft generally and her own in particular  there’s five of us down there with my husband and the two boys said she indicating the cabin with her thumb naturally it gets rather stuffy  the mate sighed he was thinking that under some conditions there were worse things than stuffy cabins  and nancy’s so discontented said the mother looking at the girl who was reading quietly by her side she doesn’t like ships or sailors she gets her head turned reading those penny novelettes  you look after your own head said nancy elegantly without looking up  girls in those novels don’t talk to their mothers like that said the elder woman severely  they have different sorts of mothers said nancy serenely turning over a page i hate little pokey ships and sailors smelling of tar i never saw a sailor i liked yet  the mate’s face fell there’s sailors and sailors he suggested humbly  it’s no good talking to her said the mother with a look of fat resignation on her face we can only let her go her own way if you talked to her twentyfour hours right off it wouldn’t do her any good  i’d like to try said the mate plucking up spirit  would you said the girl for the first time raising her head and looking him full in the face impudence  perhaps you haven’t seen many ships said the impressionable mate his eyes devouring her face would you like to come and have a look at our cabin  no thanks said the girl sharply then she smiled maliciously i daresay mother would though she’s fond of poking her nose into other people’s business  the mother regarded her irreverent offspring fixedly for a few moments the mate interposed  i should be very pleased to show you over ma’am he said politely  the mother hesitated then she rose and accepting the mate’s assistance clambered on to the side of the steamer and supported by his arms sprang to the deck and followed him below  very nice she said nodding approvingly as the mate did the honours very nice  it’s nice and roomy for a little craft like ours said the mate as he drew a stone bottle from a locker and poured out a couple of glasses of stout try a little beer ma’am  what you must think o’ that girl o’ mine i can’t think murmured the lady taking a modest draught  the young said the mate who had not quite reached his twentyfifth year are often like that  it spoils her said her mother she’s a goodlooking girl too in her way  i don’t see how she can help being that said the mate  oh get away with you said the lady pleasantly she’ll get fat like me as she gets older  she couldn’t do better said the mate tenderly  nonsense said the lady smiling  you’re as like as two peas persisted the mate i made sure you were sisters when i saw you first  you ain’t the first that’s thought that said the other laughing softly not by a lot  i like to see ladies about said the mate who was trying desperately for a return invitation i wish you could always sit there you quite brighten the cabin up  you’re a flatterer said his visitor as he replenished her glass and showed so little signs of making a move that the mate making a pretext of seeing the engineer hurried up on deck to singe his wings once more  still reading he said softly as he came abreast of the girl all about love i s’pose  have you left my mother down there all by herself inquired the girl abruptly  just a minute said the mate somewhat crestfallen i just came up to see the engineer  well he isn’t here was the discouraging reply  the mate waited a minute or two the girl still reading quietly and then walked back to the cabin the sound of gentle regular breathing reached his ears and stepping softly he saw to his joy that his visitor slept  she’s asleep said he going back and she looks so comfortable i don’t think i’ll wake her  i shouldn’t advise you to said the girl she always wakes up cross  how strange we should run up against each other like this said the mate sentimentally it looks like providence doesn’t it  looks like carelessness said the girl  i don’t care replied the mate i’m glad i did let that line go overboard best day’s work i ever did i shouldn’t have seen you if i hadn’t  and i don’t suppose you’ll ever see me again said the girl comfortably so i don’t see what good you’ve done yourself  i shall run down to limehouse every time we’re in port anyway said the mate it’ll be odd if i don’t see you sometimes i daresay our craft’ll pass each other sometimes perhaps in the night he added gloomily  i shall sit up all night watching for you declared miss jansell untruthfully  in this cheerful fashion the conversation proceeded the girl who was by no means insensible to his bright eager face and wellknit figure dividing her time in the ratio of three parts to her book and one to him time passed all too soon for the mate when they were interrupted by a series of hoarse unintelligible roars proceeding from the schooner’s cabin  that’s father said miss jansell rising with a celerity which spoke well for the discipline maintained on the aquila he wants me to mend his waistcoat for him  she put down her book and left the mate watching her until she disappeared down the companionway then he sat down and waited  one by one the crew returned to the steamer but the schooner’s deck showed no signs of life then the skipper came and having peered critically over his vessel’s side gave orders to get under way  if she’d only come up said the miserable mate to himself i’d risk it and ask whether i might write to her  this chance of imperilling a promising career did not occur however the steamer slowly edged away from the schooner and picking her way between a tier of lighters steamed slowly into clearer water  full speed ahead roared the skipper down the tube the engineer responded and the mate gazed in a melancholy fashion at the water as it rapidly widened between the two vessels then his face brightened up suddenly as the girl ran up on deck and waved her hand hardly able to believe his eyes he waved his back the girl gesticulated violently now pointing to the steamer and then to the schooner  by jove that girl’s taken a fancy to you said the skipper she wants you to go back  the mate sighed seems like it he said modestly  to his astonishment the girl was now joined by her men folk who also waved hearty farewells and throwing their arms about shouted incoherently  blamed if they haven’t all took a fancy to you said the puzzled skipper the old man’s got the speakingtrumpet now what does he say  something about life i think said the mate  they’re more like jumpingjacks than anything else said the skipper just look at ’em  the mate looked and as the distance increased sprang on to the side and his eyes dim with emotion waved tender farewells if it had not been for the presence of the skipper—a tremendous stickler for decorum—he would have kissed his hand  it was not until gravesend was passed and the sidelights of the shipping were trying to show in the gathering dusk that he awoke from his tender apathy it is probable that it would have lasted longer than that but for a sudden wail of anguish and terror which proceeded from the cabin and rang out on the still warm air  sakes alive said the skipper starting what’s that  before the mate could reply the companion was pushed back and a middleaged woman labouring under strong excitement appeared on deck  you villain she screamed excitably rushing up to the mate take me back take me back  what’s all this harry demanded the skipper sternly  he—he—he—asked me to go into the cab—cabin sobbed mrs jansell and sent me to sleep and too—too—took me away my husband’ll kill me i know he will take me back  what do you want to be took back to be killed for interposed one of the men judicially  i might ha’ known what he meant when he said i brightened the cabin up said mrs jansell and when he said he thought me and my daughter were sisters he said he’d like me to sit there always the wretch  did you say that inquired the skipper fiercely  well i did said the miserable mate but i didn’t mean her to take it that way she went to sleep and i forgot all about her  what did you say such silly lies for then demanded the skipper  the mate hung his head  old enough to be your mother too said the skipper severely here’s a nice thing to happen aboard my ship and afore the boy too  blast the boy said the goaded mate  take me back wailed mrs jansell you don’t know how jealous my husband is  he won’t hurt you said the skipper kindly he won’t be jealous of a woman your time o’ life that is not if he’s got any sense you’ll have to go as far as boston with us now i’ve lost too much time already to go back  you must take me back said mrs jansell passionately  i’m not going back for anybody said the skipper but you can make your mind quite easy you’re as safe aboard my ship as what you would be alone on a raft in the middle of the atlantic and as for the mate he was only chaffing you wasn’t you harry  the mate made some reply but neither mrs jansell the skipper nor the men who were all listening eagerly caught it and his unfortunate victim accepting the inevitable walked to the side of the ship and gazed disconsolately astern  it was not until the following morning that the mate who had received orders to mess for’ard saw her and ignoring the fact that everybody suspended work to listen walked up and bade her good morning  harry said the skipper warningly  all right said the mate shortly i want to speak to you very particularly he said nervously and led his listener aft followed by three of the crew who came to clean the brasswork and who listened mutinously when they were ordered to defer unwonted industry to a more fitting time the deck clear the mate began and in a long rambling statement which mrs jansell at first thought the ravings of lunacy acquainted her with the real state of his feelings  i never did said she when he had finished never why you hadn’t seen her before yesterday  of course i shall take you back by train said the mate and tell your husband how sorry i am  i might have suspected something when you said all those nice things to me said the mollified lady well you must take your chance like all the rest of them she can only say ’no’ again it’ll explain this affair better that’s one thing but i expect they’ll laugh at you  i don’t care said the mate stoutly you’re on my side ain’t you  mrs jansell laughed and the mate having succeeded beyond his hopes in the establishment of amicable relations went about his duties with a light heart  by the time they reached boston the morning was far advanced and after the gem was comfortably berthed he obtained permission of the skipper to accompany the fair passenger to london beguiling the long railway journey by every means in his power despite his efforts however the journey began to pall upon his companion and it was not until evening was well advanced that they found themselves in the narrow streets of limehouse  we’ll see how the land lies first said he as they approached the wharf and made their way cautiously on to the quay  the aquila was still alongside and the mate’s heart thumped violently as he saw the cause of all the trouble sitting alone on the deck she rose with a little start as her mother stepped carefully aboard and running to her kissed her affectionately and sat her down on the hatches  poor mother she said caressingly what did you bring that lunatic back with you for  he would come said mrs jansell hush here comes your father  the master of the aquila came on deck as she spoke and walking slowly up to the group stood sternly regarding them under his gaze the mate breathlessly reeled off his tale noticing with somewhat mixed feelings the widening grin of his listener as he proceeded  well you’re a lively sort o’ man said the skipper as he finished in one day you tie up your own ship run off with my wife and lose us a tide are you always like that  i want somebody to look after me i s’pose said the mate with a side glance at nancy  well we’d put you up for the night said the skipper with his arm round his wife’s shoulders but you’re such a chap i’m afraid you’d burn the ship down or something what do you think old girl  i think we’ll try him this once said his wife and now i’ll go down and see about supper i want it  the old couple went below and the young one remained on deck nancy went and leaned against the side and as she appeared to have quite forgotten his presence the mate after some hesitation joined her  hadn’t you better go down and get some supper she asked  i’d sooner stay here if yon don’t mind said the mate i like watching the lights going up and down i could stay here for hours  i’ll leave you then said the girl i’m hungry  she tripped lightly off with a smothered laugh leaving the fairlytrapped man gazing indignantly at the lights which had lured him to destruction  from below he heard the cheerful clatter of crockery accompanied by a savoury incense and talk and laughter he imagined the girl making fun of his sentimental reasons for staying on deck but too proud to meet her ironical glances stayed doggedly where he was resolving to be off by the first train in the morning he was roused from his gloom by a slight touch on his arm and turning sharply saw the girl by his side  supper’s quite ready said she soberly and if you want to admire the lights very much come up and see them when i do—after supper     an elaborate elopement     i have always had a slight suspicion that the following narrative is not quite true it was related to me by an old seaman who among other incidents of a somewhat adventurous career claimed to have received napoleon’s sword at the battle of trafalgar and a wound in the back at waterloo i prefer to tell it in my own way his being so garnished with nautical terms and expletives as to be half unintelligible and somewhat horrifying our talk had been of love and courtship and after making me a present of several tips invented by himself and considered invaluable by his friends he related this story of the courtship of a chum of his as illustrating the great lengths to which young bloods were prepared to go in his days to attain their ends  it was a fine clear day in june when hezekiah lewis captain and part owner of the schooner thames bound from london to aberdeen anchored off the little outoftheway town of orford in suffolk among other antiquities the town possessed hezekiah’s widowed mother and when there was no very great hurry—the world went slower in those days—the dutiful son used to go ashore in the ship’s boat and after a filial tap at his mother’s window which often startled the old woman considerably pass on his way to see a young lady to whom he had already proposed five times without effect  the mate and crew of the schooner seven all told drew up in a little knot as the skipper in his shoregoing clothes appeared on deck and regarded him with an air of grinning mysterious interest  now you all know what you have got to do queried the skipper  ay ay replied the crew grinning still more deeply  hezekiah regarded them closely and then ordering the boat to be lowered scrambled over the side and was pulled swiftly towards the shore  a sharp scream and a breathless lawkamussy me as he tapped at his mother’s window assured him that the old lady was alive and well and he continued on his way until he brought up at a small but pretty house in the next road  morning mr rumbolt said he heartily to a stout redfaced man who sat smoking in the doorway  morning cap’n morning said the redfaced man  is the rheumatism any better inquired hezekiah anxiously as he grasped the other’s huge hand  so so said the other but it ain’t the rheumatism so much what troubles me he resumed lowering his voice and looking round cautiously it’s kate  what said the skipper  you’ve heard of a man being henpecked continued mr rumbolt in tones of husky confidence  the captain nodded  i’m chickpecked murmured the other  what inquired the astonished mariner again  chickpecked repeated mr rumbolt firmly chikpeked d’ye understand me  the captain said that he did and stood silent awhile with the air of a man who wants to say something but is half afraid to at last with a desperate appearance of resolution he bent down to the old man’s ear  that’s the deaf ’un said mr rumbolt promptly  hezekiah changed ears speaking at first slowly and awkwardly but becoming more fluent as he warmed with his subject while the expression of his listener’s face gradually changed from incredulous bewilderment to one of uncontrollable mirth he became so uproarious that he was fain to push the captain away from him and lean back in his chair and choke and laugh until he nearly lost his breath at which crisis a remarkably pretty girl appeared from the back of the house and patted him with hearty good will  that’ll do my dear said the choking mr rumbolt here’s captain lewis  i can see him said his daughter calmly what’s he standing on one leg for  the skipper who really was standing in a somewhat constrained attitude coloured violently and planted both feet firmly on the ground  being as i was passing close in miss rumbolt said he and coming ashore to see mother—  to the captain’s discomfort manifestations of a further attack on the part of mr rumbolt appeared but were promptly quelled by the daughter  mother she repeated encouragingly  i thought i’d come on and ask you just to pay a sort o’ flying visit to the thames thank you i’m comfortable enough where i am said the girl  i’ve got a couple of monkeys and a bear aboard which i ’m taking to a menagerie in aberdeen continued the captain and the thought struck me you might possibly like to see ’em well i don’t know said the damsel in a flutter is it a big bear  have you ever seen an elephant inquired hezekiah cautiously  only in pictures replied the girl  well it’s as big as that nearly said he  the temptation was irresistible and miss rumbolt telling her father that she should not be long disappeared into the house in search of her hat and jacket and ten minutes later the brawny rowers were gazing their fill into her deep blue eyes as she sat in the stern of the boat and told lewis to behave himself  it was but a short pull out to the schooner and miss rumbolt was soon on the deck lavishing endearments on the monkey and energetically prodding the bear with a handspike to make him growl the noise of the offended animal as he strove to get through the bars of his cage was terrific and the girl was in the full enjoyment of it when she became aware of a louder noise still and turning round saw the seamen at the windlass  why what are they doing she demanded getting up anchor  ahoy there shouted hezekiah sternly what are you doing with that windlass  as he spoke the anchor peeped over the edge of the bows and one of the seamen running past them took the helm  now then shouted the fellow stand by look lively there with them sails  obeying a light touch of the helm the schooner’s bowsprit slowly swung round from the land and the crew hauling lustily on the ropes began to hoist the sails  what the devil are you up to thundered the skipper have you all gone mad what does it all mean  it means said one of the seamen whose fat amiable face was marred by a fearful scowl that we’ve got a new skipper  good heavens a mutiny exclaimed the skipper starting melodramatically against the cage and starting hastily away again where’s the mate  he’s with us said another seaman brandishing his sheath knife and scowling fearfully he’s our new captain  in confirmation of this the mate now appeared from below with an axe in his hand and approaching his captain roughly ordered him below  i’ll defend this lady with my life cried hezekiah taking the handspike from kate and raising it above his head  nobody’ll hurt a hair of her beautiful head said the mate with a tender smile  then i yield said the skipper drawing himself up and delivering the handspike with the air of a defeated admiral tendering his sword  good said the mate briefly as one of the men took it  what demanded miss rumbolt excitedly aren’t you going to fight them here give me the handspike  before the mate could interfere the sailor with thoughtless obedience handed it over and miss rumbolt at once tried to knock him over the head being thwarted in this design by the man taking flight she lost her temper entirely and bore down like a hurricane on the remaining members of the crew who were just approaching  they scattered at once and ran up the rigging like cats and for a few moments the girl held the deck then the mate crept up behind her and with the air of a man whose job exactly suited him clasped her tightly round the waist while one of the seamen disarmed her  you must both go below till we’ve settled what to do with you said the mate reluctantly releasing her  with a wistful glance at the handspike the girl walked to the cabin followed slowly by the skipper  this is a bad business said the latter shaking his head solemnly as the indignant miss rumbolt seated herself  don’t talk to me you coward said the girl energetically  the skipper started  i made three of ’em run said miss rumbolt and you did nothing you just stood still and let them take the ship i’m ashamed of you  the skipper’s defence was interrupted by a hoarse voice shouting to them to come on deck where they found the mutinous crew gathered aft round the mate the girl cast a look at the shore which was now dim and indistinct and turned somewhat pale as the serious nature of her position forced itself upon her  lewis said the mate  well growled the skipper  this ship’s going in the lace and brandy trade and if so be as you’re sensible you can go with it as mate d’ye hear  an’ s’pose i do what about the lady inquired the captain  you and the lady’ll have to get spliced said the mate sternly then there’ll be no tales told a scotch marriage is as good as any and we’ll just lay off and put you ashore and you can get tied up as right as ninepence  marry a coward like that demanded miss rumbolt with spirit not if i know it why i’d sooner marry that old man at the helm  old bill’s got three wives a’ready to my sartin knowledge spoke up one of the sailors the lady’s got to marry cap’n lewis so don’t let’s have no fuss about it  i won’t said the lady stamping violently  the mutineers appeared to be in a dilemma and following the example of the mate scratched their heads thoughtfully  we thought you liked him said the mate at last feebly  you had no business to think said miss rumbolt you are bad men and you’ll all be hung every one of you i shall come and see it the cap’n’s welcome to her for me murmured the helmsman in a husky whisper to the man next to him the vixen  very good said the mate if you won’t you won’t this end of the ship’ll belong to you after eight o’clock of a night lewis you must go for’ard with the men  and what are you going to do with me after inquired the fair prisoner  the seven men shrugged their shoulders helplessly and hezekiah looking depressed lit his pipe and went and leaned over the side  the day passed quietly the orders were given by the mate and hezekiah lounged moodily about a prisoner at large at eight o’clock miss rumbolt was given the key of the stateroom and the men who were not in the watch went below  the morning broke fine and clear with a light breeze which towards midday dropped entirely and the schooner lay rocking lazily on a sea of glassy smoothness the sun beat fiercely down bringing the fresh paint on the taffrail up in blisters and sorely trying the tempers of the men who were doing odd jobs on deck  the cabin where the two victims of a mutinous crew had retired for coolness got more and more stuffy until at length even the scorching deck seemed preferable and the girl with a faint hope of finding a shady corner went languidly up the companionladder  for some time the skipper sat alone pondering gloomily over the state of affairs as he smoked his short pipe he was aroused at length from his apathy by the sound of the companion being noisily closed while loud frightened cries and hurrying footsteps on deck announced that something extraordinary was happening as he rose to his feet he was confronted by kate rumbolt who panting and excited waved a big key before him  i’ve done it she cried her eyes sparkling  done what shouted the mystified skipper  let the bear loose said the girl ha ha you should have seen them run you should have seen the fat sailor  let the—phew—let the— good heavens here’s a pretty kettle of fish he choked  listen to them shouting cried the exultant kate clapping her hands just listen  those shouts are from aloft said hezekiah sternly where you and i ought to be  i’ve closed the companion said the girl reassuringly  closed the companion repeated hezekiah as he drew his knife he can smash it like cardboard if the fit takes him go in here  he opened the door of his stateroom  shan’t said miss rumbolt politely  go in at once cried the skipper quick with you  sha— began miss rumbolt again then she caught his eye and went in like a lamb you come too she said prettily  i’ve got to look after my ship and my men said the skipper i suppose you thought the ship would steer itself didn’t you  mutineers deserve to be eaten whimpered miss rumbolt piously somewhat taken aback by the skipper’s demeanour  hezekiah looked at her  they’re not mutineers kate he said quietly it was just a piece of mad folly of mine they’re as honest a set of old sea dogs as ever breathed and i only hope they are all safe up aloft i’m going to lock you in but don’t be frightened it shan’t hurt you  he slammed the door on her protests and locked it and slipping the key of the cage in his pocket took a firm grip of his knife and running up the steps gained the deck then his breath came more freely for the mate who was standing a little way up the fore rigging after tempting the bear with his foot had succeeded in dropping a noose over its head the brute made a furious attempt to extricate itself but the men hurried down with other lines and in a short space of time the bear presented much the same appearance as the lion in aesop’s fables and was dragged and pushed a heated and indignant mass of fur back to its cage  having locked up one prisoner the skipper went below and released the other who passed quickly from a somewhat hysterical condition to one of such haughty disdain that the captain was thoroughly cowed and stood humbly aside to let her pass  the fat seaman was standing in front of the cage as she reached it and regarding the bear with much satisfaction until kate sidled up to him and begged him as a personal favour to go in the cage and undo it  undo it why he’d kill me gasped the fat seaman aghast at such simplicity  i don’t think he would said his tormenter with a bewitching smile and i’ll wear a lock of your hair all my life if you do but you’d better give it to me before you go in  i ain’t going in said the fat sailor shortly  not for me queried kate archly  not for fifty like you replied the old man firmly he nearly had me when he was loose i can’t think how he got out  why i let him out said miss rumbolt airily just for a little run how would you like to be shut up all day  the sailor was just going to tell her with more fluency than politeness when he was interrupted that’ll do said the skipper who had come behind them go for’ard you there’s been enough of this fooling the lady thought you had taken the ship thompson i’ll take the helm there’s a little wind coming stand by there  he walked aft and relieved the steersman awkwardly conscious that the men were becoming more and more interested in the situation and also that kate could hear some of their remarks as he pondered over the subject and tried to think of a way out of it the cause of all the trouble came and stood by him  did my father know of this she inquired  i don’t know that he did exactly said the skipper uneasily i just told him not to expect you back that night  and what did he say said she  said he wouldn’t sit up said the skipper grinning despite himself  kate drew a breath the length of which boded no good to her parent and looked over the side  i was afraid of that traveller chap from ipswich said hezekiah after a pause your father told me he was hanging round you again so i thought i—well i was a blamed fool anyway  see how ridiculous you have made me look before all these men said the girl angrily  they’ve been with me for years said hezekiah apologetically and the mate said it was a magnificent idea he quite raved about it he did i wouldn’t have done it with some crews but we’ve had some dirty times together and they’ve stood by me well but of course that’s nothing to do with you it’s been an adventure i’m very sorry for very  a pretty safe adventure for you said the girl scornfully you didn’t risk much look here i like brave men if you go in the cage and undo that bear i’ll marry you that’s what i call an adventure  smith called the skipper quietly come and take the helm a bit  the seaman obeyed and lewis accompanied by the girl walked forward  at the bear’s cage he stopped and fumbling in his pocket for the key steadily regarded the brute as it lay gnashing its teeth and trying in vain to bite the ropes which bound it  you’re afraid said the girl tauntingly you’re quite white  the captain made no reply but eyed her so steadily that her gaze fell he drew the key from his pocket and inserted it in the huge lock and was just turning it when a soft arm was drawn through his and a soft voice murmured sweetly in his ear never mind about the old bear  and he did not mind  the cook of the gannet      all ready for sea and no cook said the mate of the schooner     gannet gloomily what’s become of all the cooks i can’t     think  they most on ’em ship as mates now said the skipper grinning but you needn’t worry about that i’ve got one coming aboard tonight i’m trying a new experiment george  i once knew a chemist who tried one said george an’ it blew him out of the winder but i never heard o’ shipmasters trying ’em  there’s all kinds of experiments rejoined the other what do you say to a lady cook george  a what asked the mate in tones of strong amazement what aboard a schooner  why not inquired the skipper warmly why not there’s plenty of ’em ashore—why not aboard ship  ’tain’t proper for one thing said the mate virtuously  i shouldn’t have expected you to have thought o’ that said the other unkindly besides they have stewardesses on big ships an’ what’s the difference she’s a sort o’ relation o’ mine too—cousin o’ my wife’s a widder woman and a good sensible age an’ as the doctor told her to take a sea voyage for the benefit of her ’elth she’s coming with me for six months as cook she’ll take her meals with us but o’ course the men are not to know of the relationship  what about sleeping accommodation inquired the mate with the air of a man putting a poser  i’ve thought o’ that replied the other it’s all arranged  the mate with an uncompromising air waited for information  she—she’s to have your berth george continued the skipper without looking at him you can have that nice large airy locker  one what the biscuit and onions kep’ in inquired george  the skipper nodded  i think if it’s all the same to you said the mate with laboured politeness i’ll wait till the butter keg’s empty and crowd into that  it’s no use your making yourself unpleasant about it said the skipper not a bit the arrangements are made now and here she comes  following his gaze the mate looked up as a stout comelylooking woman of middle age came along the jetty followed by the watchman staggering under a box of enormous proportions  jim cried the lady  halloa cried the skipper starting uneasily at the title we’ve been expecting you for some time  there’s a row on with the cabman said the lady calmly this silly old man—the watchman snorted fiercely—let the box go through the window getting it off the top and the cabman wants me to pay he’s out there using language and he keeps calling me grandma—i want you to have him locked up  come down below now said the skipper we’ll see about the cab mrs blossom—my mate george go and send that cab away  mrs blossom briefly acknowledging the introduction followed the skipper to the cabin while the mate growling under his breath went out to enter into a verbal contest in which he was from the first hopelessly overmatched  the new cook being somewhat fatigued with her journey withdrew at an early hour and the sun was well up when she appeared on deck next morning the wharves and warehouses of the night before had disappeared and the schooner under a fine spread of canvas was just passing tilbury  there’s one thing i must put a stop to said the skipper as he and the mate after an admirablycooked breakfast stood together talking the men seem to be hanging round that galley too much  what can you expect demanded the mate they’ve all got their sunday clothes on too pretty dears  hi you bill cried the skipper what are you doing there  lending cook a hand with the saucepans sir said bill an oakumbearded man of sixty  there ain’t no call for ’im to come ’ere at all sir shouted another seaman putting his head out of the galley me an’ cook’s lifting ’em beautiful  come out both of you or i’ll start you with a rope roared the irritated commander  what’s the matter inquired mrs blossom they’re not doing any harm  i can’t have ’em there said the skipper gruffly they’ve got other things to do  i must have some assistance with that boiler and the saucepans said mrs blossom decidedly so don’t you interfere with what don’t concern you jimmy  that’s mutiny whispered the horrified mate sheer rank mutiny  she don’t know no better whispered the other back cook you mustn’t talk like that to the cap’n—what me and the mate tell you you must do you don’t understand yet but it’ll come easier byandbye  will it demanded mrs blossom loudly will it i don’t think it will how dare you talk to me like that jim harris you ought to be ashamed of yourself  my name’s cap’n harris said the skipper stiffly  well captain harris said mrs blossom scornfully and what’ll happen if i don’t do as you and that other shamefacedlooking man tell me  we hope it won’t come to that said harris with quiet dignity as he paused at the companion but the mate’s in charge just now and i warn you he’s a very severe man don’t stand no nonsense george  with these brave words the skipper disappeared below and the mate after one glance at the dauntless and imposing attitude of mrs blossom walked to the side and became engrossed in a passing steamer a hum of wondering admiration arose from the crew and the cook thoroughly satisfied with her victory returned to the scene of her labours  for the next twentyfour hours mrs blossom reigned supreme and performed the cooking for the vessel assisted by five ministering seamen the weather was fine and the wind light and the two officers were at their wits’ end to find jobs for the men  why don’t you put your foot down grumbled the mate as a burst of happy laughter came from the direction of the galley the idea of men laughing like that aboard ship they’re carrying on just as though we wasn’t here  will you stand by me demanded the skipper pale but determined  of course i will said the other indignantly  now my lads said harris stepping forward i can’t have you chaps hanging round the galley all day you’re getting in cook’s way and hindering her just get your knives out i’ll have the masts scraped  you just stay where you are said mrs blossom when they’re in my way i’ll soon let ’em know  did you hear what i said thundered the skipper as the men hesitated  aye aye sir muttered the crew moving off  how dare you interfere with me said mrs blossom hotly as she realised the defeat ever since i’ve been on this ship you’ve been trying to aggravate me i wonder the men don’t hit you you nasty gingerwhiskered little man  go on with your work said the skipper fondly stroking the maligned whiskers  don’t you talk to me jim harris said mrs blossom quivering with wrath don’t you give me none of your airs who borrowed five pounds from my poor dead husband just before he died and never paid it back  go on with your work repeated the skipper with pale lips  whose uncle benjamin had three weeks demanded mrs blossom darkly whose uncle joseph had to go abroad without stopping to pack up  the skipper made no reply but the anxiety of the crew to have these vital problems solved was so manifest that he turned his back on the virago and went towards the mate who at that moment dipped hurriedly to escape a wet dishclout the two men regarded each other pale with anxiety  now you just move off said mrs blossom shaking another clout at them i won’t have you hanging about my galley keep to your own end of the ship  the skipper drew himself up haughtily but the effect was somewhat marred by one eye which dwelt persistently on the clout and after a short inward struggle he moved off accompanied by the mate wellington himself would have been nonplussed by a wet cloth in the hands of a fearless woman  she’ll just have to have her own way till we get to llanelly said the indignant skipper and then i’ll send her home by train and ship another cook i knew she’d got a temper but i didn’t know it was like this she’s the last woman that sets foot on my ship—that’s all she’s done for her sex  in happy ignorance of her impending doom mrs blossom went blithely about her duties assisted by a crew whose admiration for her increased by leaps and bounds and the only thing which ventured to interfere with her was a stiff atlantic roll which they encountered upon rounding the land’s end  the first intimation mrs blossom had of it was the falling of small utensils in the galley after she had picked them up and replaced them several times she went out to investigate and discovered that the schooner was dipping her bows to big green waves and rolling with much straining and creaking from side to side a fine spray which broke over the bows and flew over the vessel drove her back into the galley which had suddenly developed an unaccountable stuffiness but though the crew to a man advised her to lie down and have a cup of tea she repelled them with scorn and with pale face and compressed lips stuck to her post  two days later they made fast to the quay at llanelly and halfanhour later the skipper called the mate down to the cabin and handing him some money told him to pay the cook off and ship another the mate declined  you obey orders said the skipper fiercely else you an’ me’ll quarrel  i’ve got a wife an’ family urged the mate  pooh said the skipper rubbish  and uncles added the mate rebelliously  very good said the skipper glaring we’ll ship the other cook first and let him settle it after all i don’t see why we should fight his battles for him  the mate being agreeable went off at once and when mrs blossom after a little shopping ashore returned to the gannet she found the galley in the possession of one of the fattest cooks that ever broke ship’s biscuit  hullo said she realising the situation at a glance what are you doing here  cooking said the other gruffly then catching sight of his questioner he smiled amorously and winked at her  don’t you wink at me said mrs blossom wrathfully come out of that galley  there’s room for both said the new cook persuasively come in an’ put your ’ed on my shoulder  utterly unprepared for this mode of attack mrs blossom lost her nerve and instead of storming the galley as she had fully intended drew back and retired to the cabin where she found a short note from the skipper enclosing her pay and requesting her to take the train home after reading this she went ashore again returning presently with a big bundle which she placed on the cabin table in front of harris and the mate who had just begun tea  i’m not going home by train said she opening the bundle which contained a spirit kettle and provisions i’m going back with you but i am not going to be beholden to you for anything—i ’m going to board myself  after this declaration she made herself tea and sat down the meal proceeded in silence though occasionally she astonished her companions by little mysterious laughs which caused them slight uneasiness as she made no hostile demonstration however they became reassured and congratulated themselves upon the success of their manoeuvre  how long shall we be getting back to london do you think inquired mrs blossom at last  we shall probably sail tuesday night and it may be anything from six days upwards answered the skipper if this wind holds it’ll probably be upwards  to his great concern mrs blossom put her handkerchief over her face and shaking with suppressed laughter rose from the table and left the cabin  the couple left eyed each other wonderingly  did i say anything pertickler funny george inquired the skipper after some deliberation  didn’t strike me so said the mate carelessly i expect she’s thought o’ something else to say about your family she wouldn’t be so goodtempered as all that for nothing i feel cur’ous to know what it is  if you paid more attention to your own business said the skipper his choler rising you’d get on better a mate who was a good seaman wouldn’t ha’ let a cook go on like this—it’s not discipline  he went off in dudgeon and a coolness sprang up between them which lasted until the bustle of starting in the small hours of wednesday morning  once under way the day passed uneventfully the schooner crawling sluggishly down the coast of wales and when the skipper turned in that night it was with the pleasant conviction that mrs blossom had shot her last bolt and like a sensible woman was going to accept her defeat from this pleasing idea he was aroused suddenly by the watch stamping heavily on the deck overhead  what’s up cried the skipper darting up the companionladder jostled by the mate  i dunno said bill who was at the wheel shakily mrs blossom come up on deck a little while ago and since then there’s been three or four heavy splashes  she can’t have gone overboard said the skipper in tones to which he manfully strove to impart a semblance of anxiety no here she is anything wrong mrs blossom  not so far as i’m concerned replied the lady passing him and going below  you’ve been dreaming bill said the skipper sharply  i ain’t said bill stoutly i tell you i heard splashes it’s my belief she coaxed the cook up on deck and then shoved him overboard a woman could do anything with a man like that cook  i’ll soon see said the mate and walking forward he put his head down the forescuttle and yelled for the cook  aye aye sir answered a voice sleepily while the other men started up in their bunks do you want me  bill thinks somebody has gone overboard said the mate are you all here  in answer to this the mystified men turned out all standing and came on deck yawning and rubbing their eyes while the mate explained the situation before he had finished the cook suddenly darted off to the galley and the next moment the forlorn cry of a bereaved soul broke on their startled ears  what is it cried the mate  come here shouted the cook look at this  he struck a match and held it aloft in his shaking fingers and the men who were worked up to a great pitch of excitement and expected to see something ghastly after staring hard for some time in vain profanely requested him to be more explicit  she’s thrown all the saucepans and things overboard said the cook with desperate calmness this lid of a tea kettle is all that’s left for me to do the cooking in  the gannet manned by seven faminestricken misogynists reached london six days later the skipper obstinately refusing to put in at an intermediate port to replenish his stock of hardware the most he would consent to do was to try and borrow from a passing vessel but the unseemly behaviour of the master of a brig who lost two hours owing to their efforts to obtain a saucepan of him utterly discouraged any further attempts in that direction and they settled down to a diet of biscuits and water and salt beef scorched on the stove  mrs blossom unwilling perhaps to witness their sufferings remained below and when they reached london only consented to land under the supervision of a guard of honour composed of all the ablebodied men on the wharf     a benefit performance     in the small front parlour of no 3 mermaid passage sunset bay jackson pepper expilot sat in a state of indignant collapse tenderly feeling a cheek on which the print of hasty fingers still lingered  the room which was in excellent order showed no signs of the tornado which had passed through it and jackson pepper looking vaguely round was dimly reminded of those tropical hurricanes he had read about which would strike only the objects in the path and leave all others undisturbed  in this instance he had been the object and the tornado after obliterating him had passed up the small staircase which led from the room leaving him listening anxiously to its distant mutterings  to his great discomfort the storm showed signs of coming up again and he had barely time to effect an appearance of easy unconcern which accorded but ill with the flush aforementioned when a big redfaced woman came heavily downstairs and burst into the room  you have made me ill again she said severely and now i hope you are satisfied with your work you’ll kill me before you have done with me  the expilot shifted on his chair  you’re not fit to have a wife continued mrs pepper aggravating them and upsetting them any other woman would have left you long ago  we’ve only been married three months pepper reminded her  don’t talk to me said his wife it seems more like a lifetime  it seems a long time to me said the expilot plucking up a little courage  that’s right said his wife striding over to where he sat say you’re tired of me say you wish you hadn’t married me you coward ah if my poor first husband was only alive and sitting in that chair now instead of you how happy i would be  if he likes to come and take it he’s welcome said pepper it’s my chair and it was my father’s before me but there’s no man living i would sooner give it to than your first ah he knew what he was about when the dolphin went down he did i don’t blame him though  what do you mean demanded his wife  it’s my belief that he didn’t go down with her said pepper crossing over to the staircase and standing with his hand on the door  didn’t go down with her repeated his wife scornfully what became of him then where’s he been this thirty years  in hiding said pepper spitefully and passed hastily upstairs  the room above was charged with memories of the late lamented his portrait in oils hung above the mantelpiece smaller portraits—specimens of the photographer’s want of art—were scattered about the room while various personal effects including a mammoth pair of seaboots stood in a corner on all these articles the eye of jackson pepper dwelt with an air of chastened regret  it ’ud be a rum go if he did turn up after all he said to himself softly as he sat on the edge of the bed i’ve heard of such things in books i dessay she’d be disappointed if she did see him now thirty years makes a bit of difference in a man  jackson cried his wife from below i’m going out if you want any dinner you can get it if not you can go without it  the front door slammed violently and jackson advancing cautiously to the window saw the form of his wife sailing majestically up the passage then he sat down again and resumed his meditations  if it wasn’t for leaving all my property i’d go he said gloomily there’s not a bit of comfort in the place nag nag nag from morn till night ah cap’n budd you let me in for a nice thing when you went down with that boat of yours come back and fill them boots again they’re too big for me  he rose suddenly and stood gaping in the centre of the room as a mad hazy idea began to form in his brain his eyes blinked and his face grew white with excitement he pushed open the little lattice window and sat looking abstractedly up the passage on to the bay beyond then he put on his hat and deep in thought went out  he was still thinking deeply as he boarded the train for london next morning and watched sunset bay from the window until it disappeared round the curve so many and various were the changes that flitted over his face that an old lady whose seat he had taken gave up her intention of apprising him of the fact and indulged instead in a bitter conversation with her daughter of which the erring pepper was the unconscious object  in the same preoccupied fashion he got on a bayswater omnibus and waited patiently for it to reach poplar strange changes in the landscape not to be accounted for by the mere lapse of time led to explanations and the conductor—a humane man who said he had got an idiot boy at home—personally laid down the lines of his tour two hours later he stood in front of a small house painted in many colours and ringing the bell inquired for cap’n crippen  in response to his inquiry a big man with light blue eyes and a long grey beard appeared and recognising his visitor with a grunt of surprise drew him heartily into the passage and thrust him into the parlour he then shook hands with him and clapping him on the back bawled lustily for the small boy who had opened the door  pot o’ stout bottle o’ gin and two long pipes said he as the boy came to the door and eyed the expilot curiously  at all these honest preparations for his welcome the heart of jackson grew faint within him  well i call it good of you to come all this way to see me said the captain after the boy had disappeared but you always was warmhearted pepper and how’s the missis  shocking said pepper with a groan  ill inquired the captain  illtempered said pepper in fact cap’n i don’t mind telling you she’s killing me—slowly killing me  pooh said crippen nonsense you don’t know how to manage her  i thought perhaps you could advise me said the artful pepper i said to myself yesterday ’pepper go and see cap’n crippen what he don’t know about wimmen and their management ain’t worth knowing if there’s anybody can get you out of a hole it’s him he’s got the power and what’s more he’s got the will’  what causes the temper inquired the captain with his most judicial air as he took the liquor from his messenger and carefully filled a couple of glasses  it’s natural said his friend ruefully she calls it having a high spirit herself and she’s so generous she’s got a married niece living in the place and when that gal comes round and admires the things—my things—she gives ’em to her she gave her a sofa the other day and what’s more she made me help the gal to carry it home  have you tried being sarcastic inquired the captain thoughtfully  i have said pepper with a shiver the other day i said very nasty ’is there anything else you’d like my dear’ but she didn’t understand it  no said the captain  no said pepper she said i was very kind and she’d like the clock and what’s more she had it too red’aired hussy  the captain poured out some gin and drank it slowly it was evident he was thinking deeply and that he was much affected by his friend’s troubles  there is only one way for me to get clear said pepper as he finished a thrilling recital of his wrongs and that is to find cap’n budd her first  why he’s dead said crippen staring hard don’t you waste your time looking for him  i’m not going to said pepper but here’s his portrait he was a big man like you he had blue eyes and a straight handsome nose like you if he’d lived to now he’d be almost your age and very likely more like you than ever he was a sailor you’ve been a sailor  the captain stared at him in bewilderment  he had a wonderful way with wimmen pursued jackson hastily you’ve got a wonderful way with wimmen more than that you’ve got the most wonderful gift for acting i’ve ever seen ever since the time when you acted in that barn at bristol i’ve never seen any actor i can honestly say i’ve liked—never look how you can imitate cats—better than henry irving himself  i never had much chance being at sea all my life said crippen modestly  you’ve got the gift said pepper impressively it was born in you and you’ll never leave off acting till the day of your death you couldn’t if you tried—you know you couldn’t  the captain smiled deprecatingly  now i want you to do a performance for my benefit continued pepper i want you to act cap’n budd what was lost in the dolphin thirty years ago there’s only one man in england i’d trust with the part and that’s you  act cap’n budd gasped the astonished crippen putting down his glass and staring at his friend  the part is written here said the expilot producing a notebook from his breast pocket and holding it out to his friend i’ve been keeping a log day by day of all the things she said about him in the hopes of catching her tripping but i never did there’s notes of his family his ships and a lot of silly things he used to say which she thinks funny  i couldn’t do it said the captain seriously as he took the book  you could do it if you liked said pepper besides think what a spree it’ll be for you learn it by heart then come down and claim her her name’s martha  what good ’ud it do you if i did inquired the captain she’d soon find out  you come down to sunset bay said pepper emphasising his remarks with his forefinger you claim your wife you allude carefully to the things set down in this book i give martha back to you and bless you both then—  then what inquired crippen anxiously  you disappear concluded pepper triumphantly and of course believing her first husband is alive she has to leave me she’s a very particular woman and besides that i’d take care to let the neighbours know i’m happy you’re happy and if she’s not happy why she don’t deserve to be  i’ll think it over said crippen and write and let you know  make up your mind now urged pepper reaching over and patting him encouragingly upon the shoulder if you promise to do it the thing’s as good as done lord i think i see you now coming in at that door and surprising her talk about acting  is she what you’d call a goodlooking woman inquired crippen  very handsome said pepper looking out of the window  i couldn’t do it said the captain it wouldn’t be right and fair to her  i don’t see that said pepper i never ought to have married her without being certain her first was dead it ain’t right crippen say what you like it ain’t right  if you put it that way said the captain hesitatingly  have some more gin said the artful pilot  the captain had some more and what with flattery and gin combined with the pleadings of his friend began to consider the affair more favourably pepper stuck to his guns and used them so well that when the captain saw him off that evening he was pledged up to the hilt to come down to sunset bay and personate the late captain budd on the following thursday  the expilot passed the intervening days in a sort of trance from which he only emerged to take nourishment or answer the scoldings of his wife on the eventful thursday however his mood changed and he went about in such a state of suppressed excitement that he could scarcely keep still  lor’ bless me snapped mrs pepper as he slowly perambulated the parlour that afternoon what ails the man can’t you keep still for five minutes  the expilot stopped and eyed her solemnly but ere he could reply his heart gave a great bound for from behind the geraniums which filled the window he saw the face of captain crippen slowly rise and peer cautiously into the room before his wife could follow the direction of her husband’s eyes it had disappeared  somebody looking in at the window said pepper with forced calmness in reply to his wife’s eyebrows  like their impudence said the unconscious woman resuming her knitting while her husband waited in vain for the captain to enter  he waited some time and then half dead with excitement sat down and with shaking fingers lit his pipe as he looked up the stalwart figure of the captain passed the window during the next twenty minutes it passed seven times and pepper coming to the not unnatural conclusion that his friend intended to pass the afternoon in the same unprofitable fashion resolved to force his hand  must be a tramp he said aloud  who inquired his wife man keeps looking in at the window said pepper desperately keeps looking in till he meets my eye then he disappears looks like an old seacaptain something  old seacaptain said his wife putting down her work and turning round there was a strange hesitating note in her voice she looked at the window and at the same instant the head of the captain again appeared above the geraniums and meeting her gaze hastily vanished martha pepper sat still for a moment and then rising in a slow dazed fashion crossed to the door and opened it mermaid passage was empty  see anybody quavered pepper  his wife shook her head but in a strangely quiet fashion and sitting down took up her knitting again  for some time the click of the needles and the tick of the clock were the only sounds audible and the expilot had just arrived at the conclusion that his friend had abandoned him to his fate when there came a low tapping at the door  come in cried pepper starting  the door opened slowly and the tall figure of captain crippen entered and stood there eyeing them nervously a neat little speech he had prepared failed him at the supreme moment he leaned against the wall and in a clumsy shamefaced fashion lowered his gaze and stammered out the one word—martha  at that word mrs pepper rose and stood with parted lips eyeing him wildly  jem she gasped jem  martha croaked the captain again  with a choking cry mrs pepper ran towards him and to the huge gratification of her lawful spouse flung her arms about his neck and kissed him violently  jem she cried breathlessly is it really you i can hardly believe it where have you been all this long time where have you been  lots of places said the captain who was not prepared to answer a question like that offhand but wherever i’ve been—he held up his hand theatrically—the image of my dear lost wife has been always in front of me  i knew you at once jem said mrs pepper fondly smoothing the hair back from his forehead have i altered much  not a bit said crippen holding her at arm’s length and carefully regarding her you look just the same as the first time i set eyes on you  where have you been wailed martha pepper putting her head on his shoulder  when the dolphin went down from under me and left me fighting with the waves for life and martha i was cast ashore on a desert island began crippen fluently there i remained for nearly three years when i was rescued by a barque bound for new south wales there i met a man from poole who told me you were dead having no further interest in the land of my birth i sailed in australian waters for many years and it was only lately that i heard how cruelly i had been deceived and that my little flower was still blooming  the little flower’s head being well down on his shoulder again the celebrated actor exchanged glances with the worshipping pepper  if you’d only come before jem said mrs pepper who was he what was his name  smith said the cautious captain  if you’d only come before jem said mrs pepper in a smothered voice it would have been better only three months ago i married that object over there  the captain attempted a melodramatic start with such success that having somewhat underestimated the weight of his fair bride he nearly lost his balance  it can’t be helped i suppose he said reproachfully but you might have waited a little longer martha  well i’m your wife anyhow said martha and i’ll take care i never lose you again you shall never go out of my sight again till you die never  nonsense my pet said the captain exchanging uneasy glances with the expilot nonsense  it isn’t nonsense jem said the lady as she drew him on to the sofa and sat with her arms round his neck it may be true all you’ve told me and it may not for all i know you may have been married to some other woman but i’ve got you now and i intend to keep you  there there said the captain as soothingly as a strange sinking at the heart would allow him  as for that other little man i only married him because he worried me so said mrs pepper tearfully i never loved him but he used to follow me about and propose was it twelve or thirteen times you proposed to me pepper  i forget said the expilot shortly  but i never loved him she continued i never loved you a bit did i pepper  not a bit said pepper warmly no man could ever have a harder or more unfeeling wife than you was i’ll say that for you willing  as he bore this testimony to his wife’s fidelity there was a knock at the door and upon his opening it the rector’s daughter a lady of uncertain age entered and stood regarding with amazement the frantic but ineffectual struggles of captain crippen to release himself from a position as uncomfortable as it was ridiculous  mrs pepper said the lady aghast oh mrs pepper  it’s all right miss winthrop said the lady addressed calmly as she forced the captain’s flushed face on to her ample shoulder again it’s my first husband jem budd  good gracious said miss winthrop starting enoch arden in the flesh  who inquired pepper with a show of polite interest  enoch arden said miss winthrop one of our great poets wrote a noble poem about a sailor who came home and found that his wife had married again but in the poem the first husband went away without making himself known and died of a broken heart  she looked at captain crippen as though he hadn’t quite come up to her expectations  and now said pepper speaking with great cheerfulness it’s me that’s got to have the broken heart well well  it’s a most interesting case cried miss winthrop and if you wait till i fetch my camera i’ll take your portrait together just as you are  do said mrs pepper cordially  i won’t have my portrait took said the captain with much acerbity  not if i wish it dear inquired mrs pepper tenderly  not if you keep awishing it all your life replied the captain sourly making another attempt to get his head from her shoulder  don’t you think they ought to have their portrait taken now asked miss winthrop turning to the expilot  i don’t see no ’arm in it said pepper thoughtlessly  you hear what mr pepper says said the lady turning to the captain again surely if he doesn’t mind you ought not to  i’ll talk to him byandbye said the captain very grimly  p’raps it would be better if we kept this affair to ourselves for the present said the expilot taking alarm at his friend’s manner  well i won’t intrude on you any longer said miss winthrop oh look there how rude of them  the others turned hastily in time to see several heads vanish from the window captain crippen was the first to speak  jem said mrs pepper severely before he had finished  captain budd said miss winthrop flushing  the incensed captain rose to his feet and paced up and down the room he looked at the expilot and that small schemer shivered  easy does it cap’n he murmured with a wink which he meant to be comforting  i’m going out a little way said the captain after the rector’s daughter had gone just to cool my head  mrs pepper took her bonnet from its peg behind the door and surveying herself in the glass tied it beneath her chin  alone said crippen nervously i want to do a little thinking  never again jem said mrs pepper firmly my place is by your side if you’re ashamed of people looking at you i’m not i’m proud of you come along come and show yourself and tell them who you are you shall never go out of my sight again as long as i live never  she began to whimper  what’s to be done inquired crippen turning desperately on the bewildered pilot  what’s it got to do with him demanded mrs pepper sharply  he’s got to be considered a little i s’pose said the captain dissembling besides i think i’d better do like the man in the poetry did let me go away and die of a broken heart perhaps it’s best  mrs pepper looked at him with kindling eyes  let me go away and die of a broken heart repeated the captain with real feeling i’d rather do it i would indeed  mrs pepper bursting into angry tears flung her arms round his neck again and sobbed on his shoulder the pilot obeying the frenzied injunctions of his friend’s eye drew down the blind  there’s quite a crowd outside he remarked  i don’t mind said his wife amiably they’ll soon know who he is  she stood holding the captain’s hand and stroking it and whenever his feelings became too much for her put her head down on his waistcoat at such times the captain glared fiercely at the expilot who being of a weak nature was unable despite his anxiety to give his risible faculties that control which the solemnity of the occasion demanded  the afternoon wore slowly away miss winthrop who disliked scandal had allowed something of the affair to leak out and several visitors including a local reporter called but were put off till the morrow on the not unnatural plea that the longseparated couple desired a little privacy the three sat silent the expilot with wrinkled brows trying hard to decipher the liplanguage in which the captain addressed him whenever he had an opportunity but could only dimly guess its purport when the captain pressed his huge fist into the service as well  mrs pepper rose at length and went into the back room to prepare tea as she left the door open however and took the captain’s hat with her he built no hopes on her absence but turned furiously to the expilot  what’s to be done he inquired in a fierce whisper this can’t go on  it’ll have to whispered the other  now look here said crippen menacingly i’m going into the kitchen to make a clean breast of it i’m sorry for you but i’ve done the best i can come and help me to explain  he turned to the kitchen but the other with the strength born of despair seized him by the sleeve and held him back  she’ll kill me he whispered breathlessly  i can’t help it said crippen shaking him off serve you right  and she’ll tell the folks outside and they’ll kill you continued pepper  the captain sat down again and confronted him with a face as pale as his own  the last train leaves at eight whispered the pilot hurriedly it’s desperate but it’s the only thing you can do take her for a stroll up by the fields near the railway station you can see the train coming in for a mile off nearly time yourself carefully and make a bolt for it she can’t run  the entrance of their victim with the teatray stopped the conversation but the captain nodded acceptance behind her back and then with a forced gaiety sat down to tea  for the first time since his successful appearance he became loquacious and spoke so freely of incidents in the life of the man he was impersonating that the expilot sat in a perfect fever lest he should blunder the meal finished he proposed a stroll and as the unsuspecting mrs pepper tied on her bonnet slapped his leg and winked confidently at his fellowconspirator  i’m not much of a walker said the innocent mrs pepper so you must go slowly  the captain nodded and at pepper’s suggestion left by the back way to avoid the gaze of the curious  for some time after their departure pepper sat smoking with his anxious face turned to the clock until at length unable to endure the strain any longer and not without a sportsmanlike idea of being in at the death he made his way to the station and placed himself behind a convenient coaltruck  he waited impatiently with his eyes fixed on the road up which he expected the captain to come he looked at his watch five minutes to eight and still no captain the platform began to fill a porter seized the big bell and rang it lustily in the distance a patch of white smoke showed just as the watcher had given up all hope the figure of the captain came in sight he was swaying from side to side holding his hat in his hand but doggedly racing the train to the station  he’ll never do it groaned the pilot then he held his breath for three or four hundred yards behind the captain mrs pepper pounded in pursuit  the train rolled into the station passengers stepped in and out doors slammed and the guard had already placed the whistle in his mouth when captain crippen breathing stentorously came stumbling blindly on to the platform and was hustled into a third class carriage  close shave that sir said the stationmaster as he closed the door  the captain sank back in his seat fighting for breath and turning his head gave a last triumphant look up the road  all right sir said the stationmaster kindly as he followed the direction of the other’s eyes and caught sight of mrs pepper we’ll wait for your lady  jackson pepper came from behind the coaltruck and watched the train out of sight wondering in a dull vague fashion what the conversation was like he stood so long that a tender hearted porter who had heard the news made bold to come up and put a friendly hand on his shoulder  you’ll never see her again mr pepper he said sympathetically  the expilot turned and regarded him fixedly and the last bit of spirit he was ever known to show flashed up in his face as he spoke  you’re a blamed idiot he said rudely     a case of desertion     the sun was just rising as the small tublike steamer or to be more correct steambarge the bulldog steamed past the sleeping town of gravesend at a good six knots per hour  there had been a little discussion on the way between her crew and the engineer who down in his grimy little engineroom did his own stoking and everything else necessary the crew consisting of captain mate and boy who were doing their first trip on a steamer had been transferred at the last moment from their sailingbarge the witch and found to their discomfort that the engineer who had not expected to sail so soon was terribly and abusively drunk every moment he could spare from his engines he thrust the upper part of his body through the small hatchway and rowed with his commander  ahoy bargee he shouted popping up like a jackinthebox after a brief cessation of hostilities  don’t take no notice of ’im said the mate ’e’s got a bottle of brandy down there an’ he’s ’alf mad  if i knew anything o’ them blessed engines growled the skipper i’d go and hit ’im over the head  but you don’t said the mate and neither do i so you’d better keep quiet  you think you’re a fine feller continued the engineer standing up there an’ playing with that little wheel you think you’re doing all the work what’s the boy doing send him down to stoke  go down said the skipper grinning with fury and the boy reluctantly obeyed  you think said the engineer pathetically after he had cuffed the boy’s head and dropped him down below by the scruff of his neck you think because i’ve got a black face i’m not a man there’s many a hoily face ’ides a good ’art  i don’t think nothing about it grunted the skipper you do your work and i’ll do mine  don’t you give me none of your back answers bellowed the engineer ’cos i won’t have ’em  the skipper shrugged his shoulders and exchanged glances with his sympathetic mate wait till i get ’im ashore he murmured  the biler is wore out said the engineer reappearing after a hasty dive below it may bust at any moment  as though to confirm his words fearful sounds were heard proceeding from below  it’s only the boy said the mate he’s scared—natural  i thought it was the biler said the skipper with a sigh of relief it was loud enough  as he spoke the boy got his head out of the hatchway and rendered desperate with fear fairly fought his way past the engineer and gained the deck  very good said the engineer as he followed him on deck and staggered to the side i’ve had enough o’ you lot  hadn’t you better go down to them engines shouted the skipper  am i your slave demanded the engineer tearfully tell me that am i your slave  go down and do your work like a sensible man was the reply  at these words the engineer took umbrage at once and scowling fiercely removed his greasy jacket and flung his cap on the deck he then finished the brandy which he had brought up with him and gazed owlishly at the kentish shore  i’m going to have a wash he said loudly and sitting down removed his boots  go down to the engines first said the skipper and i’ll send the boy to you with a bucket and some soap  bucket replied the engineer scornfully as he moved to the side i’m going to have a proper wash  hold him roared the skipper suddenly hold him  the mate realising the situation rushed to seize him but the engineer with a mad laugh put his hands on the side and vaulted into the water when he rose the steamer was twenty yards ahead  go astarn yelled the mate  how can i go astarn when there’s nobody at the engines shouted the skipper as he hung on to the wheel and brought the boat’s head sharply round git a line ready  the mate with a coil of rope in his hand rushed to the side but his benevolent efforts were frustrated by the engineer who seeing the boat’s head making straight for him saved his life by an opportune dive the steamer rushed by  turn ’er agin screamed the mate  the captain was already doing so and in a remarkably short space of time the boat which had described a complete circle was making again for the engineer  look out for the line shouted the mate warningly  i don’t want your line yelled the engineer i’m going ashore  come aboard shouted the captain imploringly as they swept past again we can’t manage the engines  put her round again said the mate i’ll go for him with the boat haul her in boy  the boat which was dragging astern was hauled close and the mate tumbled into her followed by the boy just as the captain was in the middle of another circleto the intense indignation of a crowd of shipping large and small which was trying to get by  ahoy yelled the master of a tug which was towing a large ship take that steam roundabout out of the way what the thunder are you doing  picking up my engineer replied the captain as he steamed right across the other’s bows and nearly ran down a sailingbarge the skipper of which a salvation army man was nobly fighting with his feelings  why don’t you stop he yelled  ’cos i can’t wailed the skipper of the bulldog as he threaded his way between a huge steamer and a schooner who in avoiding him were getting up a little collision on their own account  ahoy bulldog ahoy called the mate stand by to pick us up we’ve got him  the skipper smiled in an agonised fashion as he shot past hotly pursued by his boat the feeling on board the other craft as they got out of the way of the bulldog and nearly ran down her boat and then in avoiding that nearly ran down something else cannot be put into plain english but several captains ventured into the domains of the ornamental with marked success  shut off steam yelled the engineer as the bulldog went by again draw the fires then  who’s going to steer while i do it bellowed the skipper as he left the wheel for a few seconds to try and get a line to throw them  by this time the commotion in the river was frightful and the captain’s steering as he went on his round again something marvellous to behold a strange lack of sympathy on the part of brother captains added to his troubles every craft he passed had something to say to him busy as they were and the remarks were as monotonous as they were insulting at last just as he was resolving to run his boat straight down the river until he came to a halt for want of steam the mate caught the rope he flung and the bulldog went down the river with her boat made fast to her stern  come aboard you—you lunatic he shouted  not afore i knows ’ow i stand said the engineer who was now beautifully sober and in full possession of a somewhat acute intellect  what do you mean demanded the skipper  i don’t come aboard shouted the engineer until you and the mate and the bye all swear as you won’t say nothing about this little game  i’ll report you the moment i get ashore roared the skipper i’ll give you in charge for desertion i’ll—  with a supreme gesture the engineer prepared to dive but the watchful mate fell on his neck and tripped him over a seat  come aboard cried the skipper aghast at such determination come aboard and i’ll give you a licking when we get ashore instead  honour bright inquired the engineer  honour bright chorused the three  the engineer with all the honours of war came on board and after remarking that he felt chilly bathing on an empty stomach went down below and began to stoke in the course of the voyage he said that it was worth while making such a fool of himself if only to see the skipper’s beautiful steering warmly asseverating that there was not another man on the river that could have done it before this insidious flattery the skipper’s wrath melted like snow before the sun and by the time they reached port he would as soon have thought of hitting his own father as his smoothtongued engineer     outsailed     it was a momentous occasion the two skippers sat in the private bar of the old ship in high street wapping solemnly sipping cold gin and smoking cigars whose sole merit consisted in the fact that they had been smuggled it is well known all along the waterside that this greatly improves their flavour  draw all right queried captain berrowa short fat man of few ideas who was the exulting owner of a bundle of them  beautiful replied captain tucker who had just made an excursion into the interior of his with the small blade of his penknife why don’t you keep smokes like these landlord  he can’t chuckled captain berrow fatuously they’re not to be ’ad—money couldn’t buy ’em  the landlord grunted why don’t you settle about that race o’ yours an’ ha’ done with it he cried as he wiped down his counter seems to me cap’n tucker’s hanging fire  i’m ready when he is said tucker somewhat shortly  it’s taking your money said berrow slowly the thistle can’t hold a candle to the good intent and you know it many a time that little schooner o’ mine has kept up with a steamer  wher’d you ha’ been if the tow rope had parted though said the master of the thistle with a wink at the landlord  at this remark captain berrow took fire and with his temper rapidly rising to fever heat wrathfully repelled the scurvy insinuation in language which compelled the respectful attention of all the other customers and the hasty intervention of the landlord  put up the stakes he cried impatiently put up the stakes and don’t have so much jaw about it  here’s mine said berrow sturdily handing over a greasy fiver now cap’n tucker cover that  come on said the landlord encouragingly don’t let him take the wind out of your sails like that  tucker handed over five sovereigns  high water’s at 1213 said the landlord pocketing the stakes you understand the conditionseach of you does the best he can for hisself after eleven an’ the one what gets to poole first has the ten quid understand  both gamblers breathed hard and fully realising the desperate nature of the enterprise upon which they had embarked ordered some more gin a rivalry of long standing as to the merits of their respective schooners had led to them calling in the landlord to arbitrate and this was the result berrow vaguely feeling that it would be advisable to keep on good terms with the stakeholder offered him one of the famous cigars the stakeholder anxious to keep on good terms with his stomach declined it  you’ve both got your moorings up i s’pose he inquired  got ’em up this evening replied tucker we’re just made fast one on each side of the dolphin now  the wind’s light but it’s from the right quarter said captain berrow an’ i only hope as ’ow the best ship’ll win i’d like to win myself but if not i can only say as there’s no man breathing i’d sooner have lick me than cap’n tucker he’s as smart a seaman as ever comes into the london river an’ he’s got a schooner angels would be proud of  glasses o’ gin round said tucker promptly cap’n berrow here’s your very good health an’ a fair field an’ no favour  with these praiseworthy sentiments the master of the thistle finished his liquor and wiping his mouth on the back of his hand nodded farewell to the twain and departed once in the high street he walked slowly as one in deep thought then with a sudden resolution turned up nightingale lane and made for a small unsavoury thoroughfare leading out of ratcliff highway a quarter of an hour later he emerged into that famous thoroughfare again smiling incoherently and retracing his steps to the waterside jumped into a boat and was pulled off to his ship  comes off tonight joe said he as he descended to the cabin an’ it’s arf a quid to you if the old gal wins  what’s the bet inquired the mate looking up from his task of shredding tobacco  five quid replied the skipper  well we ought to do it said the mate slowly ’t wont be my fault if we don’t  mine neither said the skipper as a matter o’ fact joe i reckon i’ve about made sure of it all’s fair in love and war and racing joe  ay ay said the mate more slowly than before as he revolved this addition to the proverb  i just nipped round and saw a chap i used to know named dibbs said the skipper keeps a boardinghouse for sailors wonderful sharp little chap he is needles ain’t nothing to him there’s heaps of needles but only one dibbs he’s going to make old berrow’s chaps as drunk as lords  does he know ’em inquired the mate  he knows where to find ’em said the other i told him they’d either be in the ’duke’s head’ or the ’town o’ berwick’ but he’d find ’em wherever they was ah even if they was in a coffee pallis i b’leeve that man ’ud find ’em  they’re steady chaps objected the mate but in a weak fashion being somewhat staggered by this tribute to mr dibbs’ remarkable powers  my lad said the skipper it’s dibbs’ business to mix sailors’ liquors so’s they don’t know whether they’re standing on their heads or their heels he’s the most wonderful mixer in christendom takes a reg’lar pride in it many a sailorman has got up a ship’s side thinking it was stairs and gone off half acrost the world instead of going to bed through him  we’ll have a easy job of it then said the mate i b’leeve we could ha’ managed it without that though ’tain’t quite what you’d call sport is it  there’s nothing like making sure of a thing said the skipper placidly what time’s our chaps coming aboard  ten thirty the latest replied the mate old sam’s with ’em so they’ll be all right  i’ll turn in for a couple of hours said the skipper going towards his berth lord i’d give something to see old berrow’s face as his chaps come up the side  p’raps they won’t git as far as that remarked the mate  oh yes they will said the skipper dibbs is going to see to that i don’t want any chance of the race being scratched turn me out in a couple of hours  he closed the door behind him and the mate having stuffed his clay with the coarse tobacco took some pink notepaper with scalloped edges from his drawer and placing the paper at his right side and squaring his shoulders began some private correspondence  for some time he smoked and wrote in silence until the increasing darkness warned him to finish his task he signed the note and having put a few marks of a tender nature below his signature sealed it ready for the post and sat with halfclosed eyes finishing his pipe then his head nodded and placing his arms on the table he too slept  it seemed but a minute since he had closed his eyes when he was awakened by the entrance of the skipper who came blundering into the darkness from his stateroom vociferating loudly and nervously  ay ay said joe starting up  where’s the lights said the skipper what’s the time i dreamt i’d overslept myself what’s the time  plenty o’ time said the mate vaguely as he stifled a yawn  ha’past ten said the skipper as he struck a match you’ve been asleep he added severely  i ain’t said the mate stoutly as he followed the other on deck i’ve been thinking i think better in the dark  it’s about time our chaps was aboard said the skipper as he looked round the deserted deck i hope they won’t be late  sam’s with ’em said the mate confidently as he went on to the side there ain’t no festivities going on aboard the good intent neither  there will be said his worthy skipper with a grin as he looked across the intervening brig at the rival craft there will be  he walked round the deck to see that everything was snug and shipshape and got back to the mate just as a howl of surprising weirdness was heard proceeding from the neighbouring stairs  i’m s’prised at berrow allowing his men to make that noise said the skipper waggishly our chaps are there too i think i can hear sam’s voice  so can i said the mate with emphasis  seems to be talking rather loud said the master of the thistle knitting his brows  sounds as though he’s trying to sing said the mate as after some delay a heavilyladen boat put off from the stairs and made slowly for them no he ain’t he’s screaming  there was no longer any doubt about it the respectable and greatlytrusted sam was letting off a series of wild howls which would have done credit to a pennygaff zulu and was evidently very much out of temper about something  ahoy thistle ahoy bellowed the waterman as he neared the schooner chuck us a ropequick  the mate threw him one and the boat came alongside it was then seen that another waterman using impatient and deplorable language was forcibly holding sam down in the boat  what’s he done what’s the row demanded the mate  done said the waterman in disgust done he’s ’ad a small lemon an’ it’s got into his silly old head he’s making all this fuss ’cos he wanted to set the pub on fire an’ they wouldn’t let him man ashore told us they belonged to the good intent but i know they’re your men  sam roared the skipper with a sinking heart as his glance fell on the recumbent figures in the boat come aboard at once you drunken disgrace d’ye hear  i can’t leave him said sam whimpering  leave who growled the skipper  him said sam placing his arms round the waterman’s neck him an’ me’s like brothers  get up you old loonatic snarled the waterman extricating himself with difficulty and forcing the other towards the side now up you go  aided by the shoulders of the waterman and the hands of his superior officers sam went up and then the waterman turned his attention to the remainder of his fares who were snoring contentedly in the bottom of the boat  now then he cried look alive with you d’ye hear wake up wake up kick ’em bill  i can’t kick no ’arder grumbled the other waterman  what the devil’s the matter with ’em stormed the master of the thistle chuck a pail of water over ’em joe  joe obeyed with gusto and as he never had much of a head for details bestowed most of it upon the watermen through the row which ensued the thistle’s crew snored peacefully and at last were handed up over the sides like sacks of potatoes and the indignant watermen pulled back to the stairs  here’s a nice crew to win a race with wailed the skipper almost crying with rage chuck the water over ’em joe chuck the water over ’em  joe obeyed willingly until at length to the skipper’s great relief one man stirred and sitting up on the deck sleepily expressed his firm conviction that it was raining for a moment they both had hopes of him but as joe went to the side for another bucketful he evidently came to the conclusion that he had been dreaming and lying down again resumed his nap as he did so the first stroke of big ben came booming down the river  eleven o’clock shouted the excited skipper  it was too true before big ben had finished the neighbouring church clocks commenced striking with feverish haste and hurrying feet and hoarse cries were heard proceeding from the deck of the good intent  loose the sails yelled the furious tucker loose the sails damme we’ll get under way by ourselves  he ran forward and assisted by the mate hoisted the jibs and then running back cast off from the brig and began to hoist the mainsail as they disengaged themselves from the tier there was just sufficient sail for them to advance against the tide while in front of them the good intent shaking out sail after sail stood boldly down the river  this was the way of it said sam as he stood before the grim tucker at six o’clock the next morning surrounded by his mates he came into the ’town o’ berwick’ where we was as nice a spoken little chap as ever you’d wish to see he said he’d been alooking at the good intent and he thought it was the prettiest little craft ’e ever seed and the exact image of one his dear brother which was a missionary ’ad and he’d like to stand a drink to every man of her crew of course we all said we was the crew direckly an’ all i can remember after that is two coppers an’ a little boy trying to giv’ me the frog’s march an’ somebody chucking pails o’ water over me it’s crool ’ard losing a race what we didn’t know nothink about in this way but it warn’t our faultit warn’t indeed it’s my belief that the little man was a missionary of some sort hisself and wanted to convert us an’ that was his way of starting on the job it’s all very well for the mate to have highstirriks but it’s quite true every word of it an’ if you go an’ ask at the pub they’ll tell you the same     mated     the schooner falcon was ready for sea the last bale of general cargo had just been shipped and a few hairy unkempt seamen were busy putting on the hatches under the able profanity of the mate  all clear inquired the master a short ruddyfaced man of about thirtyfive cast off there  ain’t you going to wait for the passengers then inquired the mate  no no replied the skipper whose features were working with excitement they won’t come now i’m sure they won’t we’ll lose the tide if we don’t look sharp  he turned aside to give an order just as a buxom young woman accompanied by a loutish boy a bandbox and several other bundles came hurrying on to the jetty  well here we are cap’n evans said the girl springing lightly on to the deck i thought we should never get here the cabman didn’t seem to know the way but i knew you wouldn’t go without us  here you are said the skipper with attempted cheerfulness as he gave the girl his right hand while his left strayed vaguely in the direction of the boy’s ear which was coldly withheld from him go down below and the mate’ll show you your cabin bill this is miss cooper a lady friend o’ mine and her brother  the mate acknowledging the introduction led the way to the cabin where they remained so long that by the time they came on deck again the schooner was off limehouse slipping along well under a light wind  how do you like the stateroom inquired the skipper who was at the wheel  pretty fair replied miss cooper it’s a big name for it though ain’t it oh what a large ship  she ran to the side to gaze at a big liner and as far as gravesend besieged the skipper and mate with questions concerning the various craft at the mate’s suggestion they had tea on deck at which meal william henry cooper became a source of much discomfort to his host by his remarkable discoveries anent the fauna of lettuce despite his efforts however and the cloud under which evans seemed to be labouring the meal was voted a big success and after it was over they sat laughing and chatting until the air got chilly and the banks of the river were lost in the gathering darkness at ten o’clock they retired for the night leaving evans and the mate on deck  nice gal that said the mate looking at the skipper who was leaning moodily on the wheel  ay ay replied he bill he continued turning suddenly towards the mate i’m in a deuce of a mess you’ve got a good square head on your shoulders now what on earth am i to do of course you can see how the land lays  of course said the mate who was not going to lose his reputation by any display of ignorance anyone could see it he added  the question is what’s to be done said the skipper  that’s the question said the mate guardedly  i feel that worried said evans that i’ve actually thought of getting into collision or running the ship ashore fancy them two women meeting at llandalock  such a sudden light broke in upon the square head of the mate that he nearly whistled with the brightness of it  but you ain’t engaged to this one he cried  we’re to be married in august said the skipper desperately that’s my ring on her finger  but you’re going to marry mary jones in september expostulated the mate you can’t marry both of ’em  that’s what i say replied evans that’s what i keep telling myself but it don’t seem to bring much comfort i’m too soft’earted where wimmen is concerned bill an’ that’s the truth of it d’reckly i get alongside of a nice gal my arm goes creeping round her before i know what it’s doing  what on earth made you bring the girl on the ship inquired the mate the other one’s sure to be on the quay to meet you as usual  i couldn’t help it groaned the skipper she would come she can be very determined when she likes she’s awful gone on me bill  so’s the other one apparently said the mate  i can’t think what it is the gals see in me said the other mournfully can you  no i’m blamed if i can replied the mate frankly  i don’t take no credit for it bill said the skipper not a bit my father was like it before me the worry’s killing me  well which are you going to have inquired the mate which do you like the best  i don’t know an’ that’s a fact said the skipper they ’ve both got money coming to ’em when i’m in wales i like mary jones best and when i’m in london it’s janey cooper it’s dreadful to be like that bill  it is said the mate drily i wouldn’t be in your shoes when those two gals meet for a fortune then you’ll have old jones and her brothers to tackle too seems to me things’ll be a bit lively  i hev thought of being took sick and staying in my bunk bill suggested evans anxiously  an’ having the two of ’em to nurse you retorted bill nice quiet time for an invalid  evans made a gesture of despair  how would it be said the mate after a long pause and speaking very slowly how would it be if i took this one off your hands  you couldn’t do it bill said the skipper decidedly not while she knew i was above ground well i can try returned the mate shortly i’ve took rather a fancy to the girl is it a bargain  it is said the skipper shaking hands upon it if you git me out of this hole bill i’ll remember it the longest day i live  with these words he went below and after cautiously undoing w h cooper who had slept himself into a knot that a professional contortionist would have envied tumbled in beside him and went to sleep  his heart almost failed him when he encountered the radiant jane at breakfast in the morning but he concealed his feelings by a strong effort and after the meal was finished and the passengers had gone on deck he laid hold of the mate who was following and drew him into the cabin  you haven’t washed yourself this morning he said eyeing him closely how do you s’pose you are going to make an impression if you don’t look smart  well i look tidier than you do growled the mate  of course you do said the wily evans i’m going to give you all the chances i can now you go and shave yourself and here—take it  he passed the surprised mate a brilliant red silk tie embellished with green spots  no no said the mate deprecatingly  take it repeated evans if anything’ll fetch her it’ll be that tie and here’s a couple of collars for you they’re a new shape quite the rage down poplar way just now  it’s robbing you said the mate and it’s no good either i ain’t got a decent suit of clothes to my back  evans looked up and their eyes met then with a catch in his breath he turned away and after some hesitation went to his locker and bringing out a new suit bought for the edification of miss jones handed it silently to the mate  i can’t take all these things without giving you something for ’em said the mate here wait a bit  he dived into his cabin and after a hasty search brought out some garments which he placed on the table before his commander  i wouldn’t wear ’em no not to drown myself in declared evans after a brief glance they ain’t even decent  so much the better said the mate it’ll be more of a contrast with me  after a slight contest the skipper gave way and the mate after an elaborate toilette went on deck and began to make himself agreeable while his chief skulked below trying to muster up courage to put in an appearance  where’s the captain inquired miss cooper after his absence had been so prolonged as to become noticeable  he’s below dressin’ i b’leeve replied the mate simply  miss cooper glancing at his attire smiled softly to herself and prepared for something startling and she got it for a more forlorn sulkylooking object than the skipper when he did appear had never been seen on the deck of the falcon and his london betrothed glanced at him hot with shame and indignation  whatever have you got those things on for she whispered  work my dear—work replied the skipper  well mind you don’t lose any of the pieces said the dear suavely you mightn’t be able to match that cloth  i’ll look after that said the skipper reddening you must excuse me talkin’ to you now i’m busy  miss cooper looked at him indignantly and biting her lip turned away and started a desperate flirtation with the mate to punish him evans watched them with mingled feelings as he busied himself with various small jobs on the deck his wrath being raised to boiling point by the behaviour of the cook who being a poor hand at disguising his feelings came out of the galley several times to look at him  from this incident a coolness sprang up between the skipper and the girl which increased hourly at times the skipper weakened but the watchful mate was always on hand to prevent mischief owing to his fostering care evans was generally busy and always gruff and miss cooper who was used to the most assiduous attentions from him knew not whether to be most bewildered or most indignant four times in one day did he remark in her hearing that a sailor’s ship was his sweetheart while his treatment of his small prospective brother inlaw when he expostulated with him on the state of his wardrobe filled that hitherto pampered youth with amazement at last on the fourth night out as the little schooner was passing the coast of cornwall the mate came up to him as he was steering and patted him heavily on the back  it’s all right cap’n said he you’ve lost the prettiest little girl in england  what said the skipper in incredulous tones  fact replied the other here’s your ring back i wouldn’t let her wear it any longer  however did you do it inquired evans taking the ring in a dazed fashion  oh easy as possible said the mate she liked me best that’s all  but what did you say to her persisted evans  the other reflected  i can’t call to mind exactly he said at length but you may rely upon it i said everything i could against you but she never did care much for you she told me so herself  i wish you joy of your bargain said evans solemnly after a long pause  what do you mean demanded the mate sharply  a girl like that said the skipper with a lump in his throat who can carry on with two men at once ain’t worth having she’s not my money that’s all  the mate looked at him in honest bewilderment  mark my words continued the skipper loftily you’ll live to regret it a girl like that’s got no ballast she’ll always be running after fresh neckties  you put it down to the necktie do you sneered the mate wrathfully  that and the clothes cert’nly replied the skipper  well you’re wrong said the mate a lot you know about girls it wasn’t your old clothes and it wasn’t all your bad behaviour to her since she’s been aboard you may as well know first as last she wouldn’t have nothing to do with me at first so i told her all about mary jones  you told her that cried the skipper fiercely  i did replied the other she was pretty wild at first but then the comic side of it struck her—you wearing them old clothes and going about as you did she used to watch you until she couldn’t stand it any longer and then go down in the cabin and laugh wonderful spirits that girl’s got hush here she is  as he spoke the girl came on deck and seeing the two men talking together remained at a short distance from them  it’s all right jane said the mate i’ve told him  oh said miss cooper with a little gasp  i can’t bear deceit said the mate and now it’s off his mind he’s so happy he can’t bear himself  the latter part of this assertion seemed to be more warranted by facts than the former but evans made a choking noise which he intended as a sign of unbearable joy and relinquishing the wheel to the mate walked forward the clear sky was thick with stars and a mind at ease might have found enjoyment in the quiet beauty of the night but the skipper was too interested in the behaviour of the young couple at the wheel to give it a thought immersed in each other they forgot him entirely and exchanged little playful slaps and pushes which incensed him beyond description several times he was on the point of exercising his position as commander and ordering the mate below but in the circumstances interference was impossible and with a lowvoiced goodnight he went below here his gaze fell on william henry who was slumbering peacefully and with a hazy idea of the eternal fitness of things he raised the youth in his arms and despite his sleepy protests deposited him in the mate’s bunk then with head and heart both aching he retired for the night  there was a little embarrassment next day but it soon passed off and the three adult inmates of the cabin got on quite easy terms with each other the most worried person aft was the boy who had not been taken into their confidence and whose face when his sister sat with the mate’s arm around her waist presented to the skipper a perfect study in emotions  i feel quite curious to see this miss jones said miss cooper amiably as they sat at dinner  she’ll be on the quay waving her handkerchief to him said the mate we’ll be in tomorrow afternoon and then you’ll see her  as it happened the mate was a few hours out in his reckoning for by the time the falcon’s bows were laid for the small harbour it was quite dark and the little schooner glided in guided by the two lights which marked the entrance the quay seen in the light of a few scattered lamps looked dreary enough and except for two or three indistinct figures appeared to be deserted beyond the broken lights of the town stood out more clearly as the schooner crept slowly over the dark water towards her berth  fine night cap’n said the watchman as the schooner came gently alongside the quay  the skipper grunted assent he was peering anxiously at the quay  it’s too late said the mate you couldn’t expect her this time o’night it’s ten o’clock  i’ll go over in the morning said evans who now that things had been adjusted was secretly disappointed that miss cooper had not witnessed the meeting if you’re not going ashore we might have a hand o’ cards as soon’s we’re made fast  the mate assenting they went below and were soon deep in the mysteries of threehand cribbage evans who was a good player surpassed himself and had just won the first game the others being nowhere when a head was thrust down the companionway and a voice like a strained foghorn called the captain by name  ay ay yelled evans laying down his hand  i’ll come down cap’n said the voice and the mate just had time to whisper old jones to miss cooper when a man of mighty bulk filled up the doorway of the little cabin and extended a huge paw to evans and the mate he then looked at the lady and breathing hard waited  young lady o’ the mate’s said evans breathlessly—miss cooper sit down cap’n get the gin out bill  not for me said captain jones firmly but with an obvious effort  the surprise of evans and the mate admitted of no concealment but it passed unnoticed by their visitor who fidgeting in his seat appeared to be labouring with some mysterious problem after a long pause during which all watched him anxiously he reached over the table and shook hands with evans again  put it there cap’n said evans much affected by this token of esteem  the old man rose and stood looking at him with his hand on his shoulder he then shook hands for the third time and patted him encouragingly on the back  is anything the matter demanded the skipper of the falcon as he rose to his feet alarmed by these manifestations of feeling is mary—is she ill  worse than that said the other—worse’n that my poor boy she’s married a lobster  the effect of this communication upon evans was tremendous but it may be doubted whether he was more surprised than miss cooper who utterly unversed in military terms strove in vain to realize the possibility of such a mesalliance as she gazed wildly at the speaker and squeaked with astonishment  when was it asked evans at last in a dull voice  thursday fortnight at ha’ past eleven said the old man he’s a sergeant in the line i would have written to you but i thought it was best to come and break it to you gently cheer up my boy there’s more than one mary jones in the world  with this undeniable fact captain jones waved a farewell to the party and went off leaving them to digest his news for some time they sat still the mate and miss cooper exchanging whispers until at length the stillness becoming oppressive they withdrew to their respective berths leaving the skipper sitting at the table gazing hard at a knot in the opposite locker  for long after their departure he sat thus amid a deep silence broken only by an occasional giggle from the stateroom or an idiotic sniggering from the direction of the mate’s bunk until recalled to mundane affairs by the lamp burning itself out he went in befitting gloom to bed     the rival beauties     if you hadn’t asked me said the night watchman i should never have told you but seeing as you’ve put the question point blank i will tell you my experience of it you’re the first person i’ve ever opened my lips to upon the subject for it was so eggstraordinary that all our chaps swore as they’d keep it to theirselves for fear of being disbelieved and jeered at  it happened in ’84 on board the steamer george washington bound from liverpool to new york the first eight days passed without anything unusual happening but on the ninth i was standing aft with the first mate hauling in the log when we hears a yell from aloft an’ a chap what we called stuttering sam come down as if he was possessed and rushed up to the mate with his eyes nearly starting out of his ’ed  ’there’s the sssssssississip’ ses he  ’the what’ ses the mate  ’the ssseaseasssssip’  ’look here my lad’ ses the mate taking out a pockethankerchief an’ wiping his face ’you just tarn your ’ed away till you get your breath it’s like opening a bottle o’ soda water to stand talking to you now what is it’  ’it’s the ssssssisseaseaseasarpint’ ses sam with a bust  ’rather a long un by your account of it’ ses the mate with a grin  ’what’s the matter’ ses the skipper who just came up  ’this man has seen the seasarpint sir that’s all’ ses the mate  ’yyyes’ said sam with a sort o’ sob  ’well there ain’t much doing just now’ ses the skipper ’so you’d better get a slice o’ bread and feed it’  the mate bust out larfing an’ i could see by the way the skipper smiled he was rather tickled at it himself  the skipper an’ the mate was still larfing very hearty when we heard a dreadful ’owl from the bridge an’ one o’ the chaps suddenly leaves the wheel jumps on to the deck and bolts below as though he was mad t’other one follows ’m a’most d’reckly and the second mate caught hold o’ the wheel as he left it and called out something we couldn’t catch to the skipper  ’what the d——’s the matter’ yells the skipper  the mate pointed to starboard but as ’is ’and was shaking so that one minute it was pointing to the sky an’ the next to the bottom o’ the sea it wasn’t much of a guide to us even when he got it steady we couldn’t see anything till all of a sudden about two miles off something like a telegraph pole stuck up out of the water for a few seconds and then ducked down again and made straight for the ship  sam was the fust to speak and without wasting time stuttering or stammering he said he’d go down and see about that bit o’ bread an’ he went afore the skipper or the mate could stop ’im  in less than ’arf a minute there was only the three officers an’ me on deck the second mate was holding the wheel the skipper was holding his breath and the first mate was holding me it was one o’ the most exciting times i ever had  ’better fire the gun at it’ ses the skipper in a trembling voice looking at the little brass cannon we had for signalling  ’better not give him any cause for offence’ ses the mate shaking his head  ’i wonder whether it eats men’ ses the skipper ’perhaps it’ll come for some of us’  ’there ain’t many on deck for it to choose from’ ses the mate looking at ’im significant like  ’that’s true’ ses the skipper very thoughtful ’i’ll go an’ send all hands on deck as captain it’s my duty not to leave the ship till the last if i can anyways help it’  how he got them on deck has always been a wonder to me but he did it he was a brutal sort o’ a man at the best o’ times an’ he carried on so much that i s’pose they thought even the sarpint couldn’t be worse anyway up they came an’ we all stood in a crowd watching the sarpint as it came closer and closer  we reckoned it to be about a hundred yards long an’ it was about the most awfullooking creetur you could ever imagine if you took all the ugliest things in the earth and mixed ’em up—gorillas an’ the like—you’d only make a hangel compared to what that was it just hung off our quarter keeping up with us and every now and then it would open its mouth and let us see about four yards down its throat  ’it seems peaceable’ whispers the fust mate arter awhile  ’p’raps it ain’t hungry’ ses the skipper ’we’d better not let it get peckish try it with a loaf o’ bread’  the cook went below and fetched up halfadozen an’ one o’ the chaps plucking up courage slung it over the side an’ afore you could say ’jack robinson’ the sarpint had woffled it up an’ was looking for more it stuck its head up and came close to the side just like the swans in victoria park an’ it kept that game up until it had ’ad ten loaves an’ a hunk o’ pork  ’i’m afraid we’re encouraging it’ ses the skipper looking at it as it swam alongside with an eye as big as a saucer cocked on the ship  ’p’raps it’ll go away soon if we don’t take no more notice of it’ ses the mate ’just pretend it isn’t here’  well we did pretend as well as we could but everybody hugged the port side o’ the ship and was ready to bolt down below at the shortest notice and at last when the beast got craning its neck up over the side as though it was looking for something we gave it some more grub we thought if we didn’t give it he might take it and take it off the wrong shelf so to speak but as the mate said it was encouraging it and long arter it was dark we could hear it snorting and splashing behind us until at last it ’ad such an effect on us the mate sent one o’ the chaps down to rouse the skipper  ’i don’t think it’ll do no ’arm’ ses the skipper peering over the side and speaking as though he knew all about seasarpints and their ways  ’s’pose it puts its ’ead over the side and takes one o’ the men’ ses the mate  ’let me know at once’ ses the skipper firmly an’ he went below agin and left us  well i was jolly glad when eight bells struck an’ i went below an’ if ever i hoped anything i hoped that when i go up that ugly brute would have gone but instead o’ that when i went on deck it was playing alongside like a kitten a’most an’ one o’ the chaps told me as the skipper had been feeding it agin  ’it’s a wonderful animal’ ses the skipper ’an’ there’s none of you now but has seen the seasarpint but i forbid any man here to say a word about it when we get ashore’  ’why not sir’ ses the second mate  ’becos you wouldn’t be believed’ said the skipper sternly ’you might all go ashore and kiss the book an’ make affidavits an’ not a soul ’ud believe you the comic papers ’ud make fun of it and the respectable papers ’ud say it was seaweed or gulls’  why not take it to new york with us’ ses the fust mate suddenly  ’what’ ses the skipper  ’feed it every day’ ses the mate getting excited ’and bait a couple of shark hooks and keep ’em ready together with some wire rope git ’im to foller us as far as he will and then hook him we might git him in alive and show him at a sovereign a head anyway we can take in his carcase if we manage it properly’  ’by jove if we only could’ ses the skipper getting excited too  ’we can try’ ses the mate ’why we could have noosed it this mornin’ if we had liked and if it breaks the lines we must blow its head to pieces with the gun’  it seemed a most eggstraordinary thing to try and catch it that way but the beast was so tame and stuck so close to us that it wasn’t quite so ridikilous as it seemed at fust  arter a couple o’ days nobody minded the animal a bit for it was about the most nervous thing of its size you ever saw it hadn’t got the soul of a mouse and one day when the second mate just for a lark took the line of the foghorn in his hand and tooted it a bit it flung up its ’ead in a scared sort o’ way and after backing a bit turned clean round and bolted  i thought the skipper ’ud have gone mad he chucked over loaves o’ bread bits o’ beef and pork an’ scores o’ biskits and byandbye when the brute plucked up heart an’ came arter us again he fairly beamed with joy then he gave orders that nobody was to touch the horn for any reason whatever not even if there was a fog or chance of collision or anything of the kind an’ he also gave orders that the bells wasn’t to be struck but that the bosen was just to shove ’is ’ead in the fo’c’s’le and call ’em out instead  arter three days had passed and the thing was still follering us everybody made certain of taking it to new york an’ i b’leeve if it hadn’t been for joe cooper the question about the seasarpint would ha’ been settled long ago he was a most eggstraordinary ugly chap was joe he had a perfic cartoon of a face an’ he was so delikitminded and sensitive about it that if a chap only stopped in the street and whistled as he passed him or pointed him out to a friend he didn’t like it he told me once when i was symperthizing with him that the only time a woman ever spoke civilly to him was one night down poplar way in a fog an’ he was so ’appy about it that they both walked into the canal afore he knew where they was  on the fourth morning when we was only about three days from sandy hook the skipper got out o’ bed wrong side an’ when he went on deck he was ready to snap at anybody an’ as luck would have it as he walked a bit forrard he sees joe asticking his phiz over the side looking at the sarpint  ’what the d—— are you doing’ shouts the skipper ’what do you mean by it’  ’mean by what sir’ asks joe  ’putting your black ugly face over the side o’ the ship an’ frightening my seasarpint’ bellows the skipper ’you know how easy it’s skeered’  ’frightening the seasarpint’ ses joe trembling all over an’ turning very white  ’if i see that face o’ yours over the side agin my lad’ ses the skipper very fierce ’i’ll give it a black eye now cut’  joe cut an’ the skipper having worked off some of his illtemper went aft again and began to chat with the mate quite pleasant like i was down below at the time an’ didn’t know anything about it for hours arter and then i heard it from one o’ the firemen he comes up to me very mysterious like an’ ses ’bill’ he ses ’you’re a pal o’ joe’s come down here an’ see what you can make of ’im’  not knowing what he meant i follered ’im below to the engineroom an’ there was joe sitting on a bucket staring wildly in front of ’im and two or three of ’em standing round looking at ’im with their ’eads on one side  ’he’s been like that for three hours’ ses the second engineer in a whisper ’dazed like’  as he spoke joe gave a little shudder ’frighten the seasarpint’ ses he ’o lord’  ’it’s turned his brain’ ses one o’ the firemen ’he keeps saying nothing but that’  ’if we could only make ’im cry’ ses the second engineer who had a brother what was a medical student ’it might save his reason but how to do it that’s the question’  ’speak kind to ’im sir’ ses the fireman ’i’ll have a try if you don’t mind’ he cleared his throat first an’ then he walks over to joe and puts his hand on his shoulder an’ ses very soft an’ pitiful like  ’don’t take on joe don’t take on there’s many a ugly mug ’ides a good ’art’  afore he could think o anything else to say joe ups with his fist an’ gives ’im one in the ribs as nearly broke ’em then he turns away ’is ’ead an’ shivers again an’ the old dazed look come back  ’joe’ i ses shaking him ’joe’  ’frightened the seasarpint’ whispers joe staring  ’joe’ i ses ’joe you know me i’m your pal bill’  ’ay ay’ ses joe coming round a bit  ’come away’ i ses ’come an’ git to bed that’s the best place for you’  i took ’im by the sleeve and he gets up quiet an’ obedient and follers me like a little child i got ’im straight into ’is bunk an’ arter a time he fell into a soft slumber an’ i thought the worst had passed but i was mistaken he got up in three hours’ time an’ seemed all right ’cept that he walked about as though he was thinking very hard about something an’ before i could make out what it was he had a fit  he was in that fit ten minutes an’ he was no sooner out o’ that one than he was in another in twentyfour hours he had six fullsized fits and i’ll allow i was fairly puzzled what pleasure he could find in tumbling down hard and stiff an’ kicking at everybody an’ everything i couldn’t see he’d be standing quiet and peaceable like one minute and the next he’d catch hold o’ the nearest thing to him and have a bad fit and lie on his back and kick us while we was trying to force open his hands to pat ’em  the other chaps said the skipper’s insult had turned his brain but i wasn’t quite so soft an’ one time when he was alone i put it to him  ’joe old man’ i ses ’you an’ me’s been very good pals’  ’ay ay’ ses he suspicious like  ’joe’ i whispers ’what’s yer little game’  ’wodyermean’ ses he very short  ’i mean the fits’ ses i looking at ’im very steady ’it’s no good looking hinnercent like that ’cos i see yer chewing soap with my own eyes’  ’soap’ ses joe in a nasty sneering way ’you wouldn’t reckernise a piece if you saw it’  arter that i could see there was nothing to be got out of ’im an’ i just kept my eyes open and watched the skipper didn’t worry about his fits ’cept that he said he wasn’t to let the sarpint see his face when he was in ’em for fear of scaring it an’ when the mate wanted to leave him out o’ the watch he ses ’no he might as well have fits while at work as well as anywhere else’  we were about twentyfour hours from port an’ the sarpint was still following us and at six o’clock in the evening the officers puffected all their arrangements for ketching the creetur at eight o’clock next morning to make quite sure of it an extra watch was kept on deck all night to chuck it food every halfhour an’ when i turned in at ten o’clock that night it was so close i could have reached it with a clothesprop  i think i’d been abed about ’arfanhour when i was awoke by the most infernal row i ever heard the foghorn was going incessantly an’ there was a lot o’ shouting and running about on deck it struck us all as ’ow the sarpint was gitting tired o’ bread and was misbehaving himself consequently we just shoved our ’eds out o’ the forescuttle and listened all the hullaballoo seemed to be on the bridge an’ as we didn’t see the sarpint there we plucked up courage and went on deck  then we saw what had happened joe had ’ad another fit while at the wheel and not knowing what he was doing had clutched the line of the foghorn and was holding on to it like grim death and kicking right and left the skipper was in his bedclothes raving worse than joe and just as we got there joe came round a bit and letting go o’ the line asked in a faint voice what the foghorn was blowing for i thought the skipper ’ud have killed him but the second mate held him back an’ of course when things quieted down a bit an’ we went to the side we found the seasarpint had vanished  we stayed there all that night but it warn’t no use when day broke there wasn’t the slightest trace of it an’ i think the men was as sorry to lose it as the officers all ’cept joe that is which shows how people should never be rude even to the humblest for i’m sartin that if the skipper hadn’t hurt his feelings the way he did we should now know as much about the seasarpint as we do about our own brothers     mrs bunker’s chaperon     matilda stood at the open door of a house attached to a wharf situated in that dreary district which bears the highsounding name of st katharine’s  work was over for the day a couple of unhorsed vans were pushed up the gangway by the side of the house and the big gate was closed the untidy office which occupied the groundfloor was deserted except for a greybearded housemaid of sixty who was sweeping it through with a broom and indulging in a few sailorly oaths at the choking qualities of the dust he was raising  the sound of advancing footsteps stopped at the gate a small flapdoor let in it flew open and matilda bunker’s open countenance took a pinkish hue as a small man in jersey and blue coat with a hard round hat exceeding high in the crown stepped inside  good evening mrs bunker ma’am said he coming slowly up to her  good evening captain said the lady who was mrs only by virtue of her age and presence  fresh breeze said the man in the high round hat if this lasts we’ll be in ipswich in no time  mrs bunker assented  beautiful the river is at present continued the captain everything growing splendid  in the river asked the mystified mrs bunker  on the banks said the captain the trees by sheppey and all round there now why don’t you say the word and come there’s a cabin like a new pin ready for you to sit in—for cleanness i mean—and every accommodation you could require sleep like a hummingtop you will if you come  hummingtop queried mrs bunker archly  any top said the captain come make up your mind we shan’t sail afore nine  it don’t look right said the lady who was sorely tempted but the missus says i may go if i like so i’ll just go and get my box ready i’ll be down on the jetty at nine  ay ay said the skipper smiling me and bill’ll just have a snooze till then so long  so long said matilda  so long repeated the amorous skipper and turning round to bestow another ardent glance upon the fair one at the door crashed into the waggon  the neighbouring clocks were just striking nine in a sort of yelping chorus to the heavy boom of big ben which came floating down the river as mrs bunker and the night watchman staggering under a load of luggage slowly made their way on to the jetty the barge for such was the craft in question was almost level with the planks while the figures of two men darted to and fro in all the bustle of getting under way  bill said the watchman addressing the mate bear a hand with this box and be careful it’s got the wedding clothes inside  the watchman was so particularly pleased with this little joke that in place of giving the box to bill he put it down and sat on it shaking convulsively with his hand over his mouth while the blushing matilda and the discomfited captain strove in vain to appear unconcerned  the packages were rather a tight squeeze for the cabin but they managed to get them in and the skipper with a threatening look at his mate who was exchanging glances of exquisite humour with the watchman gave his hand to mrs bunker and helped her aboard  welcome on the sir edmund lyons mrs bunker said he bill kick that dawg back  stop said mrs bunker hastily that’s my chapperong  your what said the skipper it’s a dawg mrs bunker an’ i won’t have no dawgs aboard my craft  bill said mrs bunker fetch my box up again  leastways the captain hastened to add unless it’s any friend of yours mrs bunker  it’s chaperoning me said matilda it wouldn’t be proper for a lady to go a v’y’ge with two men without somebody to look after her  that’s right sam said the watchman sententiously you ought to know that at your age  why we’re looking after her said the simpleminded captain me an’ bill  take care bill don’t cut you out said the watchman in a hoarse whisper distinctly audible to all he’s younger nor what you are sam an’ the wimmen are just crazy arter young men ’sides which he’s a finer man altogether an’ you’ve had one wife a’ready sam  cast off said the skipper impatiently cast off stand by there bill  ay ay said bill seizing a boathook and the lines fell into the water with a splash as the barge was pushed out into the tide  mrs bunker experienced the usual trouble of landsmen aboard ship and felt herself terribly in the way as the skipper divided his attentions between the tiller and helping bill with the sail meantime the barge had bothered most of the traffic by laying across the river and when the sail was hoisted had got under the lee of a huge warehouse and scarcely moved  we’ll feel the breeze directly said captain codd then you’ll see what she can do  as he spoke the barge began to slip through the water as a light breeze took her huge sail and carried her into the stream where she fell into line with other craft who were just making a start  at a pleasant pace with wind and tide the sir edmund lyons proceeded on its way her skipper cocking his eye aloft and along her decks to point out various beauties to his passenger which she might otherwise have overlooked a comfortable supper was spread on the deck and mrs bunker began to think regretfully of the pleasure she had missed in taking up bargesailing so late in life  greenwich with its whitefronted hospital and background of trees was passed the air got sensibly cooler and to mrs bunker it seemed that the water was not only getting darker but also lumpy and she asked two or three times whether there was any danger  the skipper laughed gaily and diving down into the cabin fetched up a shawl which he placed carefully round his fair companion’s shoulders his right hand grasped the tiller his left stole softly and carefully round her waist  how enjoyable said mrs bunker referring to the evening  glad you like it said the skipper who wasn’t oh how pleasant to go sailing down the river of life like this everything quiet and peaceful just driftin’—  ahoy yelled the mate suddenly from the bows who’s steering starbud your hellum  the skipper started guiltily and put his helm to starboard as another barge came up suddenly from the opposite direction and almost grazed them there were two men on board and the skipper blushed for their fluency as reflecting upon the order in general  it was some little time before they could settle down again after this but ultimately they got back in their old position and the infatuated codd was just about to wax sentimental again when he felt something behind him he turned with a start as a portly retriever inserted his head under his left arm and slowly but vigorously forced himself between them then he sat on his haunches and panted while the disconcerted codd strove to realise the humour of the position  i think i shall go to bed now said mrs bunker after the position had lasted long enough to be unendurable if anything happens a collision or anything don’t be afraid to let me know  the skipper promised and shaking hands bade his passenger goodnight she descended somewhat clumsily it is true into the little cabin and the skipper sitting by the helm which he lazily manoeuvred as required smoked his short clay and fell into a lover’s reverie  so he sat and smoked until the barge which had by the help of the breeze been making its way against the tide began to realise that that good friend had almost dropped and at the same time bethought itself of a small anchor which hung over the bows ready for emergencies such as these  we must bring up bill said the skipper  ay ay said bill sleepily raising himself from the hatchway over she goes  with no more ceremony than this he dropped the anchor the sail with two strong men hauling on to it creaked and rustled its way close to the mast and the sir edmund lyons was ready for sleep  i can do with a nap said bill i’m dogtired  so am i said the other it’ll be a tight fit down for’ard but we couldn’t ask a lady to sleep there  bill gave a noncommittal grunt and as the captain after the manner of his kind took a last look round before retiring placed his hands on the hatch and lowered himself down the next moment he came up with a wild yell and sitting on the deck rolled up his trousers and fondled his leg  what’s the matter inquired the skipper  that blessed dog’s down there that’s all said the injured bill he’s evidently mistook it for his kennel and i don’t wonder at it i thought he’d been wonderful quiet  we must talk him over said the skipper advancing to the hatchway poor dog poor old chap come along then come along he patted his leg and whistled and the dog which wanted to get to sleep again growled like a small thunderstorm  come on old fellow said the skipper enticingly come along come on then  the dog came at last and then the skipper instead of staying to pat him raced bill up the ropes while the brute in execrable taste paced up and down the deck daring them to come down coming to the conclusion at last that they were settled for the night he returned to the forecastle and after a warning bark or two turned in again both men after waiting a few minutes cautiously regained the deck  you call him up again said bill seizing a boathook and holding it at the charge  certainly not said the other i won’t have no blood spilt aboard my ship  who’s going to spill blood asked the jesuitical bill but if he likes to run hisself on to the boathook —  put it down said the skipper sternly and bill sullenly obeyed  we’ll have to snooze on deck said codd  and mind we don’t snore said the sarcastic bill ’cos the dog mightn’t like it  without noticing this remark the captain stretched himself on the hatches and bill after a few more grumbles followed his example and both men were soon asleep  day was breaking when they awoke and stretched their stiffened limbs for the air was fresh with a suspicion of moisture in it two or three small craft were like them selves riding at anchor their decks wet and deserted others were getting under way to take advantage of the tide which had just turned  up with the anchor said the skipper seizing a handspike and thrusting it into the windlass  as the rusty chain came in an ominous growling came from below and bill snatched his handspike out and raised it aloft the skipper gazed meditatively at the shore and the dog as it came bounding up gazed meditatively at the handspike then it yawned an easy unconcerned yawn and commenced to pace the deck and coming to the conclusion that the men were only engaged in necessary work regarded their efforts with a lenient eye and barked encouragingly as they hoisted the sail  it was a beautiful morning the miniature river waves broke against the blunt bows of the barge and passed by her sides rippling musically over the flat essex marshes a white mist was slowly dispersing before the rays of the sun and the trees on the kentish hills were black and drenched with moisture  a little later smoke issued from the tiny cowl over the fo’c’sle and rolled in a little pungent cloud to the kentish shore then a delicious odour of frying steak rose from below and fell like healing balm upon the susceptible nostrils of the skipper as he stood at the helm  is mrs bunker getting up inquired the mate as he emerged from the fo’c’sle and walked aft  i believe so said the skipper there’s movements below  ’cos the steak’s ready and waiting said the mate i’ve put it on a dish in front of the fire  ay ay said the skipper  the mate lit his pipe and sat down on the hatchway slowly smoking he removed it a couple of minutes later to stare in bewilderment at the unwonted behaviour of the dog which came up to the captain and affectionately licked his hands  he’s took quite a fancy to me said the delighted man  love me love my dog quoted bill waggishly as he strolled forward again  the skipper was fondly punching the dog which was now on its back with its four legs in the air when he heard a terrible cry from the fo’c’sle and the mate came rushing wildly on deck  where’s that ———— dog he cried  don’t you talk like that aboard my ship where’s your manners cried the skipper hotly  —— the manners said the mate with tears in his eyes where’s that dog’s manners he’s eaten all that steak  before the other could reply the scuttle over the cabin was drawn and the radiant face of mrs bunker appeared at the opening  i can smell breakfast she said archly  no wonder with that dog so close said bill grimly mrs bunker looked at the captain for an explanation  he’s ate it said that gentleman briefly a pound and a ’arf o’ the best rump steak in wapping  never mind said mrs bunker sweetly cook some more i can wait  cook some more said the skipper to the mate who still lingered  i’ll cook some bloaters that’s all we’ve got now replied the mate sulkily  it’s a lovely morning said mrs bunker as the mate retired the air is so fresh i expect that’s what has made rover so hungry he isn’t a greedy dog not at all  very likely said codd as the dog rose and after sniffing the air gently wagged his tail and trotted forward where’ she off to now  he can smell the bloaters i expect said mrs bunker laughing it’s wonderful what intelligence he’s got come here rover  bill cried the skipper warningly as the dog continued on his way look out he’s coming  call him off yelled the mate anxiously call him off  mrs bunker ran up and seizing her chaperon by the collar hauled him away  it’s the sea air said she apologetically and he’s been on short commons lately because he’s not been well keep still rover  keep still rover said the skipper with an air of command  under this joint control the dog sat down his tongue lolling out and his eyes fixed on the fo’c’sle until the breakfast was spread the appearance of the mate with a dish of steaming fish excited him again and being chidden by his mistress he sat down sulkily in the skipper’s plate until pushed off by its indignant owner  soft roe bill inquired the skipper courteously after he had served his passenger  that’s not my plate said the mate pointedly as the skipper helped him  oh i wasn’t noticing said the other reddening  i was though said the mate rudely i thought you’d do that i was waiting for it i’m not going to eat after animals if you are  the skipper coughed and after effecting the desired exchange proceeded with his breakfast in sombre silence  the barge was slipping at an easy pace through the water the sun was bright and the air cool and everything pleasant and comfortable until the chaperon who had been repeatedly pushed away broke through the charmed circle which surrounded the food and seized a fish in the confusion which ensued he fell foul of the teakettle and dropping his prey bit the skipper frantically until driven off by his mistress  naughty boy said she giving him a few slight cuffs has he hurt you i must get a bandage for you  a little said codd looking at his hand which was bleeding profusely there’s a little linen in the locker down below if you wouldn’t mind tearing it up for me  mrs bunker giving the dog a final slap went below and the two men looked at each other and then at the dog which was standing at the stern barking insultingly at a passing steamer  it’s about time she came over said the mate throwing a glance at the sail then at the skipper then at the dog  so it is said the skipper through his set teeth  as he spoke he pushed the long tiller hastily from port to starboard and the dog finished his bark in the water the huge sail reeled for a moment then swung violently over to the other side and the barge was on a fresh tack with the dog twenty yards astern he was wise in his generation and after one look at the barge made for the distant shore  murderers screamed a voice murderers you’ve killed my dog  it was an accident i didn’t see him stammered the skipper  don’t tell me stormed the lady i saw it all through the skylight  we had to shift the helm to get out of the way of a schooner said codd  where’s the schooner demanded mrs bunker where is it  the captain looked at the mate where’s the schooner said he  i b’leeve said the mate losing his head entirely at this question i b’leeve we must have run her down i don’t see her nowhere about  mrs bunker stamped her foot and with a terrible glance at the men descended to the cabin from this coign of vantage she obstinately refused to budge and sat in angry seclusion until the vessel reached ipswich late in the evening then she appeared on deck dressed for walking and utterly ignoring the woebegone codd stepped ashore and obtaining a cab for her boxes drove silently away  an hour afterwards the mate went to his home leaving the captain sitting on the lonely deck striving to realise the bitter fact that so far as the end he had in view was concerned he had seen the last of mrs bunker and the small but happy home in which he had hoped to install her     a harbour of refuge     a waterman’s boat was lying in the river just below greenwich the waterman resting on his oars while his fare a small perturbedlooking man in seaman’s attire gazed expectantly up the river  there she is he cried suddenly as a small schooner came into view from behind a big steamer take me alongside  nice little thing she is too said the waterman watching the other out of the corner of his eye as he bent to his oars rides the water like a duck her cap’n knows a thing or two i’ll bet  he knows watermen’s fares replied the passenger coldly  look out there cried a voice from the schooner and the mate threw a line which the passenger skilfully caught  the waterman ceased rowing and as his boat came alongside the schooner held out his hand to his passenger who had already commenced to scramble up the side and demanded his fare it was handed down to him  it’s all right then said the fare as he stood on the deck and closed his eyes to the painful language in which the waterman was addressing him nobody been inquiring for me  not a soul said the mate what’s all the row about  well you see it’s this way said the master of the frolic dropping his voice i’ve been taking a little too much notice of a little craft down battersea way—nice little thing an’ she thought i was a single man dy’e see  the mate sucked his teeth  she introduced me to her brother as a single man continued the skipper he asked me when the banns was to be put up an’ i didn’t like to tell him i was a married man with a family  why not asked the mate  he’s a prizefighter said the other in aweinspiring tones ’the battersea bruiser’ consequently when he clapped me on the back and asked me when the banns was to be i only smiled  what did he do inquired the mate who was becoming interested  put ’em up groaned the skipper an’ we all went to church to hear ’em talk o’ people walking over your grave george it’s nothing to what i felt—nothing i felt a hypocrite almost somehow he found out about me and i’ve been hiding ever since i sent you that note he told a pal he was going to give me a licking and come down to fairhaven with us and make mischief between me and the missis  that ’ud be worse than the licking said the mate sagely  ah and she’d believe him afore she would me too an’ we’ve been married seventeen years said the skipper mournfully  perhaps that’s—began the mate and stopped suddenly  perhaps what inquired the other after waiting a reasonable time for him to finish  h’m i forgot what i was going to say said the mate funny it’s gone now well you’re all right now you’d intended this to be the last trip to london for some time  yes that’s what made me a bit more loving than i should ha’ been mused the skipper however all’s well that ends well how did you get on about the cook did you ship one  yes i’ve got one but he’s only signed as far as fairhaven replied the mate fine strong chap he is he’s too good for a cook i never saw a better built man in my life it’ll do your eyes good to look at him here cook  at the summons a huge closecropped head was thrust out of the galley and a man of beautiful muscular development stepped out before the eyes of the paralyzed skipper and began to remove his coat  ain’t he a fine chap said the mate admiringly show him your biceps cook  with a leer at the captain the cook complied he then doubled his fists and ducking his head scientifically danced all round the stupefied master of the frolic  put your dooks up he cried warningly i’m going to dot you  what the deuce are you up to cook demanded the mate who had been watching his proceedings in speechless amazement  cook said the person addressed with majestic scorn i’m no cook i’m bill simmons the ’battersea bruiser’ an’ i shipped on this ere little tub all for your dear captin’s sake i’m going to put sich a ’ed on ’im that when he wants to blow his nose he’ll have to get a lookingglass to see where to go to i’m going to give ’im a licking every day and when we get to fairhaven i’m going to foller ’im ’ome and tell his wife about ’im walking out with my sister  she walked me out said the skipper with dry lips  put ’em up vociferated the bruiser  don’t you touch me my lad said the skipper dodging behind the wheel go an’ see about your work—go an’ peel the taters  wot roared the bruiser  you’ve shipped as cook aboard my craft said the skipper impressively if you lay a finger on me it’s mutiny and you’ll get twelve months  that’s right said the mate as the pugilist who had once had fourteen days for bruising and still held it in wholesome remembrance paused irresolute it’s mutiny and it’ll also be my painful duty to get up the shotgun and blow the top of your ugly ’ed off  would it be mutiny if i was to dot you one inquired the bruiser in a voice husky with emotion as he sidled up to the mate  it would said the other hastily  well you’re a nice lot said the disgusted bruiser you and your mutinies will any one of you have a go at me  there was no response from the crew who had gathered round and were watching the proceedings with keen enjoyment  or all of yer asked the bruiser raising his eyebrows  i’ve got no quarrel with you my lad the boy remarked with dignity as he caught the new cook’s eye  go and cook the dinner’ said the skipper and look sharp about it i don’t want to have to find fault with a young beginner like you but i don’t have no shirkers aboard—understand that  for one moment of terrible suspense the skipper’s life hung in the balance then the bruiser restraining his natural instincts by a mighty effort retreated growling to the galley  the skipper’s breath came more freely  he don’t know your address i s’pose said the mate  no but he’ll soon find it out when we get ashore replied the other dolefully when i think that i’ve got to take that brute to my home to make mischief i feel tempted to chuck him overboard almost  it is a temptation agreed the mate loyally closing his eyes to his chief’s physical deficiencies i’ll pass the word to the crew not to let him know your address anyhow  the morning passed quietly the skipper striving to look unconcerned as the new cook grimly brought the dinner down to the cabin and set it before him after toying with it a little while the master of the frolic dined off buttered biscuit  it was a matter of much discomfort to the crew that the new cook took his duties very seriously and prided himself on his cooking he was moreover disposed to be inconveniently punctilious about the way in which his efforts were regarded for the first day the crew ate in silence but at dinnertime on the second the storm broke  what are yer looking at your vittles like that for inquired the bruiser of sam dowse as that ablebodied seaman sat with his plate in his lap eyeing it with much disfavour that ain’t the way to look at your food after i’ve been perspiring away all the morning cooking it  yes you’ve cooked yourself instead of the meat said sam warmly it’s a shame to spoil good food like that it’s quite raw  you eat it said the bruiser fiercely that’s wot you’ve go to do eat it  for sole answer the indignant sam threw a piece at him and the rest of the crew snatching up their dinners hurriedly clambered into their bunks and viewed the fray from a safe distance  have you ’ad enough inquired the bruiser addressing the head of sam which protruded from beneath his left arm  i ’ave said sam surlily  and you won’t turn up your nose at good vittles any more inquired the bruiser severely  i won’t turn it up at anything said sam earnestly as he tenderly felt the member in question  you’re the only one as ’as complained said the bruiser you’re dainty that’s wot you are look at the others—look how they’re eating theirs  at this hint the others came out of their bunks and fell to and the bruiser became affable  it’s wonderful wot i can turn my ’and to he remarked pleasantly things come natural to me that other men have to learn you ’d better put a bit of raw beef on that eye o’ yours sam  the thoughtless sam clapped on a piece from his plate and it was only by the active intercession of the rest of the crew that the sensitive cook was prevented from inflicting more punishment  from this time forth the bruiser ruled the roost and his temper soured by his trials ruled it with a rod of iron the crew with the exception of dowse were small men getting into years and quite unable to cope with him his attitude with the skipper was dangerously deferential and the latter was sorely perplexed to think of a way out of the mess in which he found himself  he means business george he said one day to the mate as he saw the bruiser watching him intently from the galley  he looks at you worse an’ worse was the mate’s cheering reply the cooking’s spoiling what little temper he’s got left as fast as possible  it’s the scandal i’m thinking of groaned the skipper all becos’ i like to be a bit pleasant to people  you mustn’t look at the black side o’ things said the mate perhaps you won’t want to need to worry about that after he’s hit you i’d sooner be kicked by a horse myself he was telling them down for’ard the other night that he killed a chap once  the skipper turned green he ought to have been hung for it he said vehemently i wonder what juries think they’re for in this country if i’d been on the jury i’d ha’ had my way if they’d starved me for a month  look here said the mate suddenly i’ve got an idea you go down below and i’ll call him up and start rating him when i’m in the thick of it you come and stick up for him  george said the skipper with glistening eyes you’re a wonder lay it on thick and if he hits you i’ll make it up to you in some way  he went below and the mate after waiting for some time leaned over the wheel and shouted for the cook  what do you want growled the bruiser as he thrust a visage all red and streaky with his work from the galley  why the devil don’t you wash them saucepans up demanded the mate pointing to a row which stood on the deck do you think we shipped you becos we wanted a brokennosed tenthrate prizefighter to look at  tenthrate roared the bruiser coming out on to the deck  don’t you roar at your officer said the mate sternly your manners is worse than your cooking you’d better stay with us a few trips to improve ’em  the bruiser turned purple and shivered with impotent wrath  we get a parcel o’ pothouse loafers aboard here continued the mate airily addressing the atmosphere and blank my eyes if they don’t think they’re here to be waited on you’ll want me to wash your face for you next and do all your other dirty work you—  george said a sad reproving voice  the mate started dramatically as the skipper appeared at the companion and stopped abruptly  for shame george said the skipper i never expected to hear you talk to anybody like that especially to my friend mr simmons  your wot demanded the friend hotly  my friend repeated the other gently and as to tenthrate prizefighters george the ’battersea bruiser’ might be champion of england if he’d only take the trouble to train  oh you’re always sticking up for him said the artful mate  he deserves it said the skipper warmly he’s always run straight ’as bill simmons and when i hear ’im being talked at like that it makes me go ’ot all over  don’t you take the trouble to go ’ot all over on my account said the bruiser politely  i can’t help my feelings bill said the skipper softly  and don’t you call me bill roared the bruiser with sudden ferocity d’ye think i mind what you and your little tinpot crew say you wait till we get ashore my friend and the mate too both of you wait  he turned his back on them and walked off to the galley from which with a view of giving them an objectlesson of an entertaining kind he presently emerged with a small sack of potatoes which he slung from the boom and used as a punching ball dealing blows which made the master of the frolic sick with apprehension  it’s no good he said to the mate kindness is thrown away on that man  well if he hits one he’s got to hit the lot said the mate we’ll all stand by you  i can’t always have the crew follering me about said the skipper dejectedly no he’ll wait his opportunity and after he’s broke my head he’ll go ’ome and break up my wife’s ’art  she won’t break ’er ’art said the mate confidently she and you’ll have a rough time of it p’raps it would be better for you if she did break it a bit but she’s not that sort of woman well those of us as live longest’ll see the most  for the remainder of that day the cook maintained a sort of unnatural calm the frolic rose and fell on the seas like a cork and the bruiser took short unpremeditated little runs about the deck which aggravated him exceedingly between the runs he folded his arms on the side and languidly cursed the sea and all that belonged to it and finally having lost all desire for food himself went below and turned in  he stayed in his bunk the whole of the next day and night awaking early the following morning to the pleasant fact that the motion had ceased and that the sides and floor of the fo’c’sle were in the places where people of regular habits would expect to find them the other bunks were empty and after a toilet hastened by a yearning for nourishment he ran up on deck  day had just broken and he found to his surprise that the voyage was over and the schooner in a small harbour lying alongside a stone quay a few unloaded trucks stood on a railway line which ran from the harbour to the town clustered behind it but there was no sign of work or life the good people of the place evidently being comfortably in their beds and in no hurry to quit them  the bruiser with a happy smile on his face surveyed the scene sniffing with joy the smell of the land as it came fresh and sweet from the hills at the back of the town there was only one thing wanting to complete his happiness—the skipper  where’s the cap’n he demanded of dowse who was methodically coiling a line  just gone ’ome replied dowse shortly  in a great hurry the bruiser sprang on to the side and stepped ashore glancing keenly in every direction for his prey there was no sign of it and he ran a little way up the road until he saw the approaching figure of a man from whom he hoped to obtain information then happening to look back he saw the masts of the schooner gliding by the quay and retracing his steps a little perceived to his intense surprise the figure of the skipper standing by the wheel  ta ta cookie cried the skipper cheerily  angry and puzzled the bruiser ran back to the edge of the quay and stood owlishly regarding the schooner and the grinning faces of its crew as they hoisted the sails and slowly swung around with their bow pointing to the sea  well they ain’t making a long stay old man said a voice at his elbow as the man for whom he had been waiting came up why they only came in ten minutes ago what did they come in for do you know  they belong here said the bruiser but me and the skipper’s had words and i’m waiting for ’im  that craft don’t belong here said the stranger as he eyed the receding frolic  yes it does said the bruiser  i tell you it don’t said the other i ought to know  look here my friend said the bruiser grimly don’t contradict me that’s the frolic of fairhaven  very likely said the man i don’t know where she’s from but she’s not from here  why said the bruiser and his voice shook ain’t this fairhaven  lord love you no said the stranger not by a couple o’ hundred miles it ain’t wot put that idea into your silly fat head  the frantic bruiser raised his fist at the description but at that moment the crew of the frolic which was just getting clear of the harbour hung over the stern and gave three hearty cheers the stranger was of a friendly and excitable disposition and his evil star being in the ascendant that morning he took off his hat and cheered wildly back immediately afterwards he obtained unasked the post of whippingboy to the master of the frolic and entered upon his new duties at once                                    ————
