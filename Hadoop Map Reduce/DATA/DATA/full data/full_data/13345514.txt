 chapter v     spinney lawn  chapter vi    the white does warning  chapter vii   hunting  chapter viii  duck shooting  chapter ix    trevors legacy      chapter i  sault st pierre   i write this by desire of my brothers and sisters that if any reports of our strange family history should come down to after generations the thing may be properly understood  the old times at trevorsham seem to me so remote that i can hardly believe that we are the same who were so happy then  nay jaquetta laughs and declares that it is not possible to be happier than we have been since and fulk would have me remember that all was not always smooth even in those days  perhaps notfor him at least dear fellow in those latter times but when i think of the old home the worst troubles that rise before me are those of the backboard and the stocks french in the schoolroom and miss simmonds lady ursula think of your position  and as to jaquetta she was born under a more benignant star  nobody could have put a backboard on her any more than on a kitten  our mother had died oh how happily for herself when jaquetta was a baby and miss simmonds most carefully ruled not only over us but over adela brainerd my fathers ward who was brought up with us because she had no other relation in the world  besides my father wished her to marry one of my brothers  it would have done very well for either torwood or bertram but unluckily as it seemed neither of them could take to the notion  she was a dear little thing to be sure and we were all very fond of her but as bertram said it would have been like marrying jaquetta and torwood had other views to which my father would not then listen  then bertrams regiment was ordered to canada and that was the real cause of it all though we did not know it till long after  bertram was starting out on a sporting expedition with a canadian gentleman when about ten miles from montreal they halted at a farm with a good wellbuilt house named sault st pierre all looking prosperous and comfortable and a young farmer american in his waysfreespoken familiar and bluntbut very kindly and friendly was at work there with some frenchcanadian labourers  bertrams friend knew him and often halted there on hunting expeditions so they went into the housevery nicely furnished a pretty parlour with muslin curtains a piano and everything pleasant and joel lea called his wife a handsome fair young woman bertram says from the first she put him in mind of some one and he was trying to make out who it could be  then came the wifes mother a neat little delicate bent woman with dark eyes that looked bertram said as if they had had some great fright and never recovered it  they called her mrs dayman  she was silent at first and only helped her daughter and the maid to get the dinner and an excellent dinner it was but she kept on looking at bertram and she quite started when she heard him called mr trevor when they were just rising up and going to take leave she came up to him in a frightened agitated manner as if she could not help it and said  sir you are so like a gentleman i once knew  was any relation of yours ever in canada  my father was in canada answered bertram  oh no she said then very much affected the captain trevor i knew was killed in the lake campaign in 1814  it must be a mistake yet you put me in mind of him so strangely  then bertram protested that she must mean my father for that he had been a captain in the th and had been stationed at york as toronto was then called but was badly wounded in repulsing the american attack on the lakes in 1814  not dead she asked with her cheeks getting pale and a sort of excitement about her that made bertram wonder at the moment if there could have been any old attachment between them and he explained how my father was shipped off from england between life and death and how when he recovered he found his uncle dying and the title and property coming to him  and he married she said with a bewildered look and bertram told her that he had married lady mary luptonas his uncle and father had wishedand how we four were their children  i can fancy how kindly and tenderly bertram would speak when he saw that she was anxious and pained and she took hold of his hand and held him and when he said something of mentioning that he had seen her she cried out with a sort of terror oh no no mr trevor i beg you will not  let him think me dead as i thought him  and then she drew down bertrams tall head to her and fairly kissed his forehead adding i could not help it sir an old womans kiss will do you no harm  then he went away  he never did tell us of the meeting till long after  he was not a great letter writer and besides he thought my father might not wish to have the flirtations of his youth brought up against him  so we little knew  but it seems that the daughter and soninlaw were just as much amazed as bertram and when he was gone and the poor old lady sank into her chair and burst out crying and as they came and asked who or what this was she sobbed out your brother hester  oh so like himmy husband or something to that effect as unawares  she wanted to take it back again but of course hester would not let her and made her tell the whole  it seems that her name was faith le blanc she was half english half frenchcanadian and lived in a village in a very unsettled part where captain trevor used to come to hunt and where he made love to her and ended by marrying herwith the knowledge of her family and his brother officers but not of his familyjust before he was ordered to the lake frontier  the war had stirred up the indians to acts of violence they had not committed for many years and a tribe of them came down on the village plundering burning killing and torturing those whom they had known in friendly intercourse  faith le blanc had once given some milk to a papoose upon its mothers back and perhaps for this reason she was spared but everyone belonging to her was she believed destroyed and she was carried away by the tribe who wanted to make her one of themselves and she knew that if she offended them such horrors as she had seen practised on others would come on her  however they had gone to another resort of theirs where there was a young hunter who often visited them and was on friendly terms  when he found that there was a white woman living as a captive among them he spared no effort to rescue her  both he and she were often in exceeding danger but he contrived her escape at last and brought her through the woods to a place of safety and there her child was born  it was over the american frontier and it was long before she could write to her husband  she never knew what became of her letter but the hunter friend piers dayman showed her an american paper which mentioned captain trevor among the officers killed in their attack dayman was devoted to her and insisted on marrying her and bringing up her daughter as his own  i fancy she was a woman of gentle passive temper and had been crushed and terrified by all she had gone through so as to have little instinct left but that of clinging to the protector who had taken her up when she had lost everything else and she married him  nor did hester guess till that very day that piers dayman was not her father  there were other children sons who have given themselves to hunting and trapping in the hudsons bay companys territory but hester remained the only daughter and they educated her well sending her to a convent at montreal where she learnt a good many accomplishments they were not roman catholics but it was the only way of getting an education  dayman must have been a warmhearted tenderly affectionate person hester loved him very much but he had lived a wild sportsmans life and never was happy at rest  they changed home often and at last he was snowed up and frozen to death with one of his boys on a bear hunting expedition  not very long after hester married this sturdy american joel lea who had bought some land on the canadian side of the border and her mother came home to live with them  they had been married four or five years but none of their children had lived  so it was when the discovery came upon poor old mrs dayman i do not know what else to call her that fulk torwood trevor the husband of her youth was not dead but was earl of trevorsham married and the father of four children in england  poor old thing  she would have buried her secret to the last as much in pity and love to him as in shame and grief for herself and consideration too for the sons for whom the discovery was only less bad than for us as they had less to lose  hester herself hardly fully understood what it all involved and it only gradually grew on her  that winter her mother fell ill and mr lea felt it right that the small property she had had for her life should be properly secured to her sons according to the division their father had intended  so a lawyer was brought from montreal and her will was made  thus another person knew about it and he was much struck and explained to hester that she was really a lady of rank and probably the only child of her father who had any legal claim to his estates  lea with a good deal of the old american republican temper would not be stirred up he despised lords and ladies and would none of it but the lawyer held that it would be doing wrong not to preserve the record  hester had grown excited and seconded him and one day when lea was out the lawyer brought a magistrate to take mrs daymans affidavit as to all her past historymarriage witnesses and all  she was a good deal overcome and agitated and quite implored hester never to use the knowledge against her father but she must have been always a passive docile being and they made her tell all that was wanted and sign her deposition as she had signed her will as faith trevor commonly known as faith dayman  she did not live many days after  it was on the 3rd of february 1836 that she died and in the course of the summer hester had a son who throve as none of her babies had done  then she lay and brooded over him and the rights she fancied he was deprived of till she worked herself up to a strong and fixed purpose and insisted upon making all known to her father  now that her mother was gone she persuaded herself that he had been a cruel faithless tyrant who had wilfully deserted his young wife  joel lea would not listen to her  why should she wish to make his son a goodfornothing english lord  that was his view  nothing but misery distress and temptation could come of not letting things alone  he held to that and there were no means forthcoming either of coming to england to present herself  the family were well to do but had no ready money to lay out on a passage across the atlantic nor would hester wait  she had persuaded herself that a letter would be suppressed even if she had known how to address it but to claim her sons rights and make an earl of him had become her fixed idea and she began laying aside every farthing in her power  in this she was encouraged not by the lawyer who had made the willand who considering that poor faiths witnesses had been destroyed and her certificate and her wedding ring taken from her by the indians thought that the marriage could not be substantiatedbut by a clever young clerk who had managed to find out the state of things a man named perrault who used to come to the farm always when lea was out and talk her into a further state of excitement about her childs expectations and the injuries she was suffering it was her one idea  she says she really believes she should have gone mad if the saving had not occupied her and a very dreary life poor joel must have had whilst she was scraping together the passagemoney  he still steadily and sternly disapproved the whole and when at two years end she had put together enough to bring her and her boy home and maintain them there for a few weeks he still refused to go with her  the last thing he said was remember hester what was the price of all the kingdoms of the world  thou wilt have it then  would that i could say my blessing go with thee  and he took his child and held him long in his arms and never spoke one word over him but my poor boy     chapter ii  trevorsham   i suppose i had better tell what we had been doing all this time adela and i had come out and had a season or two in london and my father had enjoyed our pleasure in it and paid a good deal of court to our pretty adela because there was no driving torwood into anything warmer than easy brotherly companionship  in fact torwood had never cared for anyone but little emily deerhurst once he had come to her rescue when she was only nine or ten years old and her schoolboy cousins were teasing her and at every twelfthday party since she and he had come together as by right there was something irresistible in her great soft plaintive brown eyes though she was scarcely pretty otherwise and we used to call her the white doe of rylstone  torwood was six or seven years older and no one supposed that he seriously cared for her till she was sixteen then when my father spoke point blank to him about adela he was driven into owning what he wished  my father thought it utter absurdity  the connection was not pleasant to him mrs deerhurst was always looked on as a designing widow who managed to marry off her daughters cleverly and he could believe no good of emily  now adela always had more power with papa than any of us  she had a coaxing way which his stately oldschool courtesy never could resist she used when we were children to beg for holidays and get treats for us and even now many a request which we should never have dared to utter she could with her droll arch way make him think the most sensible thing in the world  what odd things people can do who have lived together like brothers and sisters  i can hardly help laughing when i think of torwood coming disconsolately up from the library and replying in answer to our vigorous demands that his lordship had some besotted notion past all reason  then we pressed him harderadela with indignation and i with sympathytill we forced out of him that he had been forbidden ever to think or speak again of emily and all his faith in her laughed to scorn as delusions induced by mrs deerhurst  im sure i hope youll take ormerod adela i remember he ended then at least you would be out of the way  for sir john ormerods courtship was an evident fact to all the family as indeed adela was heiress enough to be a good deal troubled with suitors though she had hitherto managed to make them all keep their distance  adela laughed at him for his kind wishes but i could see she meant to plead for him  she had her chance for sir john ormerod brought matters to a crisis at the next ball and though she thought as she said she had settled him he followed it up with her guardian and adela was invited to a conference in the library  it happened that as she ran upstairs all in a glow she came on torwood at the landing  she couldnt help saying in her odd halflaughing halfcrying voice  it will come right torwood ive made terms im out of your way  not ormerod he exclaimed  oh no no  i can hear her dash of scorn now for i was just behind my brother but she went on out of breath  you may go on seeing her provided you dont say a wordtilltill shes been out two years  adela you queen of girls how have you done it he began but she thrust him aside and flew up into my arms and when i had her in her own room it came out i hardly know how that she had so shown that she cared for no one she had ever seen except my father that they found they did love each other andandin short they were going to be married  really it seemed much less wonderful then than it does in thinking of it afterwards  my father was much handsomer than any young man i ever saw with a hawk nose a clear rosy skin pure pink and white like a boys curly little rings of white hair blue eyes clear and bright as the sky a tall upright soldierly figure and a magnificent stately bearing courteous and grand to all but sweetly tender to a very few and to her above all  it always had been so ever since he had brought her home an orphan of six years old from her mothers deathbed at nice  and he was youthful could ride or hunt all day without so much fatigue as either of his sons and was as fresh and eager in all his ways as a lad  and she our pretty darling  i dont think torwood and i in the least felt the incongruity of her becoming our stepmother only that papa was making her more entirely his own  i am glad we did not mar the sunshine  it did not last long  she came home thoroughly unwell from their journey to switzerland and never got better  by the time the spring had come round again she was lying in the vault at trevorsham and we were trying to keep poor little alured alive and help my poor father to bear it  he was stricken to the very heart and never was the same man again his age seemed to come upon him all at once and whereas at sixtyfive he had been like a man ten years younger he suddenly became like one ten years older and though he never was actually ill he failed from month to month  he could not bear the sight or sound of the poor baby  poor adela had scarcely lived to hear it was a boy and all she had said about it was ursula youll be his mother  and oh i have tried  if love would do it i think he could not be more even to dear adela  what a frail little life it was  what nights and days we had with him doctors saying that skill could not do it but care might and nurses knowing how to be more effective than i could be yet while i durst not touch him i could not bear not to see him  and i do think i was the first person he began to know  meantime there was a great difference in torwood  he had been very much of a big boy hitherto  no one but myself could have guessed that he cared for much besides a lazy kind of enjoyment of all the best and nicest things in this world  he did what he was told but in an uninterested sort of way just as if politics and county business and work at the estate were just as much tasks thrust on him as virgil and homer had been and put his spirit into sporting c  but when he was allowed to think hopefully of emily it seemed to make a man of him and he took up all that he had to do as if it really concerned him and was not only a burden laid on him by his father  and as my father became less able to exert himself torwood came forward more and was something substantial to lean upon  dear fellow i am sure he did well earn the consent he gained at last though not with much satisfaction from papa  emily had grown into great sweetness and grace and mrs deerhurst had gone on very well  of course people were unkind enough to say it was only because she had such prey in view as lord torwood but whatever withheld her it is certain that emily only had the most suitable and reasonable pleasures for a young lady and was altogether as nice and gentle and sensible as could be desired there never was a bit of acting in her she was only allowed to grow in what seemed natural to her  she was just one of the nice simple girls of that day doing her quiet bit of solid reading and her practice and her neat little smooth pencil drawing from a print as a kind of duty to her accomplishments every day and filling books with neat upanddown ms copies of all the poetry that pleased her dainty in all her ways timid submissive and as it seemed to me colourless  but fulk taught her wordsworth who was his great passion then and found her a perfect listener to all his tory hopes fears and usages  papa could not help liking her when she came to stay with us after they were engaged at the end of two years  he allowed that away from her mother and all her belongings she would do very well and she was so pretty and sweet in her respectful fear of himi might almost say awethat his graceful chivalrous courtesy woke up again and he was beginning absolutely to enjoy her as she became a little more confident and understood him better  how well i remember that last evening  i was happier than i had been for weeks about little alured the convulsions had quite gone off the teeth that had caused them were through and he had been laughing and playing on my lap quite brightlycooing to his mothers miniature in my locket  he was such an intelligent little fellow for eighteen months  i came down so glad and it was so pleasant to see emily in her white dress leaning over my father while he had gone so happily into his old delight of showing his prints and engravings and torwood standing by the fire watching them with the look of a conqueror and jaquettalike the absurd child she loved to beteasing them with ridiculous questions about their housekeeping  they were to have spinney lawn bought for them just a mile away and the business was in hand  jacquey was enquiring whether there was a parlour for the cid torwoods hunter whom she declared was as dear to him as emily herself  indeed emily did go out every morning after breakfast to feed him with bread  i can see her now on torwoods arm with big rollo and little malta rolling over one another after them  then came an afternoon when we had all walked to spinney lawn laid out the gardens together and wandered about the empty rooms planning for them  the birds were singing in the march sunshine and the tomtits were calling peter in the trees and jaquetta went racing about after the dogs like a thing of seven years old instead of seventeen  and torwood was cutting out a root of primroses leaves and all for emily when we saw a fly go along the lane and wondered with a sort of idle wonder  we supposed it must be visitors for the parsonage and so we strolled home looking for violets by the way and jaquetta getting shiny studs of celandine ah i remember those glistening stars were all closed before we came back  well it must come so it is silly to linger  there stood the fly at the halldoor and the butler met us saying  theres a person with his lordship my lord  she would not wait till you came in though i told her he saw no one on business without you  torwood hastened on before this expecting to see some importunate person bothering my father with a petition  what he did see was my father leaning back in his chair with a white confounded bewildered look and a woman with a child on her lap opposite  her back was to the door and torwoods first impression was that she was a welldressed impostor threatening him so he came quickly to my fathers side and said  what is it father  im here  my poor father put out his hand feebly to him and said  it is all true torwood  god forgive me i did not know it  know what he asked anxiously  what is it that distresses you father  let me speak to this person  then she broke outnot loud not coarsely but very determinatelyno sir you would be very glad to suppress me and my child and my evidence no doubt but the earl of trevorsham has acknowledged the truth of my claim and i will not leave this spot till he has acknowledged my mother as his only lawful wife and my child trevor lea as his only lawful heir  torwood thought her insane and only said quietly as he offered my father his arm i will talk it over with you presently lord trevorsham is not equal to discuss it now  i see what you mean she said quickly  you would like to make me out crazy but lord trevorsham knows better  do not you my father she said with a strong emphasis the more marked because it was concentrated not loud  my poor father was shuddering all over with involuntary trembling but he put torwoods hand away from him and looked up piteously as if his heart was breaking as it was but he spoke steadily  it is true it is true torwood  i was married to poor faith when i was a young man in canada  they sent me proofs that all had perished when the indians attacked the village but and then he put his hands over his face  it must have been dreadful to see but hester lea was too much bent on her rights to feel a moments pity and she spoke on in a hard tone with her eyes fixed on my brothers face  but you failed to discover that she was rescued from the indians gave birth to me your daughter hester and only died two years ago  you hear  my boy my poor boy forgive me dont leave me to her was what my poor father had saidhe who had been so strong  my brother saw what it all meant now  never fear that sir he said i am your son still any way you know  you will do justice to me she began in her fierce tone but my brother met it calmly with certainly we will do our best that justice should be done  you have brought proof  his quietness overawed her and she pointed to the papers on the table they were her mothers attested narrative and the certificate of her burial  my brother read aloud the 3rd of february 1836 then he turned to my father and said you observe father the difference this may make if true is that of putting little alured into the place i have held my fathers last marriage was on the 15th of april 1836 he added to her  he says she quite glared at him with mortification as if he had invented poor little alured on purpose to baffle her but my father breathed more freely  and is nothingnothing to be done for my child your own grandson exclaimed she after these years  torwood silenced her by one of his looks  we only wish to do justice he said if it be as you say you will have a right to a great deal and it will not be disputed but you must be aware that a claim made in this manner requires investigation and you can see that my father is not in a state for an exciting discussion  your father she said with a bitter tone of scorn but he took it firmly though the blood seemed to come boiling to his temples  yes he said my father and if you are indeed his daughter you should show some pity and filial duty by not forcing the discussion on him while he can so little bear it  that staggered her a little but she said i do not wish to do him any harm but i have my childs interests to think of  how do i know what advantage may be taken against him  torwood saw my father lying back in the chair trembling and he dreaded a fit every moment  i give you my word he said that no injustice shall be done you and as she looked keenly at him as if she distrusted him he said yes you may trust me  i was bred an english gentleman whatever i was born and i promise you never to come between you and your rights when your identity as lord trevorshams daughter is fully established meantime do you not see that your presence is killing him  tell me where you may be heard of  i shall stay at the shinglebay hotel till i am secure of the justice i claim she said  come my boy since your own grandfather will not so much as look at you  torwood walked her across the hall  he was a little touched by those last words and felt that she might have looked for a daughters reception so he said in the hall  you must remember this is a very sudden shock to us all  when my father has grown accustomed to the idea no doubt he will wish to see you again but in his present state of health he must be our first consideration  and unprepared as my sisters are it would be impossible to ask you to stay in the house  she was always a little subdued by my brothers manner i think its courtesy and polish almost frightened her highspirited resolute woman as she was  i understand she said with a stiff cold tone  jaquetta heard the echo of it and wondered  but he added when they understand all and when my father is equal to it you shall be sent for  when he went back to the library he found my poor father unconscious it was really only fainting then and he came round without anyone being called and he shrank from seeing anyone but torwood explaining to him most earnestly how though he was too ill himself to go to the place his brotherofficer general poyntz had done so for him and had been persuaded that the whole settlement and all the inhabitants had been swept off  it was such a shock to him that it nearly killed him  poor father it was grievous to hear him wish it had quite done so  we only knew that the woman had upset my father very much and that torwood could not leave him  word was sent us to sit down to dinner without them and torwood sent for some gravy soup and some wine for him  he went on talkingsometimes about us but more often about poor faith who seemed to have come back on him in all the beauty and charm of his first love  he seemed to be talking himself feverish and after a time torwood thought that silence would be better for him so he got him to go to bed and sent good old blake the butler who had been his servant in the army to sit in the dressingroom blake it turned out had known all about the old story so he was a safe person  not that safety mattered much  lady hester leashe called herself so now as indeed she had every rightwas making it known at shinglebay  so torwood came out  i was very anxious of course and had been hovering about on the nursery stairs where i had gone to see whether baby was quietly asleep and i overtook him as he was going downstairs  how is papa i asked  i shall never forget the white look of the face he raised up to mine as he said poor father  ursula i can only call the news terrible will you try to stand up against it bravely  and then he held out his arms and gathered me into them and i believe i said i can bear anything when you do that  i thought it could only be something about bertram who had rather a way of getting into scrapes and i said his name but just as fulk was setting me at ease on that score jaquetta who was on the watch too opened the door of the green drawingroom and we were obliged to go in  then hardly answering her and emily as they asked after papa he stood straight up in the middle of the rug and told us beginning withursula did you know that our father had been married as a young man in canada  no we had never guessed it  he was my brother went on this is his daughter  our sister jaquetta asked  where has she been all this time  but i saw there must be more to trouble him and then it came  i cannot tell  my father had every reason to believe thatshehis first wifehad been killed in a massacre by the red indians but if what this person says is true she only died two years ago  but it was in all good faith that he married our mother  he had taken all means to discover  even then we did not perceive what this involved  i felt stunned and numbed chiefly from seeing the great shock it had been to my father and to him but poor little jaquetta and emily were altogether puzzled and jaquetta said but is this sister of ours such a very disagreeable person torwood  why didnt you bring her in and show her to us  then he exclaimed almost angrily at her simplicity good heavens girls dont you see what it all means  if this is true i am not torwood  we are nothingnobodynameless  he turned to the fire put both elbows on the mantelshelf and hid his face in his hands  emily sprang up and tried to draw down his arm and she did but he only used it to put her from him hold her off at arms length and look at heroh with such a tender face of firm sorrow  ah emily he said you too  it has been all on false pretences that will have to be all over now  then emilys great brown eyes grew bigger with wonder and dismay  false pretences she cried what false pretences  not that you cared for me torwood  not that i cared for you he said with a suppressed tone that made his voice so deep  not that i cared but that lord torwood didtorwood is the baby upstairs  but it is youyouyoufulk said emily trying to creep and sidle up to him white doe fashion  i believe nobody had ever called him by his christian name before and it made it sweeter to him but still he did not give in  ah thats all very well he said and his voice was softer then but what would your mother say  the same as i do said emily undauntedly  how should it change ones feelings one bit and she almost cried at being held back  he did let her nestle up to him then but with a sad sort of smile my child my darling he said i ought not to allow this  it will only be the worse after  but just then a servants step made them start back and a message came and brought word that mr blake would be glad if lord torwood would step up  yes my poor father was wandering in his speech and very feverish mixing up adela and faith le blanc strangely together sometimes and at others fancying he was lying ill with his wound and sending messages to faith  we sent for the doctor but he could not do anything really  it had been a deathblow though the illness lasted a full week  he knew us generally and liked to see us but he always had the sense that something dreadful had happened to us and he would stroke my hand or jaquettas and pity us  he was haunted too by the sense that he ought to do something for us which he could not do  we thought he meant to make a will securing us something but he was never in a condition in which my brother would have felt justified in getting him to sign it  indeed there was so little disease about him and we thought he would get better if only we could keep him free from distress and excitement so we made his room as quiet as possible and discouraged his talking or thinking  lady hester came every day  my brother had sent for mr eagles our solicitor to meet her the first time and look at her papers  he said he could not deny that it looked very bad for us  of the original marriage there was no doubt indeed my father had told torwood where to find the certificate of it folded up in the secret drawer of his desk with his commission in the army and the register of faiths burial was only too plain  the only chance there was for us was that her identity could not be established but mr eagles did not think it would go off on this  the whole of her life seemed to be traceable besides there was something about hester that forbade all suspicion of her being a conscious impostor  whether she would be able to prove herself my fathers daughter was another more doubtful point that however made no difference except as to her own rank and fortune  if the first wife were proved to have been alive till 1836 then little alured was the only true heir to the title and estate and next after him stood hester lea and her son  people said she was like the family i never could see it and always thought the likeness due to their imagination  she took one by surprise  she was a tall wellmade woman with a narrow waist and a proud peculiarly upright bearing though quick almost sharp in all her movements and especially with her eyes  those eyes i confess always startled me  they were clear bright blue well opened eyeshonest eyes one would have called themonly they appeared to be always searching about and darting at one when one least expected it the red and white of the face too always had a clear hard look like the eyes the teeth projected a little and were so very very white that they always seemed to me to flash like the eyes and if ever she smiled it was as much as to say i dont believe you  her nose had an amount of hook too that always gave me the feeling of having a wild hawk in the room with me  jaquetta used to call her a panther of the wilderness but to my mind there was none of the purring cattish tenderness of the panther  however that might be only because she viewed us as her natural enemies and was always on her guard against us though i do not well know why i am sure we only wanted to know the truth and do justice and fulk was so convinced that she would prove her case and that there was no help for it that at the end of hearing mr eagles question her he said well the matter must be tried in due time but since we are brothers and sisters let us be friendly and he held out his hand to her  mr eagles who told me said he could have beaten him for the imprudent admission only he did look so generous and sweet and sad and lady hester drew herself up doubtfully and proudly as if she could hardly bear to own such a brother but she did take his hand coldly though and saying let me see my father  he was obliged to tell her that this was impossible  i doubt whether she ever believed himat least she used to gaze at him with her determined eyes as if she meant to abash him out of falsehood and she sharply questioned every one about lord trevorshams state  the determination to be friendly made my brother offer to take her to us  she consented but not very readily and i am afraid we were needlessly cold and dry but we were taken by surprise when my brother brought her into the sittingroom  it was not very easy to welcome the woman who was going to turn us all out and under such a stigma and sheshe could hardly be expected to look complacently at the interlopers who had her place and the title she had a right to  she put us through her hard catechism about my dear fathers state and said at last that she should like to see lord torwood  taken by surprise we looked and signed towards him whom that name had always meant  he smiled a little and said little alured  but remember i am bound to concede nothing till judicial minds are convinced  the parties concerned cannot judge  can you venture to have baby down ursula  no i did not venture  i thought it might have been averted but i was only obliged to take her up to the nurseries  on the way up she asked which way my fathers room lay  i answered oh across there i did not know if she might not make a dash at it  i think she must have heard at shinglebay how delicate poor little alured was and thence gathered hopes of the succession for her boy for she asked her sharp questions about his health all the way up and knew that he had had fits  i could not put her down as one generally can inquisitive people  i suppose it was because she was more sensible of the difference in our real positions than i have as yet felt  baby was asleep and i think she was touched by the actual sight of him  she said he was very like her boy and though i supposed that a mere assertion at the time it was quite true  alured and trevor lea have always been remarkably alike  however she crossexamined nurse about his health even more minutely and then took her leave but she came again every day walking after the first as long as my dear father lived  and she must have talked for there came a kind of feeling over everyone as well as ourselves that something was hanging over us of which the issue would be known when my fathers illness took some turn  mr decies came every day to inquire but i could not bear a strange eye and hester might have been looking on  i was steeling myself against him  was i rightoh was i right  i have wondered and grieved  for i knew well enough what he had been thinking of for months before only i did not want it to come to a point  how was i to leave little alured to jaquetta or disturb my father by breaking up his home  i liked him on the whole and had come the length of thinking that if i ever married at all it would be but thats all nonsense and mine could not have been what other peoples love was or i should not have shrunk from the sight and look of him  if it had been only poverty that was coming it would have been a different thing but to be nameless impostors  mrs deerhurst had gone out on a round of visits when emily came to us taking her younger daughter  they were not a very letterwriting family  it is odd how some peoples pen is a real outlet of expression while others seem to lack the nerve that might convey their thoughts to it even when they live in more sympathy than emily could well have had with her mother  at least so i understand what afterwards we wondered at that emily never mentioned hester only saying when after some days she did write that lord trevorsham was ill  so fulk had the one comfort of being with her when he was out of the sick room  i used to see them from the window walking up and down the terrace in the blue east wind haze of those march days never that i could see speaking  i dont think my brother would have felt it honourable to tie one additional link between himself and her  he had not a doubt as to how her mother would act but to be in her dear little affectionate presence was a better help than we could give him even though nothing passed between them  jaquetta used to wonder at them and then try to go on the same as usual and would wander about the garden and park with her dogs and bring us in little anecdotes and do all the laughing over them herself  poor child she felt as if she were in a bad dream and these were efforts to shake it off and wake herself  after all nothing was ever so bad as those ten days  but my brother always said he was thankful for the respite and time for thought which they gave him     chapter iii  the peerage case   the end came suddenly at last when we were thinking my dear father more tranquil  he passed away in sleep late one evening just ten days after hesters arrival  she had gone back to her lodgings and we did not send to tell her till the morning but by nine oclock she was in the house  we had crept down to breakfast jaquetta and i feeling very dreary in the halflight and as if desolation had suddenly come on us and when we heard her fly drive up to the door jaquetta cried out almost angrily torwood how could you and we would have run away but he said stay dear girls it is better to have it over  as she came in he rang the bell as if for family prayers and she had only asked one or two questions which he answered shortly when all the servants came in some crying sadly  fulk read a very few prayersas much as he had voice for and then as all stood up he had to clear his voice but he spoke firmly enough  it is right that you all should know that a grave doubt has arisen as to my position here  lord trevorsham had every reason to believe his first wife had perished by the hands of the red indians long before he married my mother  what he did was done in entire ignoranceno breath of blame must light on him  this lady alleges that she can produce proofs that she is his daughter and that her mother only died in february 36  if these proofs be considered satisfactory by a committee of the house of lords then she and alured torwood trevor will be shown to be his only legitimate children  i shall place the matter in the right hands as soon as possiblethat is for she was glaring at him as soon as the funeral is over  until that decision is made i request that no one will call me by the title of him who is gone but i shall remain here to take care of my little brother whose guardian my father wished me to be and for the present at least i shall make no change in the establishment  i think everyone held their breath there was a great stillness over alla sort of hush of aweand then some of the maids began sobbing and the butler tried to say something but he quite broke down and just then a troubled voice cried out  torwood torwood what is this  and there we saw bertram in the midst of us with the haggard look of a man who had travelled all night and a dismayed air that i can never forget  he had been quartered at belfast and we had written to him the day after my fathers illness to summon him home but there were no telegraphs nor railways and there had been some hindrance about his leave so that it had taken all that length of time to bring him fulk had left all to be told on his arrival  he had come by the mailcoach and walked up from the trevorsham arms where he had been told of our fathers death and so had let himself in noiselessly and was standing in the diningroom door hearing all that fulk said  poor fellow  jaquetta flung herself on him hiding her face against him while the servants went and before any one else could speak hester stood forth and said to our amazement  captain trevor  you know me  you can and must bear me witness and do me justice  you  i have seen you beforebutwhere  i beg your pardon he said bewildered  you remember sault st pierre farm she said  sault st pierre  what  you are mrs lea  good heavens  where is your mother  my mother is dead sir  you were the first person who made known to her that her husband my father was not dead but had takenor pretended to takean english woman for his wife  wait thundered fulk whatever my father did was ignorantly and honourably done  bertram was as pale as death and looked from one of us to the other and at last he gasped out  and thatwas what she meant  there sir said hester turning to torwood you see your brother cannot deny it  you will not refuse justice to me and my son  i fancy she expected that the house was to be given up to her and that we were only to remain there on her sufferance perhaps till after the funeral  my brother spoke justice will no doubt be done but the question does not lie between you and me but between me and alured  it is as i said a peerage questionand will be decided by the peers incidentally that enquiry will prove what is your position and rank as well as what may or may not be ours  any further points depend upon my fathers will and that will be in the hands of mr eagles i think you can see that it would be impossible as well as unfeeling to take any steps until after the funeral  whatever hester lea was she was a highspirited being standing there a solitary woman a stranger with all of us four and one whole household as it must have seemed against her  i was outraged and shocked at her defiance at the time but when some time after i reread king john i saw that there was something of constance in her  that may be she answered but when my childs interests are at stake i cannot haggle over conventionalities and proprieties  i am the earl of trevorshams only legitimate daughter and i claim my right to remain in his house and to take charge of my infant brother  a sign from fulk stopped me as i was going to scream at this  remember he said your identity has yet to be proved  your brother there must needs witness  he has done so  what do you witness to bertram asked fulk  i do not know i cannot understand said bertram  i saw this person in a farm in lower canada and there was an old lady who seemed to have known my father and was very much amazed to find he was not killed in 1814  i did not hear her name nor know whose mother she was nor anything about her nor what this dreadful business means  at any rate said fulk to her your claim to remain in the house must depend on the legal proof of the fact  my fathers first marriage is undoubted but absolute legal certainty that you are the child of that marriage alone can entitle you to take rank as his daughter and therefore i am not compelled to admit your claim to remain here though if you will refrain from renewing this discussion till after the funeral i will not ask you to leave the house  i do not recognize your right to ask or not to ask she said undauntedly  i am either lord trevorshams rightful heirand it is not yet shown that i am notor else i am the guardian he appointed for his son  i know this to be so and mr eagles who will soon be here will show it to you in the will if you wish it  therefore until the decision is made when if it goes against me the child will no doubt be made a ward in chancery i am the person responsible for him and his property  i have no doubt you will take advantage of me and of every quibble against me and there at last she began to break down but if there is justice in heaven or earth my child shall have it though you and all were leagued against him  and there she began to sob  and those brothers of mine they actually grew compassionate they ran after wine they called us to bring salts and help her  emily shuddered and put her hands behind her but jaquetta actually ran up to the woman and coaxed her and comforted her when i had rather have coaxed a tigress  but i had to go to the table and pour out tea and give it to her with all the rest  i dont know how we got through that breakfast  but we did and then i made the housekeeper put her into the very best rooms anything if she would only stay there out of the way  when i came back i found fulk explaining why he had spoken at once and he said he felt that she would have no scruples about taking the initiative and that everyone would be having surmises  poor bertram was even more cut up than we were  it came more suddenly and he felt as if it was all his doing  he had no hope and he took all ours away  there had been something in the old woman that impressed him as genuine and he had no doubt that she had known and loved our father  nay no one could suspect hester of not believing in her own story the only question was whether the links of evidence could be substantiated  the next thing that happenedi cant tell which day it waswas mrs deerhursts coming professing to be dreadfully shocked and overcome by my fathers death to take away emily  she must be so much in our way i who saw her first answered only by begging to keep herour great comfort and the one thing that cheered and upheld my brother  mrs deerhurst looked keenly at me and i began to wonder what she knew but just then came fulk into the room with his calm set determined face  i knew he would rather speak without me so i went away and only knew what he could bear to tell me afterwards  mrs deerhurst had been a great deal kinder than he expected  no doubt she would not break the thing off while there was a shred of hope that he was an earl but he could not drive her to allow in so many words that it must depend upon that  he had quite made up his mind that it was not right to enjoy emilys presence and the comfort it gave him unless he was secure of mrs deerhursts permitting the engagement under his possible circumstances  i believe he nattered himself she would and let her deceive him with thinking so instead of as we all did seeing that what she wanted was to secure the credit of being constant and disinterested in case he retained his position  so although she took emily home she left him cheered and hopeful admiring her and believing that she so regarded her daughters happiness that if he had enough to support her she would overlook the loss of rank and title  he went on half the evening talking about what a remarkable woman mrs deerhurst was and at any rate it cheered him up through those worst days  our lupton uncles came and were frightfully shocked and incredulous at least uncle george was  uncle lupton himself remembered something of my father having told him of a former affair in america  they would not let jaquetta and me go to the funeral and they were wise for hester thrust herself inbut it is of no use to think about that  indeed there is not much to tell about that time and i need not go into the investigation  it was all taken out of our hands as my brother had said  perrault came over from canada and brought his witnesses but not joel lea  he had nothing to prove had conscientious scruples about appearing in an english court of justice and still hoped it would all come to nothing  we stayed on at the london housethe lawyers said we ought and that possession was ninetenths c  besides we wanted advice for baby who had been worse of late  the end of it was that it went against us  faiths marriage her identity and hesters were proved beyond all doubt and little alured was served earl of trevorsham  poor child how ill he was just then it was declared water on the brain  i could hardly think about anything else but they all said it seemed like a mockery and that he would not bear the title a week  and then lady hester would have been not countess of trevorsham but viscountess torwood and at any rate she halved the personal property all that had been meant for us  for we already knew that there was nothing in the will that could do us any good  all depended on my mothers marriage settlements and as the marriage was invalid they were so much waste paper  my uncles to whom my poor mothers fortune reverted would not touch it and gave every bit back to us but it was only 10000 pounds and what was that among the four of us  i was in a sort of maze all the time thinking of very little beyond dear little alureds struggle for life and living upon his little faint smiles when he was a shade better  jaquetta has told me more of what passed than i heeded at the time  our brothers decided not to retain the trevor name to which we had no right but they had both been christened torwood after an old family custom and they thought it best to use this still as a surname  bertram felt the shame as he would call it the most but fulk held up his head more  he said where there was no sin there was no shame and that to treat ourselves as under a blot of disgrace was insulting our parents who had been mistaken but not guilty  bertram was determined against returning to his regiment and it would have been really too expensive  his plan was to keep together and lay out our capital upon a piece of ground in new zealand which was beginning to be settled  jaquetta was always ready to be delighted  dear child her head was full of log huts and robinson crusoe life and cows to milk herself and i really think she would have liked to go ashore in the swiss familys eight tubs  the thorough change after all the sorrow seemed delicious to her i heard her and bertram laughing down below and wondered if they got the length of settling what dogs they would take out  and fulk  he really had almost persuaded himself that emily would go with us or at the very worst would wait till he had achieved prosperity and could come home and fetch her  mrs deerhurst had declared that waiting for the decision was so bad for her nerves that she must take her to paris and actually our dear old stupid fellow had not perceived what that meant for the woman had let him part tenderly with emily in london with promises of writing c the instant the case was decided  it passed his powers to suppose she could expose her daughters heart to such a wreck  so he held up cheerful and hopeful thinking what a treasure of constancy he had and when they had built their castle in new zealand they sent up jaquey to call me to share it with them  baby was asleep and i went down but when i heard the planit was cross to be so unsympathizing but i did feel hurt and angry at their forgetting him and i said i shall never leave alured  ursula you could not stay by yourself said jaquey  and bertram who had hardly ever seen him and could not care for him said it was nonsense and even if there were a chance of the child living i could not be left behind  i was wrought up and broke out that he would and should live and that i would come as a stranger a nursery governess and watch over him and never abandon him to hester  never fear ursula said fulk if he lives he will be in safe hands  safe hands  what are safe hands for a child like that  hesters who only wishes him out of her way  for shame the others said and i answered that of course i did not think hester meant ill by him but that where the doctors had said only love and care could save himno care was safe where he was not loved and i cried very very bitterly more than i had done even for my father or for anything else before and i fell into a storm of passion at the cruelty of leaving the poor little thing whom his dying mother had trusted to me and declared i would never never do it  i was right in the main it seems to me but unjust and naughty in the way i did it and when fulk with some hesitation began to talk of my not being asked to go just yetnot while the child livedi turned round in a really violent naughty fit withyou too fulk i thought you loved your little brother better than that  you only want to be rid of him and leave him to hester and he will die in her hands  fulk began to say that the court of chancery never gave the custody to the next heir  but i rushed away again to the nursery and sat there devising plans of disguising myself in a close cap and blue spectacles and coming to offer myself as lord trevorshams governess  the child had no relations whatever on his mothers side and though if he had been healthy nurses and tutors might have taken care of this baby lordship even that would have been sad enough and for the feeble little creature whose life hung on a thread how was it to be thought of  i fully made up my mind to stay even if they all went i told jaquetta soin my vehemence dashed all her bright anticipation and sent her again in tears to bed  i wish unhappiness would not make one so naughty  the next day poor fulk was struck down  a letter came from mrs deerhurst to break off the engagement and a great parcel containing all the things he had given emily  she must have packed them up before leaving england while she was still flattering him  not a word nor a line was there from emily herselfonly a supplication from the mother that he would not rend her childs heart by persistingjust as if she had not encouraged him to go on all this time  nothing would serve him but that he must dash over to paris to see her and emily  railroads were not and it was a ten days affair at the shortest and with all our prospects doubtful and alured still so ill it was very trying  how bertram did rave at the folly and futility of the expedition but one comfort was that alured was a ward of chancery and in the vast kindness and commiseration everyone bestowed upon us no one tried to hurry us or turn us out  hester used to come continually to inquire after her brother and there was something in her way that always made me shudder when she asked after him  i knew she could not wish for his life and gloated over all the reports she could collect of his weakness  i felt more and more horror of her god forgive me for not having tried not to hate her  i sometimes doubt whether my dread and distrust were not visible and may not have put it into her head  and then came mr decies again and again  he was faithfuli see it now  he cared not if i had neither name nor fortune he held fast to his proposals  and i  oh i was absorbedi was universally defianti did not do him justice in the bitterness i did not realise i thought he was constant only out of honour and pity and i did not choose to open my heart to understand his pleadings or accept them as earnesti was harsh  oh how little one knows what one is doing  too proud to be gratefulthat was actually my case i was enamoured of the bluespectacle plan i had romances of watching alured day and night and pouring away dangerous draughts the very fancy i see now was playing with edged tools i feel as if my imagination had put the possibility into the very air  once indeedwhen jaquetta had been telling me she did not understand my unkindness and observed that even for alureds sake she could not see why i did not accepti did begin to regard him as a possible protector for the boy  but no the blue spectacles would be the more assiduous guardian said my foolish fancy  before i had thought it over into sense or reason fulk came back from paris  he had not been really crushed till now  he was white and silent and resolute and very gentle all excitement of manner gone he did not say one word but we knew it was all over with him and that he could not have had one scrap of comfort or hope  nor had he though even to me he told nothing till we were together in the dark one evening much later  he did insist upon seeing emily but her mother would not leave her or take her eyes off her and the timid thing did nothing but sob and cry in utter helplessness and shame and never even gave him a look  it was not the being neglected and cast off that he felt as such a wrong to both himself and emily but the being drawn on with false hopes and promises to expect that she was to belong to him after all and he was cruelly disappointed that emily had not energy to cling to himhe had made so sure of her  bertram and jaquetta had expected all along that he would be the more eager to be off to the antipodes when everything was swept away from him here and he did sit after dinner talking it over in a businesslike way while bertram gave him all the information he had been collecting in his absence  i would not listen  i was determined against going away from my charge i had rather have been his housemaid than have left him to hester and i must have looked like a stone as i got up and left them to their talk while i went back to the boy  i heard bertram say while i was lighting my candle poor ursula she will not see it  hart told me today that the child is dyingwould hardly get through the night  now i had been thinking all the afternoon that he was better and i had gone down to dinner cheered  i turned into the doorway and told fulk to come and see  he did come  there was alured lying as he had lain all day upon his nurses knees with her arm under his head  he had not moaned for a long time and i had left him in a more comfortable sleep  he opened his eyes as we came in held out his hands more strongly than we thought he could have done quite smiledsuch an intelligent smileand said tortor which was what he had always called his brother making his gesture to go to him  the tears came into fulks eyes though he smiled back and spoke in his sweet strong voice and held out his arms while we told him he had better sit down  poor nurse she must have been glad enoughshe had held him all that livelong day  and he was quite eager to go to his brother and smiled up and cooed out tortor again as he felt himself on the strong arm  fulk bade nurse go and lie down and he would hold him  and so he did i fed the child as i had done at intervals all day and he sometimes slept sometimes woke and murmured or cooed a little and fulk scarcely spoke or stirred hour after hour  he had been travelling day and night but strange to say that enforced calmthat tender stillness and watching was better for him than rest  he would only have tossed about awake if he had gone to bed after a discussion with bertram  but in the morning dr hart came quite surprised to find the child alive and when he looked at him and felt his pulse he said you have saved him for this time at least  everybody was lavish of pronouns and chary of proper names  nobody knew what to call anybody  his little lordship was able to be laid in his cot and fulk almost blind now with sheer sleep stumbled off to his room threw himself on his bed and slept for seven hours in his clothes without so much as moving  he confessed that he had never had such unbroken dreamless sleep since he had first seen hester leas face  that little murmur of tortor had settled all our fates  i dont think he had realised before how love was the one thing that the childs life hung upon and that the boy himself must have that love and trust  then too when he had waked and dressed and come down the first person he met was hester with her hard glittering eyes trying to condole and not able to hide how the exulting look went out of her face on hearing that the earl as she chose to term him was better  she supposed some arrangement would soon be made and fulk said he should see the lawyers at once about it and arrange for the personal guardianship of lord trevorsham  of course i am the only proper person while he lives poor child she said  i broke in with the next heir is never allowed the custody  i wish i had not  she hastily and proudly said what do you mean and fulk quickly added that the lord chancellor would decide  the next day he went out and on returning came up to me in the nursery and called me into the study  ursula he said i find that considering the circumstances there will be no objection made to our retaining the personal charge of our little brother  everyone is very kind  ours is not a common case of illegitimacy and my fathers wellknown express wishes will be allowed to prevail  and your character i could not help saying and he owned that it did go for something that he was known to everybody and had some standing of his own apart from the rank he had lost  then he went on to say that this would of course put an end to the emigration plan so far as he was concerned  no doubt in the restless desire of change coming after such a fall and disappointment it was a great sacrifice but as he said there did not seem anything left for him in life but just to try to do what seemed most like ones duty and then he said it did not seem a worthy thing to do nothing but just exist on a confined income and the only thing he did know anything about and was not too old to learn was farming and managing an estate  trevorsham would want an agent for old hall was so old that my brother had really done all his work for a year or two past and he had felt his way enough to know he could get appointed to the agency if he chose  the house was to be let but there was a farm to be had about two miles off with a good house and he thought of taking it and stocking it and turning regular farmer on his own account while looking after the property and bringing alured up among his own people and interests  bertram did not like this at all  among all our old friends and acquaintance  impossible unbearable he said  but fulks answer wasbetter so  if we went to a strange place and tried to conceal it it would always be oozing out and be supposed disgraceful  if my sisters can bear it i had rather confront it straightforwardly  and be pitiedsaid bertram with such a contemptuous tone  nobody however thought it would be advisable for him to give up the new zealand plan nor did he ever mean it for a moment indeed he declared that he should go and prepare for us for that we should very soon get tired of skimpings farm and come out to him meaning of course that our dear charge would be over  he even wanted jaquetta to come with him at once and the log huts and fern trees danced before her eyes as the blue spectacles had done before mine but she did not like to leave me and fulk would not encourage it for we both thought her much too young and too tenderly brought up to be sent out to a wild settlers life alone with bertram and without a friend near  to be farmers sisters where we had been the earls daughterswell i had much rather then that it had been somewhere else but i saw it was best for baby and still more so for fulk and clear little jaquey held fast to me and to him and so it was settled  our friends and relatives had much rather we had all emigrated  they did not know what to do with us and would have been glad to have had us all out of sight for ever damaged goods shipped off to the colonies  we felt this and it heartened us up to stay out of the spirit of opposition  old aunt amelia who fussed and cried over us and our two uncles who gave us good advice by the yard  alas i fear we were equally ungrateful to them both cold and impatient  no we did not bear it really well though they said we did  we had plenty of pride and selfrespect and that carried us on but there was no submission no notion of taking it religiously  i dont mean that we did not go to church and in the main try to do right  any one more upright than my brother it would have been hard to find but as to any notion that religious feeling could help us and that our reverse might be blessed to us that would have seemed a very strange language indeed  and so we were hard we would bear no sympathy but from one another and even among ourselves we never gave way  people admired us i fancy but were alienated and disappointed and we were quite willing then to have it so     chapter iv  skimpings farm   skimpings farm was the unlucky name of the place and fulk would allow of no modificationhis resolution was to accept it all entirely  now i love no spot on earth so well  it was very different then  the farmhouse lay on the slope of the hill in the parish of trevorsham but with the park lying between it and the main village the ground sloped sharply down to the little river which about two miles lower down blends with the avon being in fact a creek out of shinglebay  beneath the house the stream is clear and rocky but then comes a flat of salt marsh excellent for cattle and then again the river becomes tidal and reaches at high water to the steep banks sometimes covered with wood sometimes with pasture or corn  then under the little promontory comes the hamlet of fisherfolk at quay trevor and then the coast sweeps away to shinglebay town as anyone may see by the map  ours is an old farm and had an orchard of old appletrees sloping down to the riveras also did the home field only divided by a low stone wall from the little strip of flowergarden before the house which in those days had nothing in it but two tamarisks a teatree and a rose with lovely buds and flowers that always had green hearts  there was a goodsized kitchengarden behind and the farmyard was at the side by the back door  the house is old and therefore was handsome outside even then but the chief of the lower story was comprised in one big room a keepingroom as it was called with an open chimney screened by a settle and with a long polished table with a bench on either side  into this room the front porcha deep one with seatsopened  at one end was a charming little sittingroom parted off at the other the real kitchen for cooking and the dairy and all the rest of the farm offices  upstairsthe stairs are dark oak and come down at one end of the big kitchenthere is one beautiful large room made the larger by a grand oriel window under the gable one opening out of it and four more over the offices then a stepladder and a great cheeseroom and a perfect wilderness of odd nooks up in the roof  as to furniture fulk had bought that with the stock and everything else belonging to the farm for a round sum and the chancery people told us that we might take anything for ourselves from home that had been bought by ourselves had belonged to our mother or been given to us individually  so the furniture of fulks rooms in londonmost of which he had had at oxfordmy own piano our books and various little worktables chairs pictures and knicknacks appertained to us also we brought what belonged to the little ones nursery and put him in the large room his grand nurseearl though he wascould not stand the change but old blake who was retiring into a public house as he could do nothing else for us suggested his youngest sister who became the comfort of my life for she was the widow of a small farmer and could give me plenty of sound counsel as to how much pork to provide for the labourers and how much small beer would keep them in good heart and not make them too merry  and she had too much good sense to get into rivalry with susan sisson the hinds wife who lived in a kind of leanto cottage opening into the farmyard and was the chief real manager of the dairy and poultrythough such was not jaquettas view of the case by any manner of means  what a help it was to have one creature who did enjoy it all from the very first  the parting with bertram was sore and ones heart will ache after him still at times though he is prosperous and happy with his wife and fine family at the new trevorsham  fulk went through it all in a grave set way as if he knew he never should be happy again and accepted everything in silence as a matter of course not wanting to sadden us but often grieving me more by his steady silence than if he had complained  one thing he was resolved on that he would be a farmer out and outnot a gentleman farmer as he said but though he only wore broadcloth in the evening and on sundays i cant say he ever succeeded in not looking more of the gentleman  we fitted up the little parlour with our prettiest things and it was our morning room and we put a screen across the big keepingroom which made it snug for a family gathering place  but those were the days when everyone was abusing the farmers for not living with their labourers in the house and fulk was determined to try it at least the first year either for the sake of consistency or because he was resolved to keep our expenses as low as possible  failure would be ruin he impressed on us and he thought we ought to live on the profits of the farm except what was directly spent on the boy and to save the income of the agency  taking one year with another we did so  so he gave up his own dear old cid and only used the same horses that had sufficed for our predecessora most real loss and deprivationand he chose to take meals at the long table in the keepingroom with the farm servants  he said we girls might dine in our little parlour apart but there was no bearing that and the whole household dined and supped together  breakfast was at such uncertain times that we left that for the back kitchen and had our own little round table by the fire or in the parlour at halfpast seven and so we took care to have a good cup of coffee for fulk when he came in about five or six but the halfpast twelve dinner and eight oclock supper were at the long table our three selves and baby at the topbaby between me and mrs rowe allys rowe as he called her then george and susan sisson opposite each other the under nurse the two maids the hind and the three lads  i believe it was a very awful penance to them at first  we used to hear them splashing away at the pump and puffing like porpoises and they came in with shining faces and lank hair in wet rats tails the foremost of which they pulled on all occasions of sitting down getting up or being offered food  but they always behaved very well and the habit of the animal at feedingtime is so silent that i believe the restraint was compensated by the honour and it did civilise them thanks perhaps to susans lectures on manners which we sometimes overheard  fulk made spasmodic attempts to talk to sisson but the chief conversation was jaquettas  she went on merrily all dinnertime asking about ten thousand things and hazarding opinions that elicited amusement in spite of ourselves as when she asked what sheep did with their other two legs or suggested growing canary seed as sure to be a profitable crop  indeed i think she had a little speculation in it on her own account in the kitchen gardenonly the sparrows were too many for herand what they left would not ripen  but the child was always full of some new and rare device rattling on anyhow not for want of sense but just to force a smile out of fulk and keep us all alive as she called it  she knew every bird and beast on the farm fed the chickens collected the eggs nursed tender chicks or orphan lambs and weaning calves and was in and out with the dogs all day really as happy as ten queens with the freedom and homely usefulness of the lifetripping daintily about in the tall pattens of farm life in those days and making fresh enjoyment and fun of everything  i used to be half vexed to see her grieve so little over all we had lost but fulk said i suppose it is very hard to break down a creature at that age  and even i was cheered by the wonderful start of health alured took from the time mrs rowe had him  he grew fat and rosy and learnt to walk and dr hart was quite astonished at his progress and said he was nearly safe from any more attacks of that fearful water on the brain till he was six or seven years old and that till that time we must let him be as much as possible in the open air and with the animals and not stimulate his brainneither teach nor excite nor contradict him nor let him cry  the farm life was evidently the very thing he wanted  what a reprieve it was even though it should be only a reprieve  he was already three years old and was very clever and observant  we were glad that he was too young to take heed of the change or to see what was implied by his change from baby to my lord and we always called him by his christian name  mrs rowe felt far too much for us to gossip to him and he was always with her or with me though i do believe he liked benthe great rough hindbetter than anyone else would lead mrs rowe long dances after him to see him milk the cows and would hold forth to him at dinner in a way as diverting to us as it was embarrassing to poor ben who used to blurt out at intervals yoi my lord and noa my lord while the two maids tried to swallow their tittering  the farmers at market used to call fulk my lord by mistake and then colour up to their eyes through their red faces  i believe indeed it was their name for him among themselves and that they watched him with a certain contemptuous compassion in the full belief that he would ruin himself  and he declares he should if he had lived a bit more luxuriously or if he had not had the agency salary to help him through the years of buying experience and the bad season with which he began  nor was it till he had for some years introduced that capital breed which thrives so well in the salt marshes and twice following showed up the prize ox at the county show that they began to believe in farmer torwood or think his advanced opinions in agriculture anything but a gentlemans whimsies  as to friends and acquaintance i am afraid we showed a great deal of pride and stiffness  they were kinder than we deserved but we thought it prying and patronage and would not accept what we could not return  it is not fair to say we  it was only myselfjaquetta never saw anything but kindness and took it pleasantly and fulk was too busy and too unhappy to be concerned about our visiting matters  if i saw anyone coming to call i hid myself in the orchard or if i was taken by surprise i was stiffness itself and then i wrote a set of cards miss torwood and miss jaquetta torwood and drove round in the queer oldfashioned gig to leave them and there was an end of it for i would accept no invitations though jaquetta looked at me wistfully and thus i daunted all but old miss prior  poor old thing  all her pleasures had oozed down from our house in old times to her and her gratitude was indomitable and stood all imaginable rebuffs that courtesy permitted me  i believe she only pitied and loved me the more and persevered in the dreadful kindness that has no tact  it did not strike me that pleasure might be good for jaquetta or that fulks stern silent sorrow might have been lightened by variety used as he had been to political life and london society it was no small change to have merely the market for interest the farm for occupation and no society but ourselves no newspaper but the county chronicle once a week no new books for mudie did not exist then even if we could have afforded it  we had dropped out of the guinea country book club and knights penny magazine was our only fresh literature however jaquetta never was much of a reader and was full of businessqueen of the poultry and running after the weakly ones half the day supplementing george sissons very inadequate gardeningaye and his wifes equally rough cooking  she found a receipt book and turned out excellent dishes  she could not bear she said to see fulk try to eat grease and with an effort at concealment assisted by the dogs fall back upon bread and cheese  luckily plain work in the schoolroom had not gone out in our day and i could make and mend respectably but i had to keep a volume of shakespeare scott or wordsworth open before me and learn it by heart to keep away thoughts which might have been good for me but nothey were working on their own bitterness  sunday was the hardest day of all to fulk for this was the only one on which he could not be busy enough to tire himself out  we were a mile from church and when we got to the wormeaten farm pew there was a smell as jaquey said as if generations of farmers had been eating cheese there and generations of mice eating after them and she always longed to shut up a cat there  the old curate was very old and nothing seemed alive but the fiddles in the galleryindeed after the penny magazine had made us acquainted with the nibelung jaquey took to calling sisson folker the mighty fiddler so determined were his strains  after the great house was shut up one service was dropped and so the latter part of the day was spent in a visit to all the livestock fulk laden with alured and jaquetta with tit bits for each and all  she and alured really enjoyed it and we tried to think we did  and then fulk used to stride off on a long solitary walk or else sit in the porch with his arms across in a dumb heavy silence till he saw us looking at him and then he would shake himself and go and find sisson and discuss every field and beast with him  at least we thought we should have been at peace here but one afternoon when jaquetta had gone across to the village to see some purchase at the shop she came back flushed and breathless and said as she sat down by me oh ursie ursie i met miss prior and she has bought spinney lawn  she was hester it had never meant anyone else amongst us when it was said in that voice  fulk when we told him had it appeared known it for some days past  all he said was well she has every right  and when i exclaimed just like a harpy come to watch our poor child he said nonsense  but i knew i was right and sat broodingtill presently he said put that out of your head ursula or you will not be able to behave properly to her  i dont see any good in behaving properly to her said jaquetta what business has she to come here  i do not choose to regale the neighbourhood with our family jarssaid fulk quietly  and thensuch a ridiculous child as jaquetta wasshe burst out laughing and cried what a feast they would be   preserved crabs i suppose and she brought a tiny curl into the corner of his mouth  my pride was up and i remember i answered you are right fulk  no one shall say we are jealous or shrink from the sight of her  when smith told me that he had no idea who was the bidder or he would not have suffered it said fulk i told him i could have no possible objection  and so we endured it in our pride and our dignity  lady hester lea was the heroine of the neighbourhood  the romance of the disowned daughter was charming and i was far too disagreeable to excite any counterbalancing pity  she was handsome and everybody raved about her likeness to poor papa and the family portraits and her montreal convent had given her manners quite distinct from english vulgarity or maybe her blood told on her bearing for she was immensely admired for her demeanour quite as much as for her beauty  old miss priorwhom no coldness on my part could check in her assiduous kindness and nothing would hinder from affectionately telling us whatever we did not want to hearkept us constantly informed of the new comers triumphs  especially she would dwell upon the sensation that lady hester produced and all that the gentlemen said of her  her name stood as lady patroness to all the balls and fancy fairs and archery that shinglebay produced and there was no going to shop there without her barouche coming clattering down the street with the two prancing greys and poor little trevor inside with a loopedup hat and ostrich feather exactly like alureds for by some intention she always dressed him in the exact likeness of his little uncles  i used to think miss prior told her and sedulously prevented her ever seeing his lordship out of his brown holland pinafores but the same rule still held good  what tender enquiries poor miss prior used to make after the dear little lord as she called him  my asseverations of his health and intelligence generally eliciting that it was current among lady hesters friends that he could neither stand nor speak and was so imbecile that it was a mercy that he could not live to be eight years old  of course that was what hester was waiting for  and no small pleasure was it when alured would come pattering in with a shout of ursa ursa and as soon as he saw a lady would stop and pull off his hat from his chestnut curls like the little gentleman he always was  spinney lawn was bought before joel lea came to england  if he had seen where it was i doubt whether he would have consented to the purchase but perrault managed it all and then with what he had made out of the case bought himself a share in meakins office at shinglebay and constituted himself lady hesters legal adviser  mr lea after vainly trying to get his wife to return to sault st pierre thought it wrong to be apart from her and his son and came to england  fulk went at once to call on him expecting to be disgusted with yankeeisms but came home saying he had found a more unlucky man than himself  fancy a great big plain hardworking backwoodsman bred only to the axe and rifle with illimitable forests to range in happy in toil and homely plenty and a little king to himself set down in an english villa with a trim garden and paddock and servants everywhere to deprive him of the very semblance to occupation  poor man he had not even the alleviation of being proud of it and trying to live up to it  puritan to the bone of his broad back he thought everything as wicked as it was wearisome and foolish and lived like faithful in vanity fair solely enduring it for the sake of his wife and son  i suppose he could not have carried her off or altered her course without the strong hand for she was a determined woman all the more resolute because she acted for her child  he was a staunch dissenter and would not go to church with lady hester who did so as a needful part of the belonging of her station or perhaps to watch over us but trudged two miles every sunday to the meetinghouse at shinglebay where he was a great light and spent all that she allowed him on the minister and the sunday school  as to society he abhorred it on principle and kept out of the way when his wife gave her parties  if she had an old affection for him in the depths of her heart it was swallowed up in vexation and provocation and no wonder for the verdict of society as miss prior reported it washow sad that such a woman as lady hester should have been thrown away on a mere common mannot a bit better than a labourer  i detested him like all the rest but fulk declared he was sublime in passive endurance and used to make opportunities of consulting him about cattle or farming just to interest him  fulk and the dissenting minister were the only friends the poor man had and the latter hester would not let into her house  as to perrault he loathed and shrank from him as the real destroyer of all his peace and still the most dangerous influence about his wife  he never said so but we felt it  i think the poor mans happiest hours were spent here and now and then in a press of work or to show how a thing ought to be done he put his own hand to axe lever or hayfork and toiled with that cruellywasted alert strength  fulk always says there never was anyone who taught him so much as joel lea and he means deeper things than farming  sometimes mr lea brought his little boy  i was vexed at first but alured who had hardly spoken to a child before was in ecstasies as if a new existence had come upon him and trevor lea was really a very nice little boy  he was only half a year the elder and they were so much alike that strangers did not know them apart dressed alike as they were or they were taken for twins and it made people laugh to find they were uncle and nephew  and i must allow the nephew was the best behaved though it made me savage to hear fulk say so  but our allys was not real naughtinessonly the consequence of our not being able to keep up discipline while we lived in dread  of that seventh year that might rob us of our darlingalways sweet and loving     chapter v  spinney lawn   a change or two began to creep into our life  one afternoon as jaquetta in her pretty pink gingham and white apron with her black hair in the grecian coil we used to wear when our heads were allowed to be of their own proper size was gathering crimson apples from the quarrendon tree close to the river a voice came over the water  oh my good girl if you would but stand so a minute and allow me to sketch you  jaquetta started round and laughed  no doubt she was looking like an arcadian but ias from under the trees i saw two gentlemen on the other side of the little stream and jumped up to come to her defencei must have looked more like a displeased if not draggletailed duchess for there was an immediate disconcerted begging of our pardons and a hasty departure  jaquetta made a very funny account of my spring forward in awful dignity so horribly affronted at her being called a good girl and she made fulk laugh heartily  the gloom did seem to be lightening on him now  walking tourists we supposed though one we thought was a clergyman and on sunday we saw him in the desk and the draughtsman in the parsonage pew and we discovered that these were the proposed new curate mr cradock and his younger brother  our rector was a canon who had bad health and never came near us and the poor old curate was past work and indeed died a week or two after he had given up  i saw that younger brother colour up to the roots of his bright hair as jaquetta walked up the aisle in her drawn black silk bonnet with the pink lining made by herself and i think she coloured too for she was rosier than usual when we faced round in the corners of our pew  we saw no more of them for a month and a dainty bridallooking little lady appeared in the parsonage seat with white ribbons in her straw bonnet and modest little orange flowers in the frill round her pleasant face  mrs cradock she was we heard and not only miss prior but fulk wanted us to call on her  whats the use said i  farmers families are not on visiting terms with the ladies of the parsonage  poor jaquey uttered an oh dear but she and fulk knew i was past moving in that mood  however one morning in the next week in walked fulk into the keepingroom and the clergyman with him and found jaquey and me standing at the long table under the window peeling and cutting up apples for applecheese  mr cradock my sister he said just in the old tone when he brought a friend into our st jamessstreet drawingroom and he hardly gave time for the shaking of hands before he had returned to the discussion about the change of ministry just with the voice and animation i had not seen for two whole years  we went on with our apples  for one thing we were not wanted for another there was no fire in the little parlour and the gentlemen both seemed to be enjoying the bright one that was burning on the hearth  the only difficulty was that dinner time began to approach  the men could not be kept waiting and i heard alured awake from his sleep pattering about and shouting and as we began to gather up our apples one of the maids peeped in with a tablecloth over her arm  mr cradock saw though fulk did not and said his wife would expect him and then he looked most pleasantly to  me and said he was not at all wanted at home while his wife was luxuriating in a settlement of furniture but this was he was assured the last day of confusion and tomorrow she would be quite ready for all who would be so good as to call on her  i could only say i would do myself the pleasure and then he still waited a moment to say that his brother arthur could not recover from his dismay at his greeting to miss torwood  but he said the boys head was quite turned by the beauty of the country  he had been raving all day about the new poet alfred tennyson and i believe he thought he had walked into lotusland  nearer the dragon of the hesperides perhaps said fulk laughing is he with you now  no he has gone back to oxford  he is in his second year and whether he takes to medicine or to art is to be settled by commonsense or genius  oh but if he has genius began jaquetta eagerly  thats the question said mr cradock laughing  but i am hindering you shamefully and with that he took his leave having quite demolished our barriers  and his wife was of the same naturesimple blithe and bonnyready to make friends in a moment and though she must have known all about us never seeming to remember anything but that we were her nearest lady neighbours  jaquetta whose young friendships had been broken short off because the poor girls really did not know how to correspond with her under present circumstances took to mrs cradock with eager enthusiasm and tripped across the park to her two or three times a week and became delightedly interested in all her doings parochial or otherwise  dear jaqueys happy nature had always been content but when i saw how exceedingly she enjoyed the variety liveliness and occupations brought by the cradocks i felt that it had been scarcely kind to seclude her to gratify my own sole pride but then there had been nobody like the cradocksto drop or be dropped  the refreshment to fulk was even greater  the having a man to converse with and break his mind against one who would argue and who really cared for the true principles of politics made an immense difference to him  when after tea he said he would walk to the parsonage to see how the debate had gone and we knew we should not see him till halfpast ten we could not but be glad it must have been so much pleasanter than playing at chess listening to our old music or reading even the new books they lent us  he brightened greatly that winter and i ceased to fear that he was getting a farmers slouch  he looked as stately and beautiful as ever lord torwood had done and the dejection had gone out of his face and bearing when suddenly it returned again and as miss prior was away from home i never found out the cause till one day as i was shopping at shinglebay and was telling the linen draper that mr torwood would call for the parcel i saw the lady at the other counter start and turn round as if at a sudden shock  then i saw the white doe eyes full of the old pleading expression and the lips quivering wistfully but i only said to myself the old arts that is what has overthrown fulk again and away i went with a rigid bow and said nothing  there was no exchange of calls  that was not my fault for we could not have begun and we heard that mrs deerhurst said the torwoods had shown very good taste in retiring from all society poor things only it was a great mistake to remain in the neighbourhoodso awkward for everybody  mrs cradock was much struck with emilys sweet looks but i believe that jaquetta told her all about it and we never met the deerhursts there  in fact they were not intimate for there must have been a repulsion between mrs deerhurst and such a woman as mary cradock  the deerhursts owned a villa on the outskirts of shinglebay indeed i believe it was the difficulty in letting it that had unwillingly forced mrs deerhurst home after having married her second daughter but not emily  she was only a mile and a half from spinney lawn and speedily became familiar there being as entirely hesters counsellor in etiquette as was perrault on business  people saw a marked improvement in elegance from the time she became adviser  that next winter poor joel lea died  i suppose it was merely the dulness and want of exercise that killed him for he had lost flesh and grown languid in manner for months before a low fever set in and he had no power to struggle with it  he had been ill a long time when he sent a message to beg mr torwood to come and see him  jaquetta and i persuaded ourselves that he had discovered that perrault had suborned witnesses or done something that would falsify the whole trial  jaquetta said she should be very glad for fulk and if it happened now little alured would never feel it but for her own part she should hate to go back to be my lady again  she had never known before what happiness was  i could not help laughing  nobody had ever detected anything amiss with lady jaquetta trevors spirits but that they were too high at times  of course i dont mean that i was miserable she said but theres something now that does make everything so delicious  could you not take that something to the park i asked laughing  i dont know  it would not be so bad if i could run in and out at the parsonage as i do now  and as i smiled it smote me as i recollected that arthur cradock was always at the parsonage in the vacations  jaquetta had been sketched many a time as nymph of the orchard and many a nymph besides  and if he was yielding to his brothers wisdom in making medicine his study and art his pleasure was not our unconscious maiden the sugar that sweetened the cup of prudence  might not elevation be as sore a trial to her as depression had been to us  however our troubling ourselves was all nonsense  good joel lea would never have connived at any evil doings  all he had wanted of fulk was to be certain of his forgiveness for the injury he had suffered through his wife and to entreat him to keep a watch over her and the boy  you are her brother when all is come and gone he said and i do not trust that perrault  if ever he fails her or turns against her youll stand her friend and look to the boy  fulk heartily promised and joel further begged him to write to her eldest brother francis dayman who was prospering immensely in the timber trade and let him know the state of thingsthough he had been so angered at hesters sacrifice of his mothers good name and his own birth that he had broken with her entirely  but if anyone can get her out of perraults hands it is francis poor joel said and he went on to talk of his poor boy about whom he was very anxious having no trust in any of hesters intimates and begging fulk to throw a good word to him now and then  he thinks much of you he said  i heard him tell miss deerhurst that it was no use for anyone to try to be such an outandout gentleman as his uncle for they couldnt do it and he had rather be like you than anyone else  i dont care for gentlemen and all that foolery as you know  i wish i could leave him to my old mate eli potter but you are true and honest fulk torwood and i think not so far from the kingdom  then he asked fulk to read a chapter to him  no one else would do so except little trevor when now and then left alone with him but hester would not believe him seriously ill and thought the bible wearied him and made him low spirited and as to his friend the dissenter she would never admit him  fulk was so indignant that he wanted to drive to shinglebay and fetch mr ball but lea thanked him and half smiled at his superstition of thinking that a minister was needed to speed his soul but he was pleased that fulk came to him on each of the four or five remaining days of his life and read to him whatever he wished  he sank suddenly at last while hester was at church on sunday morning and died when alone with fulk  somehow the intense reality of that man and the true comfort his faith was to him made an immense impression on my brother and seemed as it were to give the communication between his religious belief and his feelings which had somehow not been in force before he thought and borrowed books from mr cradock and there came a deepening and softening over him which one saw in many ways that made him dearer than ever  he looked more at peace even though one felt that each passing sight of emily was a sting  hester was dreadfully stricken down at first and her anguish of lamentation and selfreproach was terrible to witness but she would not hear of fulks fetching either of usindeed i fancy that was the fault of my dry cold looksnor would she allow him to do anything for her  mrs deerhurst came to be with her and perrault managed everything  they had a magnificent funeralmuch grander than my fathersand laid him in the family vault  perrault took the opportunity of insulting fulk by pairing him with old hall the exagent but hall found it out in time and refused to go and when the moment came everybody fell back and fulk found himself close to poor little trevor who tried to get his hand out of perraults and cling to him but perrault held him tight till at the moment when they moved to the mouth of the vault and were to go down the steps terror completely seized the poor child and he began to shriek so fearfully that fulk had to snatch him up and carry him out of the church trembling from head to foot  it was very cruel to send a sensitive child of six years old in that way but hester was too much exhausted with her violent grief to go herself and devoted mother as she was in all else she never perceived that poor childs instinctive shrinking from perrault  we tried to be kind to her and hoped she would soften towards us but she did not  i could see her eyes glitter with their keen searching glance under her crape veil as if she were measuring alured all over when the child walked into church with me and indeed when he went to the zoological gardens some time later and saw the cobra di capello he said  ursa why does that snake look at me just like lady hester  there must have been fascination in the eager mystery of the gaze for strangely enough he was not afraid of her  she always made much of him if he came in her way and he was so fond of trevor lea that nothing made him so eager or happy as the thought of seeing him  the one idea that her boy was ousted by alured and the longing to see him the heir seemed to drive out everything else from hesteralmost feeling for her husband  fulk had written to francis dayman and he intended to come and see after his sister as soon as he could leave his business but this rather precipitated matters  hester was persuaded that alured could not live through that eighth year of his life at the utmost and perrault somehow persuaded her that only as her husband could he protect her interests and trevors though what machinations she could have expected from us i cannot guess or how in the case of a minor we could have interfered with her rights  but the man had gained such an ascendancy over her that she did not even perceive that the connection was not good for that great object of hers her sons position in society  in fact he persuaded her that he was of a noble old french family and ought to be a count  how we laughed when we heard of it  she did preserve wisdom enough to insist upon having her fortune conveyed to trustees for her son so that perrault could only touch the income and not the principal and as she told everyone that he had been determined upon this being done i suppose he saw that any demur would excite her suspicion  they went to london and were married there while we were still scouting poor miss priors rumours  we were very sorry when we thought of poor joels charge and besides the count had an uncomfortable slippery look about him  i cant describe it otherwise  he was a slim trim welldressed man only given to elaborate jewellery and waistcoats with polished black hair and boots and keen frenchlooking eyes wellmannered and so versatile and polite that he soon overcame peoples prejudices and he was thought to make a much better master of the house than poor joel had ever done     chapter vi  the white does warning   here was alureds eighth birthday and he had never been ill at all but was as finelooking healthy a boy as could be seen  we took him to london and showed him to dr hart and he said that the old tendency was entirely outgrown and that lord trevorsham was as likely to live and thrive as any child of his age in england  it really seemed the beginning of a new life not to have that dreadful fear hanging over us any longer  we felt settled that was one thing not as if we should do as bertram expected have to come off to new zealand  the farm had just began to pay  fulks sales of cattle had been for the first time more than enough to clear his rent  he had a great ox in the smithfield cattle show and met our lupton uncles there not as an unsuccessful man  and i  i had a dim feeling that alured would soon cease to need me and jaquetta would not be claimed for a long time and if  but in the midst of that i saw a haggard face driving in the park by the side of a little overdressed faded woman  and aunt amelia told me how in the rebound from my harshness no doubt mr decies had as it were dropped into the hands of a weak extravagant girl who had long been using all the intellect she had to attract him and now led him a dreary life of perpetual dissipation  i dont know how much i had been to blame  i am sure he was meant for better things  mine could never have been real love for him and the refusal could not have been wrong  it must have been the pride and harshness that stung him  i was very sorry for him though i could not think about it of course still less speak but that was the beginning of my hating myself and i have hated myself more and more ever since i have taken to write all this down and seen how hard and foolish i was how very much the worst of the three  even my care for alured sprang out of exclusive passion and so though i do think that by heavens mercy i had a great share in cherishing him into strength and health i had managed him badly i had indulged him over much and was improperly resentful of any attempt of jaquetta or even of fulk to interfere with him or restrain him  thus when the anxiety was over and he was a strong boy full of health and activity his will was entirely unrestrained he had no notion of minding any of us still less of learning  trevor lea could read write talk french say a few latin declensions when alured could not read a word of three letters and would not try to learn  oh the antics he played when i tried to teach him  then fulk tried and he was tame for three days but then came idleness wilfulness anger punishment but he laughed to scorn all that we could find in our hearts to do to him  as to getting other help we were ashamed till he should be a little less shamefully backward  the cradocks offered to teach him but then unless he was elaborately put on honour he played truant  he had plenty of honour plenty of affection but not the smallest conscience as to obedience and fulk would not have the other two motives worked too hard saying the one might break the other give way  we had not taught obedience so we had to take the consequences and we were the less able to enforce it that he had come to a knowledge of our mutual relations much sooner than we intended and in the worst manner possible  of course he knew himself to be lord trevorsham and owner of the property but one day when fulk found him galloping his pony in the field laid up for hay and ordered him out he retorted that you aint my proper brother and you havent any rights over me  it is my field and i shall do as i like  fulk got hold of the ponys bridle and took alured by the shoulder without one word then took him into the little study and had it out with him  it was hester who had told him  he had been at spinney lawn with trevor all one afternoon when we had thought him out with old sisson he had told no falsehood indeed but hester and her husband had made him understand so far as such a child could do that there was some disgrace connected with us that fulk had once been in his place and only wanted to get it back and now had it all his own way with his young lordships property and that he owed us neither duty nor affection only to his true relative lady hester perrault  the dear boy had maintained stoutly that he did love ursula and jacquey and that hester wasnt half so nice and that he had rather they bullied him than that she coaxed him  but there was the poison sownto rankle and grow and burst out when he was opposed  he had full faith and trust in fulk and accepted his history owning indeed from a boy that he had been a horrid little wretch for saying what he did and asking whether it had not been a great bore indeed he behaved all the better instead of the worse for some little time dear fellow  but he was too big and strong to tie to ones apronstring and his greatest pleasure was in being with trevor  i think trevors own influence never did any harm  poor joel lea had trained him well and he was a conscientious good boy who often hindered alured from insubordination but the attraction to spinney lawn was a mischievous thingfor there was no doubt that the heads of the family would set him against us if they could  so fulk thought it wiser to send him to school since he was learning nothing properly at home and only getting more disobedient and unruly  immediately trevor lea was sent to the same school to the boys great delight  they cared little that trevor was placed nearly at the top and trevorsham at the bottom of the little preparatory school  they held together just as much and alured came home wonderfully improved and delightfully good but more than ever inseparable from trevor  in the meantime francis dayman had come to pay his sister a visit he had made some fortunate speculations and had come on to be a merchant of considerable wealth and weight in the hudsons bay company  a handsome man of a good deal of strength and force he seemed to be and perrault had certainly been wise in securing his prize before hester had such a guardian  he was an open straightforward man with a fresh breath of the forest about him successful beyond all his hopes and full of activity  he took to fulk and seemed to have a strong fellowfeeling for us  but little had fulk expected to be made the confidant of his vehement admiration for emily deerhurst  the gentle ladylike girl impressed the backwoodsman in a wondrous manner  it seemed to him as if his wealth would have real value if he could pour it all out on her  and her mother encouraged him  emily was six years older than when she had cast off fulk and there was a pale changed look about her and the rich canadian who could buy a baronetcy and do anything she asked tempted mrs deerhurst  though as fulk said bitterly if the stain on his birth was all the cause of the utter withdrawal was it not the same with francis dayman only in his case it was gilded  dayman knew nothing of this former affair  the world was forgetting it and if hester knew it she kept it from his knowledge so he used to consult fulk as to what was to be done to please an english lady and whether he was too rough for her and fulk stood it all  he even knew when the young lady herself was brought forwardand refused gently sadly courteously but unmistakably and then when driven hard by the eager wooing owned to an old attachment that never would permit her to marry  what a light there was in fulks eyes when he whispered that into my ears  and yet he had kept his counsel even though mr dayman told him that the mother declared it to be a foolish romantic affair of very early girlhood that no doubt his perseverance would overthrow  and her persecution muttered poor fulk  but he did enjoy the confidences in a bittersweet fashion  it was justifiable to be a dog in the manger under the circumstances  mr dayman went to london and hester was negotiating about a house where mrs deerhurst and her daughters were to stay with her for a few weeks  i fancy mrs deerhurst thought that the chance of seeing farmer torwood ride by to market had a bad effect  it was the easter holidays and both boys were at home always trying to be together and we not finding it easy to keep alured from spinney lawn without such flat refusals as would have given his sister legitimate cause of complaint and offence  one beautiful spring afternoon when alured to my vexation and vague uneasiness had gone over there i was sowing annuals in the garden and watching for him at the same time when to my surprise i saw coming over the fields from the park a lady with a quick timid yet wearied step  had she lost her way i thought  there was something of the tame fawn in her movement and then i remembered the white doe  yes it was emily  the one haunting anxiety of my life broke outyou havent come to say theres anything amiss with my boy i cried out  no oh no  i think he is safe now but i wanted to tell you i think you ought to be warned  she was trembling so much that i wanted to bring her in and make her rest but she would only sit down on the step of the stile and there she whispered it in this way  you know theres a dreadful scarlet fever at old browns  the old man that sells curiosities  no i did not know it ill keep trevorsham away i said wondering she had come all this way and then asking in a fright surely he has not been there  no i met him on the road with lady hester perrault and i told them i walked back to spinney lawn with them  but as i began to thank her and her voice went lower still butoh ursula lady hester knew it  knew it  yes knew it quite well  she was doing it on purpose  oh emily hid her face in her hands i pray god to forgive me if i am doing a very cruel wicked wrong but i cant help thinking it i had told her only yesterday how bad the fever was in that street she said she had forgotten it and thanked me but she had not her own boy trevor with her  i was too much frozen with the horror of the thing to speak at first and perhaps emily thought i did not quite believe her for she said under her breath and ive heard her talktalk to mammaabout her being so certain that lord trevorsham could not live even when he was past seven years old  they always have said that the first illness would go to his head and carry him off  and when people do wish things very much and then she grew frightened at herself and began blaming herself for the horrible fancy but saying it haunted her every time she saw lord trevorsham in lady hesters sight  that old ballad the wee grovelling doo would come into her head and she had felt as if any harm happened to the child it would be her fault for not having spoken a word of warning and this had determined her  by this time i had taken it in and then the first thing i did was to spring up and ask how she could leave the boy still in the womans power to which she answered that she had walked them back to spinney lawna whole mileand that lady hester could not set forth again now that alured had heard the conversation  he had been bent on going to buy a tame seagull there as a birthday present for trevor and emily had lured him off from that by a promise of getting one from an old fisherman whom she knew  so there was not much fear of his running back into the danger though i should not have a happy moment till he was in my sight again  then emily sprang up saying she must go  she had walked four miles and she must get back as fast as she could  most likely mamma would think her at spinney lawn  but what must not it have cost that timid thing to venture here with her warning  it gave me a double sense of the reality of my boys peril that she had been excited to it and she would not hear of coming in to rest and when i entreated her to wait till i could get the gig to drive her part of the way she held me fast and insisted with all the terror of womanly shamefacedness that hethat torthat mr torwoodshould not know  and she sprang up to go home instantly before he could guess  oh emily that is too bad when nothing would make him so glad  oh no no he has been used too ill he cant care for me now and as if i should  i dont think poor emily uttered anything half so coherent as this at any rate i understood that she disclaimed the least possibility of his affection continuing and felt it an outrage on herself to be where she could even suppose herself to have voluntarily put herself in his way  i thought there was nothing for it but to let her start hurry after her with some vehicle and then call and bring home my boy but in the midst of my perplexity and her struggle with her tears who should appear on the scene but fulk himself driving home the spring cart wherein everybody being busy he had conveyed a pig to a new home  i dont know how it was all done or said  my first notion was that he should be warned of our dear boys danger and rescue him before anything else  i could not get into my head that there was no present reason for dread and yet when i had gasped out oh fulkaluredfetch him home  emily came to warn us the accusation began to seem so monstrous and horrible that i could not go on with it before emily  she too perhaps found it harder to utter to a man than to a woman and between the strangeness of speaking to one another again and her shyness and his wonder and delight it seemed to me unreasonable that poor little alureds danger was counting for nothing between them and i turned from the former reticence to the bereaved tigress style and burst out and are we to stand talking here while our boy is in these peoples power  then fulk did listen to what it was all about but even then it seemed to me he would not think half so much of the peril as of what emily had done  in truth i believe all they both wanted was to get out of my way but they pacified me by fulks undertaking if emily did not object to the cart to drive her across the park where no one would meet her and she could get out only a mile from home and to call at spinney lawn in returning by the road and take up alured  what a drive that must have been  fulk had the advantage over emily in knowing what poor mr dayman had told him whereas she poor child only knew that he had been so vilely served that she thought his affection and esteem had been entirely killed  they had it all out in that tax cart a vehicle fulk now regards as a heavenly chariot and i heard it all afterwards  poor emily she had grown a great deal older in those six years  at eighteen she had implicitly believed in her mother  mrs deerhurst had been so good all those years of striving not to frighten my father that she had been perfection in her daughters eyes  emily had believed with all her heart in her apparent disinterestedness and her hopes and sympathy for us were real and so when the crash really came and she told the poor girl with floods of tears that it was impossible and a thing not to be thought of for a rightminded woman to unite herself to a man of such birth  and poor emily with the conscious ignorance of eighteen believed and was the sort of gentle creature who could easily be daunted by the terror that her generous impulses to share the shame and namelessness were unfeminine and wrong the utter silence had been the consequence of her mother assuring her with authority that the true kindness was to betray no token of feeling that could cherish hope where all was hopeless and that he would regret her less if she commanded herself and gave him no look  it had been terrible calm selfcommand and obedience to abused filial confidence in her mothers infallibility  and then mrs deerhurst had been sinking ever since in her daughters esteem as emily could not but rise higher from the conscientious struggle and selfdenying submission and besides grew older and had more experience while mrs deerhurst no doubt deteriorated in the foreign wandering life and all her motives made themselves evident when she married the younger daughter  emily had thought for herself and seen that advantage had been taken of her innocence and that her betrothed had rights which if she had been older she would not have been persuaded to ignore  but coming home two years later and meeting my cold eyes and fulks ceremonious bow and hearing on all parts that he had accepted his position and had a hard struggle to maintain his two sisters she knowing herself to be portionless could but suffer and be still  of course every attempt of her mothers to get her to marry advantageously and even more mrs deerhursts devotion to lady hester tore away more and more of the veil she had tried to keep over her eyes and as her youngest sister grew up into bloom and into the wish for society emily had been allowed more and more to go her own quiet way in the religious and charitable life of shinglebay where she had peace if not joy  and then came the dayman affair when all the old persecution revived again and emilys foremost defence against him her blushing objection to his birth was set aside as a mere prudish fancy of a young girl  the gentle emily had been irate then and all the more when her mother tried to cover her inconsistency by alleging that everybody knew of lord torwoods fall whereas no one knew or cared who francis dayman was or where he came from  henceforth emilys shame at the usage of fulk had been doubleor rather it turned into indignation reports that he was to marry a rich graziers daughter had no effect in turning her in pique to dayman  she had firmly told her mother that if it were wrong for her to take the one it must be equally so to take the other  this mrs deerhurst had concealed from poor mr dayman nor would emilys modesty allow her to utter the objection to the mans own face so mrs deerhurst encouraged him and trusted to london reports of the graziers daughter and persevering appeals to that filial sense of duty which had been strained so much too far  and now how did it stand  when i secure in knowing that alured was safe at home thinking it abominable nonsense in miss deerhurst to have bothered about scarlet fever hester herself had said so  when i could hear fulks happiness and try to analyse it what did it amount to  why that they knew they loved one another still and never meant to cease  and with what hopes  alas the hopes were all for some time or other  emily would do nothing in flat disobedience and there was little or no hope of her mothers consent to her marrying farmer torwood  she meant to tell her mother thus much that she had seen him and that they loved each other as much as ever and as mrs deerhurst had waived the objection to dayman it could not hold in the other case  it would be in fact a tacit compactscarcely an engagementwith what amount of meeting or correspondence must be left for duty and principle to decide but the love that had existed without aliment for six years might trust now  and hap what hap there never was a happier man than my fulk that evening  he was too joyous not to be universally charitable  nay he called it a blessed fancy of emilys that brought her here as it was emilys and had brought him such bliss he could not quite scorn it but he did not could not believe in it as we did  it was culpable carelessness in hester but colonial people had been used to such health that they did not care about infection  but it was a glorious act of emilys in fact the manly mind could believe nothing so horrible of any woman     chapter vii  hunting   emily told mr dayman the whole truth  poor fellow he could not face fulk again and went back to canada  no doubt emily went through a great deal but we never exactly knew what  fulk wrote to mrs deerhurst stating that he hoped in four years time to be able to purchase the farm of which he had the lease and without going into the past asking her sanction to the engagement  she sent a cold letter in answer to desire that the impertinence should not be repeated  and emily wrote that her mother would not hear of the engagement and she knew fulk would not wish her to deceive or disobey and so we must trust one another still but how sweet to do that  and when any of us met her there were precious little words and looks and fulk meant to try again after the four years  in the meantime he was much respected and had made himself a place of his own  it chafed hester to perceive that though she had pulled us down she could not depress us after the first  she had lowered her position too by her marriage   at first perrault was on his good behaviour and made a favourable impression among the secondrate shinglebay society hester got round her but as the hopes of the title coming to her diminished he kept less within bounds did not treat her well at home and took to racing and gambling  i never could get fulk to share my alarms about alured but he did not think perraults society fit for the boy told alured so and forbade him to go to spinney lawn  but though alured was much improved as to obedience it was almost impossible to enforce this command  hester had some strange fascination for him  she would fiercely caress him at times and he knew she was his sister and could not see why when she was often alone he should not be with her  the passion for trevor was in full force too and the boys could not be content only to meet at the farm  we tried sending alured to make visits from home in the holidays but he did not like it and he was not happy his heart was with his home and with trevor  we tried having a tutor for the spring holidays before he went to eton but it did not answer  he was not a sensible man did not like dining in the keepingroom with the household and though he did it he showed that he thought it a condescension  moreover instead of attending to alured he was always trying to flirt with jaquetta infinitely disturbing arthur cradocks peace and the end of it was that alured was a great deal more left to his own devices than ever he had been before and exasperated besides  he was in that mood when one day as he was riding along the lanes he met perrault and trevor coming in from hunting  alured had a very pretty pony but he was growing rather large for it and fulk had promised that if he worked well at eton he should have a lovely little arab that was being trained by a dealer he knew and that another year fulk himself would go out hunting with him  perrault began to pity him for having missed the run  why did not his brother take him out  fulks old mare was a sort of elephant and it was not convenient to get another horse just then  that alured knew and explained but he was pitied the more for being kept back and perrault ended by saying that if on the next hunting day he could meet them at the corner of the park a capital mount should be there for him  the hour was attainable if alured made haste with his studies and he accepted gladly and without compunction  fulk had never in so many words forbidden him and besides fulk had delegated his authority to the hateful tutor  but the next morning before alured was up trevor was in his bedroom you wont go trevorsham  yes i shall im not such a muff as to stay for that fellow  but i need not try to tell what passed as of course i did not hear it i never so much as knew of it till long after only trevorsham was determined and trevor tried all round the due arguments of principle honour and duty but alured had worked up a schoolboy selfjustification on all points and besides had the stronghold of i will and i dont care  then trevor told him under his breath he was sure it was not a safe horse  but my highspirited boy laughed this to scorn  and perhaps hell play you some trick added trevor  but trevorsham was still undaunted in his selfwill till trevor resolutely announced his determination if nothing else would stop it of going at once to fulk and informing him  the boy endured all the rage and scorn that a threat so contrary to all schoolboy codes of honour and friendship might deserve  i believe alured struck him but at any rate trevor lea gained his point though at the cost of a desperate quarrel  alured held aloof and sulked at him for the remaining fortnight at home and only vouchsafed the explanation to us that lea was a horrid little sneak and he had done with him  they did not make it up till they met in the same house at eton and then though trevor was placed far above alured they became as friendly as ever  in fact i believe alured having imprudently denominated himself by his full title was having it kicked out of him when the fortunate possessor of the monosyllabic name came and stood by him and made common cause to the entire renewing of love  poor trevor his was a dreary home  his mother loved him passionately but she was an anxious worn disappointed woman always craving restless and expectant of something and perrault was always tormenting her for money  he was deeply in debt and though he could not touch the bulk of her fortuneneither indeed could she as it was conveyed to trusteeshe was always demanding money of her and bullying her while matters grew worse and worse and they were in danger of having to let spinney lawn and go to live abroad  as to keeping trevor at eton that was becoming impossible  at christmas the tutor consulted fulk about how he should get leas bills paid and intimated that he must not return unless this were done  and poor trevor himself had little comfort except with us  we encouraged him to come to us for we had all come to have a very real love for the dear lad himself and we saw he was unhappy at home besides that it was the only way of keeping alured contented  trevor had entirely left off inviting alured to spinney lawn partly he was too gentlemanly and good a boy not to be ashamed of the men who hung about the stables and besides we now perceive that the same awful impression that was on emily deerhurst was upon him and that he had a sense that trevorsham was regarded in a manner that made his presence there a peril  he was but a boy and it was an undefined horror and he never breathed a word of it but oh there was a weight on that young brow an anxious look about the face and though now and then he would be all joy and fun still there was the older more sorrowful look about him  we thought he was grieving at not going back to eton and fulk was living in hopes of an answer to the letter he had written to francis dayman about it but that was not all  one daychristmas eve it wasmr cradock on coming into the church to look at the holly wreaths found trevor kneeling on his fathers gravestone in the pavement sobbing as if his heart was breaking and heard between the sobs a broken prayer about forgivedont let them do itturn mothers heart  then mr cradock went out of hearing but he waited for the boy outside and asked if he could do anything for him  no  trevor shook his head thanked him and grew reserved     chapter viii  duck shooting   alureds thirteenth birthday was on the 10th of january and he had extracted a promise from fulk to take him duckshooting to the mouth of our little river  nothing can be prettier than our tide river by day with the retreating banks overhung with trees the longlegged herons standing in the firs looking like toys in a german box while the breadth of blue water reflects the trees that bend down to it  but on a winters night to creep in perfect silence and lie still under an overhanging bank not daring to make a sound till you could get a shot at the ducks disporting themselves in the moonlight on the frozen mud on the banks  such an occupation could only be endurable under the name of sport  however fulk and bertram had had their time and now alured was having the infection in his turn but trevor was driven over to spend the day much mortified that he had a bad broken chilblain which made his boots unwearable and it was the more disappointing that it was a very hard frost and there was a report that some wild swans had been seen on the river  but in the course of the day jaquetta routed out a pair of india rubber boots which with worsted stockings beneath did not press the chilblains at all and after having spent all the day in snowballing and building forts trevor declared himself far from lame and resolved not to lose the fun  he had not come equipped so alured put him into an old grey coat and cap of his own and merrily they started in the frosty moonlight with dashes of snow lying under the hedges and everything intensely light  fulk grumbling in fun at being dragged away from his warm fire and pretending to be grown old the boys shouting to one another full of glee all the dogs in the yard clamouring because only the wise old retriever captain was allowed to be of the party arthur cradock making ridiculous mistakes on purpose between the uncle and nephew trevorsham and sham trevor as he called them  alas  nay shall i say alas or only be thankful  they had been gone some time when we heard a rapid tread coming towards the porch  something in the very sound thrilled jaquetta and me at once with dismay  we darted out and saw brand the head gamekeeper in the park  never fear my lady thank god he said my lord is quite safe it is poor master lea who is hurt and mr torwood sent me up for some brandy and a mattress and a lantern and some cloths  that assured us that he was alive and we ran to fulfil the request in the utmost haste without asking further questions and sending off sisson to ride for the poor mother and to go on to shinglebay for the doctor though to our comfort we knew that arthur had almost finished his surgical education and was sure to know what was to be done  a stray shot we said again and again to each other and we called nurse rowe and made up a bed in alureds old nursery and lighted a fire and were all ready with hearts beating heavy with suspense before the steps came backmy poor alured first as we held the door open  how pale his face looked and his brows were drawn with horror and his steps dragging saying not a word but trembling as he came and held by me with one hand on my waist while fulk and sisson carried in the mattress arthur cradock at the side and perrault who had joined them walking behind with the flask  dear trevor lay white with sobbing breath and closed eyes the cloths and mattress soaked through and through with blood  they put him down on the keepingroom table and arthur poured more brandy into his mouth  i said something of the room being ready but arthur said very low he is dyinginternal bleeding and when jaquetta asked can nothing be done he answered nothing but to leave him still  trevorsham murmured the feeble voice and alured was close to him ally you are all right and then again as alured assured him he would be better no i shant im so glad it wasnt you  i always thought hed do it some day and now youre quite safe i want to thank god  we did not understand those words then we did soon  the weak voice rambled on to thank god but oh it hurts soi canti will when i get there  then presently mother  shell come very soon said alured  mother oh mother trevorsham dont let them know  o trev promise promise  promise what  i promise whatever it is  only tell me entreated alured  take care of herof mother  dont let and then his eyes met perraults and a shudder came all over him which brought the end nearer and all another spoonful of brandy could do was to enable him to say something in alureds ear and then a broken word or twoforgivegladpray and when we all knelt and fulk did say the lords prayer and a verse or two more there was a peaceful loving look at fulk and jaquetta and me and then the whisper of the name that is above every name as a glad brightness came over the face and the eyes looked upwards and so grew set in their gaze and there was the sound one never can forget  nurse rowe laid her hand on alureds neck as he knelt with his head close to trevors  fulk and i looked at each other and we knew that all was over  they had tried in vain to check the bleeding  no one could have done more than arthur had done but a main artery had been injured and nothing could have saved him  he had said nothing after the first cry except when he saw alureds grief  never mind im glad it was not you  and once or twice as they carried him home he had begged to be put down though they durst not attend to the entreaty and arthur did not think he had suffered much pain  it jarred that just as we would have knelt for one silent prayer perraults voice broke on us  ah poor boy it is better than if it lasted longer  i saw that halfwitted  fellow billy blake about so i dont wonder at anything but of course it was a mere accident and i shall not press it  scarcely hearing him i had joined mrs rowe in the endeavour to detach alured from his dear companion when there was poor hester among us with open horrorstricken eyes and a wild frightful shriek as she leapt forward and no words can describe the misery of her voice as she called on her boy to look at her and speak to hergathering him into her bosom with a passionate desperate clasp that seemed almost an outrage on the calm awful stillness of the innocent child and alured involuntarily cried oh dont while fulk spoke to her kindly but just then she saw her husband and sprang on her feet her eyes flashing her hands stretched out while she screamed out you here you dare to come here  you who killed him  fulk caught her arm saying hush hester come away  it was a lamentable accident but  oh the laugh she gave was the most horrible thing i ever heard accident i tell you it has been his one thought to make accidents for trevorsham  and he hated my childmy dear noble beautiful only one  he made him miserable and murdered him at last  she gave another passionate kiss to the cheeks and then just as i hoped she was going to let us lead her away she darted from us rushed past mr cradock who was entering the porch and in another moment he hurrying after her saw her rush down the steep grassy slope and fling herself into the swollen rapid stream  his shout brought them all out and fulk found him too in the river holding her and struggling with the stream which winter had made full and violent and the black darkness of the shadows made it hard to find any landing place and he was nearly swept away before it was possible to get them out of the river and fulk was as completely drenched as he was when they brought poor hester quite unconscious up to the house and brought her to the room that had been prepared for her son and there dr brown and arthur gave us plenty to do in filling hotwater baths and warming flannels or rubbing the icy hands and feet  only that constant need of exertion could have borne us through the horror of it all  but it was not over yet  there was a call of ursula and as i ran down i found fulk standing at the bottom of the stairs with alured in his arms looking like death  i found him on the parlour sofa the little window and the escritoire open  fulk said breathlessly the villain  im not hurt said dear alureds voice faintly but reassuringly oh put me down fulk  we did put him down on the floorthere was no other placewith his head on my lap and i found strange voices asking him what perrault had done to him  oh nothing twasnt that  yes hes gone out by the window  he swallowed some wine and then sat up leaning against me as i sat at the bottom of the stairs quite himself again and assuring us that he was not hurt perrault never touched himthreatened you then said fulk  no said alured as if he hadnt spirit to be indignant i meant him to get off  lord trevorsham cried a voice in great displeasure and i saw that mr halsted the nearest magistrate was standing over us  he told metrevor didsaid alured  told you to assist the murderer to escape exclaimed mr halsted  alured let his head fall back and would not answer and fulk said there is no need for him to speak at present is there  the constable and the rest are gone after perrault but i do not yet know what has directed the suspicion against him  and then at the stair foot for there was no other place to go to we came to an understanding the two gentlemen and brand the keeper standing and i seated on the step with my boy lying against me  i could not trust him out of my sight nor indeed was he fit to be left  it seems that brand had been uneasy about the number of shooters whom the report of the swans had attracted and though the bank of the river was not trevorsham ground he had kept along on the border of the covers higher up the hill to guard his hares and pheasants  thus he had seen everything distinctly in the moonlight against the snowy bank below and he had observed one figure in particular moving stealthily along in a parallel line with that which he knew our party would take though they were in shadow and he could not see them  suddenly a chance shot fired somewhere made all the ducks fly up a head and shoulders that brand took for his young lords appeared beyond the shadow beside fulks and at the same moment he saw the man whom he had been watching level his gun from behind and fire then came the cry and brand running down in horror himself was amazed to see this person doing the same and when they came up with the group he recognised perrault and found at the same time that trevor was the sufferer and that lord trevorsham was safe  he then would have thought it an accident but for perraults own needless wonder whence the shot came and that same remark that billy blake the halfwitted son of a farmer was about that night  brand a shrewd fellow restrained his reply that mr perrault knew most about it himself  he saw that the most pressing need was to obey fulk in fetching necessaries from our house and that perrault meant to disarm suspicion by treating it as an accident so he thought it best to go off to a magistrate with his story before giving any alarm feeling certain as he said that the shot had been meant for the earl as indeed perraults first exclamation on coming up showed that he too had expected to find trevorsham the wounded one  mr halsted had sent for the constable and came at once though even then inclined to doubt whether brand had not imputed accident to malice  but perraults flight had settled that question  during the confusion while hester was being carried upstairs the miscreant had the opportunity of speaking to the child  drowned  no she is not drowned but she may be the other thing if you dont get me off  what dont you understand  let the law lay a finger on me and what is to hinder me from telling how your sweet sister has been plotting to get youyes you out of the way of her darling  no you neednt fear theres nothing to get by it now lucky for you you brought the poor boy out when i thought him safe by the fire nursing his chilblain  but mind this if i am arrested all the story shall come out  ill not swing alone  if i fired she pointed the gun  and you may judge if that was what poor trevor meant by his mutterings to you about mother  but what do you want alured asked  he had backed up against the wall he was past being frightened but he felt numb and sick with horror and ready to do anything to get the wretch out of his sight  i want a clear way out of the house and all the cash you can get together  what no more than that  id not be a lord to be kept so short  find me some more  alured knew i should forgive him and he took my key from my basket unlocked the escritoire and gave him my purse of household money undid the shutters and helped perrault to squeeze himself through the little parlour window and then as he said something came over him and he just reached the sofa and knew no more  he did not tell all this about hester before mr halsted only when fulk finding how shaken he was had carried him upstairs and we had taken him to his room he asked anxiously whether anyone had heard hester say that dreadful thing and added then if mr perrault gets away no one will knowabout her  was that why you helped him we asked  trevor told me to take care of her he said and then he told us of perraults arguments but we ought not to have let him talk of them that night for it brought back the shuddering and sobbing and the horror seemed to come upon him so that there was no soothing him or getting him calm till the doctor mixed an anodyne draught and let it go as it would with hester i never left my boy till i had crooned him to sleep as in the old times     chapter ix  trevors legacy   jaquetta bore the brunt of that night and showed the stuff she was made of for poor hester had only revived to fall into a most frightful state of delirium raving and struggling so that the doctor and arthur could hardly hold her  so it went on for hours alured the only creature asleep in the house and we not daring to send for any help from without poor hesters exclamations were so dreadful  poor alured his waking was sad enough  he had loved trevor with all his heart and the wonder that anyone could be so wicked oppressed him almost as much as the grief  the remnants of the opiate hung upon him too and he lay about all day hardly rousing himself to speak or look but giddily and drowsy  not till the inquest was it perceived how cleverly perrault had taken his measures so that had he not made the mistake between the two boys he would scarcely have been suspected certainly not but for brands having watched him  the report of the wild swans was traced to him  no doubt it was as an excuse for a heavier charge for poor trevor was wounded with shot that would not have been used merely for ducks and besides the other shooters it attracted would be likely to make detection less easy indeed fulk had seen that there were enough men about to spoil their sport and but for the boys eagerness would have turned back  moreover it was proved that perrault had in the course of the morning met billy blake and asked him if he meant to bag the swanif he followed the young lords party and fired when they did he would be sure to bring something down  he did not know that the blakes never let the poor fellow load his old gun with anything but powder  then his joining the horrified group as if he had been merely after the ducks and had been attracted by the cry had entirely deceived us and but for hesters accusation brands evidence and his own flight together with all the past might have continued to do so  he had gone to his own house as it afterwards turned out entered so quietly that the listening watching servants never heard him collected all the valuables he could easily carry away changed his dress and gone off before the search had followed him thither  a verdict of wilful murder was returned against him at the inquest but it is very doubtful whether he could have been convicted of anything but manslaughter for even if the intention could have been proved without his wife whose evidence was inadmissible the malice was not directed against his victim but against trevorsham  we could not but feel it a relief day by day that nothing was heard of him for who could tell what disclosures there might be about the poor thing who lay delirious needing perpetual watchfulness arthur devoted himself to the care of her and never left us or i do not see how we could have gone through it all  alured was well again but inert and crushed and heartless about doing anything except that he walked over to spinney lawn and brought home trevors dog to which he gave himself up all day and insisted on having it in his room at night  the burial was in the vaultnobody attended but fulk and alured not even arthur for though the poor mother was not aware of what was going on it was such a dreadful day with her that he durst not leave us alone to the watch  it was enough to break ones heart to stand by the window and hear her wandering on about her trevor coming to his place and not being kept from his position while we watched the little coffin carried across the field by the labouring men with those two walking after it  our boys first funeral was that of the friend who had died in his stead  we were glad to send him back to eton out of the sound of his poor sisters voice though he went off very mournfully declaring that he should be even more wretched there without trevor than he was at home and that he never should do any good without him  but there he was wrong i am thankful to say  dear trevor was more a guide to him dead than living  trevors chief eton friend young maitland a good highprincipled clever boy a little older who had valued him for what he was while passing alured by as a foolish idle little swell took pity upon him in the grief and dejection of his lossdid for him all and more than trevor could do and has been the friend and blessing of his life aiding the depth and earnestness that seemed to pass into our dear child as he hung over the dying lad yes trevor lea and john maitland did for our trevorsham what all our love and care had never been able to do  meantime hesters illness took its course  the chill of that icy water had done great harm and there was much inflammation at first leaving such oppression of breath that permanent injury to the lungs was expected and therefore it was all the sadder to see the dumb despair with which she returned to understanding i can hardly say to memory for i believe she had never lost it for a moment  hopeless heedless reckless speechless she was a passive weight lying or sitting eating or drinking as she was bidden but not making any manifestation of preference or dislike save that she turned rigidly and sullenly away from any attempt to read prayers to her  she asked no questions attempted no employment but seemed to care for nothing and for weeks uttering nothing but a yes no or a mechanical thank you  jaquetta tried to caress her by force of nursing and pity  jaquetta really had come to a warm tender love for her but she sullenly pushed away the sweet face and turned aside  we never ventured to leave her alone and this after a time began to vex her  she bade us go down once or twice and tried to send away mrs rowe and at last when she found it was never permitted she broke out angrily one day you are very absurd to take so much trouble to hinder what cannot make any difference  it made ones blood run cold and yet it was a relief that the silence was broken  i cant tell what i said only i implored her not to think so and told her that her having been rescued was a sign that heaven would have her repent and come back but she laughed that horrible laugh  do you think i repent she said no only that i left it to that fool  i should have made no mistakes  i was too much horrified to do anything but hide my eyes and pray  i thought i did not do so obviously but hester saw or guessed stamped at me and said dont i will not have it done  it is mockery  happily you cannot prevent our doing that my poor lady hester i said  all i wish you to do is what you would do if you had a spark of natural feeling  what i asked bewildered at this apparent accusation of unkindness  leave me to myself  send me from your door  not oppress me with this ridiculous burthensome care and attention all out of the family pride you still keep up in the trevors she sneered  no hester  sister hester will you not believe it is love  i said thinking that if she would believe that we loved her and forgave her it might help her to believe that her father above did i had never called her by her name alone before but i thought it might draw her nearer but it made her only fiercer  nonsense she said i know better  and then she fell into the same deadly gloom but i think she had almost a wild animals longing for solitude for she made a solemn promise not to attempt her life if we would only leave her alone  and we did though we took care someone was within hearing for she was still very weak and we had not a bell in the house except a little hand one on the table  so the easter holidays drew on and she was still far too weak and unwell for any thought of moving her so that we were in trouble about alureds holidays not liking him to come home to a house of illness that would renew his sorrow and advising him to accept some invitations from his schoolfellows but he wrote that he particularly wished to come homehe could not bear to be away and maitland wanted to see the place and know all about dear lea so might he bring him home  we were only too glad to consent and i had gone to sleep with jaquetta so as to make roomfeeling very happy over the best school report of our boy we had ever had though not the best we were to have  he spent two or three days at mr maitlands in london and then he and his friend john came on here  the railway did not come within twenty miles then and they had to post from it in flies  how delightful it was to see the tall hat and wide white collar as he stood up in the open fly signalling to us and pointing us out to his friend  only what must it have been to the poor sufferer in the room above  oh did not ones heart go out in prayer for her  out jumped alured among all of us and all the dogs at the garden gate and the first thing after his kiss to us all was to turn to the fly and take out a flowerpot with a beautiful delicate forced rose in it  wheres hester he said  my dear child she has not left her room yet  she is well enough for me to take this to her i suppose he said he always did get some flower like this to bring home to her you know she liked them so much  it was just his one idea that trevor had told him to take his place to her  we looked doubtfully at each other but fulk quietly said yes you may go  and added as the boy went off it can do no harm to her in the end poor thing  to her no that was not my fear  there was alured almost exactly what trevor had been when last she saw him with his bright sweet honest face over the rose running up the stairs knocking and coming in with his boyish good morning hester i do hope you are better and bending down with his fresh brotherly kiss on her poor hot forehead ive got this rose for you the bud will be out in a day or two  if ever there was a modern version of st dorothys roses it was there  that boys kiss and his gift touched the place in her heart  she caught him passionately in her arms and held him till he almost lost breath and then she held him off from her as vehemently  boytrevorshamwhat do you come to me for  he told me said alured half dismayed  besides you are my sister  sister indeed  dont you know we would have killed you  never mind that said alured with an odd sort of readiness  you are my sister all the same and ohif you would let me try to be a little bit of trevor to you though i know i cant  youwho must hate me  no said he i always did like you hester and ive been thinking about you all the halfwhenever i thought of him  and as the tears came into the boys eyes the blessed weeping came at last to hester  he thought he had done her harm for she cried till she was absolutely spent sick faint and weak as a child  but she was like a child and when her head was on the pillow she begged for trevorsham to wish her goodnight  i think she tried to fancy his kiss was trevors  any way the bitter black despair was gone from that time  she believed in and accepted his kindness like a sort of after glow from trevors love  perhaps it did her the more good that after all he was only a boy sometimes forgot her and sometimes hurried after his own concerns so that there was more excitement in it than if it had been the steady certain tenderness of an older person on which she could reckon  she certainly cared for no one like trevorsham  she even came downstairs that she might see him more constantly and while he was at home she seemed to think of no one else  but she had softened to us all and accepted us as her belongings in a matterofcourse kind of way  only when he was gone did she one day say in a heavy dreary tone that she must soon be leaving us  but i told her as we had agreed that she was very far from well enough to go away alone for indeed it was true that disease of the lungs had set in and to send her away to languish and die alone was not to be thought of  my answer made her look up to me and say i dont see why you should all be so good to me  do you know how i have hated you  i could not help smiling a little at that it had so little to do with the matter but i bent down and kissed her the first time i had ever done so  i dont understand it she said and then pushing me away suddenly no you cannot know that iii was the first to devise mischief against that boy  perrault would never have thought of it but for me now you see whom you are harbouring  perhaps you thought it all perraults doing  no we did not i said  and you still cherish me  iwho drove you from your home and rank and came from wishing the death of your darling to contriving it  i told her we knew it  and at last after a long long silence she looked up from her joined hands and said if i may only see my child again even from the other side of the great gulf i would be ready for any torment  it would be no torment to me so i saw him do you think i shall be allowed ursula  how i longed for more power more words to tell her how infinitely more mercy there was than she thought of  i dont think she took it in then but the beginning was made and she turned away no more from what she looked on at first as a means of bringing her to her boy but byandby became even more to her  gradually she told how the whole history had come about  she had thought nothing of the discovery of her birth till her boy was born but from that time the one thought of seeing him in the rank she thought his due had eaten into her heart  she had loved her husband before but his resistance had chafed her and gradually she felt it an injustice and cruelty and her love and respect withered away till she regarded him as an obstacle  and when she had spent her labour on the voyage and obtained recognition from her fatherbehold alureds existence deprived her of the prize almost within her grasp  a settled desire for the poor babys death was the consequence kept up by the continued reports of his danger  till that time she had prayed then a sense that heaven was unjust to her and her boy filled her with grim rebellion and she prayed no more and perrault by his constant return to the subject and speculations on it kept her mind on it far more  but alured lived and every time she saw him she half hated him half loved him hated him as standing in her sons light loved him because she could not help loving trevors shadow  that day when emily met themit had been a sudden impulsealured had been talking to her about his plans for trevors birthday and as he spoke of that street the wild thought came over her how easily a fever might yet sweep him away  and yet she says all down the street she was trying to persuade herself to forget emilys warning and to disbelieve in the infection  after all she thought even if she had not met emily she should have made some excuse for turning back such a pitiful thought came of the fair fresh face flushing and dying  but it was prevented only it left fruits for perrault had heard what passed between her and trevorsham  did you take him to the shop he asked  and when she mentioned miss deerhursts reminder he said ah that game wants skill and coolness to carry it out  she says that was almost all that passed in so many words but from that time she never doubted that perrault would take any opportunity of occasioning danger to trevorsham and strange to say she lived in a continued agony half of hope half of terror and grief and pity her longing for trevors promotion balanced by the thought of the grief he would suffer for his friend  any time those five years she told me she thought that had she seen perrault hurting him she should have rushed between to save him and yet in other moods when she planned for her son she would herself have done anything to sweep alured from his path  and the frequent discussion with perrault of plans depending on the possession of the trevorsham property kept the consciousness of his purpose before her and as debt and desperation grew she was more and more sure of it  that last day when trevor had been driven away lamenting his inability to go out duck shooting perrault had quietly said in the late evening i shall take a turn in the salt marshes tonightopportunities may offer  the wretch  fulk thinks he said so to implicate her  at any rate it left her shuddering with dread and remorse yet half triumphant at the notion of putting an end to fulks power over the estate and of installing her son as heir of trevorsham  she had no fears for him she trusted to his lame foot to detain him and said to herself that if it was to be he would be spared the sight she was growing jealous of his love for alured and of us and had a fierce glad hope of getting him more to herself  and then oh poor hester  no wonder her desire was to be       anywhere anywhere      out of the world   but out of all the anguish the remorse the despair repentance grew at last  love seemed to open the heart to it  the sense of infinite redeeming love penetrated at last and trust in pardon and with pardon came peace  peace grew on her through increasing selfcondemnation and bearing her up as the bodily powers failed more and more  there is little more to say  she was a dear and precious charge to us and as she grew weaker she also became more cheerful and even that terrible brokenhearted sense of bereavement calmed  she found out about jaquetta and arthur and took great interest in his arrangements for getting a partnership at shinglebay  and hester said jaquetta it is so lucky for me that i came down from being a fine lady  i might never have known arthur and if i had what an absurd creature i should have been as a poor mans wife  as to the deerhursts the mother sent a servant once or twice to inquire but never came herself to see her dear friend and miss prior took care to tell us that there were horrid whispers about that hester had known and if not mrs deerhurst could not have on her visiting list the wife of a man with a warrant out against him she thought it very unfeeling in us to harbour her  but emily came  hester had a great longing to thank her for checking her on that walk to the scarletfever place and asked jaquetta one day to write to her and beg her to come to see a dying woman  emily showed the note to her mother and did not ask leave  the white doe had become a much more valiant animal  hester had liked emily even while emily shrank from her and she now realized what she had inflicted upon her and fulk  she asked emilys pardon for it as she had asked fulks and said that when she was gone she hoped all would come right  of course the old position could not be restored but she knew now why joel lea had such an instinct against it  i feel she once said as if satan had offered me all this for my soul and i had taken the bargain  aye and if gods providence had allowed our wicked purpose he would have had it too  my husband he prayed for me and my boy did too  she always called joel lea my husband now and thought and talked much of their early love and his warnings  i think the way she had saddened his later years grieved her as much as anything and all her affection seemed revived  she lingered on never leaving the house indeed but not much worse till the year had come round again and we loved her more each day we nursed her  and when the end came suddenly at last we mourned as for a dear sister  perrault wrote oncea threatening swaggering letter from america demanding hushmoney  it did not come till she was too ill to open itonly in the last week before her death and it was left till we settled her affairs  then fulk wrote and told him of the verdict against him and recommended him to let himself be heard of no more  and he took the advice  we found that dear hester had left all the fortune 30000 pounds which had been settled on herself and trevor to be divided equally between us three  nor had we any scruple in profiting by it  trevorsham had enough and it was what my father would have given us if he could  it was enough to make jaquetta and her young dr cradock settle down happily and prosperously on the practice they bought  and enough too together with emilys strong quiet determination to make mrs deerhurst withdraw her opposition  daughters of twentynine years old may get their own way  moreover a drawingroom and diningroom were built on to skimpings lawn though alured declares they have spoilt the place and nothing ever was so jolly as the keepingroom  we had a beautiful double wedding in the summer in our old church and since that i have come to make the old hall homelike to my boy in the holidays  we are very happy together when he comes home and fills the house with his young friends and if it feels too large and empty for me in his absence i can always walk down for a happy afternoon with emily or go and make a longer visit to jaquetta  and i dont think as a leader of the fashion she would have been half so happy as the motherly active readyhanded doctors wife  but best of all to me are those quiet moments when alureds earnest spirit shows itself and he talks out what is in his heart that it is a great responsibility to stand in the place such a man as fulk would have hadyesand to have been saved at the cost of trevors life  i believe the pure calm remembrance of trevor leas life will be his guiding star and that he will be worthy of it
