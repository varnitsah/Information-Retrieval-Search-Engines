came to america in a flood of winter sunshine that made unaccustomed eyelids blink and the new yorker who is nothing if not modest said this isnt a sample of our really fine days wait until such and such times come or go to such and a such a quarter of the city we were content and more than content to drift aimlessly up and down the brilliant streets wondering a little why the finest light should be wasted on the worst pavements in the world to walk round and round madison square because that was full of beautifully dressed babies playing countingout games or to gaze reverently at the broadshouldered pugnosed irish new york policemen wherever we went there was the sun lavish and unstinted working nine hours a day with the colour and the cleancut lines of perspective that he makes that any one should dare to call this climate muggy yea even subtropical was a shock there came such a man and he said go north if you want weatherweather that is weather go to new england so new york passed away upon a sunny afternoon with her roar and rattle her complex smells her triply overheated rooms and much too energetic inhabitants while the train went north to the lands where the snow lay it came in one sweepalmost it seemed in one turn of the wheelscovering the winterkilled grass and turning the frozen ponds that looked so white under the shadow of lean trees into pools of ink  as the light closed in a little wooden town white cloaked and dumb slid past the windows and the strong light of the car lamps fell upon a sleigh the driver furred and muffled to his nose turning the corner of a street now the sleigh of a picturebook however well one knows it is altogether different from the thing in real life a means of conveyance at a journeys end but it is well not to be overcurious in the matter for the same american who has been telling you at length how he once followed a kilted scots soldier from chelsea to the tower out of pure wonder and curiosity at his bare knees and sporran will laugh at your interest in just a cutter  the staff of the trainsurely the great american nation would be lost if deprived of the ennobling society of brakeman conductor pullmancar conductor negro porter and newsboytold pleasant tales as they spread themselves at ease in the smoking compartments of snowings up the line to montreal of desperate attacksfour engines together and a snowplough in fronton drifts thirty feet high and the pleasures of walking along the tops of goods wagons to brake a train with the thermometer thirty below freezing it comes cheaper to kill men that way than to put airbrakes on freightcars said the brakeman  thirty below freezing it was inconceivable till one stepped out into it at midnight and the first shock of that clear still air took away the breath as does a plunge into seawater a walrus sitting on a woolpack was our host in his sleigh and he wrapped us in hairy goatskin coats caps that came down over the ears buffalo robes and blankets and yet more buffalorobes till we too looked like walruses and moved almost as gracefully the night was as keen as the edge of a newlyground sword breath froze on the coatlapels in snow the nose became without sensation and the eyes wept bitterly because the horses were in a hurry to get home and whirling through air at zero brings tears but for the jingle of the sleighbells the ride might have taken place in a dream for there was no sound of hoofs upon the snow the runners sighed a little now and again as they glided over an inequality and all the sheeted hills round about were as dumb as death only the connecticut river kept up its heart and a lane of black water through the packed ice we could hear the stream worrying round the heels of its small bergs elsewhere there was nothing but snow under the moonsnow drifted to the level of the stone fences or curling over their tops in a lip of frosted silver snow banked high on either side of the road or lying heavy on the pines and the hemlocks in the woods where the air seemed by comparison as warm as a conservatory it was beautiful beyond expression natures boldest sketch in black and white done with a japanese disregard of perspective and daringly altered from time to time by the restless pencils of the moon  in the morning the other side of the picture was revealed in the colours of the sunlight there was never a cloud in the sky that rested on the snowline of the horizon as a sapphire on white velvet hills of pure white or speckled and furred with woods rose up above the solid white levels of the fields and the sun rioted over their embroideries till the eyes ached here and there on the exposed slopes the days warmththe thermometer was nearly forty degreesand the nights cold had made a bald and shining crust upon the snow but the most part was soft powdered stuff ready to catch the light on a thousand crystals and multiply it sevenfold through this magnificence and thinking nothing of it a woodsledge drawn by two shaggy red steers the unbarked logs diamonddusted with snow shouldered down the road in a cloud of frosty breath it is the mark of inexperience in this section of the country to confound a sleigh which you use for riding with the sledge that is devoted to heavy work and it is i believe a still greater sign of worthlessness to think that oxen are driven as they are in most places by scientific twisting of the tail the driver with red mittens on his hands felt overstockings that come up to his knees and perhaps a silverygray coonskin coat on his back walks beside crying gee haw even as is written in american stories and the speech of the driver explains many things in regard to the dialect story which at its best is an infliction to many now that i have heard the long unhurried drawl of vermont my wonder is not that the new england tales should be printed in what for the sake of argument we will call english and its type but rather that they should not have appeared in swedish or russian our alphabet is too limited this part of the country belongs by laws unknown to the united states but which obtain all the world over to the new england story and the ladies who write it you feel this in the air as soon as you see the whitepainted wooden houses left out in the snow the austere schoolhouse and the peoplethe men of the farms the women who work as hard as they with it may be less enjoyment of lifethe other houses well painted and quaintly roofed that belong to judge this lawyer that and banker such an one all powers in the metropolis of six thousand folk over by the railway station more acutely still do you realise the atmosphere when you read in the local paper announcements of chicken suppers and church sociables to be given by such and such a denomination sandwiched between paragraphs of genial and friendly interest showing that the countryside live and without slaying each other on terms of terrifying intimacy  the folk of the old rock the dwellers in the older houses born and raised hereabouts would not live out of the town for any consideration and there are insane people from the southmen and women from boston and the likewho actually build houses out in the open country two and even three miles from main street which is nearly 400 yards long and the centre of life and population with the strangers more particularly if they do not buy their groceries in the street which means and is the town the town has little to do but it knows everything and much more also that goes on among them their dresses their cattle their views the manners of their children their manner towards their servants and every other conceivable thing is reported digested discussed and rediscussed up and down main street now the wisdom of vermont not being at all times equal to grasping all the problems of everybody elses life with delicacy sometimes makes pathetic mistakes and the town is set by the ears you will see therefore that towns of a certain size do not differ materially all the world over the talk of the men of the farms is of their farmspurchase mortgage and sale recorded rights boundary lines and road tax it was in the middle of new zealand on the edge of the wild horse plains that i heard this talk last when a man and his wife twenty miles from the nearest neighbour sat up half the night discussing just the same things that the men talked of in main street vermont usa  there is one man in the state who is much exercised over this place he is a farmhand raised in a hamlet fifteen or twenty miles from the nearest railway and greatly daring he has wandered here the bustle and turmoil of main street the new glare of the electric lights and the fivestoreyed brick business block frighten and distress him much he has taken service on a farm well away from these delirious delights and says he ive been offered 25 a month to work in a bakery at new york but you dont get me to no new york ive seen this place an it just scares me his strength is in the drawing of hay and the feeding of cattle winter life on a farm does not mean the comparative idleness that is so much written of each hour seems to have its sixty minutes of work for the cattle are housed and eat eternally the colts must be turned out for their drink and the ice broken for them if necessary then ice must be stored for the summer use and then the real work of hauling logs for firewood begins new england depends for its fuel on the woods the trees are blazed in the autumn just before the fall of the leaf felled later cut into fourfoot lengths and as soon as the friendly snow makes sledging possible drawn down to the woodhouse afterwards the needs of the farm can be attended to and a farm like an arch is never at rest a little later will come maplesugar time when the stately maples are tapped as the sap begins to stir and beringed with absurd little buckets a cow being milked into a thimble gives some idea of the disproportion which are emptied into cauldrons afterwards this is the time of the sugaringoff parties you pour the boiled syrup into tins full of fresh snow where it hardens and you pretend to help and become very sticky and make love boys and girls together even the introduction of patent sugar evaporators has not spoiled the lovemaking  there is a certain scarcity of men to make love with not so much in towns which have their own manufactories and lie within a lovers sabbathday journey of new york but in the farms and villages the men have gone awaythe young men are fighting fortune further west and the women remainremain for ever as women must on the farms when the children depart the old man and the old woman strive to hold things together without help and the womans portion is work and monotony sometimes she goes mad to an extent which appreciably affects statistics and is put down in census reports more often let us hope she dies in the villages where the necessity for heavy work is not so urgent the women find consolation in the formation of literary clubs and circles and so gather to themselves a great deal of wisdom in their own way that way is not altogether lovely they desire facts and the knowledge that they are at a certain page in a german or an italian book before a certain time or that they have read the proper books in a proper way at any rate they have something to do that seems as if they were doing something it has been said that the new england stories are cramped and narrow even a faroff view of the ironbound life whence they are drawn justifies the author you can carve a nut in a thousand different ways by reason of the hardness of the shell  twenty or thirty miles across the hills on the way to the green mountains lie some finished chapters of pitiful storiesa few score abandoned farms started in a lean land held fiercely so long as there was any one to work them and then left on the hillsides beyond this desolation are woods where the bear and the deer still find peace and sometimes even the beaver forgets that he is persecuted and dares to build his lodge these things were told me by a man who loved the woods for their own sake and not for the sake of slaughtera quiet slowspoken man of the west who came across the drifts on showshoes and refrained from laughing when i borrowed his footgear and tried to walk the gigantic lawntennis bats strung with hide are not easy to manoeuvre if you forget to keep the long heels down and trailing in the snow you turn over and become as a man who fails into deep water with a lifebelt tied to his ankles if you lose your balance do not attempt to recover it but drop halfsitting and halfkneeling over as large an area as possible when you have mastered the wolfstep can slide one shoe above the other deftly that is to say the sensation of paddling over a tenfootdeep drift and taking short cuts by buried fences is worth the ankleache the man from the west interpreted to me the signs on the snow showed how a fox this section of the country is full of foxes and men shoot them because riding is impossible leaves one kind of spoor walking with circumspection as becomes a thief and a dog who has nothing to be ashamed of but widens his four legs and plunges another how coons go to sleep for the winter and squirrels too and how the deer on the canada border trample down deep paths that are called yards and are caught there by inquisitive men with cameras who hold them by their tails when the deer have blundered into deep snow and so photograph their frightened dignity he told me of people alsothe manners and customs of new englanders here and how they blossom and develop in the far west on the newer railway lines when matters come very nearly to civil war between rival companies racing for the same cañon how there is a country not very far away called caledonia populated by the scotch who can give points to a new englander in a bargain and how these same scotchamericans by birth name their townships still after the cities of their thrifty race it was all as new and delightful as the steady scrunch of the snowshoes and the dazzling silence of the hills  beyond the very furthest range where the pines turn to a faint blue haze against the one solitary peaka real mountain and not a hillshowed like a gigantic thumbnail pointing heavenward  and thats monadnock said the man from the west all the hills have indian names you left wantastiquet on your right coming out of town  you know how it often happens that a word shuttles in and out of many years waking all sorts of incongruous associations i had met monadnock on paper in a shameless parody of emersons style before ever style or verse had interest for me but the word stuck because of a rhyme in which one was       crowned coeval   with monadnocks crest     and my wings extended   touch the east and west  later the same word pursued on the same principle as that blessed one mesopotamia led me to and through emerson up to his poem on the peak itselfthe wise old giant busy with his sky affairs who makes us sane and sober and free from little things if we trust him so monadnock came to mean everything that was helpful healing and full of quiet and when i saw him half across new hampshire he did not fail in that utter stillness a hemlock bough overweighted with snow came down a foot or two with a tired little sigh the snow slid off and the little branch flew nodding back to its fellows  for the honour of monadnock there was made that afternoon an image of snow of gautama buddha something too squat and not altogether equal on both sides but with an imperial and reposeful waist he faced towards the mountain and presently some men in a woodsledge came up the road and faced him now the amazed comments of two vermont farmers on the nature and properties of a swagbellied god are worth hearing they were not troubled about his race for he was aggressively white but rounded waists seem to be out of fashion in vermont at least they said so with rare and curious oaths  next day all the idleness and trifling were drowned in a snowstorm that filled the hollows of the hills with whirling blue mist bowed the branches of the woods till you ducked but were powdered all the same when you drove through and wiped out the sleighing tracks mother nature is beautifully tidy if you leave her alone she rounded off every angle broke down every scarp and tucked the white bedclothes till not a wrinkle remained up to the chine of the spruces and the hemlocks that would not go to sleep  now said the man of the west as we were driving to the station and alas to new york all my snowtracks are gone but when that snow melts a week hence or a month hence theyll all come up again and show where ive been  curious idea is it not imagine a murder committed in the lonely woods a snowstorm that covers the tracks of the flying man before the avenger of blood has buried the body and then a week later the withdrawal of the traitorous snow revealing step by step the path cain tookthe sixinch deetrail of his snowshoeseach step a dark disk on the white till the very end  there is so much so very much to write if it were worth while about that queer little town by the railway station with its life running to all outward seeming as smoothly as the hackcoupés on their sleigh mounting and within disturbed by the hatreds and troubles and jealousies that vex the minds of all but the gods for instanceno it is better to remember the lesson monadnock and emerson has said zeus hates busybodies and people who do too much  that there are such folk a long nasal drawl across main street attests a farmer is unhitching his horses from a post opposite a store he stands with the tierope in his hand and gives his opinion to his neighbour and the world generallybut them there andersons they aint got no notion of etikwette     across a continent   it is not easy to escape from a big city an entire continent was waiting to be traversed and for that reason we lingered in new york till the city felt so homelike that it seemed wrong to leave it and further the more one studied it the more grotesquely bad it grewbad in its paving bad in its streets bad in its streetpolice and but for the kindness of the tides would be worse than bad in its sanitary arrangements no one as yet has approached the management of new york in a proper spirit that is to say regarding it as the shiftless outcome of squalid barbarism and reckless extravagance no one is likely to do so because reflections on the long narrow pigtrough are construed as malevolent attacks against the spirit and majesty of the great american people and lead to angry comparisons yet if all the streets of london were permanently up and all the lamps permanently down this would not prevent the new york streets taken in a lump from being first cousins to a zanzibar foreshore or kin to the approaches of a zulu kraal gullies holes ruts cobblesstones awry kerbstones rising from two to six inches above the level of the slatternly pavement tramlines from two to three inches above street level building materials scattered half across the street lime boards cut stone and ashbarrels generally and generously everywhere wheeled traffic taking its chances dray versus brougham at cross roads swaybacked poles whittled and unpainted drunken lampposts with twisted irons and lastly a generous scatter of filth and more mixed stinks than the winter wind can carry away are matters which can be considered quite apart from the spirit of democracy or the future of this great and growing country in any other land they would be held to represent slovenliness sordidness and want of capacity here it is explained not once but many times that they show the speed at which the city has grown and the enviable indifference of her citizens to matters of detail one of these days you are told everything will be taken in hand and put straight the unvirtuous rulers of the city will be swept away by a cyclone or a tornado or something big and booming of popular indignation everybody will unanimously elect the right men who will justly earn the enormous salaries that are at present being paid to inadequate aliens for road sweepings and all will be well at the same time the lawlessness ingrained by governors among the governed during the last thirty forty or it may be fifty years the brutal levity of the public conscience in regard to public duty the toughening and suppling of public morals and the reckless disregard for human life bred by impotent laws and fostered by familiarity with needless accidents and criminal neglect will miraculously disappear if the laws of cause and effect that control even the freest people in the world say otherwise so much the worse for the laws america makes her own behind her stands the ghost of the most bloody war of the century caused in a peaceful land by long temporising with lawlessness by letting things slide by shiftlessness and blind disregard for all save the material need of the hour till the hour long conceived and let alone stood up fullarmed and men said here is an unforeseen crisis and killed each other in the name of god for four years  in a heathen land the three things that are supposed to be the pillars of moderately decent government are regard for human life justice criminal and civil as far as it lies in man to do justice and good roads in this christian city they think lightly of the firsttheir own papers their own speech and their own actions prove it buy and sell the second at a price openly and without shame and are apparently content to do without the third one would almost expect racial sense of humour would stay them from expecting only praiseslab lavish and slavishfrom the stranger within their gates but they do not if he holds his peace they forge tributes to their own excellence which they put into his mouth thereby treating their own land which they profess to honour as a quack treats his pills if he speaksbut you shall see for yourselves what happens then and they cannot see that by untruth and invective it is themselves alone that they injure  the blame of their city evils is not altogether with the gentlemen chiefly of foreign extraction who control the city these find a people made to their handa lawless breed ready to wink at one evasion of the law if they themselves may profit by another and in their rare leisure hours content to smile over the details of a clever fraud then says the cultured american give us time give us time and we shall arrive the otherwise american who is aggressive straightway proceeds to thrust a piece of halfhanged municipal botchwork under the nose of the alien as a sample of perfected effort there is nothing more delightful than to sit for a strictly limited time with a child who tells you what he means to do when he is a man but when that same child loudvoiced insistent unblushingly eager for praise but thinskinned as the most morbid of hobbledehoys stands about all your ways telling you the same story in the same voice you begin to yearn for something made and finishedsay egypt and a completely dead mummy it is neither seemly nor safe to hint that the government of the largest city in the states is a despotism of the alien by the alien for the alien tempered with occasional insurrections of the decent folk only the chinaman washes the dirty linen of other lands  st paul minnesota  yes it is very good to get away once more and pick up the old and ever fresh business of the vagrant loafing through new towns learned in the manners of dogs babies and perambulators half the world over and tracking the seasons by the upgrowth of flowers in strangerpeoples gardens st paul standing at the barndoor of the dakota and minnesota granaries is all things to all men except to minneapolis eleven miles away whom she hates and by whom she is patronised she calls herself the capital of the northwest the new northwest and her citizens wear not only the tall silk hat of trade but the soft slouch of the west she talks in another tongue than the new yorker andsure sign that we are far across the continenther papers argue with the san francisco ones over rate wars and the competition of railway companies st paul has been established many years and if one were reckless enough to go down to the business quarters one would hear all about her and more also but the residential parts of the town are the crown of it in common with scores of other cities broadcrowned suburbsusing the word in the english sensethat make the stranger jealous you get here what you do not get in the citywellpaved or asphalted roads planted with trees and trim sidewalks studded with houses of individuality not boorishly fenced off from each other but standing each on its plot of wellkept turf running down to the pavement it is always sunday in these streets of a morning the cablecar has taken the men down town to business the children are at school and the big dogs three and a third to each absent child lie nosing the winterkilled grass and wondering when the shoots will make it possible for a gentleman to take his spring medicine in the afternoon the children on tricycles stagger up and down the asphalt with due proportion of big dogs at each wheel the cablecars coming up hill begin to drop the men each at his own doorthe door of the house that he builded for himself though the architect incited him to that vile little attic tower and useless loggia and naturally enough twilight brings the lovers walking two by two along the very quiet ways you can tell from the houses almost the exact period at which they were built whether in the jigsaw days when if behoved respectability to use unlovely turned rails and pierced gableends or during the colonial craze which means white paint and fluted pillars or in the latest domestic era a most pleasant mixture that is of stained shingles hooded dormerwindows cunning verandas and recessed doors seeing these things one begins to understand why the americans visiting england are impressed with the old and not with the new he is not much more than a hundred years ahead of the english in design comfort and economy and this is most important laboursaving appliances in his house from newport to san diego you will find the same thing today  last tribute of respect and admiration one little brown house at the end of an avenue is shuttered down and a doctors buggy stands before it on the door a large blue and white label says scarlet fever oh most excellent municipality of st paul it is because of these little things and not by rowdying and racketing in public places that a nation becomes great and free and honoured in the cars tonight they will be talking wheat girding at minneapolis and sneering at duluths demand for twenty feet of water from duluth to the atlanticmatters of no great moment compared with those streets and that label   a day later  five days ago there wasnt a foot of earth to see it was just naturally covered with snow says the conductor standing in the rear car of the great northern train he speaks as though the snow had hidden something priceless here is the view one railway track and a line of staggering telegraph poles ending in a dot and a blur on the horizon to the left and right a sweep as it were of the sea one huge plain of corn land waiting for the spring dotted at rare intervals with wooden farmhouses patent selfreapers and binders almost as big as the houses ricks left over from last years abundant harvest and mottled here and there with black patches to show that the early ploughing had begun the snow lies in a last few streaks and whirls by the track from skyline to skyline is black loam and prairie grass so dead that it seems as though no one years sun would waken it this is the granary of the land where the farmer who bears the burdens of the stateand who therefore ascribes last years bumper crop to the direct action of the mckinley billhas also to bear the ghastly monotony of earth and sky he keeps his head having many things to attend to but his wife sometimes goes mad as the women do in vermont there is little variety in natures big wheatfield they say that when the corn is in the ear the wind chasing shadows across it for miles on miles breeds as it were a vertigo in those who must look and cannot turn their eyes away and they tell a nightmare story of a woman who lived with her husband for fourteen years at an army post in just such a land as this then they were transferred to west point among the hills over the hudson and she came to new york but the terror of the tall houses grew upon her and grew till she went down with brain fever and the dread of her delirium was that the terrible things would topple down and crush her that is a true story  they work for harvest with steamploughs here how could mere horses face the endless furrows and they attack the earth with toothed cogged and spiked engines that would be monstrous in the shops but here are only speckles on the yellow grass even the locomotive is cowed a train of freight cars is passing along a line that comes out of the blue and goes on till it meets the blue again elsewhere the train would move off with a joyous vibrant roar here it steals away down the vista of the telegraph poles with an awed whispersteals away and sinks into the soil  then comes a town deep in black muda straggly inchthick plank town with dull red grain elevators the open country refuses to be subdued even for a few score rods each street ends in the illimitable open and it is as though the whole houseless outside earth were racing through it towards evening under a gray sky flies by an unframed picture of desolation in the foreground a farm wagon almost axle deep in mud the mire dripping from the slowturning wheels as the man flogs the horses behind him on a knoll of sodden soggy grass fenced off by raw rails from the landscape at large are a knot of utterly uninterested citizens who have flogged horses and raised wheat in their time but today lie under chipped and weatherworn wooden headstones surely burial here must be more awful to the newlymade ghost than burial at sea  there is more snow as we go north and nature is hard at work breaking up the ground for the spring the thaw has filled every depression with a sullen grayblack spate and out on the levels the water lies six inches deep in stretch upon stretch as far as the eye can reach every culvert is full and the broken ice clicks against the wooden pierguards of the bridges somewhere in this flatness there is a refreshing jingle of spurs along the cars and a man of the canadian mounted police swaggers through with his black fur cap and the yellow tab aside his wellfitting overalls and his better setup back one wants to shake hands with him because he is clean and does not slouch nor spit trims his hair and walks as a man should then a customhouse officer wants to know too much about cigars whisky and florida water her majesty the queen of england and empress of india has us in her keeping nothing has happened to the landscape and winnipeg which is as it were a centre of distribution for emigrants stands up to her knees in the water of the thaw the year has turned in earnest and somebody is talking about the first iceshove at montreal 1300 or 1400 miles east  they will not run trains on sunday at montreal and this is wednesday therefore the canadian pacific makes up a train for vancouver at winnipeg this is worth remembering because few people travel in that train and you escape any rush of tourists running westward to catch the yokohama boat the car is your own and with it the service of the porter our porter seeing things were slack beguiled himself with a guitar which gave a triumphal and festive touch to the journey ridiculously out of keeping with the view for eightandtwenty long hours did the bored locomotive trail us through a flat and hairy land powdered ribbed and speckled with snow small snow that drives like dustshot in the windthe land of assiniboia now and again for no obvious reason to the outside mind there was a town then the towns gave place to section so and so then there were trails of the buffalo where he once walked in his pride then there was a mound of white bones supposed to belong to the said buffalo and then the wilderness took up the tale some of it was good ground but most of it seemed to have fallen by the wayside and the tedium of it was eternal  at twilightan unearthly sort of twilightthere came another curious picture thusa wooden town shut in among low treeless rolling ground a calling river that ran unseen between scarped banks barracks of a detachment of mounted police a little cemetery where extroopers rested a painfully formal public garden with pebble paths and foothigh fir trees a few lines of railway buildings white women walking up and down in the bitter cold with their bonnets off some indians in red blanketing with buffalo horns for sale trailing along the platform and not ten yards from the track a cinnamon bear and a young grizzly standing up with extended arms in their pens and begging for food it was strange beyond anything that this bald telling can suggestopening a door into a new world the only commonplace thing about the spot was its namemedicine hat which struck me instantly as the only possible name such a town could carry this is that place which later became a town but i had seen it three years before when it was even smaller and was reached by me in a freightcar ticket unpaid for  that next morning brought us the canadian pacific railway as one reads about it no pen of man could do justice to the scenery there the guidebooks struggle desperately with descriptions adapted for summer reading of rushing cascades lichened rocks waving pines and snowcapped mountains but in april these things are not there the place is locked updead as a frozen corpse the mountain torrent is a boss of palest emerald ice against the dazzle of the snow the pinestumps are capped and hooded with gigantic mushrooms of snow the rocks are overlaid five feet deep the rocks the fallen trees and the lichens together and the dumb white lips curl up to the track cut in the side of the mountain and grin there fanged with gigantic icicles you may listen in vain when the train stops for the least sign of breath or power among the hills the snow has smothered the rivers and the great looping trestles run over what might be a lather of suds in a huge washtub the old snow near by is blackened and smirched with the smoke of locomotives and its dulness is grateful to aching eyes but the men who live upon the line have no consideration for these things at a haltingplace in a gigantic gorge walled in by the snows one of them reels from a tiny saloon into the middle of the track where halfadozen dogs are chasing a pig off the metals he is beautifully and eloquently drunk he sings waves his hands and collapses behind a shunting engine while four of the loveliest peaks that the almighty ever moulded look down upon him the landslide that should have wiped that saloon into kindlings has missed its mark and has struck a few miles down the line one of the hillsides moved a little in dreaming of the spring and caught a passing freight train our cars grind cautiously by for the wrecking engine has only just come through the deceased engine is standing on its head in soft earth thirty or forty feet down the slide and two long cars loaded with shingles are dropped carelessly atop of it it looks so marvellously like a toy train flung aside by a child that one cannot realise what it means till a voice cries any one killed the answer comes back no all jumped and you perceive with a sense of personal insult that this slovenliness of the mountain is an affair which may touch your own sacred self in which case but the train is out on a trestle into a tunnel and out on a trestle again it was here that every one began to despair of the line when it was under construction because there seemed to be no outlet but a man came as a man always will and put a descent thus and a curve in this manner and a trestle so and behold the line went on it is in this place that we heard the story of the canadian pacific railway told as men tell a manytimesrepeated tale with exaggerations and omissions but an imposing tale none the less in the beginning when they would federate the dominion of canada it was british columbia who saw objections to coming in and the prime minister of those days promised it for a bribe an iron band between tidewater and tidewater that should not break then everybody laughed which seems necessary to the health of most big enterprises and while they were laughing things were being done the canadian pacific railway was given a bit of a line here and a bit of a line there and almost as much land as it wanted and the laughter was still going on when the last spike was driven between east and west at the very place where the drunken man sprawled behind the engine and the iron band ran from tideway to tideway as the premier said and people in england said how interesting and proceeded to talk about the bloated army estimates incidentally the man who told ushe had nothing to do with the canadian pacific railwayexplained how it paid the line to encourage immigration and told of the arrival at winnipeg of a trainload of scotch crofters on a sunday they wanted to stop then and there for the sabbaththey and all the little stock they had brought with them it was the winnipeg agent who had to go among them arguing he was scotch too and they could not quite understand it on the impropriety of dislocating the companys traffic so their own minister held a service in the station and the agent gave them a good dinner cheering them in gaelic at which they wept and they went on to settle at moosomin where they lived happily ever afterwards of the manager the head of the line from montreal to vancouver our companion spoke with reverence that was almost awe that manager lived in a palace at montreal but from time to time he would sally forth in his special car and whirl over his 3000 miles at 50 miles an hour the regulation pace is twentytwo but he sells his neck with his head few drivers cared for the honour of taking him over the road a mysterious man he was who carried the profile of the line in his head and more than that knew intimately the possibilities of back country which he had never seen nor travelled over there is always one such man on every line you can hear similar tales from drivers on the great western in england or eurasian stationmasters on the big northwestern in india then a fellowtraveller spoke as many others had done on the possibilities of canadian union with the united states and his language was not the language of mr goldwin smith it was brutal in places summarised it came to a pronounced objection to having anything to do with a land rotten before it was ripe a land with seven million negroes as yet unwelded into the population their racetype unevolved and rather more than crude notions on murder marriage and honesty weve picked up their ways of politics he said mournfully that comes of living next door to them but i dont think were anxious to mix up with their other messes they say they dont want us they keep on saying it theres a nigger on the fence somewhere or they wouldnt lie about it  but does it follow that they are lying  sure ive lived among em they cant go straight theres some dam fraud at the back of it  from this belief he would not be shaken he had lived among themperhaps had been bested in trade let them keep themselves and their manners and customs to their own side of the line he said  this is very sad and chilling it seemed quite otherwise in new york where canada was represented as a ripe plum ready to fell into uncle sams mouth when he should open it the canadian has no special love for englandthe mother of colonies has a wonderful gift for alienating the affections of her own household by neglectbut perhaps he loves his own country we ran out of the snow through mile upon mile of snowsheds braced with twelveinch beams and planked with twoinch planking in one place a snow slide had caught just the edge of a shed and scooped it away as a knife scoops cheese high up the hills men had built diverting barriers to turn the drifts but the drifts had swept over everything and lay five deep on the top of the sheds when we woke it was on the banks of the muddy fraser river and the spring was hurrying to meet us the snow had gone the pink blossoms of the wild currant were open the budding alders stood misty green against the blue black of the pines the brambles on the burnt stumps were in tenderest leaf and every moss on every stone was this years work fresh from the hand of the maker the land opened into clearings of soft black earth at one station a hen had laid an egg and was telling the world about it the world answered with a breath of real springspring that flooded the stuffy car and drove us out on the platform to snuff and sing and rejoice and pluck squashy green marshflags and throw them at the colts and shout at the wild duck that rose from a jewelgreen lakelet god be thanked that in travel one can follow the year this my spring i lost last november in new zealand now i shall hold her fast through japan and the summer into new zealand again  here are the waters of the pacific and vancouver completely destitute of any decent defences grown out of all knowledge in the last three years at the railway wharf with never a gun to protect her lies the empress of indiathe japan boatand what more auspicious name could you wish to find at the end of one of the strong chains of empire     the edge of the east   the mist was clearing off yokohama harbour and a hundred junks had their sails hoisted for the morning breeze and the veiled horizon was stippled with square blurs of silver an english manofwar showed bluewhite on then haze so new was the daylight and all the water lay out as smooth as the inside of an oyster shell two children in blue and white their tanned limbs pink in the fresh air sculled a marvellous boat of lemonhued wood and that was our fairy craft to the shore across the stillness and the mother o pearl levels  there are ways and ways of entering japan the best is to descend upon it from america and the pacificfrom the barbarians and the deep sea coming from the east the blaze of india and the insolent tropical vegetation of singapore dull the eye to halfcolours and little tones it is at bombay that the smell of all asia boards the ship miles off shore and holds the passengers nose till he is clear of asia again that is a violent and aggressive smell apt to prejudice the stranger but kin none the less to the gentle and insinuating flavour that stole across the light airs of the daybreak when the fairy boat went to shorea smell of very clean new wood split bamboo woodsmoke damp earth and the things that people who are not white people eata homelike and comforting smell then followed on shore the sound of an eastern tongue that is beautiful or not as you happen to know it the western races have many languages but a crowd of europeans heard through closed doors talk with the western pitch and cadence so it is with the east a line of jinrickshaw coolies sat in the sun discoursing to each other and it was as though they were welcoming a return in speech that the listener must know as well as english they talked and they talked but the ghosts of familiar words would not grow any clearer till presently the smell came down the open streets again saying that this was the east where nothing matters and trifles old as the tower of babel mattered less than nothing and that there were old acquaintances waiting at every corner beyond the township great is the smell of the east railways telegraphs docks and gunboats cannot banish it and it will endure till the railways are dead he who has not smelt that smell has never lived  three years ago yokohama was sufficiently europeanised in its shops to suit the worst and wickedest taste today it is still worse if you keep to the town limits ten steps beyond into the fields all the civilisation stops exactly as it does in another land a few thousand miles further west the globetrotting millionaires anxious to spend money with a hose on whatever caught their libertine fancies had explained to us aboardship that they came to japan in haste advised by their guidebooks to do so lest the land should be suddenly civilised between steamersailing and steamersailing when they touched land they ran away to the curio shops to buy things which are prepared for themmauve and magenta and bluevitriol things by this time they have a murray under one arm and an electricblue eagle with a copperas beak and a yellow e pluribus unum embroidered on applegreen silk under the other  we being wise sit in a garden that is not ours but belongs to a gentleman in slatecoloured silk who solely for the sake of the picture condescends to work as a gardener in which employ he is sweeping delicately a welt of fallen cherry blossoms from under an azalea aching to burst into bloom steep stone steps of the colour that nature ripens through long winters lead up to this garden by way of clumps of bamboo grass you see the smell was right when it talked of meeting old friends halfadozen blueblack pines are standing akimbo against a real skynot a fogblur nor a cloudbank nor a gray dishclout wrapped round the sunbut a blue sky a cherry tree on a slope below them throws up a wave of blossom that breaks all creamy white against their feet and a clump of willows trail their palest green shoots in front of all the sun sends for an ambassador through the azalea bushes a lordly swallowtailed butterfly and his squire very like the flitting chalkblue of the english downs the warmth of the east that goes through not over the lazy body is added to the light of the eastthe splendid lavish light that clears but does not bewilder the eye then the new leaves of the spring wink like fat emeralds and the loaded branches of cherrybloom grow transparent and glow as a hand glows held up against flame little warm sighs come up from the moist warm earth and the fallen petals stir on the ground turn over and go to sleep again outside beyond the foliage where the sunlight lies on the slatecoloured roofs the ridged ricefields beyond the roofs and the hills beyond the ricefields is all japanonly all japan and this that they call the old french legation is the garden of eden that most naturally dropped down here after the fall for some small hint of the beauties to be shown later there is the roof of a temple ridged and fluted with dark tiles flung out casually beyond the corner of the bluff on which the garden stands any other curve of the eaves would not have consorted with the sweep of the pine branches therefore this curve was made and being made was perfect the congregation of the globetrotters are in the hotel scuffling for guides in order that they may be shown the sights of japan which is all one sight they must go to tokio they must go to nikko they must surely see all that is to be seen and then write home to their barbarian families that they are getting used to the sight of bare brown legs before this day is ended they will all thank goodness have splitting headaches and burntout eyes it is better to lie still and hear the grass growto soak in the heat and the smell and the sounds and the sights that come unasked  our garden overhangs the harbour and by pushing aside one branch we look down upon a heavysterned fishingboat the strawgold mats of the deckhouse pushed back to show the perfect order and propriety of the housekeeping that is going forward the fatherfisher sitting frogfashion is poking at a tiny box full of charcoal and the light white ash is blown back into the face of a largish japanese doll price two shillings and threepence in bayswater the doll wakes turns into a japanese baby something more valuable than money could buya baby with a shaven head and aimless legs it crawls to the thing in the polished brown box is picked up just as it is ready to eat live coals and is set down behind a thwart where it drums upon a bucket addressing the firebox from afar halfadozen cherry blossoms slide off a bough and waver down to the water close to the japanese doll who in another minute will be overside in pursuit of these miracles the fatherfisher has it by the pink hind leg and this time it is tucked away all but the topknot out of sight among umber nets and sepia cordage being an oriental it makes no protest and the boat scuds out to join the little fleet in the offing  then two sailors of a manofwar come along the sea face lean over the canal below the garden spit and roll away the sailor in port is the only superior man to him all matters rare and curious are either them things or them other things he does not hurry himself he does not seek adjectives other than those which custom puts into his mouth for all occasions but the beauty of life penetrates his being insensibly till he gets drunk falls foul of the local policeman smites him into the nearest canal and disposes of the question of treaty revision with a hiccup all the same jack says that he has a grievance against the policeman who is paid a dollar for every strayed seaman he brings up to the consular courts for overstaying his leave and so forth jack says that the little fellows deliberately hinder him from getting back to his ship and then with devilish art and craft of wrestling tricksthere are about a hundred of em and they can throw you with every qualified onecarry him to justice now when jack is softened with drink he does not tell lies this is his grievance and he says that them blanketed consuls ought to know they plays into each others hands and stops you at the hatobathe policemen do the visitor who is neither a seaman nor drunk cannot swear to the truth of this or indeed anything else he moves not only among fascinating scenes and a lovely people but as he is sure to find out before he has been a day ashore between stormy questions three years ago there were no questions that were not going to be settled offhand in a blaze of paper lanterns the constitution was new it has a gray pale cover with a chrysanthemum at the back and a japanese told me then now we have constitution same as other countries and so it is all right now we are quite civilised because of constitution  a perfectly irrelevant story comes to mind here do you know that in madeira once they had a revolution which lasted just long enough for the national poet to compose a national anthem and then was put down all that is left of the revolt now is the song that you hear on the twangling nachettes the babybanjoes of a moonlight night under the banana fronds at the back of funchal and the highpitched nasal refrain of it is constitucioun  since that auspicious date it seems that the questions have impertinently come up and the first and the last of them is that of treaty revision says the japanese government only obey our laws our new laws that we have carefully compiled from all the wisdom of the west and you shall go up country as you please and trade where you will instead of living cooped up in concessions and being judged by consuls treat us as you would treat france or germany and we will treat you as our own subjects  here as you know the matter rests between the two thousand foreigners and the forty million japanesea godsend to all editors of tokio and yokohama and the despair of the newly arrived in whose nose remember is the smell of the east one and indivisible immemorial eternal and above all instructive  indeed it is only by walking out at least half a mile that you escape from the aggressive evidences of civilisation and come out into the ricefields at the back of the town here men with twists of blue and white cloth round their heads are working knee deep in the thick black mud the largest field may be something less than two tablecloths while the smallest is say a speck of undercliff on to which it were hard to back a rickshaw wrested from the beach and growing its clump of barley within sprayshot of the waves the field paths are the trodden tops of the irrigating cuts and the main roads as wide as two perambulators abreast from the uplandsthe beautiful uplands planted in exactly the proper places with pine and maplethe ground comes down in terraced pocket on pocket of rich earth to the levels again and it would seem that every heavilythatched farmhouse was chosen with special regard to the view if you look closely when the people go to work you will see that a household spreads itself over plots maybe a quarter of a mile apart a revenue map of a village shows that this scatteration is apparently designed but the reason is not given one thing at least is certain the assessment of these patches can be no light piece of workjust the thing in fact that would give employment to a large number of small and variegated government officials any one of whom assuming that he was of an oriental cast of mind might make the cultivators life interesting i remember nowa secondtimeseen place brings back things that were altogether buriedseeing three years ago the pile of government papers required in the case of one farm they were many and systematic but the interesting thing about them was the amount of work that they must have furnished to those who were neither cultivators nor treasury officials  if one knew japanese one could collogue with that gentleman in the strawhat and the blue loincloth who is chopping within a sixteenth of an inch of his naked toes with the father and mother of all weedspuds his version of local taxation might be inaccurate but it would sure to be picturesque failing his evidence be pleased to accept two or three things that may or may not be facts of general application they differ in a measure from statements in the books the present landtax is nominally 212 per cent payable in cash on a three or as some say a five yearly settlement but according to certain officials there has been no settlement since 1875 land lying fallow for a season pays the same tax as land in cultivation unless it is unproductive through flood or calamity read earthquake here the government tax is calculated on the capital value of the land taking a measure of about 11000 square feet or a quarter of an acre as the unit  now one of the ways of getting at the capital value of the land is to see what the railways have paid for it the very best rice land taking the japanese dollar at three shillings is about £6510s per acre unirrigated land for vegetable growing is something over £912s and forest £211s as these are railway rates they may be fairly held to cover large areas in private sales the prices may reasonably be higher  it is to be remembered that some of the very best rice land will bear two crops of rice in the year most soil will bear two crops the first being millet rape vegetables and so on sown on dry soil and ripening at the end of may then the ground is at once prepared for the wet crop to be harvested in october or thereabouts landtax is payable in two instalments rice land pays between the 1st november and the middle of december and the 1st january and the last of february other land pays between july and august and september and december let us see what the average yield is the gentleman in the sunhat and the loincloth would shriek at the figures but they are approximately accurate rice naturally fluctuates a good deal but it may be taken in the rough at five japanese dollars fifteen shillings per koku of 330 lbs wheat and maize of the first spring crop is worth about eleven shillings per koku the first crop gives nearly 134 koku per tau the quarter acre unit of measurement aforesaid or eighteen shillings per quarter acre or £312s per acre the rice crop at two koku or £110s the quarter acre gives £6 an acre total £912s this is not altogether bad if you reflect that the land in question is not the very best rice land but ordinary no 1 at £2516s per acre capital value  a son has the right to inherit his fathers land on the fathers assessment so long as its term runs or when the term has expired has a prior claim as against any one else part of the taxes it is said lies by in the local prefectures office as a reserve fund against inundations yet and this seems a little confusing there are between five and seven other local provincial and municipal taxes which can reasonably be applied to the same ends no one of these taxes exceeds a half of the landtax unless it be the local prefecture tax of 212 per cent  in the old days the people were taxed or perhaps squeezed would be the better word to about onehalf of the produce of the land there are those who may say that the present system is not so advantageous as it looks beforetime the farmers it is true paid heavily but only on their nominal holdings they could and often did hold more land than they were assessed on today a rigid bureaucracy surveys every foot of their farms and upon every foot they have to pay somewhat similar complaints are made still by the simple peasantry of india for if there is one thing that the oriental detests more than another it is the damnable western vice of accuracy that leads to doing things by rule still by the look of those terraced fields where the water is led so cunningly from level to level the japanese cultivator must enjoy at least one excitement if the villages up the valley tamper with the water supply there must surely be excitement down the valleyargument protest and the breaking of heads  the days of romance therefore are not all dead                                       this that follows happened on the coast twenty miles through the fields from yokohama at kamakura that is to say where the great bronze buddha sits facing the sea to hear the centuries go by he has been described again and againhis majesty his aloofness and every one of his dimensions the smoky little shrine within him and the plumed hill that makes the background to his throne for that reason he remains as he remained from the beginning beyond all hope of descriptionas it might be a visible god sitting in the garden of a world made new they sell photographs of him with tourists standing on his thumb nail and apparently any brute of any gender can scrawl his or its ignoble name over the inside of the massive bronze plates that build him up think for a moment of the indignity and the insult imagine the ancient orderly gardens with their clipped trees shorn turf and silent ponds smoking in the mist that the hot sun soaks up after rain and the greenbronze image of the teacher of the law wavering there as it half seems through incense clouds the earth is all one censer and myriads of frogs are making the haze ring it is too warm to do more than to sit on a stone and watch the eyes that having seen all things see no morethe downdropped eyes the forward droop of the head and the colossal simplicity of the folds of the robe over arm and knee thus and in no other fashion did buddha sit in theold days when ananda asked questions and the dreamer began to dream of the lives that lay behind him ere the lips moved and as the chronicles say he told a tale this would be the way he began for dreamers in the east tell something the same sort of tales today long ago when devadatta was king of benares there lived a virtuous elephant a reprobate ox and a king without understanding and the tale would end after the moral had been drawn for anandas benefit now the reprobate ox was such an one and the king was such another but the virtuous elephant was i myself ananda thus then he told the tales in the bamboo grove and the bamboo grove is there today little blue and gray and slate robed figures pass under its shadow buy two or three josssticks disappear into the shrine that is the body of the god come out smiling and drift away through the shrubberies a fat carp in a pond sucks at a fallen leaf with just the sound of a wicked little worldly kiss then the earth steams and steams in silence and a gorgeous butterfly full six inches from wing to wing cuts through the steam in a zigzag of colour and flickers up to the forehead of the god and buddha said that a man must look on everything as illusioneven light and colourthe timeworn bronze of metal against bluegreen of pine and pale emerald of bamboothe lemon sash of the girl in the cinnamon dress with coral pins in her hair leaning against a block of weatherbleached stoneand last the spray of bloodred azalea that stands on the pale gold mats of the teahouse beneath the honeycoloured thatch to overcome desire and covetousness of mere gold which is often very vilely designed that is conceivable but why must a man give up the delight of the eye colour that rejoices light that cheers and line that satisfies the innermost deeps of the heart ah if the bodhisat had only seen his own image     our overseas men   all things considered there are only two kinds of men in the worldthose that stay at home and those that do not the second are the most interesting some day a man will bethink himself and write a book about the breed in a book called the book of the overseas club for it is at the clubhouses all the way from aden to yokohama that the life of the outside men is best seen and their talk is best heard a strong family likeness runs through both buildings and members and a large and careless hospitality is the note there is always the same opendoored highceiled house with matting on the floors the same come and go of darkskinned servants and the same assembly of men talking horse or business in raiment that would fatally scandalise a london committee among files of newspapers from a fortnight to five weeks old the life of the outside men includes plenty of sunshine and as much air as may be stirring at the cape where the dutch housewives distil and sell the very potent vanderhum and the absurd homemade hansom cabs waddle up and down the yellow dust of adderley street are the members of the big import and export firms the shipping and insurance offices inventors of mines and exploiters of new territories with now and then an officer strayed from india to buy mules for the government a government house aidedecamp a sprinkling of the officers of the garrison tanned skippers of the union and castle lines and naval men from the squadron at simons town here they talk of the sins of cecil rhodes the insolence of natal the beauties or otherwise of the solid boer vote and the dates of the steamers the argot is dutch and kaffir and every one can hum the national anthem that begins pack your kit and trek johnny bowlegs in the stately hongkong clubhouse which is to the further what the bengal club is to the nearer east you meet much the same gathering minus the mining speculators and plus men whose talk is of tea silk shortings and shanghai ponies the speech of the outside men at this point becomes fearfully mixed with pidginenglish and local chinese terms rounded with corrupt portuguese at melbourne in a long verandah giving on a grass plot where laughingjackasses laugh very horribly sit woolkings premiers and breeders of horses after their kind the older men talk of the days of the eureka stockade and the younger of shearing wars in north queensland while the traveller moves timidly among them wondering what under the world every third word means at wellington overlooking the harbour all rightminded clubs should command the sea another and yet a like sort of men speak of sheep the rabbits the landcourts and the ancient heresies of sir julius vogel and their more expressive sentences borrow from the maori and elsewhere and elsewhere and elsewhere among the outside men it is the samethe same mixture of every trade calling and profession under the sun the same clash of conflicting interests touching the uttermost parts of the earth the same intimate and sometimes appalling knowledge of your neighbours business and shortcomings the same largepalmed hospitality and the same interest on the part of the younger men in the legs of a horse decidedly it is at the overseas club all the world over that you get to know some little of the life of the community london is egoistical and the world for her ends with the fourmile cab radius there is no provincialism like the provincialism of london that big slackwater coated with the drift and rubbish of a thousand mens thoughts esteems itself the open sea because the waves of all the oceans break on her borders to those in her midst she is terribly imposing but they forget that there is more than one kind of imposition look back upon her from ten thousand miles when the mail is just in at the overseas club and she is wondrous tiny ninetenths of her newsso vital so epochmaking over thereloses its significance and the rest is as the scuffling of ghosts in a backattic  here in yokohama the overseas club has two mails and four sets of papersenglish french german and american as suits the variety of its constitutionand the verandah by the sea where the big telescope stands is a perpetual feast of the pentecost the population of the club changes with each steamer in harbour for the seacaptains swing in are met with hello where did you come from and mix at the bar and billiardtables for their appointed time and go to sea again the whitepainted warships supply their contingent of members also and there are wonderful men mines of most fascinating adventure who have an interest in sealingbrigs that go to the kurile islands and somehow get into trouble with the russian authorities consuls and judges of the consular courts meet men over on leave from the china ports or it may be manila and they all talk tea silk banking and exchange with its fixed residents everything is always as bad as it can possibly be and everybody is on the verge of ruin that is why when they have decided that life is no longer worth living they go down to the skittlealleyto commit suicide from the outside when a cool wind blows among the papers and there is a sound of smashing ice in an inner apartment and every third man is talking about the approaching races the life seems to be a desirable one what more could a man need to make him happy says the passerby a perfect climate a lovely country plenty of pleasant society and the politest people on earth to deal with the resident smiles and invites the passerby to stay through july and august further he presses him to do business with the politest people on earth and to continue so doing for a term of years thus the traveller perceives beyond doubt that the resident is prejudiced by the very fact of his residence and gives it as his matured opinion that japan is a faultless land marred only by the presence of the foreign community and yet let us consider it is the foreign community that has made it possible for the traveller to come and go from hotel to hotel to get his passport for inland travel to telegraph his safe arrival to anxious friends and generally enjoy himself much more than he would have been able to do in his own country government and gunboats may open a land but it is the men of the overseas club that keep it open their reward not alone in japan is the bland patronage or the scarcelyveiled contempt of those who profit by their labours it is hopeless to explain to a traveller who has been ohayoed into halfadozen shops and sayonaraed out of halfadozen more and politely cheated in each one that the japanese is an oriental and therefore embarrassingly economical of the truth thats his politeness says the traveller he does not wish to hurt your feelings love him and treat him like a brother and hell change to treat one of the most secretive of races on a brotherly basis is not very easy and the natural politeness that enters into a signed and sealed contract and undulates out of it so soon as it does not sufficiently pay is more than embarrassing it is almost annoying the want of fixity or commercial honour may be due to some natural infirmity of the artistic temperament or to the manner in which the climate has affected and his ruler has ruled the man himself for untold centuries  those who know the east know where the system of squeeze which is commission runs through every transaction of life from the sale of a grooms place upward where the woman walks behind the man in the streets and where the peasant gives you for the distance to the next town as many or as few miles as he thinks you will like that these things must be so those who do not know will not be persuaded till they have lived there the overseas club puts up its collective nose scornfully when it hears of the new and regenerate japan sprung to life since the seventies it grins with shame be it written at an imperial diet modelled on the german plan and a code napoléon à la japonaise it is so far behind the new era as to doubt that an oriental country ridden by etiquette of the sternest and social distinctions almost as hard as those of caste can be turned out to western gauge in the compass of a very young mans fife and it must be prejudiced because it is daily and hourly in contact with the japanese except when it can do business with the chinaman whom it prefers was there ever so disgraceful a club  just at present a crisis full blown as a chrysanthemum has developed in the imperial diet both houses accuse the government of improper interferencethis japanese for plenty stick and some banknoteat the recent elections they then did what was equivalent to passing a vote of censure on the ministry and refusing to vote government measures so far the wildest advocate of representative government could have desired nothing better afterwards things took a distinctly oriental turn the ministry refused to resign and the mikado prorogued the diet for a week to think things over the japanese papers are now at issue over the event some say that representative government implies party government and others swear at large the overseas club says for the most partskittles  it is a picturesque situationone that suggests romances and extravaganzas thus imagine a dreaming court intrenched behind a triple line of moats where the lotus blooms in summera court whose outer fringe is aggressively european but whose heart is japan of long ago where a dreaming king sits among some wives or other things amused from time to time with magiclantern shows and performing fleasa holy king whose sanctity is used to conjure with and who twice a year gives gardenparties where every one must come in tophat and frock coat round this court wavering between the splendours of the sleeping and the variety shows of the crystal palace place in furious but carefullyveiled antagonism the fragments of newly shattered castes their natural oriental eccentricities overlaid with borrowed western notions imagine now a large and hungry bureaucracy french in its fretful insistence on detail where detail is of no earthly moment oriental in its stress on etiquette and punctillo recruited from a military caste accustomed for ages past to despise alike farmer and trader this caste we will suppose is more or less imperfectly controlled by a syndicate of three clans which supply their own nominees to the ministry these are adroit versatile and unscrupulous men hampered by no western prejudice in favour of carrying any plan to completion through and at the bidding of these men the holy monarch acts and the acts are wonderful to criticise these acts exists a wildcat press liable to suppression at any moment as morbidly sensitive to outside criticism as the american and almost as childishly untruthful fungoid in the swiftness of its growth and pitiable in its unseasoned rashness backers of this press in its wilder moments lawless ignorant sensitive and vain are the student class educated in the main at government expense and a thorn in the side of the state judges without training handle laws without precedents and new measures are passed and abandoned with almost inconceivable levity out of the welter of classes and interests that are not those of the common folk is evolved the thing called japanese policy that has the proportion and the perspective of a japanese picture  finality and stability are absent from its councils today for reasons none can explain it is proforeign to the verge of servility tomorrow for reasons equally obscure the pendulum swings back andthe students are heaving mud at the foreigners in the streets vexatious irresponsible incoherent and above all cheaply mysterious is the rule of the landstultified by intrigue and counterintrigue chequered with futile reforms begun on european lines and lightheartedly thrown aside studded as a bowerbirds run is studded with shells and shining pebbles with plagiarisms from half the worldan operetta of administration wherein the shadow of the king among his wives samurai policemen doctors who have studied under pasteur kidgloved cavalry officers from st cyr judges with university degrees harlots with fiddles newspaper correspondents masters of the ancient ceremonies of the land paid members of the diet secret societies that borrow the knife and the dynamite of the irish sons of dispossessed daimios returned from europe and waiting for what may turn up with ministers of the syndicate who have wrenched japan from her repose of twenty years ago circle flicker shift and reform in bewildering rings round the foreign resident is the extravaganza complete  somewhere in the background of the stage are the people of the landof whom a very limited proportion enjoy the privileges of representative government whether in the past few years they have learned what the thing means or learning have the least intention of making any use of it is not clear meantime the game of government goes forward as merrily as a game of pussinthecorner with the additional joy that not more than halfadozen men know who is controlling it or what in the wide world it intends to do in tokio live the steadilydiminishing staff of europeans employed by the emperor as engineers railway experts professors in the colleges and so forth before many years they will all be dispensed with and the country will set forth among the nations alone and on its own responsibility  in fifty years then from the time that the intrusive american first broke her peace japan will experience her new birth and reorganised from sandal to topknot play the samisen in the march of modern progress this is the great advantage of being born into the new era when individual and community alike can get something for nothingpay without work education without effort religion without thought and free government without slow and bitter toil  the overseas club as has been said is behind the spirit of the age it has to work for what it gets and it does not always get what it works for nor can its members take ship and go home when they please imagine for a little the contented frame of mind that is bred in a man by the perpetual contemplation of a harbour full of steamers as a piccadilly cabrank of hansoms the weather is hot we will suppose something has gone wrong with his work that day or his children are not looking so well as might be pretty tiled bungalows bowered in roses and wistaria do not console him and the voices of the politest people on earth jar sorely he knows every soul in the club has thoroughly talked out every subject of interest and would give half a yearsoh five yearspay for one lungfilling breath of air that has life in it one sniff of the haying grass or half a mile of muddy london street where the muffin bell tinkles in the four oclock fog then the big liner moves out across the staring blue of the bay soandso and suchanone both friends are going home in her and some one else goes next week by the french mail he and he alone it seems to him must stay on and it is so maddeningly easy to gofor every one save himself the boats smoke dies out along the horizon and he is left alone with the warm wind and the white dust of the bund now japan is a good place a place that men swear by and live in for thirty years at a stretch there are china ports a weeks sail to the westward where life is really hard and where the sight of the restless shipping hurts very much indeed tourists and you who travel the world over be very gentle to the men of the overseas clubs remember that unlike yourselves they have not come here for the good of their health and that the return ticket in your wallet may possibly colour your views of their land perhaps it would not be altogether wise on the strength of much kindness from japanese officials to recommend that these your countrymen be handed over lock stock and barrel to a people that are beginning to experiment with freshdrafted halfgrafted codes which do not include juries to a system that does not contemplate a free press to a suspicious absolutism from which there is no appeal truly it might be interesting but as surely it would begin in farce and end in tragedy that would leave the politest people on earth in no case to play at civilised government for a long time to come in his concession where he is an apologetic and much satupon importation the foreign resident does no harm he does not always sue for money due to him on the part of a japanese once outside those limits free to move into the heart of the country it would only be a question of time as to where and when the trouble would begin and in the long run it would not be the foreign resident that would suffer the imaginative eye can see the most unpleasant possibilities from a general overrunning of japan by the chinaman who is far the most important foreign resident to the shelling of tokio by a joyous and bounding democracy anxious to vindicate her national honour and to learn how her newlymade navy works  but there are scores of arguments that would confute and overwhelm this somewhat gloomy view the statistics of japan for instance are as beautiful and fit as neatly as the woodwork of her houses by these it would be possible to prove anything     some earthquakes   a radical member of parliament at tokio has just got into trouble with his constituents and they have sent him a priceless letter of reproof among other things they point out that a politician should not be a waterweed which wobbles hither and thither according to the motion of the stream nor should he like a ghost without legs drift along before the wind your conduct they say has been both of a waterweed and a ghost and we purpose in a little time to give you proof of our true japanese spirit that member will very likely be mobbed in his rickshaw and prodded to inconvenience with swordsticks for the constituencies are most enlightened but how in the world can a man under these sides behave except as a waterweed and a ghost it is in the airthe wobble and the legless drift an energetic tourist would have gone to hakodate seen ainos at sapporo ridden across the northern island under the gigantic thistles caught salmon looked in at vladivostock and done half a hundred things in the time that one lazy loafer has wasted watching the barley turn from green to gold the azaleas blossom and burn out and the spring give way to the warm rains of summer now the iris has taken up the blazonry of the year and the tide of the tourists ebbs westward  the permanent residents are beginning to talk of hill places to go to for the hot weather and all the available houses in the resort are let in a little while the men from china will be coming over for their holidays but just at present we are in the thick of the tea season and there is no time to waste on frivolities packing is a valid excuse for anything from forgetting a dinner to declining a tennis party and the tempers of husbands are judged leniently all along the sea face is an inspiring smell of the finest newmown hay and canals are full of boats loaded up with the boxes jostling down to the harbour at the club men say rude things about the arrivals of the mail there never was a postoffice yet that did not rejoice in knocking a mans sabbath into flinders a fair office days work may begin at eight and end at six or if the mail comes in at midnight there is no overtime or eighthours babytalk in tea yonder are the ships here is the stuff and behind all is the american market the rest is your own affair  the narrow streets are blocked with the wains bringing down in boxes of every shape and size the upcountry rough leaf some one must take delivery of these things find room for them in the packed warehouse and sample them before they are blended and go to the firing  more than half the elaborate processes are lost work so far as the quality of the stuff goes but the markets insist on a goodlooking leaf with polish face and curl to it and in this as in other businesses the call of the markets is the law the factory floors are made slippery with the tread of barefooted coolies who shout as the tea whirls through its transformations the overnote to the clamouran uncanny thing toois the soft rustledown of the tea itselfstacked in heaps carried in baskets dumped through chutes rising and falling in the long troughs where it is polished and disappearing at last into the heart of the firingmachinealways this insistent whisper of moving dead leaves steamsieves sift it into grades with jarrings and thumpings that make the floor quiver and the thunder of steamgear is always at its heels but it continues to mutter unabashed till it is riddled down into the big foillined boxes and lies at peace  a few days ago the industry suffered a check which lasting not more than two minutes lost several hundred pounds of handfired tea it was something after this way into the stillness of a hot stuffy morning came an unpleasant noise as of batteries of artillery charging up all the roads together and at least one bewildered sleeper waking saw his empty boots where they sat and played toccatas stately at the clavicord it was the washstand really but the effect was awful then a clock fell and a wall cracked and heavy hands caught the house by the roofpole and shook it furiously to preserve an equal mind when things are hard is good but he who has not fumbled desperately at bolted jalousies that will not open while a whole room is being tossed in a blanket does not know how hard it is to find any sort of mind at all the end of the terror was inadequatea rush into the still heavy outside air only to find the servants in the garden giggling the japanese would giggle through the day of judgment and to learn that the earthquake was over then came the news swift borne from the business quarters below the hill that the coolies of certain factories had fled shrieking at the first shock and that all the tea in the pans was burned to a crisp that certainly was some consolation for undignified panic and there remained the hope that a few tall chimneys up the line at tokio would have collapsed they stood firm however and the local papers used to this kind of thing merely spoke of the shock as severe earthquakes are demoralising but they bring out all the weaknesses of human nature first is downright dread the stage ofonly let me get into the open and ill reform then the impulse to send news of the most terrible shock of modern times flying east and west among the cables did not your own hair stand straight on end and therefore must not everybody elses have done likewise last as fallen humanity picks itself together comes the cry of the mean little soul what was that all i wasnt frightened from the beginning  it is wholesome and tonic to realise the powerlessness of man in the face of these little accidents the heir of all the ages the annihilator of time and space who politely doubts the existence of his maker hears the roofbeams crack and strain above him and scuttles about like a rabbit in a stoppered warren if the shock endures for twenty minutes the annihilator of time and space must camp out under the blue and hunt for his dead among the rubbish given a violent convulsion only just such a slipping of strata as carelessly piled volumes will accomplish in a bookcase and behold the heir of all the ages is stark raving mada brute among the dishevelled hills set a hundred of the worlds greatest spirits men of fixed principles high aims resolute endeavour enormous experience and the modesty that these attributes bringset them to live through such a catastrophe as that which wiped out nagoya last october and at the end of three days there would remain few whose souls might be called their own  so much for yesterdays shock today there has come another and a most comprehensive affair it is it has broken nothing unless maybe an old heart or two cracks later on and the wise people in the settlement are saying that they predicted it from the first none the less as an earthquake it deserves recording  it was a very rainy afternoon all the streets were full of gruelly mud and all the business men were at work in their offices when it began a knot of chinamen were studying a closed door from whose further side came a most unpleasant sound of bolting and locking up the notice on the door was interesting with deep regret did the manager of the new oriental banking corporation limited most decidedly limited announce that on telegraphic orders from home he had suspended payment said one chinaman to another in pidginjapanese it is shut and went away the noise of barring up continued the rain fell and the notice stared down the wet street that was all there must have been two or three men passing by to whom the announcement meant the loss of every penny of their savingscomforting knowledge to digest after tiffin in london of course the failure would not mean so much there are many banks in the city and people would have had warning here banks are few people are dependent on them and this news came out of the sea unheralded an evil born with all its teeth  after the crash of a bursting shell every one who can picks himself up brushes the dirt off his uniform and tries to make a joke of it then some one whips a handkerchief round his handa splinter has torn itand another finds warm streaks running down his forehead then a man overlooked till now and past help groans to the death everybody perceives with a start that this is no time for laughter and the dead and wounded are attended to  even so at the overseas club when the men got out of office the brokers had told them the news in filed the english and americans and germans and french and heres a pretty mess they said one and all many of them were hit but like good men they did not say how severely  ah said a little p and o official wagging his head sagaciously he had lost a thousand dollars since noon its all right now theyre trying to make the best of it in three or four days we shall hear more about it i meant to draw my money just before i went down coast but curiously enough it was the same story throughout the club everybody had intended to withdraw and nearly everybody hadnot done so the manager of a bank which had not failed was explaining how in his opinion the crash had come about this was also very human it helped none entered a lean american throwing back his waterproof all dripping with the rain his face was calm and peaceful boy whisky and soda he said  how much haf you losd said a teuton bluntly eightfifty replied the son of george washington sweetly dont see how that prevents me having a drink my glass sirr he continued an interrupted whistling of i owe ten dollars to ogrady which he very probably did and his countenance departed not from its serenity if there is anything that one loves an american for it is the way he stands certain kinds of punishment an englishman and a heavy loser was being chaffed by a scotchman whose account at the japan end of the line had been a trifle overdrawn true he would lose in england but the thought of the few dollars saved here cheered him  more men entered sat down by tables stood in groups or remained apart by themselves thinking with knit brows one must think quickly when ones bills are falling due the murmur of voices thickened and there was no rumbling in the skittle alley to interrupt it everybody knows everybody else at the overseas club and everybody sympathises a man passed stiffly and some one of a group turned to ask lightly hit old man like hell he said and went on biting his unlit cigar another man was telling slowly and somewhat bitterly how he had expected one of his children to join him out here and how the passage had been paid with a draft on the obc but now  there ladies and gentlemen is where it hurts this little suspension out here it destroys plans pretty ones hoped for and prayed over maybe for years it knocks pleasant domestic arrangements galleywest over and above all the mere ruin that it causes the curious thing in the talk was that there was no abuse of the bank the men were in the eastern trade themselves and they knew it was the yokohama manager and the clerks thrown out of employment connection with a broken bank by the way goes far to ruin a young mans prospects for whom they were sorry were doing ourselves well this year said a wit grimly one freeshooting case one thundering libel case and a bank smash showing off pretty before the globetrotters arent we  gad think of the chaps at sea with letters of credit eh theyll land and get the best rooms at the hotels and find theyre penniless said another  never mind the globetrotters said a third look nearer home this does for soandso and soandso and soandso all old men and every penny of theirs goes poor devils  that reminds me of some one else said yet another voice his wifes at home too whew and he whistled drearily so did the tide of voices run on till men got to talking over the chances of a dividend they went to the bank of england drawled an american and the bank of england let them down said their securities werent good enough  great scotta hand came down on a table to emphasise the remarki sailed half way up the mediterranean once with a bank of england director wish id tipped him over the rail and lowered him a boat on his own securityif it was good enough  barings goes the obc dont replied the american blowing smoke through his nose this business looks decidedly problematical whatat  oh theyll pay the depositors in full dont you fret said a man who had lost nothing and was anxious to console  im a shareholder said the american and smoked on  the rain continued to fall and the umbrellas dripped in the racks and the wet men came and went circling round the central fact that it was a bad business till the day as was most fit shut down in drizzling darkness there was a refreshing sense of brotherhood in misfortunes in the little community that had just been electrocuted and did not want any more shocks all the pain that in england would be taken home to be borne in silence and alone was here bulked as it were and faced in line of company surely the christians of old must have fought much better when they met the lions by fifties at a time  at last the men departed the bachelors to cast up accounts by themselves there should be some good ponies for sale shortly and the married men to take counsel may heaven help him whose wife does not stand by him now but the women of the overseas settlements are as thorough as the men there will be tears for plans forgone the changing of the little ones schools and elder childrens careers unpleasant letters to be written home and more unpleasant ones to be received from relatives who told you so from the first there will be pinchings too and straits of which the outside world will know nothing but the women will pull it through smiling  beautiful indeed are the operations of modern financeespecially when anything goes wrong with the machine tonight there will be trouble in india among the ceylon planters the calcutta jute and the bombay cottonbrokers besides the little households of small banked savings in hongkong singapore and shanghai there will be trouble too and goodness only knows what wreck at cheltenham bath st leonards torquay and the other camps of the retired army officers they are lucky in england who know what happens when it happens but here the people are at the wrong end of the cables and the situation is not good only one thing seems certain there is a notice on a shut door in the wet and by virtue of that notice all the money that was theirs yesterday is gone away and it may never come back again so all the work that won the money must be done over again but some of the people are old and more are tired and all are disheartened it is a very sorrowful little community that goes to bed tonight and there must be as sad ones the world over let it be written however that of the sections under fire here and some are cruelly hit no man whined or whimpered or broke down there was no chance of fighting it was bitter defeat but they took it standing     halfadozen pictures   some men when they grow rich store pictures in a gallery living their friends envy them and after death the genuineness of the collection is disputed under the dispersing hammer  a better way is to spread your picture over all earth visiting them as fate allows then none can steal or deface nor any reverse of fortune force a sale sunshine and tempest warm and ventilate the gallery for nothing andin spite of all that has been said of her crudenessnature is not altogether a bad framemaker the knowledge that you may never live to see an especial treasure twice teaches the eyes to see quickly while the light lasts and the possession of such a gallery breeds a very fine contempt for painted shows and the smeary things that are called pictures  in the north pacific to the right hand as you go westward hangs a small study of no particular value as compared with some others the mist is down on an oily stretch of washedout sea through the mist the batswings of a sealing schooner are just indicated in the foreground all but leaping out of the frame an open rowboat painted the rawest blue and white rides up over the shoulder of a swell a man in bloodred jersey and long boots all shining with moisture stands at the bows holding up the carcase of a silverbellied seaotter from whose pelt the wet drips in moonstones now the artist who could paint the silver wash of the mist the wriggling treacly reflection of the boat and the raw red wrists of the man would be something of a workman  but my gallery is in no danger of being copied at present three years since i met an artist in the stony bed of a brook between a line of 300 graven lichened godlings and a flaming bank of azaleas swearing horribly he had been trying to paint one of my picturesnothing more than a big waterworn rock tufted with flowers and a snowcapped hill for background most naturally he failed because there happened to be absolutely no perspective in the thing and he was pulling the lines about to make some for home consumption no man can put the contents of a gallon jar into a pint mug the protests of all uncomfortablycrowded mugs since the world began have settled that long ago and have given us the working theories devised by imperfect instruments for imperfect instruments which are called rules of art  luckily those who painted my gallery were born before man therefore my pictures instead of being boxed up by lumbering bars of gold are disposed generously between latitudes equinoxes monsoons and the like and making all allowance for an owners partiality they are really not so bad  down in the south where the ships never gobetween the heel of new zealand and the south pole there is a seapiece showing a steamer trying to come round in the trough of a big beam sea the wet light of the days end comes more from the water than the sky and the waves are colourless through the haze of the rain all but two or three blind seahorses swinging out of the mist on the ships dripping weather side a lamp is lighted in the wheelhouse so one patch of yellow light falls on the greenpainted pistons of the steering gear as they snatch up the rudderchains a big sea has got home her stern flies up in the lather of a freed screw and her deck from poop to the break of the focsle goes under in graygreen water level as a millrace except where it spouts up above the donkeyengine and the stored derrickbooms forward there is nothing but this glare aft the interrupted wake drives far to leeward a cut kitestring dropped across the seas the sole thing that has any rest in the turmoil is the jewelled unwinking eye of an albatross who is beating across wind leisurely and unconcerned almost within hands touch it is the monstrous egotism of that eye that makes the picture by all the rules of art there should be a lighthouse or a harbour pier in the background to show that everything will end happily but there is not and the red eye does not care whether the thing beneath its still wings stays or staves  the sisterpanel hangs in the indian ocean and tells a story but is none the worse for that here you have hot tropical sunlight and a foreshore clothed in stately palms running out into a still and steamy sea burnished steel blue along the foreshore questing as a wounded beast quests for lair hurries a loaded steamer never built for speed consequently she tears and threshes the water to pieces and piles it under her nose and cannot put it under her cleanly coircoloured cargo bales are stacked round both masts and her decks are crammed and doublecrammed with darkskinned passengersfrom the focsle where they interfere with the crew to the stern where they hamper the wheel  the funnel is painted blue on yellow giving her a holiday air a little out of keeping with the yellow and black cholera flag at her main she dare not stop she must not communicate with any one there are leprous streaks of limewash trickling down her plates for a sign of this so she threshes on down the glorious coast she and her swarming passengers with the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday eating out her heart  yet another the pick of all the east rooms before we have done with blue water most of the nations of the earth are at issue under a stretch of white awning above a crowded deck the cause of the dispute a deep copper bowl foil of rice and fried onions is upset in the foreground malays lascars hindus chinese japanese burmansthe whole gamut of racetints from saffron to tarblackare twisting and writhing round it while their vermilion cobalt amber and emerald turbans and headcloths are lying underfoot pressed against the yellow ochre of the iron bulwarks to left and right are frightened women and children in turquoise and isabellacoloured clothes they are half protected by mounds of upset bedding straw mats red lacquer boxes and plaited bamboo trunks mixed up with tin plates brass and copper hukas silver opium pipes chinese playing cards and properties enough to drive halfadozen artists wild in the centre of the crowd of furious halfnaked men the fat bare back of a burman tattooed from collarbone to waistcloth with writhing patterns of red and blue devils holds the eye first it is a wicked back beyond it is the flicker of a malay kris a blue red and yellow macaw chained to a stanchion spreads his wings against the sun in an ecstasy of terror halfadozen redgold pines and bananas have been knocked down from their ripeningplaces and are lying between the feet of the fighters one pine has rolled against the long brown fur of a muzzled bear his owner a bushybearded hindu

zanzibari stoker grins through the bars of the engineroomhatch one ray of sun shining straight into his pink mouth the officer of the watch a redwhiskered man is kneeling down on the bridge to peer through the railings and is shifting a long thin black revolver from his left hand to his right the faithful sunlight that puts everything into place gives his whiskers and the hair on the back of his tanned wrist just the colour of the copper pot the bears fur and the trampled pines for the rest there is the blue sea beyond the awnings  three years hard work beside the special knowledge of a lifetime would be needed to copyeven to copythis picture mr soandso ra could undoubtedly draw the bird mr suchanother equally ra the bear and scores of gentlemen the still life but who would be the man to pull the whole thing together and make it the riotous tossing cataract of colour and life that it is and when it was done some middleaged person from the provinces who had never seen a pineapple out of a plate or a kris out of the south kensington would say that it did not remind him of something that it ought to remind him of and therefore that it was bad if the gallery could be bequeathed to the nation something might perhaps be gained but the nation would complain of the draughts and the absence of chairs but no matter in another world we shall see certain gentlemen set to tickle the backs of circes swine through all eternity also they will have to tickle with their bare hands  the japanese rooms visited and set in order for the second time hold more pictures than could be described in a month but most of them are small and excepting always the light within human compass one however might be difficult it was an unexpected gift picked up in a tokio byestreet after dark half the town was out for a walk and all the peoples clothes were indigo and so were the shadows and most of the paperlanterns were drops of blood red by the light of smoking oillamps people were selling flowers and shrubswicked little dwarf pines stunted peach and plum trees wisteria bushes clipped and twisted out of all likeness to wholesome plants leaning and leering out of greenglaze pots in the flickering of the yellow flames these forced cripples and the yellow faces above them reeled to and fro fantastically all together as the light steadied they would return to the pretence of being green things till a puff of the warm night wind among the flares set the whole line off again in a crazy dance of dwergs their shadows capering on the house fronts behind them  at a corner of a street some rich men had got together and left unguarded all the gold diamonds and rubies of the east but when you came near you saw that this treasure was only a gathering of goldfish in glass globesyellow white and red fish with from three to five forked tails apiece and eyes that bulged far beyond their heads there were wooden pans full of tiny ruby fish and little children with nets dabbled and shrieked in chase of some special beauty and the frightened fish kicked up showers of little pearls with their tails the children carried lanterns in the shape of small red paper fish bobbing at the end of slivers of bamboo and these drifted through the crowd like a strayed constellation of baby stars when the children stood at the edge of a canal and called down to unseen friends in boats the pink lights were all reflected orderly below the light of the thousand small lights in the street went straight up into the darkness among the interlacing telegraph wires and just at the edge of the shining haze on a sort of pigeontrap forty feet above ground sat a japanese fireman wrapped up in his cloak keeping watch against fires he looked unpleasantly like a bulgarian atrocity or a burmese deviation from the laws of humanity being very still and all huddled up in his roost that was a superb picture and it arranged itself to admiration now disregarding these things and otherswonders and miracles allmen are content to sit in studios and by light that is not light to fake subjects from pots and pans and rags and bricks that are called pieces of colour their collection of rubbish costs in the end quite as much as a ticket a firstclass one to new worlds where the props are given away with the sunshine to do anything because it is or may not be new on the market is wickedness that carries its own punishment but surely there must be things in this world paintable other and beyond those that lie between the north cape say and algiers for the sake of the pictures putting aside the dear delight of the gamble it might be worth while to venture out a little beyond the regular circle of subjects andsee what happens if a man can draw one thing it has been said he can draw anything at the most he can but fail and there are several matters in the world worse than failure betting on a certainty for instance or playing with nicked cards is immoral and secures expulsion from clubs keeping deliberately to one set line of work because you know you can do it and are certain to get money by so doing is on the other hand counted a virtue and secures admission to clubs there must be a middle way somewhere as there must be somewhere an unmarried man with no position reputation or other vanity to lose who most keenly wants to find out what his palette is set for in this life he will pack his steamertrunk and get into the open to wrestle with effects that he can never reproduce all the same his will be a superb failure     captains courageous  from yokohama to montreal is a long days journey and the forepart is uninviting in three voyages out of five the north pacific too big to lie altogether idle too idle to get hands about the business of a storm sulks and smokes like a chimney the passengers fresh from japan heat wither in the chill and a clammy dew distils from the rigging that gray monotony of sea is not at all homelike being as yet new and not

there is a man in yokohama who in a previous life burned galleons with drake he is a gentleman adventurer of the largest and most resourcefulby instinct a carver of kingdoms a ruler of men on the high

his most brilliant strategy will be lost among sixtyton schooners or told only in the mouths of drunken seamen whom none believe now there sits a great spirit under the palm trees of the navigator group a thousand leagues to the south and he crowned with roses and laurels strings together the pearls of those parts when he has done with this down there perhaps he will turn to the smoky seas and the wonderful adventures of captain then there will be a tale to listen to  but the first touch of dry land makes the sea and all upon it unreal five minutes after the traveller is on the cpr train at vancouver there is no romance of blue water but another kindthe life of the train into which he comes to grow as into life aboard ship a week on wheels turns a man into a part of the machine he knows when the train will stop to water wait for news of the trestle ahead drop the diningcar slip into a siding to let the westbound mail go by or yell through the thick night for an engine to help push up the bank the snort the snap and whine of the airbrakes have a meaning for him and he learns to distinguish between noisesbetween the rattle of a loose lamp and the ugly rattle of small stones on a scarped embankmentbetween the hoot toot that scares wandering cows from the line and the dry roar of the engine at the distancesignal in england the railway came late into a settled country fenced round with the terrors of the law and it has remained ever since just a little outside daily lifea thing to be respected here it strolls along with its hands in its pockets and a straw in its mouth on the heels of the roughhewn trail or log roada platformless regulationless necessity and it is treated even by sick persons and young children with a familiarity that sometimes affects the deathrate there was a small maiden aged seven who honoured our smoking compartment with her presence when other excitements failed and it was she that said to the conductor when do we change crews i want to pick waterliliesyellow ones a mere halt she knew would not suffice for her needs but the regular fifteenminute stop when the redpainted toolchest was taken off the rear car and a new gang came aboard the big man bent down to little impudencewant to pick lilies eh what would you do if the cars went on and took mama away sis take the next train she replied and tell the conductor to send me to brooklyn i live there but spose he wouldnt hed have to said young america id be a lost child  now from the province of alberta to brooklyn usa may be three thousand miles a great stretch of that distance is as new as the day before yesterday and strewn with townships in every stage of growth from the city of one round house two log huts and a chinese camp somewhere in the foothills of the selkirks to winnipeg with her leaguelong main street and her warring newspapers just at present there is an epidemic of politics in manitoba and brass bands and notices of committee meetings are splashed about the towns by reason of their closeness to the stages they have caught the contagion of foulmouthedness and accusations of bribery corruption and evilliving are many it is sweet to find a little babycity with only three men in it who can handle type cursing and swearing across the illimitable levels for all the world as though it were a grownup christian centre  all the new towns have their own wants to consider and the first of these is a railway if the town is on a line already then a new line to tap the back country but at all costs a line for this it will sell its corrupted soul and then be very indignant because the railway before which it has grovelled rides roughshod over the place  each new town believes itself to be a possible winnipeg until the glamour of the thing is a little worn off and the local paper sliding down the pole of pride with the hind legs of despair says defiantly at least a veterinary surgeon and a drug store would meet with encouragement in our midst and it is a fact that five new buildings have been erected in our midst since the spring from a distance nothing is easier than to smile at this sort of thing but he must have a cool head who can keep his pulse level when just such a wildcat townten houses two churches and a line of railsgets on the boom the reader at home says yes but its all a lie it may be butdid men lie about denver leadville ballarat broken hill portland or winnipeg twenty years agoor adelaide when town lots went begging within the memory of middleaged men did they lie about vancouver six years since or creede not twenty months gone hardly and it is just this knowledge that leads the passerby to give ear to the wildest statements of the wildest towns anything is possible especially among the rockies where the minerals lie over and above the mining towns the centres of ranching country and the supply towns to the farming districts there are literally scores upon scores of lakelets in the hills buried in woods now that before twenty years are run will be crowded summer resorts you in england have no idea of what summering means in the states and less of the amount of money that is spent on the yearly holiday people have no more than just begun to discover the place called the banff hot springs two days west of winnipeg1 in a little time they will know halfadozen spots not a days ride from montreal and it is along that line that money will be made in those days too wheat will be grown for the english market four hundred miles north of the present fields on the west side and british columbia perhaps the loveliest land in the world next to new zealand will have her own line of six thousand ton steamers to australia and the british investor will no longer throw away his money on hellicat south american republics or give it as a hostage to the states he will keep it in the family as a wise man should then the towns that are today the only names in the wilderness yes and some of those places marked on the map as hudson bay ports will be cities becausebut it is hopeless to make people understand that actually and indeed we do possess an empire of which canada is only one portionan empire which is not bounded by electionreturns on the north and eastbourne riots on the southan empire that has not yet been scratched  footnote 1 see pp 187188  let us return to the new towns three times within one year did fortune come knocking to the door of a man i know once at seattle when that town was a gray blur after a fire once at tacoma in the days when the steamtram ran off the rails twice a week and once at spokane falls but in the roar of the landboom he did not hear her and she went away leaving him only a tenderness akin to weakness for all new towns and a desire mercifully limited by lack of money to gamble in every one of them of all the excitements that life offers there are few to be compared with the whirl of a redhot boom also it is strictly moral because you do fairly earn your unearned increment by labour and perspiration and sitting up far into the nightby working like a fiend as all pioneers must do and consider all that is in it the headlong stampede to the new place the money dashed down like counters for merest daily bread the arrival of the piled cars whence the raw material of a citymen lumber and shingleare shot on to the not yet nailed platform the slashing out and pegging down of roads across the blank face of the wilderness the heaving up amid shouts and yells of the citys one electric lighta raw sizzling arc

portland to portland meeting in its heart the misspelled curse against this dam hole in the ground scrawled on the flank of a strayed freightcar by some man who had lost his money and gone away the conferences at street corners of syndicates six hours established by men not twentyfive years old the outspoken contempt for the next town also on the boom and therefore utterly vile the unceasing tramp of heavy feet on the board pavement where stranger sometimes turns on stranger in an agony of conviction and shaking him by the shoulder shouts in his ear by gd isnt it grand isnt it glorious and last the sleep of utterly wornout men three in each room of the shanty hotel all meals two dollars all drinks thirtyfive cents no washing done here the manager not responsible for anything does the bald catalogue of these recitals leave you cold it is possible but it is also possible after three days in a new town to set the full half of a truckload of archbishops fighting for corner lots as they never fought for mitre or crozier there is a contagion in a boom as irresistible as that of a panic in a theatre  after a while things settle down and then the carpenter who is also an architect can lay his bare arms across the bar and sell them to the highest bidder for the houses are coming up like toadstools after rain the men who do not build cheer those who do in that building means backing your belief in your townyours to you and peculiarly confound all other towns whatsoever behind the crowd of business men the weekly town paper plays as a stockwhip plays on a mob of cattle there is honour heaped extravagant imperial for the goodthe employer of labour the builder of stores the spender of money there is abuse savage and outrageous for the bad the man who buys out of the town the man who intends to go the sitter on the fence with persuasion and invitation in prose verse and zincograph for all that outside world which prefers to live in cities other than ours  now the editor as often as not begins as a mercenary and ends as a patriot this too is all of a piece with human nature a few years later if providence is good comes the return for judicious investment perhaps the town has stood the test of boom and that which was clapboard is now milwaukee brick or dressed stone vile in design but permanent the shanty hotel is the something house with accommodation for two hundred guests the manager who served you in his shirtsleeves as his own hotel clerk is gorgeous in broadcloth and needs to be reminded of the first meeting suburban villas more or less adorn the flats from which the liveliest fancy and fancy was free in the early days hung back horsecars jingle where the prairie schooner used to stick fast in the mudhole scooped to that end opposite the saloon and there is a belt electric service paying fabulous dividends then do you feeling older than methuselah and twice as important go forth and patronise things in general while the manager tells you exactly what sort of millionaire you would have been if you had stayed by the town  or elsethe bottom has tumbled out of the boom and the town new made is deaddead as a young mans corpse laid out in the morning success was not justified by success of ten thousand not three hundred remain and these live in huts on the outskirts of the brick streets the hotel with its suites of musty rooms is a big tomb the factory chimneys are cold the villas have no glass in them and the fireweed glows in the centre of the driveways mocking the arrogant advertisements in the empty shops there is nothing to do except to catch trout in the stream that was to have been defiled by the city sewage a twopounder lies fanning himself just in the cool of the main culvert where the alders have crept up to the city wall you pay your money and more or less you take your choice  by the time that man has seen these things and a few others that go with a boom he may say that he has lived and talk with his enemies in the gate he has heard the arabian nights retold and knows the inward kernel of that romance which some little folk say is vanished here they lie in their false teeth for cortes is not dead

breaking trails drinking sangaree running railways beyond the timberline swimming rivers blowing up treestumps and making cities where no cities were in all the five quarters of the world only people will not believe this when you tell them they are too near things and a great deal too well fed so they say of the most coldblooded realism this is romance how interesting and of overhandled thumbmarked realism this is indeed romance it is the next century that looking over its own will see the heroes of our time clearly  meantime this earth of ourswe hold a fair slice of it so faris full

the man in the train that we live in a tropical country for three months of the year only we wont recognise look at this he handed over a long list of deaths from heat that enlivened the newspapers all the cities where men live at breakingstrain were sending in their butcherbills and the papers of the cities themselves apostles of the gospel of rush were beseeching their readers to keep cool and not to overwork themselves while the hot wave was upon them the rivers were patched and barred with sundried pebbles the logs and loggers were droughtbound somewhere up the connecticut and the grass at the side of the track was burned in a hundred places by the sparks from locomotives menhatless coatless and gaspinglay in the shade of that station where only a few months ago the glass stood at 30

flag with some politicians name printed across the bottom hung down across the street as stiff as a board there were men with fans and alpaca coats curled up in splint chairs in the verandah of the

inhabitants nothing looks so hopelessly ex as a president returned to stores the stars and stripes signified that the presidential campaign had opened in main streetopened and shut up again politics evaporate at summer heat when all hands are busy with the last of the hay and as the formers put it vermonts bound to go republican the custom of the land is to drag the scuffle and dust of an election over several monthsto the improvement of business and manners but the noise of that war comes faintly up the valley of the connecticut and is lost among the fiddling of the locusts their music puts as it were a knife edge upon the heat of the day in truth it is a tropical country for the time being thunderstorms prowl and growl round the belted hills spit themselves away in a few drops of rain and leave the air more dead than before in the woods where even the faithful springs are beginning to run low the pines and balsams have thrown out all their fragrance upon the heat and wait for the wind to bring news of the rain the clematis wild carrot and all the gipsyflowers camped by sufferance between fence line and road net are masked in white dust and the goldenrod of the pastures that are burned to flaxcolour burns too like burnished brass a pillar of dust on the long hogback of the road across the hills shows where a team is lathering between farms and the roofs of

necessary to exchange news about the weather and the prospects for oats when oats are in there will be slack time on the farm and the farmers will seriously think of doing the hundred things that they have let slide during the summer they will undertake this and that when they get around to it the phrase translated is the exact equivalent to the mañana of the spaniard the kul hojaiga of upper india the yuroshii of the japanese and the long drawled taihod of the maori the only person who gets around in this weather is the summer boarderthe refugee from the burning cities of the plain and she is generally a woman she walks and botanizes and kodaks and strips the bark off the white birch to make blueribboned wastepaper baskets and the farmer regards her with wonder more does he wonder still at the city clerk in a blazer who has two weeks holiday in the year and apparently unlimited money which he earns in the easiest possible way by sitting at a desk and writing the farmers wife sees the fashions of the summer boarder and between them man and woman get a notion of the beauties of city life for which their children may live to blame them the blazer and the townmade gown are innocent recruiting sergeants for the city brigades and since one mans profession is ever a mystery to his fellow blazer and gown believe that the farmer must be happy and content a summer resort is one of the thousand windows whence to watch the thousand aspects of life in the atlantic states remember that between june and september it is the desire of all who can to get away from the big citiesnot on account of wantonness as people leave londonbut because of actual heat so they get away in their millions with their millionsthe wives of the rich men for five clear months the others for as long as they can and like drawing like they make communities set by set breed by breed division by division over the length and breadth of the landfrom maine and the upper reaches of the saguenay through the mountains and hot springs of halfadozen interior states out and away to sitka in steamers then they spend money on hotel bills among ten thousand farms on private companies who lease and stock land for sporting purposes on yachts and canoes bicycles rods châlets cottages reading circles camps tents and all the luxuries they know but the luxury of rest most of them do not know and the telephone and telegraph are faithfully dragged after them lest their menfolk should for a moment forget the ball and chain at foot  for sadness with laughter at bottom there are few things to compare with the sight of a coatless muddybooted millionaire his hat adorned with troutflies and a string of small fish in his hand clawing wildly at the telephone of some backofbeyond health resort thus  hello hello yes whos there oh all right go ahead yes its me hey what repeat sold for how much fortyfour and a half repeat no i told you to hold on what what who bought at that say hold a minute cable the other side no hold on ill come down business with watch tell schaefer ill see him tomorrow over his shoulder to his wife who wears halfhoop diamond rings at 10 am lizzie wheres my grip ive got to go down  and he goes down to eat in a hotel and sleep in his shutup house men are as scarce at most of the summer places as they are in indian hillstations in late april the women tell you that they cant get away and if they did they would only be miserable to get back now whether this wholesale abandonment of husbands by wives is wholesome let those who know the beauties of the angloindian system settle for themselves  that both men and women need rest very badly a glance at the crowded hotel tables makes plainso plain indeed that the foreigner who has not been taught that fuss and worry are in themselves honourable wishes sometimes he could put the whole unrestful crowd to sleep for seventeen hours a day i have inquired of not less than five hundred men and women in various parts of the states why they broke down and looked so gash and the men said if you dont keep up with the procession in america you are left and the women smiled an evil smile and answered that no outsider yet had discovered the real cause of their worry and strain or why their lives were arranged to work with the largest amount of friction in the shortest given time now the men can be left to their own folly but the cause of the womens trouble has been revealed to me it is the thing called help which is no help in the multitude of presents that the american man has given to the american woman for details see daily papers he has forgotten or is unable to give her good servants and that sordid trouble runs equally through the household of the millionaire or the flat of the small city man yes its easy enough to laugh said one woman passionately we are worn out and our children are worn out too and were always worrying i know it what can we do if you stay here youll know that this is the land of all the luxuries and none of the necessities youll know and then you wont laugh youll know why women are said to take their husbands to boardinghouses and never have homes youll know what an irish catholic means the men wont get up and attend to these things but we would if we had female suffrage wed shut the door to all the irish and throw it open to all the chinese and let the women have a little protection it was the cry of a soul worn thin with exasperation but it was truth today i do not laugh any more at the race that depends on inefficient helot races for its inefficient service when next you housekeeping in england differ with the respectable amiable industrious sixteenpound maid who wears a cap and says maam remember the pauper labour of americathe wives of the sixty million kings who have no subjects no man could get a thorough knowledge of the problem in one lifetime but he could guess at the size and the import of it after he has descended into the arena and wrestled with the swede and the dane and the german and the unspeakable celt then he perceives how good for the breed it must be that a man should thresh himself to pieces in naked competition with his neighbour while his wife struggles unceasingly over primitive savagery in the kitchen in india sometimes when a famine is at hand the life of the land starts up before your eyes in all its bareness and bitter stress here in spite of the trimmings and the frillings it refuses to be subdued and the clamour and the clatter of it are loud above all other soundsas sometimes the thunder of disorganised engines stops conversations along the decks of a liner and in the inquiring eyes of the passengers you read the questionthis thing is made and paid to bear us to port quietly why does it not do so only here the rattle of the badlyputtogether machine is always in the ears though men and women run about with laboursaving appliances and gospels of power through repose tinkering and oiling and making more noise the machine is new some day it is going to be the finest machine in the world to the ranks of the amateur artificers therefore are added men with notebooks tapping at every nut and bolthead fiddling with the glands registering revolutions and crying out from time to time that this or that is or is not distinctively american meantime men and women die unnecessarily in the wheels and they are said to have fallen in the battle of life  the god who sees us all die knows that there is far too much of that battle but we do not and so continue worshipping the knife that cuts and the wheel that breaks us as blindly as the outcast sweeper worships lalbeg the glorified broom that is the incarnation of his craft but the sweeper has sense enough not to kill himself and to be proud of it with sweeping  a foreigner can do little good by talking of these things for the same lean dry blood that breeds the fever of unrest breeds also the savage parochial pride that squeals under a steady stare or a pointed finger among themselves the people of the eastern cities admit that they and their womenfolk overwork grievously and go to pieces very readily and that the consequences for the young stock are unpleasant indeed but before the stranger they prefer to talk about the future of their mighty continent which has nothing to do with the case and to call aloud on baal of the dollarsto catalogue their lines mines telephones banks and cities and all the other shells buttons and counters that they have made their gods over them now a nation does not progress upon its brainpan as some books would have us believe but upon its belly as did the serpent of old and in the very long run the work of the brain comes to be gathered in by a slowfooted breed that have unimaginative stomachs and the nerves that know their place  all this is very consoling from the aliens point of view he perceives with great comfort that out of strain is bred impatience in the shape of a young bundle of nerves who is about as undisciplined an imp as the earth can show out of impatience grown up habituated to violent and ugly talk and the impatience and recklessness of his neighbours is begotten lawlessness encouraged by laziness and suppressed by violence when it becomes insupportable out of lawlessness is bred rebellion and that fruit has been tasted once already and out of rebellion comes profit to those who wait he hears of the power of the people who through rank slovenliness neglect to see that their laws are soberly enforced from the beginning and these people not once or twice in a year but many times within a month go out in the open streets and with a maximum waste of power and shouting strangle other people with ropes they are he is told lawabiding citizens who have executed the will of the people which is as though a man should leave his papers unsorted for a year and then smash his desk with an axe crying am i not orderly he hears lawyers otherwise sane and matured defend this pigjobbing murder on the grounds that the people stand behind the lawthe law that they never administered he sees a right at present only halfbut still halfconceded to anticipate the law in ones own interests and nervous impatience always nerves forejudging the suspect in gaol the prisoner in the dock and the award between nation and nation ere it is declared he knows that the maxim in london yokohama and hongkong in doing business with the purebred american is to keep him waiting for the reason that forced inaction frets the man to a lather as standing in harness frets a halfbroken horse he comes across a thousand little peculiarities of speech manner and thoughtmatters of nerve and stomach developed by everlasting frictionand they are all just the least little bit in the world lawless no more so than the restless clicking together of horns in a herd of restless cattle but certainly no less they are all goodgood for those who wait  on the other hand to consider the matter more humanly there are thousands of delightful men and women going to pieces for the pitiful reason that if they do not keep up with the procession they are left and they are leftin clothes that have no back to them among mounds of smilax and young menchancemet in the streets talk to you about their nerves which are things no young man should know anything about and the friends of your friends go down with nervous prostration and the people overheard in the trains talk about their nerves and the nerves of their relatives and the little children must needs have their nerves attended to ere their milkteeth are shed and the middleaged women and the middleaged men have got them too and the old men lose the dignity of their age in an indecent restlessness and the advertisements in the papers go to show that this sweeping list is no lie atop of the fret and the stampede the tingling selfconsciousness of a new people makes them take a sort of perverted pride in the futile racket that sends up the deathratea childs delight in the blaze and the dust of the march of progress is it not distinctively american it is and it is not if the cities were all america as they pretend fifty years would see the march of progress brought to a standstill as a locomotive is stopped by heated bearings  down in the meadow the mowingmachine has checked and the horses are shaking themselves the last of the sunlight leaves the top of monadnock and four miles away main street lights her electric lamps it is bandnight in main street and the folks from putney from marlboro from guildford and even new fane will drive in their wellfilled waggons to hear music and look at the expresident over the shoulder of the meadow two men come up very slowly their hats off and their arms swinging loosely at their sides they do not hurry they have not hurried and they never will hurry for they are of countrybankers of the flesh and blood of the ever bankrupt cities their children may yet be pale summer boarders as the boarders citybred weeds may take over their farms from the plough to the pavement goes man but to the plough he returns at last  going to supper  yeep very slowly across the wash of the uncut grass  say that corncrib wants painting  do that when we get around to it  they go off through the dusk without farewell or salutation steadily as their own steers and there are a few millions of themunhandy men to cross in their ways set silent indirect in speech and as impenetrable as that other eastern fanner who is the bedrock of another land they do not appear in the city papers they are not much heard in the streets and they tell very little in the outsiders estimate of america  and they are the american     leaves from a winter notebook  1895   we had walked abreast of the year from the very beginning and that was when the first bloodroot came up between the patches of april snow while yet the big drift at the bottom of the meadow held fast in the shadow of the woods and under the blown pineneedles clots of snow lay till far into may but neither the season nor the flowers took any note of them and before we were well sure winter had gone the lackeys of my lord baltimore in their new liveries came to tell us that summer was in the valley and please might they nest at the bottom of the garden  followed summer angry fidgety and nervous with the corn and tobacco to ripen in five short months the pastures to reclothe and the fallen leaves to hide away under new carpets suddenly in the middle of her work on a stuffystill july day she called a wind out of the northwest a wind blown under an arch of steelbellied clouds a wicked bitter wind with a lacing of hail to it a wind that came and was gone in less than ten minutes but blocked the roads with fallen trees toppled over a barn andblew potatoes out of the ground when that was done a white cloud shaped like a dumbbell whirled down the valley across the evening blue roaring and twisting and twisting and roaring all alone by itself a west indian hurricane could not have been quicker on its feet than our little cyclone and when the house rose atiptoe like a cockerel in act to crow and a sixtyfoot elm went by the board and that which had been a dusty road became a roaring torrent all in three minutes we felt that the new england summer had creole blood in her veins she went away redfaced and angry to the last slamming all the doors of the hills behind her and autumn who is a lady took charge  no pen can describe the turning of the leavesthe insurrection of the treepeople against the waning year a little maple began it flaming bloodred of a sudden where he stood against the dark green of a pinebelt next morning there was an answering signal from the swamp where the sumacs grow three days later the hillsides as far as the eye could range were afire and the roads paved with crimson and gold then a wet wind blew and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army and the oaks who had held themselves in reserve buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf till nothing remained but pencilshading of bare boughs and one could see into the most private heart of the woods  frost may be looked for till the middle of may and after the middle of september so summer has little time for enamelwork or leafembroidery her sisters bring the giftsspring windflowers solomonsseal dutchmansbreeches quakerladies and trailing arbutus that smells as divinely as the true may autumn has goldenrod and all the tribe of asters pink lilac and creamy white by the double armful when these go the curtain comes down and whatever powers shift the scenery behind work without noise in tropic lands you can hear the play of growth and decay at the back of the nightsilences even in england the tides of the winter air have a set and a purpose but here they are dumb altogether the very last piece of benchwork this season was the trailed end of a blackberryvine most daringly conventionalised in hammered iron flung down on the frosty grass an instant before people came to look the blue bloom of the furnace was still dying along the central rib and the sidesprays were cherry red even as they had been lifted from the charcoal it was a detail evidently of some invisible gate in the woods but we never found that workman though he had left the mark of his cloven foot as plainly as any strayed deer in a week the heavy frosts with scythes and hammers had slashed and knocked down all the roadside growth and the kindly bushes that veil the drop off the unfenced track  there the seasons stopped awhile autumn was gone winter was not we had time dealt out to usmere clear fresh timegracedays to enjoy the white wooden farmhouses were banked round two feet deep with dried leaves or earth and the choppers went out to get ready next years stores of wood now chopping is an art and the chopper in all respects an artist he makes his own axehelve and for each man there is but one perfect piece of wood in all the world this he never finds but the likest substitute is trimmed and balanced and poised to that ideal one man i know has evolved very nearly the weapon of umslopogaas it is almost straight lapped at the butt with leather amazingly springy and carries a twoedged blade for splitting and chopping if his demon be with himand what artist can answer for all his moodshe will cause a tree to fall upon any stick or stone that you choose uphill or down to the right or to the left artistlike however he explains that that is nothing any fool can play with a tree in the open but it needs the craftsman to bring a tree down in thick timber and do no harm to see an eightyfoot maple four feet in the butt dropped deftly as a fly is cast in the only place where it will not outrage the feelings and swipe off the tops of fifty juniors is a revelation white pine hemlock and spruce share this country with maples black and white birches and beech maple seems to have few preferences and the white birches straggle and shiver on the outskirts of every camp but the pines hold together in solid regiments sending out skirmishers to invade a neglected pasture on the first opportunity there is no overcoat warmer than the pines in a gale when the woods for miles round are singing like cathedral organs and the first snow of the year powders the rockledges  the mosses and lichens green sulphur and amber stud the copper floor of needles where the feathery groundpine runs aimlessly to and fro along the ground spelling out broken words of halfforgotten charms there are checkerberries on the outskirts of the wood where the partridge he is a ruffed grouse really dines and by the deserted loggingroads toadstools of all colours sprout on the decayed stumps wherever a green or blue rock lifts from the hillside the needles have been packed and matted round its base till when the sunshine catches them stone and setting together look no meaner than turquoise in dead gold the woods are full of colour belts and blotches of it the colours of the savagered yellow and blue yet in their lodges there is very little life for the woodpeople do not readily go into the shadows the squirrels have their business among the beeches and hickories by the roadside where they can watch the traffic and talk we have no gray ones hereabouts they are good to eat and suffer for it but five reds live in a hickory hard by and no weather puts them to sleep the woodchuck a marmot and a strategist makes his burrow in the middle of a field where he must see you ere you see him now and again a dog manages to cut him off his base and the battle is worth crossing fields to watch but the woodchuck turned in long ago and will not be out till april the coon liveswell no one seems to know particularly where brer coon lives but when the hunters moon is large and full he descends into the cornlands and men chase him with dogs for his fur which makes the finest kind of overcoat and his flesh which tastes like chicken he cries at night sorrowfully as though a child were

they are pretty and the other small things for sportfrench fashion you can get a rifle of a kind for twelve shillings and if your neighbour be fool enough to post notices forbidding hunting and

marching take you up to the moosecountry and twentyodd miles from here as the crow flies you come to virgin timber where trappers live and where there is a lost pond that many have found once but can never find again  men who are of one blood with sheep have followed their friends and the railway along the river valleys where the towns are across the hills the inhabitants are few and outside their state little known they withdraw from society in november if they live on the uplands coming down in may as the snow gives leave not much more than a generation ago these farms made their own clothes soap and candles and killed their own meat thrice a year beef veal and pig and sat still betweentimes now they buy shopmade clothes patent soaps and kerosene and it is among their tents that the huge

fancy for it is a poor family that does not know all about nervous prostration so the quack drives a pair of horses and a gailypainted waggon with a hood and sometimes takes his wife with him once only have i met a pedlar afoot he was an old man shaken with palsy and he pushed a thing exactly like a paupers burialcart selling pins tape scents and flavourings you helped yourself for his hands had no direction and he told a long tale in which the deeding away of a farm to one of his family was mixed up with pride at the distances he still could cover daily as much as six miles sometimes he was no lear as the gift of the farm might suggest but sealed of the tribe of the wandering jewa tremulous old giddygaddy there are many such rovers gelders of colts and the like who work a long beat south to virginia almost and north to the frontier paying with talk and gossip for their entertainment  yet tramps are few and that is well for the american article answers almost exactly to the

cooper horses in the manner of their tribe they have the gypsy look and some of the old gypsy names but say that they are largely mixed with gentile blood  winter has chased all these really interesting people south and in a few weeks if we have anything of a snow the back farms will be unvisited save by the doctors hooded sleigh it is no childs play to hold a practice here through the winter months when the drifts are really formed and a pair can drop in up to their saddlepads four horses a day some of them use and use upfor they are good men  now in the big silence of the snow is

it may be not too well cooked food have full swing a man and more particularly a woman can easily hear strange voicesthe word of the lord rolling between the dead hills may see visions and dream

breeds as well as religionthe deep instriking hate between neighbours that is born of a hundred little things added up brooded over and hatched by the stove when two or three talk together in the long evenings it would be very interesting to get the statistics of revivals and murders and find how many of them have been committed in the spring but for undistracted people winter is one long delight of the eye in other lands one knows the snow as a nuisance that comes and goes and is sorely manhandled and messed at the last here it lies longer on the ground than any cropfrom november to april sometimesand for three months life goes to the tune of sleighbells which are not as a southern visitor once hinted ostentation but safeguards the man who drives without them is not loved the snow is a faithful barometer foretelling good sleighing or stark confinement to barracks it is all the manure the stony pastures receive it cloaks the ground and prevents the frost bursting pipes it is the besti had almost written the onlyroadmaker in the states on the other side it can rise up in the night and bid the people sit still as the egyptians it can stop mails wipe out all timetables extinguish the lamps of twenty towns and kill man within sight of his own doorstep or hearing of his cattle unfed no one who has been through even so modified a blizzard as new england can produce talks lightly of the snow imagine eightandforty hours of roaring wind the thermometer well down towards zero scooping and gouging across a hundred miles of newly fallen snow the air is full of stinging shot and at ten yards the trees are invisible the foot slides on a reef polished and black as obsidian where the wind has skinned an exposed corner of road down to the dirt ice of early winter the next step ends hipdeep and over for here an unseen wall is banking back the rush of the singing drifts a scarped slope rises sheer across the road the wind shifts a point or two and all sinks down like sand in the hourglass leaving a pothole of whirling whiteness there is a lull and you can see the surface of the fields settling furiously in one directiona tide that spurts from between the treeboles the hollows of the pasture fill while you watch empty fill and discharge anew the rockledges show the bare flank of a stormchased liner for a moment and whitening duck under irresponsible snowdevils dance by the lee of a barn where three gusts meet or stagger out into the open till they are cut down by the main wind at the worst of the storm there is neither heaven nor earth but only a swizzle into which a man may be brewed distances grow to nightmare scale and that which in the summer was no more than a minutes bareheaded run is half an hours gasping struggle each foot won between the lulls then do the heavytimbered barns talk like ships in a crosssea beam working against beam the winters hay is ribbed over with long lines of snow dust blown between the boards and far below in the byre the oxen clash their horns and moan uneasily  the next day is blue breathless and most utterly still the farmers shovel a way to their beasts bind with chains their large ploughshares to their heaviest woodsled and take of oxen as many as allah has given them these they drive and the dragging share makes a furrow in which a horse can walk and the oxen by force of repeatedly going in up to their bellies presently find foothold the finished road is a deep double gutter between threefoot walls of snow where by custom the heavier vehicle has the right of way the lighter man when he turns out must drop waistdeep and haul his unwilling beast into the drift leaving providence to steady the sleigh  in the towns where they choke and sputter and gasp the big snow turns to horsepondine with us it stays still but wind sun and rain get to work upon it lest the texture and colour should not change daily rain makes a granulated crust over all in which white shagreen the trees are faintly reflected heavy mists go up and down and create a sort of mirage till they settle and pack round the irontipped hills and then you know how the moon must look to an inhabitant of it at twilight again the beatendown ridges and laps and folds of the uplands take on the likeness of wet sandsome huge and melancholy beach at the worlds endand when day meets night it is all goblin country to westward the last of the spent dayrustred and pearl illimitable levels of shore waiting for the tide to turn again to eastward black night among the valleys and on the rounded hill slopes a hard glaze that is not so much light as snailslime from the moon once or twice perhaps in the winter the northern lights come out between the moon and the sun so that to the two unearthly lights is added the leap and flare of the aurora borealis  in january or february come the great icestorms when every branch blade and trunk is coated with frozen rain so that you can touch nothing truly the spikes of the pines are sunk into pearshaped crystals and each fencepost is miraculously hilted with diamonds if you bend a twig the icing cracks like varnish and a halfinch branch snaps off at the lightest tap if wind and sun open the day together the eye cannot look steadily at the splendour of this jewelry the woods are full of the clatter of arms the ringing of bucks horns in flight the stampede of mailed feet up and down the glades and a great dust of battle is puffed out into the open till the last of the ice is beaten away and the cleared branches take up their regular chant  again the mercury drops twenty and more below zero and the very trees swoon the snow turns to french chalk squeaking under the heel and their breath cloaks the oxen in rime at night a trees heart will break in him with a groan according to the books the frost has split something but it is a fearful sound this grunt as of a man stunned  winter that is winter in earnest does not allow cattle and horses to play about the fields so everything comes home and since no share can break ground to any profit for some five months there would seem to be very little to do as a matter of fact country interests at all seasons are extensive and peculiar and the day is not long enough for them when you take out that time which a selfrespecting man needs to turn himself round in consider the solid undisturbed hours stand about one like ramparts at a certain time the sun will rise at another hour equally certain he will set this much we know why in the name of reason therefore should we vex ourselves with vain exertions an occasional visitor from the cities of the plains comes up panting to do things he is set down to listen to the normal beat of his own hearta sound that very few men have heard in a few days when the lather of impatience has dried off he ceases to talk of getting there or being left he does not desire to accomplish matters right away nor does he look at his watch from force of habit but keeps it where it should bein his stomach at the last he goes back to his beleaguered city unwillingly partially civilised soon to be resavaged by the clash of a thousand wars whose echo does not reach here  the air which kills germs dries out the very newspapers they might be of tomorrow or a hundred years ago they have nothing to do with todaythe long full sunlit today our interests are not on the same scale as theirs perhaps but much more complex the movement of a foreign poweran alien sleigh on this pontic shoremust be explained and accounted for or this publics heart will burst with unsatisfied curiosity if it be buck davis with the white mare that he traded his colt for and the practically new sleighrobe that he bought at the sewell auction why does buck davis who lives on the river flats cross our hills unless murder hollow be blockaded with snow or unless he has turkeys for sale but buck davis with turkeys would surely have stopped here unless he were selling a large stock in town a wail from the sacking at the back of the sleigh tells the tale it is a winter calf and buck davis is going to sell it for one dollar to the boston market where it will be turned into potted chicken this leaves the mystery of his change of route unexplained after two days sitting on tenterhooks it is discovered obliquely that buck went to pay a dooryard call on orson butler who lives on the saeter where the wind and the bald granite scaurs fight it out together kirk demming had brought orson news of a fox at the back of black mountain and orsons eldest son going to murder hollow with wood for the new barn floor that the widow amidon is laying down told buck that he might as well come round to talk to his father about the pig but old man butler meant foxhunting from the first and what he wanted to do was to borrow bucks dog who had been duly brought over with the calf and left on the mountain no old man butler did not go hunting alone but waited till buck came back from town buck sold the calf for a dollar and a quarter and not for seventyfive cents as was falsely asserted by interested parties then the two went after the fox together this much learned everybody breathes freely if life has not been complicated in the meantime by more strange countermarchings  five or six sleighs a day we can understand if we know why they are abroad but any metropolitan rush of traffic disturbs and excites     letters to the family   1908  these letters appeared in newspapers during the spring of 1908 after a trip to canada undertaken in the autumn of 1907 they are now reprinted without alteration  the road to quebec a people at home cities and spaces newspapers and democracy labour the fortunate towns mountains and the pacific a conclusion                                       the road to quebec  1907   it must be hard for those who do not live there to realise the cross between canker and blight that has settled on england for the last couple of years the effects of it are felt throughout the empire but at headquarters we taste the stuff in the very air just as one tastes iodoform in the cups and breadandbutter of a hospitaltea so far as one can come at things in the present fog every form of unfitness general or specialised born or created during the last generation has combined in one big trusta majority of all the minoritiesto play the game of government now that the game ceases to amuse ninetenths of the english who set these folk in power are crying if we had only known what they were going to do we should never have voted for them  yet as the rest of the empire perceived at the time these men were always perfectly explicit as to their emotions and intentions they said first and drove it home by large pictures that no possible advantage to the empire outweighed the cruelty and injustice of charging the british working man twopence halfpenny a week on some of his provisions incidentally they explained so that all earth except england heard it that the army was wicked much of the navy unnecessary that half the population of one of the colonies practised slavery with torture for the sake of private gain and that the mere name of empire wearied and sickened them on these grounds they stood to save england on these grounds they were elected with what seemed like clear orders to destroy the bloodstained fetish of empire as soon as possible the present mellow condition of ireland egypt india and south africa is proof of their honesty and obedience over and above this their mere presence in office produced all along our lines the same moral effect as the presence of an incompetent master in a classroom paper pellets books and ink began to fly desks were thumped dirty pens were jabbed into those trying to work rats and mice were set free amid squeals of exaggerated fear and as usual the least desirable characters in the forms were loudest to profess noble sentiments and most eloquent grief at being misjudged still the english are not happy and the unrest and slackness increase  on the other hand which is to our advantage the isolation of the unfit in one political party has thrown up the extremists in what the babu called all their naked cui bono these last are after satisfying the two chief desires of primitive man by the very latest gadgets in scientific legislation but how to get free food and freeshall we saylove within the four corners of an act of parliament without giving the game away too grossly worries them a little it is easy enough to laugh at this but we are all so knit together nowadays that a rot at what is called headquarters may spread like bubonic with every steamer i went across to canada the other day for a few weeks mainly to escape the blight and also to see what our eldest sister was doing have you ever noticed that canada has to deal in the lump with most of the problems that afflict us others severally for example she has the doublelanguage doublelaw doublepolitics drawback in a worse form than south africa because unlike our dutch her french cannot well marry outside their religion and they take their orders from italyless central sometimes than pretoria or stellenbosch she has too something of australias labour fuss minus australias isolation but plus the open and secret influence of labour entrenched with arms and high explosives on neighbouring soil to complete the parallel she keeps tucked away behind mountains a trifle of land called british columbia which resembles new zealand and new zealanders who do not find much scope for young enterprise in their own country are drifting up to british columbia already  canada has in her time known calamity more serious than floods frost drought and fireand has macadamized some stretches of her road toward nationhood with the broken hearts of two generations that is why one can discuss with canadians of the old stock matters which an australian or new zealander could no more understand than a wealthy child understands death truly we are an odd family australia and new zealand the maori war not counted got everything for nothing south africa gave everything and got less than nothing canada has given and taken all along the line for nigh on three hundred years and in some respects is the wisest as she should be the happiest of us all she seems to be curiously unconscious of her position in the empire perhaps because she has lately been talked at or down to by her neighbours you know how at any gathering of our men from all quarters it is tacitly conceded that canada takes the lead in the imperial game to put it roughly she saw the goal more than ten years ago and has been working the ball toward it ever since that is why her inaction at the last imperial conference made people who were interested in the play wonder why she of all of us chose to brigade herself with general botha and to block the forward rush i too asked that question of many the answer was something like this we saw that england wasnt taking anything just then why should we have laid ourselves open to be snubbed worse than we were we sat still quite reasonablealmost too convincing there was really no need that canada should have done other than she didexcept that she was the eldest sister and more was expected of her she is a little too modest  we discussed this first of all under the lee of a wet deckhouse in midatlantic man after man cutting in and out of the talk as he sucked at his damp tobacco the passengers were nearly all unmixed canadian mostly born in the maritime provinces where their fathers speak of canada as sussex speaks of england but scattered about their businesses throughout the wide dominion they were at ease too among themselves with that pleasant intimacy that stamps every branch of our family and every boat that it uses on its homeward way a cape liner is all the subcontinent from the equator to simons town an orient boat is australasian throughout and a cpr steamer cannot be confused with anything except canada it is a pity one may not be born in four places at once and then one would understand the halftones and asides and the allusions of all our family life without waste of precious time these big men smoking in the drizzle had hope in their eyes belief in their tongues and strength in their hearts i used to think miserably of other boats at the south end of this oceana quarter full of people deprived of these things a young man kindly explained to me how canada had suffered through what he called the imperial connection how she had been diversely bedevilled by english statesmen for political reasons he did not know his luck nor would he believe me when i tried to point it out but a nice man in a plaid who knew south africa lurched round the corner and fell on him with facts and imagery which astonished the patriotic young mind the plaid finished his outburst with the uncontradicted statement that the english were mad all our talks ended on that note  it was an experience to move in the midst of a new contempt one understands and accepts the bitter scorn of the dutch the hopeless anger of ones own race in south africa is also part of the burden but the canadians profound sometimes humorous often bewildered always polite contempt of the england of today cuts a little you see that late unfashionable war3 was very real to canada she sent several men to it and a thinlypopulated country is apt to miss her dead more than a crowded one when from her point of view they have died for no conceivable advantage moral or material her business instincts or it may be mere animal love of her children cause her to remember and resent quite a long time after the thing should be decently forgotten i was shocked at the vehemence with which some men and women spoke of the affair some of them went so far as to discusson the ship and elsewherewhether england would stay in the family or whether as some eminent statesman was said to have asserted in private talk she would cut the painter to save expense one man argued without any heat that she would not so much break out of the empire in one flurry as politically vend her children one by one to the nearest power that threatened her comfort the sale of each case to be preceded by a steady blast of abuse of the chosen victim he quotedreally these people have viciously long memoriesthe fiveyear campaign of abuse against south africans as a precedent and a warning  footnote 3 boer war of 18991902  our tobacco parliament next set itself to consider by what means if this happened canada could keep her identity unsubmerged and that led to one of the most curious talks i have ever heard it seemed to be decided that she mightjust mightpull through by the skin of her teeth as a nationif but this was doubtful england did not help others to hammer her now twenty years ago one would not have heard any of this sort of thing if it sounds a little mad remember that the mother country was throughout considered as a lady in violent hysterics  just at the end of the talk one of our twelve or thirteen hundred steeragepassengers leaped overboard ulstered and booted into a confused and bitter cold sea every horror in the world has its fitting ritual for the fifth timeand four times in just such weatheri heard the screw stop saw our wake curve like a whiplash as the great township wrenched herself round the lifeboats crew hurry to the boatdeck the bareheaded officer race up the shrouds and look for any sign of the poor head that had valued itself so lightly a boat amid waves can see nothing there was nothing to see from the first we waited and quartered the ground back and forth for a long hour while the rain fell and the seas slapped along our sides and the steam fluttered drearily through the escapes then we went ahead  the st lawrence on the last day of the voyage played up nobly the maples along its banks had turnedblood red and splendid as the banners of lost youth even the oak is not more of a national tree than the maple and the sight of its welcome made the folks aboard still more happy a dry wind brought along all the clean smell of their continentmixed odours of sawn lumber virgin earth and woodsmoke and they snuffed it and their eyes softened as they identified point after point along their own beloved riverplaces where they played and fished and amused themselves in holiday time it must be pleasant to have a country of ones very own to show off understand they did not in any way boast shout squeak or exclaim these evenvoiced returned men and women they were simply and unfeignedly glad to see home again and they said isnt it lovely dont you think its beautiful we love it  at quebec there is a sort of place much infested by locomotives like a coalchute whence rise the heights that wolfes men scaled on their way to the plains of abraham perhaps of all the tidemarks in all our lands the affair of quebec touches the heart and the eye more nearly than any other everything meets there france the jealous partner of englands glory by land and sea for eight hundred years england bewildered as usual but for a wonder not openly opposing pitt who knew those other people destined to break from england as soon as the french peril was removed montcalm himself doomed and resolute wolfe the inevitable trained workman appointed for the finish and somewhere in the background one james cook master of hms mercury making beautiful and delicate charts of the st lawrence river  for these reasons the plains of abraham are crowned with all sorts of beautiful thingsincluding a jail and a factory montcalms left wing is marked by the jail and wolfes right by the factory there is happily now a movement on foot to abolish these adornments and turn the battlefield and its surroundings into a park which by nature and association would be one of the most beautiful in our world  yet in spite of jails on the one side and convents on the other and the thin black wreck of the quebec railway bridge lying like a dumped carload of tin cans in the river the eastern gate to canada is noble with a dignity beyond words we saw it very early when the under sides of the clouds turned chilly pink over a highpiled brooding duskypurple city just at the point of dawn what looked like the sultan harunalraschids own private shallop all spangled with coloured lights stole across the irongrey water and disappeared into the darkness of a slip she came out again in three minutes but the full day had come too so she snapped off her masthead steering and cabin electrics and turned into a dingy white ferryboat full of cold passengers i spoke to a canadian about her why shes the old soandso to port levis he answered wondering as the cockney wonders when a stranger stares at an inner circle train this was his inner circlethe zion where he was all at ease he drew my attention to stately city and stately river with the same tranquil pride that we each feel when the visitor steps across our own threshold whether that be southampton water on a grey wavy morning sydney harbour with a regatta in full swing or table mountain radiant and newwashed after the christmas rains he had quite rightly felt personally responsible for the weather and every flaming stretch of maple since we had entered the river the northwester in these parts is equivalent to the southeaster elsewhere and may impress a guest unfavourably  then the autumn sun rose and the man smiled personally and politically he said he loathed the citybut it was his  well he asked at last what do you think not so bad  oh no not at all so bad i answered and it wasnt till much later that i realised that we had exchanged the countersign which runs clear round the empire     a people at home   an upcountry proverb says she was bidden to the wedding and set down to grind corn the same fate reversed overtook me on my little excursion there is a crafty network of organisations of business men called canadian clubs they catch people who look interesting assemble their members during the midday lunchhour and tying the victim to a steak bid him discourse on anything that he thinks he knows the idea might be copied elsewhere since it takes men out of themselves to listen to matters not otherwise coming under their notice and at the same time does not hamper their work it is safely short too the whole affair cannot exceed an hour of which the lunch fills half the clubs print their speeches annually and one gets crosssections of many interesting questionsfrom practical forestry to state mintsall set out by experts  not being an expert the experience to me was very like hard work till then i had thought speechmaking was a sort of conversational whist that any one could cut in at it i perceive now that it is an art of conventions remote from anything that comes out of an inkpot and of colours hard to control the canadians seem to like listening to speeches and though this is by no means a national vice they make good oratory on occasion you know the old belief that the white man on brown red or black lands will throw back in manner and instinct to the type originally bred there thus a speech in the taal should carry the deep roll the direct bellyappeal the reiterated cunning arguments and the few simple metaphors of the prince of commercial orators the bantu a new zealander is said to speak from his diaphragm hands clenched at the sides as the old maoris used what we know of firstclass australian oratory shows us the same alertness swift flight and clean delivery as a thrown boomerang i had half expected in canadian speeches some survival of the redskins elaborate appeal to suns moons and mountainstouches of grandiosity and ceremonial invocations but nothing that i heard was referable to any primitive stock there was a dignity a restraint and above all a weight in it rather curious when one thinks of the influences to which the land lies open red it was not french it was not but a thing as much by itself as the speakers  so with the canadians few gestures and the bearing of his body during the boer war one watched the contingents from every point of view and most likely drew wrong inferences it struck me then that the canadian even when tired slacked off less than the men from the hot countries and while resting did not lie on his back or his belly but rather on his side a leg doubled under him ready to rise in one surge  this time while i watched assemblies seated men in hotels and passersby i fancied that he kept this habit of semitenseness at home among his own that it was the complement of the mans still countenance and his even lowered voice looking at their footmarks on the ground they seem to throw an almost straight track neither splayed nor intoed and to set their feet down with a gentle forward pressure rather like the australians stealthy footfall talking among themselves or waiting for friends they did not drum with their fingers fiddle with their feet or feel the hair on their faces these things seem trivial enough but when breeds are in the making everything is worth while a man told me oncebut i never tried the experimentthat each of our four races light and handle fire in their own way  small wonder we differ here is a people with no people at their backs driving the great worldplough which wins the worlds bread up and up over the shoulder of the worlda spectacle as it might be out of some tremendous norse legend north of them lies niflheims enduring cold with the flick and crackle of the aurora for bifrost bridge that odin and the aesir visited these people also go north year by year and drag audacious railways with them sometimes they burst into good wheat or timber land sometimes into mines of treasure and all the north is foil of voicesas south africa was oncetelling discoveries and making prophecies  when their winter comes over the greater part of this country outside the cities they must sit still and eat and drink as the aesir did in summer they cram twelve months work into six because between such and such dates certain far rivers will shut and later certain others till at last even the great eastern gate at quebec locks and men must go in and out by the sidedoors at halifax and st john these are conditions that make for extreme boldness but not for extravagant boastings  the maples tell when it is time to finish and all work in hand is regulated by their warning signal some jobs can be put through before winter others must be laid aside ready to jump forward without a lost minute in spring thus from quebec to calgary a note of drivenot hustle but drive and finishuphummed like the steamthreshers on the still autumn air  hunters and sportsmen were coming in from the north prospectors with them their faces foil of mystery their pockets full of samples like prospectors the world over they had already been wearing wolf and coon skin coats in the great cities which work the year round carriageshops exhibited one or two seductive nickelplated sledges as a hint for the sleigh is the chariot at hand here of love in the country the farmhouses were stacking up their woodpiles within reach of the kitchen door and taking down the flyscreens one leaves these on as a rule till the double windows are brought up from the cellar and one has to hunt all over the house for missing screws sometimes one saw a few flashing lengths of new stovepipe in a backyard and pitied the owner there is no humour in the old bittertrue stovepipe jests of the comic papers  but the railwaysthe wonderful railwaystold the winters tale most emphatically the thirtyton coal cars were moving over three thousand miles of track they grunted and lurched against each other in the switchyards or thumped past statelily at midnight on their way to provident housekeepers of the prairie towns it was not a clear way either for the bacon the lard the apples the butter and the cheese in beautiful whitewood barrels were rolling eastwards toward the steamers before the wheat should descend on them that is the fifth act of the great yearplay for which the stage must be cleared on scores of congested sidings lay huge girders rolled beams limbs and boxes of rivets once intended for the late quebec bridgenow so much mere obstructionand the victuals had to pick their way through em and behind the victuals was the lumberclean wood out of the mountainslogs planks clapboards and laths for which we pay such sinful prices in englandall seeking the sea there was housing food and fuel for millions on wheels together and never a grain yet shifted of the real staple which men for five hundred miles were threshing out in heaps as high as fiftypound villas  add to this that the railways were concerned for their own new developmentsdoubletrackings loops cutoffs taps and feeder lines and great swoops out into untouched lands soon to be filled with men so the construction ballast and material trains the grading machines the wrecking cars with their camellike sneering cranesthe whole plant of a new civilisationhad to find room somewhere in the general rally before nature cried lay off  does any one remember that joyful strong confidence after the war when it seemed that at last south africa was to be developedwhen men laid out railways and gave orders for engines and fresh rollingstock and labour and believed gloriously in the future it is true the hope was murdered afterward butmultiply that good hour by a thousand and you will have some idea of how it feels to be in canadaa place which even an imperial government cannot kill i had the luck to be shown some things from the insideto listen to the details of works projected the record of works done above all i saw what had actually been achieved in the fifteen years since i had last come that way one advantage of a new land is that it makes you feel older than time i met cities where there had been nothingliterally absolutely nothing except as the fairy tales say the birds crying and the grass waving in the wind villages and hamlets had grown to great towns and the great towns themselves had trebled and quadrupled and the railways rubbed their hands and cried like the afrites of old shall we make a city where no city is or render flourishing a city that is dasolate they do it too while across the water gentlemen never forced to suffer one days physical discomfort in all their lives pipe up and say how grossly materialistic  i wonder sometimes whether any eminent novelist philosopher dramatist or divine of today has to exercise half the pure imagination not to mention insight endurance and selfrestraint which is accepted without comment in what is called the material exploitation of a new country take only the question of creating a new city at the junction of two linesall three in the air the mere drama of it the play of the human virtues would fill a book and when the work is finished when the city is when the new lines embrace a new belt of farms and the tide of the wheat has rolled north another unexpected degree the men who did it break off without compliments to repeat the joke elsewhere  i had some talk with a youngish man whose business it was to train avalanches to jump clear of his section of the track thor went to jotunheim only once or twice and he had his useful hammer miolnr with him this thor lived in jotunheim among the greenicecrowned peaks of the selkirkswhere if you disturb the giants at certain seasons of the year by making noises they will sit upon you and all your fine emotions so thor watches them glaring under the may sun or dull and doubly dangerous beneath the spring rains he wards off their strokes with enormous brattices of wood wingwalls of logs bolted together and such other contraptions as experience teaches he bears the giants no malice they do their work he his what bothers him a little is that the wind of their blows sometimes rips pines out of the opposite hillsidesexplodes as it were a whole valley he thinks however he can fix things so as to split large avalanches into little ones  another man to whom i did not talk sticks in my memory he had for years and years inspected trains at the head of a heavyish grade in the mountainsthough not half so steep as the hex4where all brakes are jammed home and the cars slither warily for ten miles tiretroubles there would be inconvenient so he as the best man is given the heaviest jobmonotony and responsibility combined he did me the honour of wanting to speak to me but first he inspected his trainon all fours with a hammer by the time he was satisfied of the integrity of the underpinnings it was time for us to go and all that i got was a friendly wave of the handa master craftsmans sign you might call it  footnote 4 hex river south africa  canada seems full of this class of materialist  which reminds me that the other day i saw the lady herself in the shape of a tall woman of twentyfive or six waiting for her tram on a street corner she wore her almost flaxengold hair waved and parted low on the forehead beneath a black astrachan toque with a red enamel mapleleaf hatpin in one side of it this was the one touch of colour except the flicker of a buckle on the shoe the dark tailormade dress had no trinkets or attachments but fitted perfectly she stood for perhaps a minute without any movement both handsright bare left glovedhanging naturally at her sides the very fingers still the weight of the superb body carried evenly on both feet and the profile which was that of gudrun or aslauga thrown out against a dark stone column what struck me most next to the grave tranquil eyes was her slow unhurried breathing in the hurry about her she was evidently a regular fare for when her tram stopped she smiled at the lucky conductor and the last i saw of her was a flash of the sun on the red mapleleaf the full face still lighted by that smile and her hair very pale gold against the dead black fur but the power of the mouth the wisdom of the brow the human comprehension of the eyes and the outstriking vitality of the creature remained that is how i would have my country drawn were i a canadianand hung in ottawa parliament house for the discouragement of prevaricators     cities and spaces  what would you do with a magic carpet if one were lent you i ask because for a month we had a private car of our very owna trifling affair less than seventy foot long and thirty ton weight you may find her useful said the donor casually to knock about the country hitch on to any train you choose and stop off where you choose  so she bore us over the cpr from the atlantic to the pacific and back and when we had no more need of her vanished like the mango tree after the trick  a private car though many books have been written in it is hardly the best place from which to study a country unless it happen that you have kept house and seen the seasons round under normal conditions on the same continent then you know how the cars look from the houses which is not in the least as the houses look from the cars then the very porters brush in its nickel clip the long cathedrallike aisle between the wellknown green seats the toll of the bell and the deep organlike note of the engine wake up memories and every sight smell and sound outside are like old friends remembering old days together a pianotop buggy on a muddy boardsidewalked street all cut up by the narrow tires the shingling at the corner of a veranda on a newbuilt house a broken snakefence girdling an old pasture of mulleins and skullheaded boulders a wisp of virginia creeper dying splendidly on the edge of a patch of corn half a dozen panels of snowfence above a cutting or even a shameless patentmedicine advertisement yellow on the black of a tobaccobarn can make the heart thump and the eyes fill if the beholder have only touched the life of which they are part what must they mean to the nativeborn there was a prairiebred girl on the train coming back after a year on the continent for whom the pinebelted hills with real mountains behind the solemn loops of the river and the intimate friendly farm had nothing to tell  you can do these landscapes better in italy she explained and with the indescribable gesture of plains folk stifled in broken ground i want to push these hills away and get into the open again im winnipeg  she would have understood that hanover road schoolmistress back from a visit to cape town whom i once saw drive off into thirty miles of mirage almost shouting thank god heres something like home at last  other people ricochetted from side to side of the car reviving this rediscovering that anticipating tother thing which sure enough slid round the next curve to meet them caring nothing if all the world knew they were home again and the newly arrived englishman with his large wooden packingcases marked settlers effects had no more part in the show than a new boy his first day at school but two years in canada and one run home will make him free of the brotherhood in canada as it does anywhere else he may grumble at certain aspects of the life lament certain richnesses only to be found in england but as surely as he grumbles so surely he returns to the big skies and the big chances the failures are those who complain that the land does not know a gentleman when it sees him they are quite right the land suspends all judgment on all men till it has seen them work thereafter as may be but work they must because there is a very great deal to be done  unluckily the railroads which made the country are bringing in persons who are particular as to the nature and amenities of their work and if so be they do not find precisely what they are looking for they complain in print which makes all men seem equal  the special joy of our trip lay in having travelled the line when it was new and like the canada of those days not much believed in when all the high and important officials whose little fingers unhooked cars were also small and disregarded today things men and cities were different and the story of the line mixed itself up with the story of the country the while the carwheels clicked out john kinojohn kino nagasaki yokohama hakodate heh for we were following in the wake of the imperial limited all full of hongkong and treaty ports men there were old known and wonderfully grown cities to be looked at before we could get away to the new work out west and what dyou think of this building and that suburb they said imperiously come out and see what has been done in this generation  the impact of a continent is rather overwhelming till you remind yourself that it is no more than your own joy and love and pride in your own patch of garden written a little large over a few more acres again as always it was the dignity of the cities that impressedan austere northern dignity of outline grouping and perspective aloof from the rush of traffic in the streets montreal of the blackfrocked priests and the french notices had it and ottawa of the grey stone palaces and the st petersburglike shining waterfrontages and toronto consumingly commercial carried the same power in the same repose men are always building better than they know and perhaps this steadfast architecture is waiting for the race when their first flurry of newlyrealised expansion shall have spent itself and the present hurrahsnest of telephone poles in the streets shall have been abolished there are strong objections to any nonfusible bilingual community within a nation but however much the french are made to hang back in the work of development their withdrawn and unconcerned cathedrals schools and convents and one aspect of the spirit that breathes from them make for good says young canada there are millions of dollars worth of church property in the cities which arent allowed to be taxed on the other hand the catholic schools and universities though they are reported to keep up the old medieval mistrust of greek teach the classics as lovingly tenderly and intimately as the old church has always taught them after all it must be worth something to say your prayers in a dialect of the tongue that virgil handled and a certain touch of insolence more magnificent and more ancient than the insolence of present materialism makes a good blend in a new land  i had the good fortune to see the cities through the eyes of an englishman out for the first time have you been to the bank he cried ive never seen anything like it whats the matter with the bank i asked for the financial situation across the border was at that moment more than usual picturesque its wonderful said he marble pillarsacres of mosaicsteel grillesmight be a cathedral no one ever told me i shouldnt worry over a bank that pays its depositors i replied soothingly there are several like it in ottawa and toronto next he ran across some pictures in some palaces and was downright angry because no one had told him that there were five priceless private galleries in one city look here he explained ive been seeing corots and greuzes and gainsboroughs and a holbein andand hundreds of really splendid pictures why shouldnt you i said theyve given up painting their lodges with vermilion hereabouts yes but what i mean is have you seen the equipment of their schools and collegesdesks libraries and lavatories its miles ahead of anything we have andno one ever told me what was the good of telling you wouldnt have believed theres a building in one of the cities on the lines of the sheldonian but better and if you go as far as winnipeg youll see the finest hotel in all the world  nonsense he said youre pulling my leg winnipegs a prairietown  i left him still lamentingabout a club and a gymnasium this timethat no one had ever told him about and still doubting all that he had heard of wonders to come  if we could only manacle four hundred members of parliament like the chinese in the election cartoons and walk them round the empire what an allcomprehending little empire we should be when the survivors got home  certainly the cities have good right to be proud and i waited for them to boast but they were so busy explaining they were only at the beginning of things that for the honour of the family i had to do the boasting in this praiseworthy game i credited melbourne rightly i hope but the pace was too good to inquire with acres of municipal buildings and leagues of art galleries enlarged the borders of sydney harbour to meet a statement about torontos wharfage and recommended folk to see cape town cathedral when it should be finished but truth will out even on a visit our eldest sister has more of beauty and strength inside her three cities alone than the rest of us put together yet it would do her no harm to send a commission through the ten great cities of the empire to see what is being done there in the way of street cleaning watersupply and trafficregulation  here and there the people are infected with the unworthy superstition of hustle which means halfdoing your appointed job and applauding your own slapdasherie for as long a time as would enable you to finish off two clean pieces of work little congestions of traffic that an english rural policeman in a country town disentangles automatically are allowed to develop into tenminute blocks where wagons and men bang and back and blaspheme for no purpose except to waste time  the assembly and dispersal of crowds purchase of tickets and a good deal of the small machinery of life is clogged and hampered by this unstable southern spirit which is own brother to panic hustle does not sit well on the national character any more than falsetto or fidgeting becomes grown men drive a laudable and necessary quality is quite different and one meets it up the western road where the new country is being made  we got clean away from the three cities and the closetilled farming and orchard districts into the land of little lakesa country of rushing streams cleareyed ponds and boulders among berrybushes all crying trout and bear  not so very long ago only a few wise people kept holiday in that part of the world and they did not give away their discoveries now it has become a summer playground where people hunt and camp at large the names of its further rivers are known in england and men otherwise sane slip away from london into the birches and come out again bearded and smokestained when the ice is thick enough to cut a canoe sometimes they go to look for game sometimes for mineralsperhaps even oil no one can prophesy we are only at the beginning of things  said an afrite of the railway as we passed in our magic carpet youve no notion of the size of our touristtraffic it has all grown up since the early nineties the trolley car teaches people in the towns to go for little picnics when they get more money they go for long ones all this continent will want playgrounds soon were getting them ready  the girl from winnipeg saw the morning frost lie white on the long grass at the lake edges and watched the haze of mellow golden birch leaves as they dropped now thats the way trees ought to turn she said dont you think our eastern maple is a little violent in colour then we passed through a country where for many hours the talk in the cars was of mines and the treatment of ores men told one talesprospectors yarns of the sort one used to hear vaguely before klondike or nome were public property they did not care whether one believed or doubted they too were only at the beginning of thingssilver perhaps gold perhaps nickel perhaps if a great city did not arise at such a placethe very name was new since my dayit would assuredly be born within a few miles of it the silent men boarded the cars and dropped off and disappeared beyond thickets and hills precisely as the first widely spaced line of skirmishers fans out and vanishes along the front of the days battle  one old man sat before me like avenging time itself and talked of prophecies of evil that had been falsified they said there wasnt nothing here excep rocks an snow they said there never wouldnt be nothing here excep the railroad theres them that cant see yit and he gimleted me with a fierce eye an all the while fortunes is madepiles is maderight under our noses  have you made your pile i asked  he smiled as the artist smilesall true prospectors have that lofty smileme no ive been a prospector most o my time but i havent lost anything ive had my fun out of the game by god ive had my fun out of it  i told him how i had once come through when land and timber grants could have been picked up for half less than nothing  yes he said placidly i reckon if youd had any kind of an education you could ha made a quarter of a million dollars easy in those days and its to be made now if you could see where how can you tell me what the capital of the hudson bay districts goin to be you cant nor i nor yet where the six next new cities is going to arise i get off here but if i have my health ill be out next summer againprospectin north  imagine a country where men prospect till they are seventy with no fear of fever fly horsesickness or trouble from the nativesa country where food and water always taste good he told me curious things about some fabled goldthe eternal motherlodeout in the north which is to humble the pride of nome and yet so vast is the empire he had never heard the name of johannesburg  as the train swung round the shores of lake superior the talk swung over to wheat oh yes men said there were mines in the countrythey were only at the beginning of minesbut that part of the world existed to clean and grade and handle and deliver the wheat by rail and steamer the track was being duplicated by a few hundred miles to keep abreast of the floods of it by and by it might be a fourtrack road they were only at the beginning meantime here was the wheat sprouting tender green a foot high among a hundred sidings where it had spilled from the cars there were the highshouldered teacaddy grainelevators to clean and the hospitals to doctor the wheat here was new gaily painted machinery going forward to reap and bind and thresh the wheat and all those carloads of workmen had been slapping down more sidings against the years delivery of the wheat  two towns stand on the shores of the lake less than a mile apart what lloyds is to shipping or the college of surgeons to medicine that they are to the wheat its honour and integrity are in their hands and they hate each other with the pure poisonous passionate hatred which makes towns grow if providence wiped out one of them the survivor would pine away and diea mateless hatebird some day they must unite and the question of the composite name they shall then carry already vexes them a man there told me that lake superior was a useful piece of water in that it lay so handy to the cpr tracks there is a quiet horror about the great lakes which grows as one revisits them fresh water has no right or call to dip over the horizon pulling down and pushing up the hulls of big steamers no right to tread the slow deepsea dancestep between wrinkled cliffs nor to roar in on weed and sand beaches between vast headlands that run out for leagues into haze and seafog lake superior is all the same stuff as what towns pay taxes for but it engulfs and wrecks and drives ashore like a fully accredited oceana hideous thing to find in the heart of a continent some people go sailing on it for pleasure and it has produced a breed of sailors who bear the same relation to the saltwater variety as a snakecharmer does to a liontamer  yet it is undoubtedly a useful piece of water     newspapers and democracy   let it be granted that as the loudvoiced herald hired by the eolithic tribe to cry the news of the coming day along the caves preceded the chosen tribal bard who sang the more picturesque history of the tribe so is journalism senior to literature in that journalism meets the first tribal need after warmth food and women  in new countries it shows clear trace of its descent from the tribal herald a tribe thinly occupying large spaces feels lonely it desires to hear the rollcall of its members cried often and loudly to comfort itself with the knowledge that there are companions just below the horizon it employs therefore heralds to name and describe all who pass that is why newspapers of new countries seem often so outrageously personal the tribe moreover needs quick and sure knowledge of everything that touches on its daily life in the big spacesearth air and water news which the older peoples have put behind them that is why its newspapers so often seem so laboriously trivial  for example a rednosed member of the tribe pete ohalloran comes in thirty miles to have his horse shod and incidentally smashes the kingbolt of his buckboard at a bad place in the road the tribal heralda thin weekly with a patent insideconnects the red nose and the breakdown with an innuendo which to the outsider is clumsy libel but the tribal herald understands that twoandseventy families of the tribe may use that road weekly it concerns them to discover whether the accident was due to pete being drunk or as pete protests to the neglected state of the road fifteen men happen to know that petes nose is an affliction not an indication one of them loafs across and explains to the tribal herald who next week cries aloud that the road ought to be mended meantime pete warmed to the marrow at having focussed the attention of his tribe for a few moments retires thirty miles upstage pursued by advertisements of buckboards guaranteed not to break their kingbolts and later which is what the tribe were after all the time some tribal authority or other mends the road  this is only a bigscale diagram but with a little attention you can see the tribal instinct of selfpreservation quite logically underrunning all sorts of queer modern developments  as the tribe grows and men do not behold the horizon from edge to unbroken edge their desire to know all about the next man weakens a littlebut not much outside the cities are still the long distances the vast unoccupied areas of the advertisements and the men who come and go yearn to keep touch with and report themselves as of old to their lodges a man stepping out of the dark into the circle of the fires naturally if he be a true man holds up his hands and says i soandso am here you can watch the ritual in full swing at any hotel when the reporter pro tribal herald runs his eyes down the list of arrivals and before he can turn from the register is met by the newcomer who without special desire for notoriety explains his business and intentions observe it is always at evening that the reporter concerns himself with strangers by day he follows the activities of his own city and the doings of nearby chiefs but when it is time to close the stockade to laager the wagons to draw the thornbush back into the gap then in all lands he reverts to the tribal herald who is also the tribal outer guard  there are countries where a man is indecently pawed over by chattering heralds who bob their foul torches in his face till he is singed and smoked at once in canada the necessary stand and deliver your sentiments goes through with the large decency that stamps all the dominion a strangers words are passed on to the tribe quite accurately no dirt is put into his mouth and where the heralds judge that it would be better not to translate certain remarks they courteously explain why  it was always delightful to meet the reporters for they were men interested in their land with the keen unselfish interest that one finds in young housesurgeons or civilians thanks to the boer war many of them had reached out to the ends of our earth and spoke of the sister nations as it did one good to hear consequently the interviewswhich are as dreary for the reporter as the reportedoften turned into pleasant and unpublished talks one felt at every turn of the quick sentences to be dealing with made and trained players of the gamebalanced men who believed in decencies not to be disregarded confidences not to be violated and honour not to be mocked this may explain what men and women have told methat there is very little of the brutal domestic terrorism of the press in canada and not much blackmailing they neither spat nor wriggled they interpolated no juicy anecdotes of murder or theft among their acquaintance and not once between either ocean did they or any other fellowsubjects volunteer that their country was lawabiding  you know the first signpost on the great main road when a woman advertises that she is virtuous a man that he is a gentleman a community that it is loyal or a country that it is lawabidinggo the other way  yet while the mens talk was so good and new their written word seemed to be cast in conventional not to say oldfashioned moulds a quarter of a century ago a subeditor opening his mail could identify the melbourne argus the sydney morning herald or the cape times as far as he could see them even unheaded clippings from them declared their origin as a piece of hide betrays the beast that wore it but he noticed then that canadian journals left neither spoor nor scentmight have blown in from anywhere between thirty degrees of latitudeand had to be carefully identified by hand today the spacing the headlines the advertising of canadian papers the chessboardlike look of the open page which should be a daily beautiful study in black and white the brittle pulppaper the machineset type are all as standardised as the railway cars of the continent indeed looking through a mass of canadian journals is like trying to find ones own sleeper in a corridor train newspaper offices are among the most conservative organisations in the world but surely after twentyfive years some changes might be permitted to creep in some original convention of expression or assembly might be developed  i drew up to this idea cautiously among a knot of fellowcraftsmen you mean said one straighteyed youth that we are a backnumber copying backnumbers  it was precisely what i did mean so i made haste to deny it we know that he said cheerfully remember we havent the sea all round usand the postal rates to england have only just been lowered it will all come right  surely it will but meantime one hates to think of these splendid people using secondclass words to express firstclass emotions  and so naturally from journalism to democracy every country is entitled to her reservations and pretences but the more democratic a land is the more makebelieves must the stranger respect some of the tribal heralds were very good to me in this matter and as it were nudged me when it was time to duck in the house of rimmon during their office hours they professed an unflinching belief in the blessed word democracy which means any crowd on the movethat is to say the helpless thing which breaks through floors and falls into cellars overturns pleasureboats by rushing from port to starboard stamps men into pulp because it thinks it has lost sixpence and jams and grills in the doorways of blazing theatres out of office like every one else they relaxed many winked a few were flippant but they all agreed that the only drawback to democracy was demosa jealous god of primitive tastes and despotic tendencies i received a faithful portrait of him from a politician who had worshipped him all his life it was practically the epistle of jeremythe sixth chapter of baruchdone into unquotable english  but canada is not yet an ideal democracy for one thing she has had to work hard among roughedged surroundings which carry inevitable consequences for another the law in canada exists and is administered not as a surprise a joke a favour a bribe or a wrestling turk exhibition but as an integral part of the national characterno more to be forgotten or talked about than ones trousers if you kill you hang if you steal you go to jail this has worked toward peace selfrespect and i think the innate dignity of the people on the other handwhich is where the trouble will beginrailways and steamers make it possible nowadays to bring in persons who need never lose touch of hot and cold watertaps spread tables and crockery till they are turned out much surprised into the wilderness they clean miss the long weeks of saltwater and the slow passage across the plains which pickled and tanned the early emigrants they arrive with soft bodies and unaired souls i had this vividly brought home to me by a man on a train among the selkirks he stood on the safely railed rearplatform looked at the gigantic pinefurred shoulder round which men at their lives risk had led every yard of the track and chirruped i say why cant all this be nationalised there was nothing under heaven except the snows and the steep to prevent him from dropping off the cars and hunting a mine for himself instead of which he went into the diningcar that is one type  a man told me the old tale of a crowd of russian immigrants who at a big fire in a city verted to the ancestral type and blocked the streets yelling down with the czar that is another type a few days later i was shown a wire stating that a community of doukhoborsrussians againhad not for the first time undressed themselves and were fleeing up the track to meet the messiah before the snow fell police were pursuing them with warm underclothing and trains would please take care not to run over them  so there you have three sort of steamborne unfitnesssoft savage and mad there is a fourth brand which may be either homegrown or imported but democracies do not recognise it of downright bad folkgrown healthy men and women who honestly rejoice in doing evil these four classes acting together might conceivably produce a rather pernicious democracy alien hysteria bloodcraze and the like reinforcing local ignorance sloth and arrogance for example i read a letter in a paper sympathising with these same doukhobors the writer knew a community of excellent people in england you see where the rot starts who lived barefoot paid no taxes ate nuts and were above marriage they were a soulful folk living pure lives the doukhobors were also pure and soulful entitled in a free country to live their own lives and not to be oppressed etc etc imported soft observe playing up to imported mad meantime disgusted police were chasing the doukhobors into flannels that they might live to produce children fit to consort with the sons of the man who wrote that letter and the daughters of the crowd that lost their heads at the fire  all of which men and women answered we admit but what can we do we want people and they showed vast and wellequipped schools where the children of slav immigrants are taught english and the songs of canada when they grow up people said you cant tell them from canadians it was a wonderful work the teacher holds up pens reels and so forth giving the name in english the children repeating chinese fashion presently when they have enough words they can bridge back to the knowledge they learned in their own country so that a boy of twelve at say the end of a year will produce a wellwritten english account of his journey from russia how much his mother paid for food by the way and where his father got his first job he will also lay his hand on his heart and say iamacanadian this gratifies the canadian who naturally purrs over an emigrant owing everything to the land which adopted him and set him on his feet the lady bountiful of an english village takes the same interest in a child she has helped on in the world and the child repays by his gratitude and good behaviour  personally one cannot care much for those who have renounced their own country they may have had good reason but they have broken the rules of the game and ought to be penalised instead of adding to their score nor is it true as men pretend that a few full meals and fine clothes obliterate all taint of alien instinct and reversion a thousand years cannot be as yesterday for mankind and one has only to glance at the races across the border to realise how in outlook manner expression and morale the south and southeast profoundly and fatally affects the north and northwest that was why the sight of the beadyeyed muddyskinned aproned women with handkerchiefs on their heads and oriental bundles in their hands always distressed one  but why must you get this stuff i asked you know it is not your equal and it knows that it is not your equal and that is bad for you both what is the matter with the english as immigrants  the answers were explicit because the english do not work because we are sick of remittancemen and loafers sent out here because the english are rotten with socialism because the english dont fit with our life they kick at our way of doing things they are always telling us how things are done in england they carry frills dont you know the story of the englishman who lost his way and was found halfdead of thirst beside a river when he was asked why he didnt drink he said how the deuce can i without a glass  but i argued over three thousand miles of country all these are excellent reasons for bringing in the englishman it is true that in his own country he is taught to shirk work because kind silly people fall over each other to help and debauch and amuse him here general january will stiffen him up remittancemen are an affliction to every branch of the family but your manners and morals cant be so tender as to suffer from a few thousand of them among your six millions as to the englishmans socialism he is by nature the most unsocial animal alive what you call socialism is his intellectual equivalent for diabolo and limerick competitions as to his criticisms you surely wouldnt marry a woman who agreed with you in everything and you ought to choose your immigrants on the same lines you admit that the canadian is too busy to kick at anything the englishman is a born kicker yes he is all that they said he kicks on principle and that is what makes for civilisation so did your englishmans instinct about the glass every new country needsvitally needsonehalf of one per cent of its population trained to die of thirst rather than drink out of their hands you are always talking of the second generation of your smyrniotes and bessarabians think what the second generation of the english are  they thoughtquite visiblybut they did not much seem to relish it there was a queer stringhalt in their talka conversational shy across the roadwhen one touched on these subjects after a while i went to a tribal herald whom i could trust and demanded of him pointblank where the trouble really lay and who was behind it  it is labour he said you had better leave it alone     labour   one cannot leave a thing alone if it is thrust under the nose at every turn i had not quitted the quebec steamer three minutes when i was asked pointblank what do you think of the question of asiatic exclusion which is agitating our community  the second signpost on the great main road says if a community is agitated by a questioninquire politely after the health of the agitator this i did without success and had to temporise all across the continent till i could find some one to help me to acceptable answers the question appears to be confined to british columbia there after a while the men who had their own reasons for not wishing to talk referred me to others who explained and on the acutest understanding that no names were to be published it is sweet to see engineers afraid of being hoist by their own petards one got more or less at something like facts  the chinaman has always been in the habit of coming to british columbia where he makes as he does elsewhere the finest servant in the world no one i was assured on all hands objects to the biddable chinaman he takes work which no white man in a new country will handle and when kicked by the mean white will not grossly retaliate he has always paid for the privilege of making his fortune on this wonderful coast but with singular forethought and statesmanship the popular will some few years ago decided to double the headtax on his entry strange as it may appear the chinaman now charges double for his services and is scarce at that this is said to be one of the reasons why overworked white women die or go off their heads and why in new cities you can see blocks of flats being built to minimise the inconveniences of housekeeping without help the birthrate will fall later in exact proportion to those flats  since the russojapanese war the japanese have taken to coming over to british columbia they also do work which no white man will such as hauling wet logs for lumber mills out of cold water at from eight to ten shillings a day they supply the service in hotels and diningrooms and keep small shops the trouble with them is that they are just a little too good and when attacked defend themselves with asperity  a fair sprinkling of punjabisexsoldiers sikhs muzbis and jatsare coming in on the boats the plague at home seems to have made them restless but i could not gather why so many of them come from shahpur phillour and jullundur way these men do not of course offer for houseservice but work in the lumber mills and with the least little care and attention could be made most valuable some one ought to tell them not to bring their old men with them and better arrangements should be made for their remitting money home to their villages they are not understood of course but they are not hated  the objection is all against the japanese so farexcept that they are said to have captured the local fishing trade at vancouver precisely as the malays control the cape town fish businessthey have not yet competed with the whites but i was earnestly assured by many men that there was danger of their lowering the standard of life and wages the demand therefore in certain quarters is that they goabsolutely and unconditionally you may have noticed that democracies are strong on the imperative mood an attempt was made to shift them shortly before i came to vancouver but it was not very successful because the japanese barricaded their quarters and flocked out a broken bottle held by the neck in either hand which they jabbed in the faces of the demonstrators it is perhaps easier to haze and hammer bewildered hindus and tamils as is being done across the border than to stampede the men of the yalu and liaoyang5  footnote 5 battles in the russojapanese war  but when one began to ask questions one got lost in a maze of hints reservations and orations mostly delivered with constraint as though the talkers were saying a piece learned by heart here are some samples  a man penned me in a corner with a single heavily capitalised sentence there is a general sentiment among our people that the japanese must go said he  very good said i how dyou propose to set about it  that is nothing to us there is a general sentiment etc  quite so sentiment is a beautiful thing but what are you going to do he did not condescend to particulars but kept repeating the sentiment which as i promised i record  another man was a little more explicit we desire he said to keep the chinaman but the japanese must go  then who takes their place isnt this rather a new country to pitch people out of  we must develop our resources slowly sirwith an eye to the interests of our children we must preserve the continent for races which will assimilate with ours we must not be swamped by aliens  then bring in your own races and bring em in quick i ventured  this is the one remark one must not make in certain quarters of the west and i lost caste heavily while he explained exactly as the dutch did at the cape years ago how british columbia was by no means so rich as she appeared that she was throttled by capitalists and monopolists of all kinds that white labour had to be laid off and fed and warmed during the winter that living expenses were enormously high that they were at the end of a period of prosperity and were now entering on lean years and that whatever steps were necessary for bringing in more white people should be taken with extreme caution then he added that the railway rates to british columbia were so high that emigrants were debarred from coming on there  but havent the rates been reduced i asked  yesyes i believe they have but immigrants are so much in demand that they are snapped up before they have got so far west you must remember too that skilled labour is not like agricultural labour it is dependent on so many considerations and the japanese must go  so people have told me but i heard stories of dairies and fruitfarms in british columbia being thrown up because there was no labour to milk or pick the fruit is that true dyou think  well you cant expect a man with all the chances that our country offers him to milk cows in a pasture a chinaman can do that we want races that will assimilate with ours etc etc  but didnt the salvation army offer to bring in three or four thousand english some short time ago what came of that idea  iterfell through  why  for political reasons i believe we do not want people who will lower the standard of living that is why the japanese must go  then why keep the chinese  we can get on with the chinese we cant get on without the chinese but we must have emigration of a type that will assimilate with our people i hope i have made myself clear  i hoped that he had too  now hear a wife a mother and a housekeeper  we have to pay for this precious state of things with our health and our childrens do you know the saying that the frontier is hard on women and cattle this isnt the frontier but in some respects its worse because we have all the luxuries and appearancesthe pretty glass and silver to put on the table we have to dust polish and arrange em after weve done our housework i dont suppose that means anything to you buttry it for a month we have no help a chinaman costs fifty or sixty dollars a month now our husbands cant always afford that how old would you take me for im not thirty well thank god i stopped my sister coming out west oh yes its a fine countryfor men  cant you import servants from england  i cant pay a girls passage in order to have her married in three months besides she wouldnt work they wont when they see chinamen working  do you object to the japanese too  of course not no one does its only politics the wives of the men who earn six and seven dollars a dayskilled labour they call ithave chinese and jap servants we cant afford it we have to think of saving for the future but those other people live up to every cent they earn they know theyre all right theyre labour theyll be looked after whatever happens you can see how the state looks after me  a little later i had occasion to go through a great and beautiful city between six and seven of a crisp morning milk and fish vegetables etc were being delivered to the silent houses by chinese and japanese not a single white man was visible on that chilly job  later still a man came to see me without too publicly giving his name he was in a small way of business and told me others had said much the same thing that if i gave him away his business would suffer he talked for half an hour on end  am i to understand then i said that what you call labour absolutely dominates this part of the world  he nodded  that it is difficult to get skilled labour into here  difficult my god if i want to get an extra hand for my businessi pay union wages of coursei have to arrange to get him here secretly i have to go out and meet him accidentallike down the line and if the unions find out that he is coming they like as not order him back east or turn him down across the border  even if he has his union ticket why  theyll tell him that labour conditions are not good here he knows what that means hell turn back quick enough im in a small way of business and i cant afford to take any chances fighting the unions  what would happen if you did  dyou know whats happening across the border men get blown up therewith dynamite  but this isnt across the border  its a damnsight too near to be pleasant and witnesses get blown up too you see the labour situation aint run from our side the line its worked from down under you may have noticed men were rather careful when they talked about it  yes i noticed all that  well it aint a pleasant state of affairs i dont say that the unions here would do anything to youand please understand im all for the rights of labour myself labour has no better friend than meive been a working man though ive got a business of my own now dont run away with any idea that im against labourwill you  not in the least i can see that you merely find that labours a little biterinconsiderate sometimes  look what happens across the border i suppose theyve told you that little fuss with the japanese in vancouver was worked from down under havent they i dont think our own people ud have done it by themselves  ive heard that several times is it quite sporting do you think to lay the blame on another country  you dont live here but as i was sayingif we get rid of the japs today well be told to get rid of some one else tomorrow theres no limit sir to what labour wants none  i thought they only want a fair days wage for a fair days work  that may do in the old country but here they mean to boss the country they do  and how does the country like it  were about sick of it it dont matter much in flush timesemployersll do most anything sooner than stop workbut when we come to a pinch youll hear something were a rich landin spite of everything they make outbut were held up at every turn by labour why theres businesses on businesses which friends of minein a small way like myselfwant to start businesses in every directionif they was only allowed to start in but they aint  thats a pity now what do you think about the japanese question  i dont think i know both political parties are playing up to the labour voteif you understand what that means  i tried to understand  and neither sidell tell the truththat if the asiatic goes this side of the continentll drop out of sight unless we get free white immigration and any party that proposed white immigration on a large scale ud be snowed under next election im telling you what politicians think myself i believe if a man stood up to labournot that ive any feeling against labourand just talked sense a lot of people would follow himquietly of course i believe he could even get white immigration after a while hed lose the first election of course but in the long run were about sick of labour i wanted you to know the truth  thank you and you dont think any attempt to bring in white immigration would succeed  not if it didnt suit labour you can try it if you like and see what happens  on that hint i made an experiment in another city there were three men of position and importance and affluence each keenly interested in the development of their land each asserting that what the land needed was white immigrants and we four talked for two hours on the matterup and down and in circles the one point on which those three men were unanimous was that whatever steps were taken to bring people into british columbia from england by private recruiting or otherwise should be taken secretly otherwise the business of the people concerned in the scheme would suffer  at which point i dropped the great question of asiatic exclusion which is agitating all our community and i leave it to you especially in australia and the cape to draw your own conclusions  externally british columbia appears to be the richest and the loveliest section of the continent over and above her own resources she has a fair chance to secure an immense asiatic trade which she urgently desires her land in many places over large areas is peculiarly fitted for the small former and fruitgrower who can send his truck to the cities on every hand i heard a demand for labour of all kinds at the same time in no other part of the continent did i meet so many men who insistently decried the value and possibilities of their country or who dwelt more fluently on the hardships and privations to be endured by the white immigrant i believe that one or two gentlemen have gone to england to explain the drawbacks viva voce it is possible that they incur a great responsibility in the present and even a terrible one for the future     the fortunate towns  after politics let us return to the prairie which is the high veldt plus hope activity and reward winnipeg is the door to ita great city in a great plain comparing herself innocently enough to other cities of her acquaintance but quite unlike any other city  when one meets in her own house a woman not seen since girlhood she is all a stranger till some remembered tone or gesture links up to the past and one cries it is you after all but indeed the child has gone the woman with her influences has taken her place i tried vainly to recover the gawky graceless city i had known so unformed and so insistent on her shy self i even ventured to remind a man of it i remember he said smiling but we were young then this thing indicating an immense perspective of asphalted avenue that dipped under thirty railway tracks only came up in the last ten yearspractically the last five weve had to enlarge all those warehouses yonder by adding two or three stories to em and weve hardly begun to go ahead yet were just beginning  warehouses railwaysidings and such are only counters in the white mans game which can be swept up and redealt as the play varies it was the spirit in the thin dancing airthe new spirit of the new citywhich rejoiced me winnipeg has things in abundance but has learned to put them beneath her feet not on top of her mind and so is older than many cities none the less the things had to be shownfor what shopping is to the woman showing off his town is to the rightminded man first came the suburbsmiles on miles of the dainty cleanoutlined woodenbuilt houses where one can be so happy and so warm each unjealously divided from its neighbour by the lightest of boundaries one could date them by their architecture year after year back to the early nineties which is when civilisation began could guess within a few score dollars at their cost and the incomes of their owners and could ask questions about the new domestic appliances of today  asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks came up a few years ago said our host as we trotted over miles of it we found it the only way to fight the prairie mud look where the daring road ended there lay unsubdued level with the pale asphalt the tenacious prairie over which civilisation fought her hubdeep way to the west and with asphalt and concrete they fight the prairie back every building season next came the showhouses built by rich men with an eye to the honour and glory of their city which is the first obligation of wealth in a new land  we twisted and turned among broad clean treelined sunlit boulevards and avenues all sluiced down with an air that forbade any thought of fatigue and talked of city government and municipal taxation till in a certain silence we were shown a suburb of uncaredfor houses shops and banks whose sides and corners were rubbed greasy by the shoulders of loafers dirt and tin cans lay about the street yet it was not the squalor of poverty so much as the lack of instinct to keep clean one race prefers to inhabit there  next a glimpse of a cold white cathedral redbrick schools almost as big thank goodness as some convents hospitals institutions a mile or so of shops and then a most familiarfeeling lunch at a club which would have amazed my englishman at montreal where men not yet old talked of fort garry as they remembered it and tales of the founding of the city of early administrative shifts and accidents mingled with the younger mens prophecies and frivolities  there are a few places still left where men can handle big things with a light touch and take more for granted in five minutes than an englishman at home could puzzle out in a year but one would not meet many english at a lunch in a london club who took the contract for building london wall or helped bully king john into signing magna charta  i had two views of the cityone on a gray day from the roof of a monster building whence it seemed to overflow and fill with noises the whole vast cup of the horizon and still all round its edge jets of steam and the impatient cries of machinery showed it was eating out into the prairie like a smothered fire  the other picture was a silhouette of the citys flank mysterious as a line of unexplored cliffs under a sky crimsonbarred from the zenith to the ground where it lay pale emerald behind the uneven ramparts as our train halted in the last of the dusk and the rails glowed dull red i caught the deep surge of it and seven miles across the purple levels saw the low restless aurora of its lights it is rather an awesome thing to listen to a vanguard of civilisation talking to itself in the night in the same tone as a thousandyearold city  all the country hereabouts is riddled with railways for business and pleasure undreamed of fifteen years ago and it was a long time before we reached the clear prairie of air and space and open land the air is different from any air that ever blew the space is ampler than most spaces because it runs back to the unhampered pole and the open land keeps the secret of its magic as closely as the sea or the desert  people here do not stumble against each other around corners but see largely and tranquilly from a long way off what they desire or wish to avoid and they shape their path accordingly across the waves and troughs and tongues and dips and fans of the land  when mere space and the stoop of the high sky begin to overwhelm earth provides little ponds and lakes lying in softflanked hollows where people can step down out of the floods of air and delight themselves with small and known distances most of the women i saw about the houses were down in the hollows and most of the men were on the crests and the flats once while we halted a woman drove straight down at us from the skyline along a golden path between black ploughed lands when the horse who managed affairs stopped at the cars she nodded mysteriously and showed us a very small baby in the hollow of her arm doubtless she was some exiled queen flying north to found a dynasty and establish a country the prairie makes everything wonderful  they were threshing the wheat on both sides or the track as far as the eye could see the smoke of the machines went up in orderly perspective alongside the mounds of chaffthus a machine a house a mound of chaff a stretch of wheat in stocksand then repeat the pattern over the next few degrees of longitude we ran through strings of nearly touching little towns where i remembered an occasional shack and through big towns once represented by a nameboard a siding and two troopers of the northwest police in those days men proved that wheat would not grow north of some fools line or other or if it did that no one would grow it and now the wheat was marching with us as far as the eye could reach the railways were out two three hundred miles north peopling a new wheat country and north of that again the grand trunk was laying down a suburban extension of a few thousand miles across the continent with branches perhaps to dawson city certainly to hudson bay  come north and look cried the afrites of the railway youre only on the fringe of it here i preferred to keep the old road and to gape at miracles accomplished since my day the old falsefronted hollowstomached western hotels were gone their places filled by fivestorey brick or stone ones with post offices to match occasionally some overlooked fragment of the past still cleaved to a town and marked it for an old acquaintance but often one had to get a mile away and look back on a placeas one holds a palimpsest up against the lightto identify the long overlaid lines of the beginnings each town supplied the big farming country behind it and each town school carried the union jack on a flagstaff in its playground so far as one could understand the scholars are taught neither to hate nor despise nor beg from their own country  i whispered to a man that i was a little tired of a three days tyranny of wheat besides being shocked at farmers who used clean bright straw for fuel and made bonfires of their chaffhills youre way behind the times said he theres fruit and dairying and any quantity of mixed farming going forward all aroundlet alone irrigation further west wheats not our only king by a long sight wait till you strike such and such a place it was there i met a prophet and a preacher in the shape of a commissioner of the local board of trade all towns have them who firmly showed me the vegetables which his district produced they were vegetables tooall neatly staged in a little kiosk near the station  i think the pious thomas tusser would have loved that man providence said he shedding pamphlets at every gesture did not intend everlasting wheat in this section no sir our business is to keep ahead of providenceto meet her with mixed farming are you interested in mixed farming psha too bad you missed our fruit and vegetable show it draws people together mixed farming does i dont say wheat is narrowing to the outlook but i claim theres more sociability and money in mixed farming weve been hypnotised by wheat and cattle nowthe cars wont start yet awhileill just tell you my ideas  for fifteen glorious minutes he gave me condensed essence of mixed farming with excursions into sugarbeet did you know they are making sugar in alberta and he talked of farmyard muck our dark mother of all things with proper devotion  what we want now he cried in farewell is menmore men yes and women  they need women sorely for domestic help to meet the mad rush of work at harvest timemaids who will help in house dairy and chickenrun till they are married  a steady tide sets that way already one contented settler recruiting others from england but if a tenth of that energy wasted on social reform could be diverted to decently thought out and supervised emigration work labour does not yet object to people working on the land we might do something worth talking about the races which work and do not form committees are going into the country at least as fast as ours it makes one jealous and afraid to watch aliens taking and taking honestly so much of this treasure of good fortune and sane living  there was a town down the road which i had first heard discussed nigh twenty years ago by a brokendown prospector in a boxcar young feller said he after he had made a professional prophecy youll hear of that town if you live shes born lucky  i saw the town laterit was a siding by a trestle bridge where indians sold beadworkand as years passed i gathered that the old tramps prophecy had come true and that luck of some kind had struck the little town by the big river so this trip i stopped to make sure it was a beautiful town of six thousand people and a railway junction beside a highgirdered iron bridge there was a public garden with trees at the station a company of joyous men and women whom that air and that light and their own goodwill made our brothers and sisters came along in motors and gave us such a day as never was  what about the luck i asked  heavens said one havent you heard about our natural gasthe greatest natural gas in the world oh come and see  i was whirled off to a roundhouse full of engines and machineryshops worked by natural gas which comes out of the earth smelling slightly of fried onions at a pressure of six hundred pounds and by valves and taps is reduced to four pounds there was luck enough to make a metropolis imagine a citys heating and lightto say nothing of powerlaid on at no greater expense than that of piping  are there any limits to the possibilities of it i demanded  who knows were only at the beginning well show you a brickmaking plant out on the prairie run by gas but just now we want to show you one of our pet farms  away swooped the motors like swallows over roads any width you please and up on to what looked like the high veldt itself a major of the mounted police who had done a year at the boer war told us how the ostrichfarm fencing and the little meercats sitting up and racing about south africa had made him homesick for the sight of the gophers by the wayside and the endless panels of wire fencing along which we rushed the prairie has nothing to learn from the veldt about fencing or tricky gates  after all said the major theres no country to touch this ive had thirty years of itfrom one end to the other  then they pointed out all the quarters of the horizonsay fifty miles wherever you turnedand gave them names  the show farmer had taken his folk to church but we friendly slipped through his gates and reached the silent spickandspan house with its trim barn and a vast mound of coppercoloured wheat piled in the sun between two mounds of golden chaff every one thumbed a sample of it and passed judgmentit must have been worth a few hundred golden sovereigns as it lay out on the veldtand we sat around on the farm machinery and in the hush that a shutup house always imposes we seemed to hear the lavish earth getting ready for new harvests there was no true wind but a push as it were of the whole crystal atmosphere  now for the brickfield they cried it was many miles off the road fed by a nevertobeforgotten drop to a river broad as the orange at norvals pont rustling between mud hills an old scotchman in the very likeness of charon with big hip boots controlled a pontoon which sagged back and forth by current on a wire rope the reckless motors bumped on to this ferry through a foot of water and charon who never relaxed bore us statelily across the dark broad river to the further bank where we all turned to look at the lucky little town and discuss its possibilities  i think you can see it best from here said one  no from here said another and their voices softened on the very name of it  then for an hour we raced over true prairie great yellowgreen plains crossed by old buffalo trails which do not improve motor springs till a single chimney broke the horizon like a mast at sea and thereby were more lighthearted men and women a shed and a tent or two for workmen the ribs and frames of the brickmaking mechanism a fifteen foot square shaft sunk sixty foot down to the clay and stark and black the pipe of a naturalgas well the rest was prairiethe mere curve of the earthwith little grey birds calling  i thought it could not have been simpler more audacious or more impressive till i saw some women in pretty frocks go up and peer at the hissing gasvalves  we fancied that it might amuse you said all those merry people and between laughter and digressions they talked over projects for building first their own and next other cities in brick of all sorts giving figures of output and expenses of plant that made one gasp to the eye the affair was no more than a novel or delicious picnic what it actually meant was a committee to change the material of civilisation for a hundred miles around i felt as though i were assisting at the planning of nineveh and whatever of good comes to the little town that was born lucky i shall always claim a share  but there is no space to tell how we fed with a prairie appetite in the mens quarters on a meal prepared by an artist how we raced home at speeds no child could ever hear of and no grownup should attempt how the motors squattered at the ford and took potshots at the pontoon till even charon smiled how great horses hauled the motors up the gravelly bank into the town how there we met people in their sunday best walking and driving and pulled ourselves together and looked virtuous and how the merry company suddenly and quietly evanished because they thought that their guests might be tired i can give you no notion of the pure irresponsible frolic of itof the almost affectionate kindness the gay and inventive hospitality that so delicately controlled the whole affairany more than i can describe a certain quiet halfhour in the dusk just before we left when the company gathered to say goodbye while young couples walked in the street and the glare of the neverextinguished naturalgas lamps coloured the leaves of the trees a stage green  it was a woman speaking out of the shadow who said what we all felt you see we just love our town  so do we i said and it slid behind us     mountains and the pacific   the prairie proper ends at calgary among the cattleranches mills breweries and three million acre irrigation works the river that floats timber to the town from the mountains does not slide nor rustle like prairie rivers but brawls across bars of blue pebbles and a greenish tinge in its water hints of the snows  what i saw of calgary was crowded into one lively halfhour motors were invented to run about new cities what i heard i picked up oddly enough weeks later from a young dane in the north sea he was qualmish but his saga of triumph upheld him  three years ago i come to canada by steeragethird class and i have the language to learn look at me i have now my own dairy business in calgary andlook at memy own half section that is three hundred and twenty acres all my land which is mine and now i come home first class for christmas here in denmark and i shall take out back with me some friends of mine which are farmers to farm on those irrigated lands near by calgary oh i tell you there is nothing wrong with canada for a man which works  and will your friends go i inquired  you bet they will it is all arranged already i bet they get ready to go now already and in three years they will come back for christmas here in denmark first class like me  then you think calgary is going ahead  you bet we are only at the beginning of things look at me chickens i raise chickens also in calgary etc etc  after all this pageant of unrelieved material prosperity it was a rest to get to the stillness of the big foothills though they too had been inspanned for the work of civilisation the timber off their sides was ducking and pitchpoling down their swift streams to be sawn into housestuff for all the world the woodwork of a purely english villa may come from as many imperial sources as its owners income  the train crept whistling to keep its heart up through the winding gateways of the hills till it presented itself very humbly before the true mountains the not so little brothers to the himalayas mountains of the pinecloaked snowcapped breed are unchristian things  men mine into the flanks of some of them and trust to modern science to pull them through not long ago a mountain kneeled on a little mining village as an angry elephant kneels but it did not get up again and the half of that camp was no more seen on earth the other half still standsuninhabited the heathen in his blindness would have made arrangements with the genius of the place before he ever drove a pick there as a learned scholar of a littleknown university once observed to an engineer officer on the himalayatibet roadyou white men gain nothing by not noticing what you cannot see you fall off the road or the road falls on you and you die and you think it all an accident how much wiser it was when we were allowed to sacrifice a man officially sir before making bridges or other public works then the local gods were officially recognised sir and did not give any more trouble and the local workmen sir were much pleased with these precautions  there are many local gods on the road through the rockies old bald mountains that have parted with every shred of verdure and stand wrapped in sheets of wrinkled silver rock over which the sight travels slowly as in delirium mad horned mountains wreathed with dancing mists lowbrowed and bentshouldered faquirs of the wayside sitting in meditation beneath a burden of glacierice that thickens every year and mountains of fair aspect on one side but on the other seamed with hollow sunless clefts where last years snow is blackened with this years dirt and smoke of forestfires the drip from it seeps away through slopes of unstable gravel and dirt till at the appointed season the whole halfmile of undermined talus slips and roars into the horrified valley  the railway winds in and out among them with little inexplicable deviations and sidetwists much as a buck walks through a forestglade sidling and crossing uneasily in what appears to be a plain way only when the track has rounded another shoulder or two a backward and upward glance at some menacing slope shows why the train did not take the easierlooking road on the other side of the gorge  from time to time the mountains lean apart and nurse between them some golden valley of slow streams fat pastures and parklike uplands with a little town and cow bells tinkling among berry bushes and children who have never seen the sun rise or set shouting at the trains and real gardens round the houses  at calgary it was a frost and the dahlias were dead a day later nasturtiums bloomed untouched beside the station platforms and the air was heavy and liquid with the breath of the pacific one felt the spirit of the land change with the changing outline of the hills till on the lower levels by the fraser it seemed that even the sussex downs must be nearer at heart to the prairie than british columbia the prairie people notice the difference and the hill people unwisely i think insist on it perhaps the magic may lie in the scent of strange evergreens and mosses not known outside the ranges or it may strike from wall to wall of timeless rifts and gorges but it seemed to me to draw out of the great sea that washes further asiathe asia of allied mountains mines and forests  we rested one day high up in the rockies to visit a lake carved out of pure jade whose property is to colour every reflection on its bosom to its own tint a belt of brown dead timber on a gravel scar showed upside down like sombre cypresses rising from green turf and the reflected snows were pale green in summer many tourists go there but we saw nothing except the wonderworking lake lying mute in its circle of forest where red and orange lichens grew among grey and blue moss and we heard nothing except the noise of its outfall hurrying through a jam of bonewhite logs the thing might have belonged to tibet or some unexplored valley behind kinchinjunga it had no concern with the west  as we drove along the narrow hillroad a piebald packpony with a chinablue eye came round a bend followed by two women blackhaired bareheaded wearing beadwork squawjackets and riding straddle a string of packponies trotted through the pines behind them  indians on the move said i how characteristic  as the women jolted by one of them very slightly turned her eyes and they were past any doubt the comprehending equal eyes of the civilised white woman which moved in that berrybrown face  yes said our driver when the cavalcade had navigated the next curve thatll be mrs soandso and miss soandso they mostly camp hereabout for three months every year i reckon theyre coming in to the railroad before the snow falls  and whereabout do they go i asked  oh all about anywheres if you mean where they come from just nowthats the trail yonder  he pointed to a haircrack across the face of a mountain and i took his word for it that it was a safe ponytrail the same evening at an hotel of all the luxuries a slight woman in a very pretty evening frock was turning over photographs and the eyes beneath the strictlyarranged hair were the eyes of the woman in the beadwork jacket who had quirted the piebald packpony past our buggy  praised be allah for the diversity of his creatures but do you know any other country where two women could go out for a three months trek and shoot in perfect comfort and safety  these mountains are only ten days from london and people more and more use them for pleasuregrounds other and most unthoughtof persons buy little fruitfarms in british columbia as an excuse for a yearly visit to the beautiful land and they tempt yet more people from england this is apart from the regular tide of emigration and serves to make the land known if you asked a stateowned railway to gamble on the chance of drawing tourists the commissioner of railways would prove to you that the experiment could never succeed and that it was wrong to risk the taxpayers money in erecting firstclass hotels yet south africa could even now be made a tourists placeif only the railroads and steamship lines had faith  on thinking things over i suspect i was not intended to appreciate the merits of british columbia too highly maybe i misjudged maybe she was purposely misrepresented but i seemed to hear more about problems and crises and situations in her borders than anywhere else so far as eye or ear could gather the one urgent problem was to find enough men and women to do the work in hand  lumber coal minerals fisheries fit soil for fruit dairy and poultry farms are all there in a superb climate the natural beauty of earth and sky match these lavish gifts to which are added thousands of miles of safe and sheltered waterways for coastal trade deep harbours that need no dredge the groundworks of immense and icefree portsall the titledeeds to half the trade of asia for the peoples pleasure and good disport salmon trout quail and pheasant play in front of and through the suburbs of her capitals a little axework and roadmetalling gives a city one of the loveliest watergirt parks that we have outside the tropics another town is presented with a hundred islands knolls wooded coves stretches of beach and dingles laid down as expressly for camplife picnics and boating parties beneath skies never too hot and rarely too cold if they care to lift up their eyes from their almost subtropical gardens they can behold snowy peaks across blue bays which must be good for the soul though they face a sea out of which any portent may arise they are not forced to protect or even to police its waters they are as ignorant of drouth murrain pestilence locusts and blight as they are of the true meaning of want and fear  such a land is good for an energetic man it is also not so bad for the loafer i was as i have told you instructed on its drawbacks i was to understand that there was no certainty in any employment and that a man who earned immense wages for six months of the year would have to be kept by the community if he fell out of work for the other six i was not to be deceived by golden pictures set before me by interested parties that is to say by almost every one i met and i was to give due weight to the difficulties and discouragements that beset the intending immigrant were i an intending immigrant i would risk a good deal of discomfort to get on to the land in british columbia and were i rich with no attachments outside england i would swiftly buy me a farm or a house in that country for the mere joy of it  i forgot those doleful and unhumorous conspirators among people who fervently believed in the place but afterwards the memory left a bad taste in my mouth cities like women cannot be too careful what sort of men they allow to talk about them  time had changed vancouver literally out of all knowledge from the station to the suburbs and back to the wharves every step was strange and where i remembered open spaces and still untouched timber the tramcars were fleeting people out to a lacrosse game vancouver is an aged city for only a few days previous to my arrival the vancouver babyie the first child born in vancouverhad been married  a steameronce familiar in table bayhad landed a few hundred sikhs and punjabi jatsto each man his bundleand the little groups walked uneasy alone keeping for many of them had been soldiers to the military step yes they said they had come to this country to get work news had reached their villages that work at great wages was to be had in this country their brethren who had gone before had sent them the news yes and sometimes the money for the passage out the money would be paid back from the sogreat wages to come with interest assuredly with interest did men lend money for nothing in any country they were waiting for their brethren to come and show them where to eat and later how to work meanwhile this was a new country how could they say anything about it no it was not like gurgaon or shahpur or jullundur the sickness plague had come to all these places it had come into the punjab by every road and manymanymany had died the crops too had failed in some districts hearing the news about these sogreat wages they had taken ship for the bellys sakefor the moneys sakefor the childrens sake  would they go back again  they grinned as they nudged each other the sahib had not quite understood they had come over for the sake of the moneythe rupees no the dollars the punjab was their home where their villages lay where their people were waiting without doubtwithout doubtthey would go back then came the brethren already working in the millscosmopolitans dressed in readymade clothes and smoking cigarettes  this way o you people they cried the bundles were reshouldered and the turbaned knots melted away the last words i caught were true sikh talk but what about the money o my brother  some punjabis have found out that money can be too dearly bought  there was a sikh in a sawmill had been driver in a mountain battery at home himself he was from amritsar oh pleasant as cold water in a thirsty land is the sound of a familiar name in a fair country  but you had your pension why did you come here  heavenborn because my sense was little and there was also the sickness at amritsar  the historian a hundred years hence will be able to write a book on economic changes brought about by pestilence there is a very interesting study somewhere of the social and commercial effects of the black death in england  on a wharf waiting for a steamer some thirty sikhs many of them wearing their old uniforms which should not be allowed were talking at the tops of their voices so that the shed rang like an indian railway station a suggestion that if they spoke lower life would be easier was instantly adopted then a senior officer with a british india medal asked hopefully has the sahib any orders where we are to go  alas he had nonenothing but goodwill and greetings for the sons of the khalsa and they tramped off in fours  it is said that when the little riot broke out in vancouver these heathen were invited by other asiatics to join in defending themselves against the white man they refused on the ground that they were subjects of the king i wonder what tales they sent back to their villages and where and how fully every detail of the affair was talked over white men forget that no part of the empire can live or die to itself  here is a rather comic illustration of this on the material side the wonderful waters between vancouver and victoria are full of whales leaping and rejoicing in the strong blue all about the steamer there is therefore a whalery on an island near by and i had the luck to travel with one of the shareholders  whales are beautiful beasts he said affectionately weve a contract with a scotch firm for every barrel of oil we can deliver for years ahead its reckoned the best for harnessdressing  he went on to tell me how a swift ship goes hunting whales with a bombgun and explodes shells into their insides so that they perish at once  all the old harpoon and boat business would take till the cows come home we kill em right off  and how dyou strip em  it seemed that the expeditious ship carried also a large airpump and pumped up the carcass to float roundly till she could attend to it at the end of her days kill she would return towing sometimes as many as four inflated whales to the whalery which is a factory full of modern appliances the whales are hauled up inclined planes like logs to a sawmill and as much of them as will not make oil for the scotch leatherdresser or cannot be dried for the japanese market is converted into potent manure  no manure can touch ours said the shareholder its so rich in bone dyou see the only thing that has beat us up to date is their hides but weve fixed up a patent process now for turning em into floorcloth yes theyre beautiful beasts that fellow he pointed to a black hump in a wreath of spray would cut up a miracle  if you go on like this you wont have any whales left i said  that is so but the concern pays thirty per cent anda few years back no one believed in it  i forgave him everything for the last sentence     a conclusion   canada possesses two pillars of strength and beauty in quebec and victoria the former ranks by herself among those mothercities of whom none can say this reminds me to realise victoria you must take all that the eye admires most in bournemouth torquay the isle of wight the happy valley at hongkong the doon sorrento and camps bay add reminiscences of the thousand islands and arrange the whole round the bay of naples with some himalayas for the background  real estate agents recommend it as a little piece of englandthe island on which it stands is about the size of great britainbut no england is set in any such seas or so fully charged with the mystery of the larger ocean beyond the high still twilights along the beaches are out of the old east just under the curve of the world and even in october the sun rises warm from the first earth sky and water wait outside every mans door to drag him out to play if he looks up from his work and though some other cities in the dominion do not quite understand this immoral mood of nature men who have made their money in them go off to victoria and with the zeal of converts preach and preserve its beauties  we went to look at a marine junkstore which had once been esquimalt a station of the british navy it was reached through winding roads lovelier than english lanes along watersides and parkways any one of which would have made the fortune of a town  most cities a man said suddenly lay out their roads at right angles we do in the business quarters what dyou think  i fancy some of those big cities will have to spend millions on curved roads some day for the sake of a change i said youve got what no money can buy  thats what the men tell us who come to live in victoria and theyve had experience  it is pleasant to think of the western millionaire hot from some gridiron of rectangular civilisation confirming good victorians in the policy of changing vistas and restful curves  there is a view when the morning mists peel off the harbour where the steamers tie up or the houses of parliament on one hand and a huge hotel on the other which as an example of cunninglyfittedin waterfronts and facades is worth a very long journey the hotel was just being finished the ladies drawingroom perhaps a hundred feet by forty carried an arched and superbly enriched plaster ceiling of knops and arabesques and interlacings which somehow seemed familiar  we saw a photo of it in country life the contractor explained it seemed just what the room needed so one of our plasterers a frenchmanthats himtook and copied it it comes in all right doesnt it  about the time the noble original was put up in england drake might have been sailing somewhere off this very coast so you see victoria lawfully holds the copyright  i tried honestly to render something of the colour the gaiety and the graciousness of the town and the island but only found myself piling up unbelievable adjectives and so let it go with a hundred other wonders and repented that i had wasted my time and yours on the anxiouseyed gentlemen who talked of drawbacks a verse cut out of a newspaper seems to sum up their attitude    as the land of little leisure   is the place where things are done   so the land of scanty pleasure   is the place for lots of fun   in the land of plenty trouble   people laugh as people should   but theres some one always kicking   in the land of heap too good  at every step of my journey people assured me that i had seen nothing of canada silent mining men from the north fruitfarmers from the okanagan valley foremen of railway gangs not so long from english public schools the oldest inhabitant of the town of villeneuve aged twentyeight certain english who lived on the prairie and contrived to get fun and good fellowship as well as money the singleminded wheatgrowers and cattlemen election agents police troopers expansive in the dusk of wayside halts officials dependent on the popular will who talked as delicately as they walked and queer souls who did not speak english and said so loudly in the diningcareach in his or her own way gave me to understand this my excursion bore the same relation to their country as a busride down the strand bears to london so i knew how they felt  the excuse is that our own flesh and blood are more interesting than anybody else and i held by birth the same right in them and their lives as they held in any other part of the empire because they had become a people within the empire my right was admitted and no word spoken which would not have been the case a few years ago one may mistake many signs on the road but there is no mistaking the spirit of sane and realised nationality which fills the land from end to end precisely as the joyous hum of a big dynamo well settled to its load makes a background to all the other shop noises for many reasons that spirit came late but since it has come after the day of little things doubts and open or veiled contempts there is less danger that it will go astray among the boundless wealth and luxury that await it the people the schools the churches the press in its degree and above all the women understand without manifestoes that their land must now as always abide under the law in deed and in word and in thought this is their castemark the ark of their covenant their reason for being what they are in the big cities with their villagelike lists of police court offences in the wideopen little western towns where the present is as free as the lives and the future as safe as the property of their inhabitants in the coast cities galled and humiliated at their one nights riot its not our habit sir its not our habit up among the mountains where the officers of the law track and carefully bring into justice the astounded malefactor and behind the orderly prairies to the barren grounds as far as a single white man can walk the relentless spirit of the breed follows up and oversees and controls it does not much express itself in words but sometimes in intimate discussion one is privileged to catch a glimpse of the inner fires they burn hotly  we do not mean to be decivilised said the first man with whom i talked about it  that was the answer throughoutthe keynote and the explanation  otherwise the canadians are as human as the rest of us to evade or deny a plain issue the duty of developing their country is always present but when it comes to taking thought better thought for her defence they refuge behind loose words and childish anticipations of miraclesquite in the best imperial manner all admit that canada is wealthy few that she is weak still fewer that unsupported she would very soon cease to exist as a nation the anxious inquirer is told that she does her duty towards england by developing her resources that wages are so high a paid army is out of the question that she is really maturing splendid defence schemes but must not be hurried or dictated to that a little wise diplomacy is all that will ever be needed in this so civilised era that when the evil day comes something will happen it certainly will the whole concluding very often with a fervent essay on the immorality of war all about as much to the point as carrying a dove through the streets to allay pestilence  the question before canada is not what she thinks or pays but what an enemy may think it necessary to make her pay if she continues wealthy and remains weak she will surely be attacked under one pretext or another then she will go under and her spirit will return to the dust with her flag as it slides down the halliards  that is absurd is always the quick answer in her own interests england could never permit it what you speak of presupposes the fall of england  not necessarily nothing worse than a stumble by the way but when england stumbles the empire shakes canadas weakness is lack of men englands weakness is an excess of voters who propose to live at the expense of the state these loudly resent that any money should be diverted from themselves and since money is spent on fleets and armies to protect the empire while it is consolidating they argue that if the empire ceased to exist armaments would cease too and the money so saved could be spent on their creature comforts they pride themselves on being an avowed and organised enemy of the empire which as others see it waits only to give them health prosperity and power beyond anything their votes could win them in england but their leaders need their votes in england as they need their outcries and discomforts to help them in their municipal and parliamentary careers no engineer lowers steam in his own boilers  so they are told little except evil of the great heritage outside and are kept compounded in cities under promise of free rations and amusements if the empire were threatened they would not in their own interests urge england to spend men and money on it consequently it might be well if the nations within the empire were strong enough to endure a little battering unaided at the first outsettill such time that is as england were permitted to move to their help  for this end an influx of good men is needed more urgently every year during which peace holdsmen loyal clean and experienced in citizenship with women not ignorant of sacrifice  here the gentlemen who propose to be kept by their neighbours are our helpful allies they have succeeded in making uneasy the class immediately above them which is the english working class as yet undebauched by the temptation of stateaided idleness or stateguaranteed irresponsibility england has millions of such silent careful folk accustomed even yet to provide for their own offspring to bring them up in a resolute fear of god and to desire no more than the reward of their own labours a few years ago this class would not have cared to shift now they feel the general disquiet they live close to it teaandsugar borrowing friends have told them jocularly or with threats of a good time coming when things will go hard with the uncheerful giver the prospect appeals neither to their reason nor to their savings bank books they hearthey do not need to readthe speeches delivered in their streets on a sunday morning it is one of their preoccupations to send their children to sunday school by roundabout roads lest they should pick up abominable blasphemies when the tills of the little shops are raided or when the family neerdowell levies on his women with more than usual brutality they know because they suffer what principles are being put into practice if these people could quietly be shown a quiet way out of it all very many of them would call in their savings they are richer than they look and slip quietly away in the english country as well as in the towns there is a feelingnot yet panic but the dull edge of itthat the future will be none too rosy for such as are working or are in the habit of working this is all to our advantage  canada can best serve her own interests and those of the empire by systematically exploiting this new recruitingground now that south africa with the exception of rhodesia has been paralysed and australia has not yet learned the things which belong to her peace canada has the chance of the century to attract good men and capital into the dominion but the men are much more important than the money they may not at first be as clever with the hoe as the bessarabian or the bokhariot or whatever the fashionable breed is but they have qualities of pluck good humour and a certain wellwearing virtue which are not altogether bad they will not hold aloof from the life of the land nor pray in unknown tongues to byzantine saints while the very tenacity and caution which made them cleave to england this long help them to root deeply elsewhere they are more likely to bring their women than other classes and those women will make sacred and individual homes a littleregarded crown colony has a proverb that no district can be called settled till there are pots of musk in the housewindowssure sign that an english family has come to stay it is not certain how much of the present steamerdumped foreign population has any such idea we have seen a financial panic in one country send whole army corps of aliens kiting back to the lands whose allegiance they forswore what would they or their likes do in time of real stress since no instinct in their bodies or their souls would call them to stand by till the storm were over  surely the conclusion of the whole matter throughout the whole empire must be men and women of our own stock habits language and hopes brought in by every possible means under a wellsettled policy time will not be allowed us to multiply to unquestionable peace but by drawing upon england we can swiftly transfuse what we need of her strength into her veins and by that operation bleed her into health and sanity meantime the only serious enemy to the empire within or without is that very democracy which depends on the empire for its proper comforts and in whose behalf these things are urged   egypt of the magicians  1913  sea travel a return to the east a serpent of old nile up the river dead kings the face of the desert the riddle of empire  and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantmentsexodus vii 22     i   sea travel  i had left europe for no reason except to discover the sun and there were rumours that he was to be found in egypt  but i had not realised what more i should find there  a p  o boat carried us out of marseilles a serang of lascars with whistle chain shawl and fluttering blue clothes was at work on the baggagehatch somebody bungled at the winch the serang called him a name unlovely in itself but awakening delightful memories in the hearer  o serang is that man a fool  very foolish sahib he comes from surat he only comes for his foods sake  the serang grinned the surtee man grinned the winch began again and the voices that called lower away stop her were as familiar as the friendly whiff from the lascars galley or the slap of bare feet along the deck but for the passage of a few impertinent years i should have gone without hesitation to share their rice serangs used to be very kind to little white children below the age of caste most familiar of all was the ship itself it had slipped my memory nor was there anything in the rates charged to remind me that singlescrews still lingered in the giltedged passenger trade  some north atlantic passengers accustomed to real ships made the discovery and were as pleased about it as american tourists at stratfordonavon  oh come and see they cried she has one screwonly one screw hear her thump and have you seen their old barn of a saloon and the officers library its open for two halfhours a day weekdays and one on sundays you pay a dollar and a quarter deposit on each book we wouldnt have missed this trip for anything its like sailing with columbus  they wandered aboutvoluble amazed and happy for they were getting off at port said  i explored too from the roughironed tablelinen the thick toothglasses for the drinks the slummocky setout of victuals at meals to the unaccommodating regulations in the curtainless cabin where they had not yet arrived at bunkedge trays for morning tea time and progress had stood still with the p  o to be just there were electricfan fittings in the cabins but the fans were charged extra and there was a rumour unverified that one could eat on deck or in ones cabin without a medical certificate from the doctor all the rest was under the old motto quis separabitthis is quite separate from other lines  after all said an angloindian whom i was telling about civilised ocean travel they dont want you egyptian trippers theyre sure of us because and he gave me many strong reasons connected with leave finance the absence of competition and the ownership of the bombay foreshore  but its absurd i insisted the whole concern is out of date theres a notice on my deck forbidding smoking and the use of naked lights and theres a lascar messing about the holdhatch outside my cabin with a candle in a lantern  meantime our onescrew tub thumped gingerly toward port said because we had no mails aboard and the mediterranean exhausted after severe february hysterics lay out like oil  i had some talk with a scotch quartermaster who complained that lascars are not what they used to be owing to their habit but it has existed since the beginning of signing on as a clan or familyall sorts together  the serang said that for his part he had noticed no difference in twenty years men are always of many kinds sahib and that is because god makes men this and that not all one patternnot by any means all one pattern he told me too that wages were rising but the price of ghee rice and currystuffs was up too which was bad for wives and families at porbandar and that also is thus and no talk makes it otherwise after suez he would have blossomed into thin clothes and long talks but the bitter spring chill nipped him as the thought of partings just accomplished and work just ahead chilled the angloindian contingent little by little one came at the outlines of the old storiesa sick wife left behind here a boy there a daughter at school a very small daughter trusted to friends or hirelings certain separation for so many years and no great hope or delight in the future it was not a nice india that the tales hinted at here is one that explains a great deal  there was a pathan a mohammedan in a hindu village employed by the village moneylender as a debtcollector which is not a popular trade he lived alone among hindus andso ran the charge in the lower courthe wilfully broke the caste of a hindu villager by forcing on him forbidden mussulman food and when that pious villager would have taken him before the headman to make reparation the godless one drew his afghan knife and killed the headman besides wounding a few others the evidence ran without flaw as smoothly as wellarranged cases should and the pathan was condemned to death for wilful murder he appealed and by some arrangement or other got leave to state his case personally to the court of revision said i believe that he did not much trust lawyers but that if the sahibs would give him a hearing as man to man he might have a run for his money  out of the jail then he came and pathanlike not content with his own good facts must needs begin by some fairytale that he was a secret agent of the government sent down to spy on that village then he warmed to it yes he was that moneylenders agenta persuader of the reluctant if you likeworking for a hindu employer naturally many men owed him grudges a lot of the evidence against him was quite true but the prosecution had twisted it abominably about that knife for instance true he had a knife in his hand exactly as they had alleged but why because with that very knife he was cutting up and distributing a roast sheep which he had given as a feast to the villagers at that feast he sitting in amity with all his world the village rose up at the word of command laid hands on him and dragged him off to the headmans house how could he have broken any mans caste when they were all eating his sheep and in the courtyard of the headmans house they surrounded him with heavy sticks and worked themselves into anger against him each man exciting his neighbour he was a pathan he knew what that sort of talk meant a man cannot collect debts without making enemies so he warned them again and again he warned them saying leave me alone do not lay hands on me but the trouble grew worse and he saw it was intended that he should be clubbed to death like a jackal in a drain then he said if blows are struck i strike and i strike to kill because i am a pathan but the blows were struck heavy ones therefore with the very afghan knife that had cut up the mutton he struck the headman had you meant to kill the headman assuredly i am a pathan when i strike i strike to kill i had warned them again and again i think i got him in the liver he died and that is all there is to it sahibs it was my life or theirs they would have taken mine over my freely given meats now whatll you do with me  in the long run he got several years for culpable homicide  but said i when the tale had been told whatever made the lower court accept all that village evidence it was too good on the face of it  the lower court said it could not believe it possible that so many respectable native gentle could have banded themselves together to tell a lie  oh had the lower court been long in the country  it was a native judge was the reply  if you think this over in all its bearings you will see that the lower court was absolutely sincere was not the lower court itself a product of western civilisation and as such bound to play upto pretend to think along western linestranslating each grade of indian village society into its english equivalent and ruling as an english judge would have ruled pathans and incidentally english officials must look after themselves  there is a fell disease of this century called snobbery of the soul its germ has been virulently developed in modern cultures from the uncomplex bacillus isolated sixty years ago by the late william makepeace thackeray precisely as major ponto with his plated dishes and stableboy masquerading as footman lied to himself and his guests sobut the book of snobs can only be brought up to date by him who wrote it  then a man struck in from the sudanfar and far to the southwith a story of a discomposed judge and a much too collected prisoner  to the great bazaars of omdurman where all things are sold came a young man from the uttermost deserts of somewhere or other and heard a gramophone life was of no value to him till he had bought the creature he took it back to his village and at twilight set it going among his ravished friends his father sheik of the village came also listened to the loud shoutings without breath the strong music lacking musicians and said justly enough this thing is a devil you must not bring devils into my village lock it up  they waited until he had gone away and then began another tune a second time the sheik came repeated the command and added that if the singing box was heard again he would slay the buyer but their curiosity and joy defied even this and for the third time late at night they slipped in pin and record and let the djinn rave so the sheik with his rifle shot his son as he had promised and the english judge before whom he eventually came had all the trouble in the world to save that earnest gray head from the gallows thus  now old man you must say guilty or not guilty  but i shot him that is why i am here i  hush it is a form of words which the law asks sotte voce write down that the old idiot doesnt understand be still now  but i shot him what else could i have done he bought a devil in a box and  quiet that comes later leave talking  but i am sheik of the village one must not bring devils into a village i said i would shoot him  this matter is in the hands of the law i judge  what need i shot him suppose that your son had brought a devil in a box to your village  they explained to him at last that under british rule fathers must hand over devildealing children to be shot by the white men the first step you see on the downward path of state aid and that he must go to prison for several months for interfering with a government shoot  we are a great race there was a pious young judge in nigeria once who kept a condemned prisoner waiting very many minutes while he hunted through the hausa dictionary word by word for maygodhavemercyonyoursoul  and i heard another taleabout the suez canal this timea hint of what may happen some day at panama there was a tramp steamer loaded with high explosives on her way to the east and at the far end of the canal one of the sailors very naturally upset a lamp in the focsle after a heated interval the crew took to the desert alongside while the captain and the mate opened all cocks and sank her not in the fairway but up against a bank just leaving room for a steamer to squeeze past then the canal authorities wired to her charterers to know exactly what there might be in her and it is said that the reply kept them awake of nights for it was their business to blow her up  meantime traffic had to go through and a p  o steamer came along there was the canal there was the sunken wreck marked by one elderly arab in a little boat with a red flag and there was about five foot clearance on each side for the p  o she went through atiptoe because even fifty tons of dynamite will jar a boat perceptibly and the tramp held morevery much more not to mention detonators by some absurd chance almost the only passenger who knew about the thing at the time was an old lady rather proud of the secret  ah she said in the middle of that agonised glide you may depend upon it that if everybody knew what i know theyd all be on the other side of the ship  later on the authorities blew up the tramp with infinite precautions from some two miles off for which reason she neither destroyed the suez canal nor dislocated the sweet water canal alongside but merely dug out a hole a hundred feet or a hundred yards deep and so vanished from lloyds register  but no stories could divert one long from the peculiarities of that amazing line which exists strictly for itself there was a bathroom occupied at the windy end of an open alleyway in due time the bather came out  said the steward as he swabbed out the tub for his successor that was the chief engineer es been some time must ave ad a mucky job below this mornin  i have a great admiration for chief engineers they are men in authority needing all the comforts and aids that can possibly be given themsuch as bathrooms of their own close to their own cabins where they can clean off at leisure  it is not fair to mix them up with the ruck of passengers nor is it done on real ships nor when a passenger wants a bath in the evening do the stewards of real ships roll their eyes like vergers in a cathedral and say well see if it can be managed they double down the alleyway and shout matcham or ponting or guttman and in fifteen seconds one of those swift three has the taps going and the towels out real ships are not annexes of westminster abbey or borstal reformatory they supply decent accommodation in return for good money and i imagine that their directors instruct their staffs to look pleased while at work  some generations back there must have been an idea that the p  o was vastly superior to all lines afloata sort of semipontifical show not to be criticised how much of the notion was due to its own excellence and how much to its passengertraffic monopoly does not matter today it neither feeds nor tends its passengers nor keeps its ships well enough to put on any airs at all  for which reason human nature being what it is it surrounds itself with an ungracious atmosphere of absurd ritual to cover grudged and inadequate performance  what it really needs is to be dropped into a march north atlantic without any lascars and made to swim for its life between a cpr boat and a north german lloydtill it learns to smile     ii  a return to the east  the east is a much larger slice of the world than europeans care to admit some say it begins at st gothard where the smells of two continents meet and fight all through that terrible restaurantcar dinner in the tunnel others have found it at venice on warm april mornings but the east is wherever one sees the lateen sailthat sharks fin of a rig which for hundreds of years has dogged all white bathers round the mediterranean there is still a suggestion of menace a hint of piracy in the blood whenever the lateen goes by fishing or fruiting or coasting  this is not my ancestral trade she whispers to the accomplice sea if everybody had their rights i should be doing something quite different for my father he was the junk and my mother she was the dhow and between the two of em they made asia then she tacks disorderly but deadly quick and shuffles past the unimaginative steampacket with her hat over one eye and a knife as it were up her baggy sleeves  even the stoneboats at port said busied on jetty extensions show their untamed descent beneath their loaded clumsiness they are all children of the camelnosed dhow who is the mother of mischief but it was very good to meet them again in raw sunshine unchanged in any rope and patch  old port said had disappeared beneath acres of new buildings where one could walk at leisure without being turned back by soldiers  two or three landmarks remained two or three were reported as still in existence and one face showed itself after many yearsravaged but respectablerigidly respectable  yes said the face i have been here all the time but i have made money and when i die i am going home to be buried  why not go home before you are buried o face  because i have lived here so long home is only good to be buried in  and what do you do nowadays  nothing now i live on my rentesmy income  think of it to live icily in a perpetual cinematograph show of excited uneasy travellers to watch huge steamers sliding in and out all day and all night like railway trucks unknowing and unsought by a single soul aboard to talk five or six tongues indifferently but to have no countryno interest in any earth except one reservation in a continental cemetery  it was a cold evening after heavy rain and the halfflooded streets reeked but we undefeated tourists ran about in droves and saw all that could be seen before traintime we missed most of us the canal companys garden which happens to mark a certain dreadful and exact division between east and west  up to that pointit is a fringe of palms stiff against the skythe impetus of home memories and the echo of home interests carry the young man along very comfortably on his first journey but at suez one must face things people generally the most sympathetic leave the boat there the older men who are going on have discovered each other and begun to talk shop no newspapers come aboard only clipped reuter telegrams the world seems cruelly large and selfabsorbed one goes for a walk and finds this little bit of kept ground with comfortable gardengated houses on either side of the path then one begins to wonderin the twilight for choicewhen one will see those palms again from the other side then the black hour of homesickness vain regrets foolish promises and weak despair shuts down with the smell of strange earth and the cadence of strange tongues  crossroads and haltingplaces in the desert are always favoured by djinns and afrits the young man will find them waiting for him in the canal companys garden at port said  on the other hand if he is fortunate enough to have won the east by inheritance as there are families who served her for five or six generations he will meet no ghouls in that garden but a free and a friendly and an ample welcome from good spirits of the east that awaits him the voices of the gardeners and the watchmen will be as the greetings of his fathers servants in his fathers house the evening smells and the sight of the hibiscus and poinsettia will unlock his tongue in words and sentences that he thought he had clean forgotten and he will go back to the ship i have seen as a prince entering on his kingdom  there was a man in our companya young englishmanwho had just been granted his hearts desire in the shape of some raw district south of everything southerly in the sudan where on twothirds of a member of parliaments wage under conditions of life that would horrify a selfrespecting operative he will see perhaps some dozen white men in a year and will certainly pick up two sorts of fever he had been moved to work very hard for this billet by the representations of a friend in the same service who said that it was a rather decent sort of service and he was all of a heat to reach khartum report for duty and fall to if he is lucky he may get a district where the people are so virtuous that they do not know how to wear any clothes at all and so ignorant that they have never yet come across strong drink  the train that took us to cairo was own sister in looks and fittings to any south african trainfor which i loved herbut she was a trial to some citizens of the united states who being used to the pullman did not understand the sidecorridored solidcompartment idea the trouble with a standardised democracy seems to be that once they break loose from their standards they have no props people are not left behind and luggage is rarely mislaid on the railroads of the older world there is an ordained ritual for the handling of all things to which if a man will only conform and keep quiet he and his will be attended to with the rest the people that i watched would not believe this they charged about futilely and wasted themselves in trying to get ahead of their neighbours  here is a fragment from the restaurantcar look at here me and some friends of mine are going to dine at this table we dont want to be separated and  you ave your number for the service sar number what number we want to dine here i tell you  you shall get your number sar for the first service  haows that where in thunder do we get the numbers anyway  i will give you the number sar at the timefor places at the first service  yes but we want to dine together hereright now  the service is not yet ready sar  and so onand so on with marchings and countermarchings and every word nervously italicised in the end they dined precisely where there was room for them in that new world which they had strayed into  on one side our windows looked out on darkness of the waste on the other at the black canal all spaced with monstrous headlights of the nightrunning steamers then came towns lighted with electricity governed by mixed commissions and dealing in cotton such a town for instance as zagazig last seen by a very small boy who was lifted out of a railwaycarriage and set down beneath a whitewashed wall under naked stars in an illimitable emptiness because they told him the train was on fire childlike this did not worry him what stuck in his sleepy mind was the absurd name of the place and his fathers prophecy that when he grew up he would come that way in a big steamer  so all his life the word zagazig carried memories of a brick shed the flicker of an oillamps floating wick a sky full of eyes and an engine coughing in a desert at the worlds end which memories returned in a restaurantcar jolting through what seemed to be miles of brilliantly lighted streets and factories no one at the table had even turned his head for the battlefields of kassassin and telelkebir after all why should they that work is done and children are getting ready to be born who will say i can remember gondokoro or elobeid or some undreamed of clapham junction abyssiniaway before a single factory was startedbefore the overhead traffic began yes when there was a feveractually feverin the city itself  the gap is no greater than that between todays and tother days zagazigbetween the horsed vans of the overland route in lieutenant waghorns time

a black boy in one blue garment climbed using his toes as fingers the tipped mainyard of a nile boat and framed himself in the window then because he felt happy he sang all among the wheeling kites

city of cairo to whose people male and female allah has given subtlety in abundance their jesters are known to have surpassed in refinement the jesters of damascus as did their twelve police captains the hardiest and most corrupt of bagdad in the tolerant days of harunalraschid while their old women not to mention their young wives could deceive the father of lies himself delhi is a great placemost bazaar storytellers in india make their villain hail from there but when the agony and intrigue are piled highest and the tale halts till the very last breathless sprinkle of cowries has ceased to fall on his mat why then with wagging head and hooked forefinger the storyteller goes on  but there was a man from cairo an egyptian of the egyptians whoand all the crowd knows that a bit of real metropolitan devilry is coming     iii   a serpent of old nile  modern cairo is an unkempt place the streets are dirty and illconstructed the pavements unswept and often broken the tramways thrown rather than laid down the gutters neglected one expects better than this in a city where the tourist spends so much every season granted that the tourist is a dog he comes at least with a bone in his mouth and a bone that many people pick he should have a cleaner kennel the official answer is that the touristtraffic is a fleabite compared with the cotton industry even so land in cairo city must be too valuable to be used for cotton growing it might just as well be paved or swept there is some sort of authority supposed to be in charge of municipal matters but its work is crippled by what is called the capitulations it was told to me that every one in cairo except the english who appear to be the mean whites of these parts has the privilege of appealing to his consul on every conceivable subject from the disposal of a garbagecan to that of a corpse as almost every one with claims to respectability and certainly every one without any keeps a consul it follows that there is one consul per superficial meter arshin or cubit of ezekiel within the city and since every consul is zealous for the honour of his country and not at all above annoying the english on general principles municipal progress is slow  cairo strikes one as unventilated and unsterilised even when the sun and wind are scouring it together the tourist talks a good deal as you may see here but the permanent european resident does not open his mouth more than is necessarysound travels so far across flat water besides the whole position of things politically and administratively is essentially false  here is a country which is not a country but a longish strip of marketgarden nominally in charge of a government which is not a government but the disconnected satrapy of a halfdead empire controlled pecksniffingly by a power which is not a power but an agency which agency has been tied up by years custom and blackmail into all sorts of intimate relations with six or seven european powers all with rights and perquisites none of whose subjects seem directly amenable to any power which at first second or third hand is supposed to be responsible that is the barest outline to fill in the details if any living man knows them would be as easy as to explain baseball to an englishman or the eton wall game to a citizen of the united states but it is a fascinating play there are frenchmen in it whose logical mind it offends and they revenge themselves by printing the financereports and the catalogue of the bulak museum in pure french there are germans in it whose demands must be carefully weighednot that they can by any means be satisfied but they serve to block other peoples there are russians in it who do not very much matter at present but will be heard from later there are italians and greeks in it both rather pleased with themselves just now full of the higher finance and the finer emotions there are egyptian pashas in it who come back from paris at intervals and ask plaintively to whom they are supposed to belong there is his highness the khedive in it and he must be considered not a little and there are women in it up to their eyes and there are great english cotton and sugar interests and angry english importers clamouring to know why they cannot do business on rational lines or get into the sudan which they hold is ripe for development if the administration there would only see reason among these conflicting interests and amusements sits and perspires the english official whose job is irrigating or draining or reclaiming land on behalf of a trifle of ten million people and he finds himself tripped up by skeins of intrigue and bafflement which may ramify through half a dozen harems and four consulates all this makes for suavity toleration and the blessed habit of not being surprised at anything whatever  or so it seemed to me watching a big dance at one of the hotels every european race and breed and half of the united states were represented but i fancied i could make out three distinct groupings the tourists with the steamertrunk creases still across their dear excited backs the military and the officials sure of their partners beforehand and saying clearly what ought to be said and a third contingent lowervoiced softerfooted and keenereyed than the other two at ease as gipsies are on their own ground flinging halfwords in local argot over shoulders at their friends understanding on the nod and moved by springs common to their clan only for example a woman was talking flawless english to her partner an english officer just before the next dance began another woman beckoned to her eastern fashion all four fingers flicking downward the first woman crossed to a potted palm the second moved toward it also till the two drew up not looking at each other the plant between them then she who had beckoned spoke in a strange tongue at the palm the first woman still looking away answered in the same fashion with a rush of words that rattled like buckshot through the stiff fronds her tone had nothing to do with that in which she greeted her new partner who came up as the music began the one was a delicious drawl the other had been the guttural rasp and click of the kitchen and the bazaar so she moved off and in a little the second woman disappeared into the crowd most likely it was no more than some question of the programme or dress but the prompt feline stealth and coolness of it the lightningquick return to and from worldapart civilisations stuck in my memory  so did the bloodless face of a very old turk fresh from some horror of assassination in constantinople in which he too had been nearly pistolled but they said he had argued quietly over the body of a late colleague as one to whom death was of no moment until the hysterical young turks were abashed and let him get awayto the lights and music of this elegantly appointed hotel  these modern arabian nights are too hectic for quiet folk i declined upon a more rational cairothe arab city where everything is as it was when maruf the cobbler fled from fatimaelorra and met the djinn in the adelia musjid the craftsmen and merchants sat on their shopboards a rich mystery of darkness behind them and the narrow gullies were polished to shoulderheight by the mere flux of people shod white men unless they are agriculturists touch lightly with their hands at most in passing easterns lean and loll and squat and sidle against things as they daunder along when the feet are bare the whole body thinks moreover it is unseemly to buy or to do aught and be done with it only people with tightfitting clothes that need no attention have time for that so we of the loose skirt and flowing trousers and slack slipper make full and ample salutations to our friends and redouble them toward our illwishers and if it be a question of purchase the stuff must be fingered and appraised with a proverb or so and if it be a fooltourist who thinks that he cannot be cheated o true believers draw near and witness how we shall loot him  but i bought nothing the city thrust more treasure upon me than i could carry away it came out of dark alleyways on tawny camels loaded with pots on pattering asses half buried under nets of cut clover in the exquisitely modelled hands of little children scurrying home from the cookshop with the evening meal chin pressed against the platters edge and eyes round with responsibility above the pile in the broken lights from jutting rooms overhead where the women lie chin between palms looking out of windows not a foot from the floor in every glimpse into every courtyard where the men smoke by the tank in the heaps of rubbish and rotten bricks that flanked newly painted houses waiting to be built some day into houses once more in the slap and slide or the heelless redandyellow slippers all around and above all in the mixed delicious smells of frying butter mohammedan bread kababs leather cookingsmoke assafetida peppers and turmeric devils cannot abide the smell of burning turmeric but the rightminded man loves it it stands for evening that brings all home the evening meal the dipping of friendly hands in the dish the one face the dropped veil and the big guttering pipe afterward  praised be allah for the diversity of his creatures and for the five advantages of travel and for the glories of the cities of the earth harunalraschid in roaring bagdad of old never delighted himself to the limits of such a delight as was mine that afternoon it is true that the call to prayer the cadence of some of the streetcries and the cut of some of the garments differed a little from what i had been brought up to but for the rest the shadow on the dial had turned back twenty degrees for me and i found myself saying as perhaps the dead say when they have recovered their wits this is my real world again  some men are mohammedan by birth some by training and some by fate but i have never met an englishman yet who hated islam and its people as i have met englishmen who hated some other faiths musalmani awadani as the saying goeswhere there are mohammedans there is a comprehensible civilisation  then we came upon a deserted mosque of pitted brick colonnades round a vast courtyard open to the pale sky it was utterly empty except for its own proper spirit and that caught one by the throat as one entered christian churches may compromise with images and sidechapels where the unworthy or abashed can traffic with accessible saints islam has but one pulpit and one stark affirmationliving or dying one onlyand where men have repeated that in redhot belief through centuries the air still shakes to it  some say now that islam is dying and that nobody cares others that if she withers in europe and asia she will renew herself in africa and will returnterribleafter certain years at the head of all the nine sons of ham others dream that the english understand islam as no one else does and in years to be islam will admit this and the world will be changed if you go to the mosque al azharthe thousandyearold university of cairoyou will be able to decide for yourself there is nothing to see except many courts cool in hot weather surrounded by clifflike brick walls men come and go through dark doorways giving on to yet darker cloisters as freely as though the place was a bazaar there are no aggressive educational appliances the students sit on the ground and their teachers instruct them mostly by word of mouth in grammar syntax logic alhisab which is arithmetic aljabr wal muqabalah which is algebra attafsir commentaries on the koran and last and most troublesome alahadis traditions and yet more commentaries on the law of islam which leads back like everything to the koran once again for it is written truly the quran is none other than a revelation it is a very comprehensive curriculum no man can master it entirely but any can stay there as long as he pleases the university provides commonstwentyfive thousand loaves a day i believeand there is always a place to lie down in for such as do not desire a shut room and a bed nothing could be more simple or given certain conditions more effective close upon six hundred professors who represent officially or unofficially every school or thought teach ten or twelve thousand students who draw from every mohammedan community west and east between manila and morocco north and south between kamchatka and the malay mosque at cape town these drift off to become teachers of little schools preachers at mosques students of the law known to millions but rarely to europeans dreamers devotees or miracleworkers in all the ends of the earth the man who interested me most was a redbearded sunkeyed mullah from the indian frontier not likely to be last at any distribution of food who stood up like a lean wolfhound among collies in a little assembly at a doorway  and there was another mosque sumptuously carpeted and lighted which the prophet does not approve of where men prayed in the dull mutter that at times mounts and increases under the domes like the boom of drums or the surge of a hot hive before the swarm flings out and round the corner of it one almost ran into our inconspicuous and wholly detached private of infantry his tunic open his cigarette alight leaning against some railings and considering the city below men in forts and citadels and garrisons all the world over go up at twilight as automatically as sheep at sundown to have a last look round they say little and return as silently across the crunching gravel detested by bare feet to their whitewashed rooms and regulated lives one of the men told me he thought well of cairo it was interesting take it from me he said theres a lot in seeing places because you can remember em afterward  he was very right the purple and lemoncoloured hazes of dusk and reflected day spread over the throbbing twinkling streets masked the great outline of the citadel and the desert hills and conspired to confuse and suggest and evoke memories till cairo the sorceress cast her proper shape and danced before me in the heartbreaking likeness of every city i had known and loved a little farther up the road  it was a cruel doublemagic for in the very hour that my homesick soul had surrendered itself to the dream of the shadow that had turned back on the dial i realised all the desolate days and homesickness of all the men penned in faroff places among strange sounds and smells     iv   up the river  once upon a time there was a murderer who got off with a lifesentence what impressed him most when he had time to think was the frank boredom of all who took part in the ritual  it was just like going to a doctor or a dentist he explained you come to em very full of your affairs and then you discover that its only part of their daily work to them i expect he added i should have found it the same iferid gone on to the finish  he would have break into any new hell or heaven and you will be met at its wellworn threshold by the bored experts in attendance  for three weeks we sat on copiously chaired and carpeted decks carefully isolated from everything that had anything to do with egypt under chaperonage of a properly orientalised dragoman twice or thrice daily our steamer drew up at a mudbank covered with donkeys saddles were hauled out of a hatch in our bows the donkeys were dressed dealt round like cards we rode off through crops or desert as the case might be were introduced in ringing tones to a temple and were then duly returned to our bridge and our baedekers for sheer comfort not to say padded sloth the life was unequalled and since the bulk of our passengers were citizens of the united statesegypt in winter ought to be admitted into the union as a temporary territorythere was no lack of interest they were overwhelmingly women with here and there a placid noseled husband or father visibly suffering from congestion of information about his native city i had the joy of seeing two such men meet they turned their backs resolutely on the river bit and lit cigars and for one hour and a quarter ceased not to emit statistics of the industries commerce manufacture transport and journalism of their townslos angeles let us say and rochester ny it sounded like a duel between two cashregisters  one forgot of course that all the dreary figures were alive to them and as los angeles spoke rochester visualised next day i met an englishman from the soudan end of things very full of a littleknown railway which had been laid down in what had looked like raw desert and therefore had turned out to be full of paying freight he was in the fulltide of it when los angeles ranged alongside and cast anchor fascinated by the mere roll of numbers  haows that he cut in sharply at a pause  he was told how and went on to drain my friend dry concerning that railroad out of sheer fraternal interest as he explained in any darn thing thats being made anywheres  so you see my friend went on we shall be bringing abyssinian cattle into cairo  on the hoof one quick glance at the desert ranges  no no by rail and river and after that were going to grow cotton between the blue and the white nile and knock spots out of the states  haows that  this way the speaker spread his first and second fingers fanwise under the big interested beak thats the blue nile and thats the white theres a difference of so many feet between em an in that fork here tween my fingers we shall  i see irrigate on the strength of the little difference in the levels how many acres  again los angeles was told he expanded like a frog in a shower an i thought he murmured egypt was all mummies and the bible i used to know something about cotton now well talk  all that day the two paced the deck with the absorbed insolente of lovers and loverlike each would steal away and tell me what a splendid soul was his companion  that was one type but there were othersprofessional men who did not make or sell thingsand these the hand of an allexacting democracy seemed to have run into one mould they were not reticent but no matter whence they hailed their talk was as standardised as the fittings of a pullman  i hinted something of this to a woman aboard who was learned in their sermons of either language  i think she began that the staleness you complain of  i never said staleness i protested  but you thought it the staleness you noticed is due to our men being so largely educated by old womenold maids practically till he goes to college and not always then a boy cant get away from them  then what happens  the natural result a mans instinct is to teach a boy to think for himself if a woman cant make a boy think as she thinks she sits down and cries a man hasnt any standards he makes em a womans the most standardised being in the world she has to be now dyou see  not yet  well our trouble in america is that were being schoolmarmed to death you can see it in any paper you pick up what were those men talking about just now  food adulteration policereform and beautifying wastelots in towns i replied promptly  she threw up her hands i knew it she cried our great national policy of coeducational housekeeping hamfrills and pillowshams did you ever know a man get a womans respect by parading around creation with a dishclout pinned to his coattails  but if his woman ordtold him to do it i suggested  then shed despise him the more for doing it you neednt laugh youre coming to the same sort of thing in england  i returned to the little gathering a woman was talking to them as one accustomed to talk from birth they listened with the rigid attention of men early trained to listen to but not to talk with women she was to put it mildly the mother of all shebores but when she moved on no man ventured to say as much  thats what i mean by being schoolmanned to death said my acquaintance wickedly why she bored em stiff but they are so well brought up they didnt even know they were bored some day the american man is going to revolt  and whatll the american woman do  shell sit and cryand itll do her good  later on i met a woman from a certain western state seeing gods great happy inattentive world for the first time and rather distressed that it was not like hers she had always understood that the english were brutal to their wivesthe papers of her state said so if you only knew the papers of her state i but she had not noticed any scandalous treatment so far and englishwomen whom she admitted she would never understand seemed to enjoy a certain specious liberty and equality while englishmen were distinctly kind to girls in difficulties over their baggage and tickets on strange railways quite a nice people she concluded but without much sense of humour one day she showed me what looked like a fashionpaper print of a dressstuffa pretty oval medallion of stars on a striped grenadine background that somehow seemed familiar  how nice what is it i asked  our national flag she replied  indeed but it doesnt look quite  no this is a new design for arranging the stars so that they shall be easier to count and more decorative in effect were going to take a vote on it in our state where we have the franchise i shall cast my vote when i get home  really and how will you vote  im just thinking that out she spread the picture on her knee and considered it head to one side as though it were indeed dress material  all this while the land of egypt marched solemnly beside us on either hand the river being low we saw it from the boat as one long plinth twelve to twenty feet high of brownish purplish mud visibly upheld every hundred yards or so by glistening copper caryatides in the shape of naked men baling water up to the crops above behind that bright emerald line ran the fawnor tigercoloured background of desert and a pale blue sky closed all there was egypt even as the pharaohs their engineers and architects had seen itland to cultivate folk and cattle for the work and outside that work no distraction nor allurement of any kind whatever save when the dead were taken to their place beyond the limits of cultivation when the banks grew lower one looked across as much as two miles of greenstuff packed like a toy noahsark with people camels sheep goats oxen buffaloes and an occasional horse the beasts stood as still too as the toys because they were tethered or hobbled each to his own halfcircle of clover and moved forward when that was eaten only the very little kids were loose and these played on the flat mud roofs like kittens  no wonder every shepherd is an abomination to the egyptians the dusty nakedfooted fieldtracks are cut down to the last centimetre of grudged width the main roads are lifted high on the flanks of the canals unless the permanentway of some light railroad can be pressed to do duty for them the wheat the pale ripened tufted sugarcane the millet the barley the onions the fringed castoroil bushes jostle each other for foothold since the desert will not give them room and men chase the falling nile inch by inch each dawn with new furrowed melonbeds on the still dripping mudbanks  administratively such a land ought to be a joy the people do not emigrate all their resources are in plain sight they are as accustomed as their cattle to being led about all they desire and it has been given them is freedom from murder and mutilation rape and robbery the rest they can attend to in their silent palmshaded villages where the pigeons coo and the little children play in the dust  but western civilisation is a devastating and a selfish game like the young woman from our state it says in effect i am rich ive nothing to do i must do something i shall take up social reform  just now there is a little social reform in egypt which is rather amusing the egyptian cultivator borrows money as all farmers must this land without hedge or wildflower is his passion by agelong inheritance and suffering by in and for which he lives he borrows to develop it and to buy more at from £30 to £200 per acre the profit on which when all is paid works out at between £5 to £10 per acre formerly he borrowed from the local moneylenders mostly greeks at 30 per cent per annum and over this rate is not excessive so long as public opinion allows the borrower from time to time to slay the lender but modern administration calls that riot and murder some years ago therefore there was established a stateguaranteed bank which lent to the cultivators at eight per cent and the cultivator zealously availed himself of that privilege he did not default more than in reason but being a farmer he naturally did not pay up till threatened with being sold up so he prospered and bought more land which was his hearts desire this year1913the administration issued sudden orders that no man owning less than five acres could borrow on security of his land the matter interested me directly because i held five hundred pounds worth of shares in that stateguaranteed bank and more than half our clients were small men of less than five acres so i made inquiries in quarters that seemed to possess information and was told that the new law was precisely on allfours with the homestead act or the united states and france and the intentions of divine providenceor words to that effect  but i asked wont this limitation of credit prevent the men with less than five acres from borrowing more to buy more land and getting on in the world  yes was the answer of course it will thats just what we want to prevent half these fellows ruin themselves trying to buy more land weve got to protect them against themselves  that alas is the one enemy against which no law can protect any son of adam since the real reasons that make or break a man are too absurd or too obscene to be reached from outside then i cast about in other quarters to discover what the cultivator was going to do about it  oh him said one of my many informants hes all right there are about six ways of evading the act that i know of the fellah probably knows another six he has been trained to look after himself since the days of rameses he can forge landtransfers for one thing borrow land enough to make his holding more than five acres for as long as it takes to register a loan get money from his own women yes thats one result of modern progress in this land or go back to his old friend the greek at 30 per cent  then the greek will sell him up and that will be against the law wont it i said  dont you worry about the greek he can get through any law ever made if theres five piastres on the other side of it  maybe but was the agricultural bank selling the cultivators up too much  not in the least the number of small holdings is on the increase if anything most cultivators wont pay a loan until you point a judgmentsummons at their head they think that shows theyre men of consequence this swells the number of judgmentsummonses issued but it doesnt mean a landsale for each summons another fact is that in real life some men dont get on as well as others either they dont farm well enough or they take to hashish or go crazy about a girl and borrow money for her orersomething of that kind and they are sold up you may have noticed that  i have and meantime what is the fellah doing  meantime the fellah has misread the actas usual he thinks its retrospective and that he neednt pay past debts they may make trouble but i fancy your bank will keep quiet  keep quiet with the bottom knocked out of twothirds of its business andand my five hundred pounds involved  is that your trouble i dont think your shares will rise in a hurry but if you want some fun go and talk to the french about it  this seemed as good a way as any of getting a little interest the frenchman that i went to spoke with a certain knowledge of finance and politics and the natural malice of a logical race against an illogical horde  yes he said the idea of limiting credit under these circumstances is absurd but that is not all people are not frightened business is not upset by one absurd idea but by the possibilities of more  are there any more ideas then that are going to be tried on this country  two or three he replied placidly they are all generous but they are all ridiculous egypt is not a place where one should promulgate ridiculous ideas  but my sharesmy shares i cried they have already dropped several points  it is possible they will drop more then they will rise  thank you but why  because the idea is fundamentally absurd that will never be admitted by your people but there will be arrangements accommodations adjustments till it is all the same as it used to be it will be the concern of the permanent officialpoor devilto pull it straight it is always his concern meantime prices will rise for all things  why  because the land is the chief security in egypt if a man cannot borrow on that security the rates of interest will increase on whatever other security he offers that will affect all work and wages and government contracts  he put it so convincingly and with so many historical illustrations that i saw whole perspectives of the old energetic pharaohs masters of life and death along the river checked in midcareer by coldblooded accountants chanting that not even the gods themselves can make two plus two more than four and the vision ran down through the ages to one little earnest head on a cooks steamer bent sideways over the vital problem of rearranging our national flag so that it should be easier to count the stars  for the thousandth time praised be allah for the diversity of his creatures     v   dead kings  the swiss are the only people who have taken the trouble to master the art of hotelkeeping consequently in the things that really matterbeds baths and victualsthey control egypt and since every land always throws back to its aboriginal life which is why the united states delight in telling aged stories any ancient egyptian would at once understand and join in with the life that roars through the nickelplumbed touristbarracks on the river where all the world frolics in the sunshine at first sight the show lends itself to cheap moralising till one recalls that one only sees busy folk when they are idle and rich folk when they have made their money a citizen of the united stateshis first trip abroadpointed out a middleaged anglosaxon who was relaxing after the manner of several schoolboys  theres a sample said the son of hustle scornfully tell me he ever did anything in his life unluckily he had pitched upon one who when he is in collar reckons thirteen and a half hours a fairish days work  among this assembly were men and women burned to an even blueblack tintcivilised people with bleached hair and sparkling eyes they explained themselves as diggersjust diggersand opened me a new world granted that all egypt is one big undertakers emporium what could be more fascinating than to get government leave to rummage in a corner of it to form a little company and spend the cold weather trying to pay dividends in the shape of amethyst necklaces lapislazuli scarabs pots of pure gold and priceless bits of statuary or if one is rich what better fun than to grubstake an expedition on the supposed site of a dead city and see what turns up there was a biggame hunter who had used most of the continent quite carried away by this sport  im going to take shares in a city next year and watch the digging myself he said it beats elephants to pieces in this game youre digging up dead things and making them alive arent you going to have a flutter  he showed me a seductive little prospectus myself i would sooner not lay hands on a dead mans kit or equipment especially when he has gone to his grave in the belief that the trinkets guarantee salvation of course there is the other argument put forward by sceptics that the egyptian was a blatant selfadvertiser and that nothing would please him more than the thought that he was being looked at and admired after all these years still one might rob some shrinking soul who didnt see it in that light  at the end of spring the diggers flock back out of the desert and exchange chaff and flews in the gorgeous verandahs for example as company has made a find of priceless stuff heaven knows how old and isnot too meek about it company b less fortunate hints that if only a knew to what extent their native diggers had been stealing and disposing of the thefts under their very archaeological noses they would not be so happy  nonsense says company a our diggers are above suspicion besides we watched em  are they is the reply well next time you are in berlin go to the museum and youll see what the germans have got hold of it must have come out of your ground the dynasty proves it so as cup is poisonedtill next year  no collector or curator of a museum should have any moral scruples whatever and i have never met one who had though i have been informed by deeplyshocked informants of four nationalities that the germans are the most flagrant pirates of all  the business of exploration is about as romantic as earthwork on indian railways there are the same narrowgauge trams and donkeys the same shining gangs in the borrowpits and the same skirling darkblue crowds of women and children with the little earthbaskets but the hoes are not driven in nor the clods jerked aside at random and when the work fringes along the base of some mighty wall men use their hands carefully a white manor he was white at breakfasttimepatrols through the continually renewed dusthaze weeks may pass without a single bead but anything may turn up at any moment and it is his to answer the shout of discovery  we had the good fortune to stay a while at the headquarters of the metropolitan museum new york in a valley riddled like a rabbitwarren with tombs their stables storehouses and servants quarters are old tombs their talk is of tombs and their dream the diggers dream always is to discover a virgin tomb where the untouched dead lie with their jewels upon them four miles away are the widewinged rampant hotels here is nothing whatever but the rubbish of death that died thousands of years ago on whose grave no green thing has ever grown villages expert in two hundred generations of graverobbing cower among the mounds of wastage and whoop at the daily tourist paths made by bare feet run from one halftomb halfmudheap to the next not much more distinct than snail smears but they have been used since  time is a dangerous thing to play with that morning the concierge had toiled for us among steamersailings to see if we could save three days that evening we sat with folk for whom time had stood still since the ptolemies i wondered at first how it concerned them or any man if such and such a pharaoh had used to his own glory the plinths and columns of such another pharaoh before or after melchizedek their whole background was too inconceivably remote for the mind to work on but the next morning we were taken to the painted tomb of a noblea minister of agriculturewho died four or five thousand years ago he said to me in so many words observe i was very like your friend the late mr samuel pepys of your admiralty i took an enormous interest in life which i most thoroughly enjoyed on its human and on its spiritual side i do not think you will find many departments of state better managed than mine or a betterkept house or a nicer set of young people  my daughters the eldest as you can see takes after her mother the youngest my favourite is supposed to favour me now i will show you all the things that i did and delighted in till it was time for me to present my accounts elsewhere and he showed me detail by detail in colour and in drawing his cattle his horses his crops his tours in the district his accountants presenting the revenue returns and he himself busiest of the busy in the good day  but when we left that broad gay anteroom and came to the narrower passage where once his body had lain and where all his doom was portrayed i could not follow him so well i did not see how he so experienced in life could be cowed by friezes of bruteheaded apparitions or satisfied by files of repeated figures he explained something to this effect  we live on the rivera line without breadth or thickness behind us is the desert which nothing can affect wither no man goes till he is dead one does not use good agricultural ground for cemeteries practically then we only move in two dimensionsup stream or down take away the desert which we dont consider any more than a healthy man considers death and you will see that we have no background whatever our world is all one straight bar of brown or green earth and for some months mere skyreflecting water that wipes out everything you have only to look at the colossi to realise how enormously and extravagantly man and his works must scale in such a country remember too that our crops are sure and our life is very very easy above all we have no neighbours that is to say we must give out for we cannot take in now i put it to you what is left for a priest with imagination except to develop ritual and multiply gods on friezes unlimited leisure limited space of two dimensions divided by the hypnotising line of the river and bounded by visible unalterable deathmust ipso facto  even so i interrupted i do not comprehend your godsyour direct worship of beasts for instance  you prefer the indirect the worship of humanity with a capital h my gods or what i saw in them contented me  what did you see in your gods as affecting belief and conduct  you know the answer to the riddle of the sphinx  no i murmured what is it  all sensible men are of the same religion but no sensible man ever tells he replied with that i had to be content for the passage ended in solid rock  there were other tombs in the valley but the owners were dumb except one pharaoh who from the highest motives had broken with the creeds and instincts of his country and so had all but wrecked it one of his discoveries was an artist who saw men not on one plane but modelled full or threequarter face with limbs suited to their loads and postures his vividly realised stuff leaped to the eye out of the acreage of lowrelief in the old convention and i applauded as a properly broughtup tourist should  mine was a fatal mistake pharaoh ahkenaton sighed in my ear i mistook the conventions of life for the realities  ah those soulcrippling conventions i cried  you mistake me he answered more stiffly i was so sure of their reality that i thought that they were really lies whereas they were only invented to cover the raw facts of life  ah those raw facts of life i cried still louder for it is not often that one has a chance of impressing a pharaoh we must face them with open eyes and an open mind did you  i had no opportunity of avoiding them he replied i broke every convention in my land  oh noble and what happened  what happens when you strip the cover off a hornets nest the raw fact of life is that mankind is just a little lower than the angels and the conventions are based on that fact in order that men may become angels but if you begin as i did by the convention that men are angels they will assuredly become bigger beasts than ever  that i said firmly is altogether outofdate you should have brought a larger mentality a more vital uplift anderall that sort of thing to bear onall that sort of thing you know  i did said ahkenaton gloomily it broke me and he too went dumb among the ruins  there is a valley of rocks and stones in every shade of red and brown called the valley of the kings where a little oilengine coughs behind its hand all day long grinding electricity to light the faces of dead pharaohs a hundred feet underground all down the valley during the tourist season stand charabancs and donkeys and sandcarts with here and there exhausted couples who have dropped out of the processions and glisten and fan themselves in some scrap of shade along the sides of the valley are the tombs of the kings neatly numbered as it might be mining adits with concrete steps leading up to them and iron grilles that lock of nights and doorkeepers of the department of antiquities demanding the proper tickets one enters and from deeps below deeps hears the voices of dragomans booming through the names and titles of the illustrious and thricepuissant dead rockcut steps go down into hot still darkness passagestwist and are led over blind pits which men say the wise builders childishly hoped would be taken for the real tombs by thieves to come up and down these alleyways clatter all the races of europe with a solid backing of the united states their footsteps are suddenly blunted on the floor of a hall paved with immemorial dust that will never dance in any wind they peer up at the blazoned ceilings stoop down to the minutely decorated walls crane and follow the sombre splendours of a cornice draw in their breaths and climb up again to the fierce sunshine to redive into the next adit on their programme what they think proper to say they say aloudand some of it is very interesting what they feel you can guess from a certain haste in their movementssomething between the shrinking modesty of a man under fire and the hadntwebetterbegettingon attitude of visitors to a mine after all it is not natural for man to go underground except for business or for the last time he is conscious of the weight of motherearth overhead and when to her expectant bulk is added the whole beaked horned winged and crowned hierarchy of a lost faith flaming at every turn of his eye he naturally wishes to move away even the sight of a very great king indeed sarcophagused under electric light in a hall full of most fortifying pictures does not hold him too long  some men assert that the crypt of st peters with only nineteen centuries bearing down on the groining and the tombs of early popes and kings all about is more impressive than the valley of the kings because it explains how and out of what an existing creed grew but the valley of the kings explains nothing except that most terrible line in macbeth      to the last syllable of recorded time  earth opens her dry lips and says it  in one of the tombs there is a little chamber whose ceiling probably because of a fault in the rock could not be smoothed off like the others so the decorator very cunningly covered it with a closely designed clothpatternjust such a chintzlike piece of stuff as in real life one would use to underhang a rough roof with he did it perfectly down there in the dark and went his way thousands of years later there was born a man of my acquaintance who for good and sufficient reason had an almost insane horror of anything in the nature of a ceilingcloth he used to make excuses for not going into the dry goods shops at christmas when hastily enlarged annexes are hidden roof and sides with embroideries perhaps a snake or a lizard had dropped on his mother from the roof before he was born perhaps it was the memory of some hideous feverbout in a tent at any rate that mans idea of the torment was a hot crowded underground room underhung with patterned cloths once in his life at a city in the far north where he had to make a speech he met that perfect combination they led him up and down narrow crowded steamheated passages till they planted him at last in a room without visible windows by which he knew he was underground and directly beneath a warmpatterned ceilingclothrather like a tentlining and there he had to say his say while panic terror sat in his throat the second time was in the valley of the kings where very similar passages crowded with people led him into a room cut of rock fathoms underground with what looked like a sagging chintz cloth not three feet above his head the man id like to catch he said when he came outside again is that decoratorman dyou suppose he meant to produce that effect  every man has his private terrors other than those of his own conscience from what i saw in the valley of the kings the egyptians seem to have known this some time ago they certainly have impressed it on most unexpected people i heard two voices down a passage talking together as follows  she i guess we werent ever meant to see these old tombs from inside anyway  he how so  she for one thing they believe so hard in being dead of course their outlook on spiritual things wasnt as broad as ours  he well theres no danger of our being led away by it did you buy that alleged scarab off the dragoman this morning     vi   the face of the desert  going up the nile is like running the gauntlet before eternity till one has seen it one does not realise the amazing thinness of that little damp trickle of life that steals along undefeated through the jaws of established death a rifleshot would cover the widest limits of cultivation a bowshot would reach the narrower once beyond them a man may carry his next drink with him till he reaches cape blanco on the west where he may signal for one from a passing union castle boat or the karachi club on the east say four thousand dry miles to the left hand and three thousand to the right  the weight of the desert is on one every day and every hour at morning when the cavalcade tramps along in the rear of the tuliplike dragoman she says i am herejust beyond that ridge of pink sand that you are admiring come along pretty gentleman and ill tell you your fortune but the dragoman says very clearly please sar do not separate yourself at all from the main body which the desert knows well you had no thought of doing at noon when the stewards rummage out lunchdrinks from the dewy icechest the desert whines louder than the wellwheels on the bank i am here only a quarter of a mile away for mercys sake pretty gentleman spare a mouthful of that prickly whiskyandsoda you are lifting to your lips theres a white man a few hundred miles off dying on my lap of thirstthirst that you cure with a rag dipped in lukewarm water while you hold him down with the one hand and he thinks he is cursing you aloud but he isnt because his tongue is outside his mouth and he cant get it back thank you my noble captain for naturally one tips half the drink over the rail with the ancient prayer may it reach him who needs it and turns ones back on the pulsing ridges and fluid horizons that are beginning their midday miragedance  at evening the desert obtrudes againtricked out as a nautch girl in veils of purple saffron goldtinsel and grassgreen she postures shamelessly before the delighted tourists with woven skeins of homewardflying pelicans fringes of wild duck black spotted on crimson and cheap jewellery of opal clouds notice me she cries like any other worthless woman admire the play of my mobile featuresthe revelations of my multicoloured soul observe my allurements and potentialities thrill while i stir you so she floats through all her changes and retires upstage into the arms of the dusk but at midnight she drops all pretence and bears down in her natural shape which depends upon the conscience of the beholder and his distance from the next white man  you will observe in the benedicite omnia opera that the desert is the sole thing not enjoined to bless the lord praise him and magnify him for ever this is because when our illustrious father the lord adam and his august consort the lady eve were expelled from eden eblis the accursed fearful lest mankind should return ultimately to the favour of allah set himself to burn and lay waste all the lands east and west of eden  oddly enough the garden of eden is almost the exact centre of all the worlds deserts counting from gobi to timbuctoo and all that land qua land is dismissed from the mercy of god those who use it do so at their own risk consequently the desert produces her own type of man exactly as the sea does i was fortunate enough to meet one sample aged perhaps twentyfive his work took him along the edge of the red sea where men on swift camels come to smuggle hashish and sometimes guns from dhows that put in to any convenient beach these smugglers must be chased on still swifter camels and since the wells are few and known the game is to get ahead of them and occupy their drinkingplaces  but they may skip a well or so and do several days march in one then their pursuer must take een greater risks and make crueller marches that the law may be upheld the one thing in the laws favour is that hashish smells abominablyworse than a heated camelso when they range alongside no time is lost in listening to lies it was not told to me how they navigate themselves across the broken wastes or by what arts they keep alive in the duststorms and heat that was taken for granted and the man who took it so considered himself the most commonplace of mortals he was deeply moved by the account of a new aerial route which the french are laying out somewhere in the sahara over a waterless stretch of four hundred miles where if the aeroplane is disabled between stations the pilot will most likely die and dry up beside it to do the desert justice she rarely bothers to wipe out evidence of a kill there are places in the desert men say where even now you come across the dead of old battles all as light as last years wasps nests laid down in swaths or strung out in flight with here and there the little sparkling lines of the emptied cartridgecases that dropped them  there are valleys and ravines that the craziest smugglers do not care to refuge in at certain times of the year as there are resthouses where ones native servants will not stay because they are challenged on their way to the kitchen by sentries of old soudanese regiments which have long gone over to paradise and of voices and warnings and outcries behind rocks there is no end these last arise from the fact that men very rarely live in a spot so utterly still that they can hear the murmuring race of the blood over their own eardrums neither ship prairie nor forest gives that silence i went out to find it once when our steamer tied up and the rest of them had gone to see a sight but i never dared venture more than a mile from our funnelsmoke at that point i came upon a hill honeycombed with graves that held a multitude of paperwhite skulls all grinning cheerfully like ambassadors of the desert but i did not accept their invitation they had told me that all the little devils learn to draw in the desert which explains the elaborate and purposeless detail that fills it none but devils could think of etching every rock outcrop with windlines or skinning it down to its glistening nerves with sandblasts of arranging hills in the likeness of pyramids and sphinxes and wrecked townsuburbs of covering the space of half an english county with sepia studies of interlacing and recrossing ravines dongas and nullahs each an exposition of much too clever perspective and of wiping out the halffinished work with a wash of sand in three tints only to pick it up again in silverpoint on the horizons edge this they do in order to make lost travellers think they can recognise landmarks and run about identifying them till the madness comes the desert is all devildeviceas you might say blasted clevernesscrammed with futile works always promising something fresh round the next corner always leading out through heaped decoration and overinsistent design into equal barrenness  there was a morning of mornings when we lay opposite the rockhewn temple of abu simbel where four great figures each sixty feet high sit with their hands on their knees waiting for judgment day at their feet is a little breadth of bluegreen crop they seem to hold back all the weight of the desert behind them which none the less lips over at one side in a cataract of vividest orange sand the tourist is recommended to see the sunrise here either from within the temple where it falls on a certain altar erected by rameses in his own honour or from without where another power takes charge  the stars had paled when we began our watch the river birds were just whispering over their toilettes in the uncertain purplish light then the river dimmered up like pewter the line of the ridge behind the temple showed itself against a milkiness in the sky one felt rather than saw that there were four figures in the pit of gloom below it these blocked themselves out huge enough but without any special terror while the glorious ritual of the eastern dawn went forward some reed of the bank revealed itself by reflection black on silver arched wings flapped and jarred the still water to splintered glass the desert ridge turned to topaz and the four figures stood clear yet without shadowing from their background the stronger light flooded them red from head to foot and they became aliveas horridly and tensely yet blindly alive as pinioned men in the deathchair before the current is switched on one felt that if by any miracle the dawn could be delayed a second longer they would tear themselves free and leap forth to heaven knows what sort of vengeance but that instant the full sun pinned them in their placesnothing more than statues slashed with light and shadowand another day got to work  a few yards to the left of the great images close to the statue of an egyptian princess whose face was the very face of she there was a marble slab over the grave of an english officer killed in a fight against dervishes nearly a generation ago  from abu simbel to wady halfa the river escaped from the domination of the pharaohs begins to talk about dead white men thirty years ago young english officers in india lied and intrigued furiously that they might be attached to expeditions whose bases were sometimes at suakim sometimes quite in the desert air but all of whose deeds are now quite forgotten occasionally the dragoman waving a smooth hand east or southeasterly will speak of some fight then every one murmurs oh

train on the way to egypt of the old days both name and face had utterly vanished from ones memory till then  it was another generation that picked up the ball ten years later and touched down in khartoum several people aboard the cook boat had been to that city they all agreed that the hotel charges were very high but that you could buy the most delightful curiosities in the native bazaar but i do not like bazaars of the egyptian kind since a discovery i made at assouan there was an old mana mussulmanwho pressed me to buy some truck or other but not with the villainous camaraderie that generations of lowcaste tourists have taught the people nor yet with the cosmopolitan lighthandedness of appeal which the townbred egyptian picks up much too quickly but with a certain desperate zeal foreign to his whole creed and nature he fingered he implored he fawned with an unsteady eye and while i wondered i saw behind him the puffy pink face of a fezzed jew watching him as a stoat watches a rabbit when he moved the jew followed and took position at a commanding angle the old man glanced from me to him and renewed his solicitations so one could imagine an elderly hare thumping wildly on a tambourine with the stoat behind him they told me afterwards that jews own most of the stalls in assouan bazaar the mussulmans working for them since tourists need oriental colour never having seen or imagined a jew coercing a mussulman this colour was new and displeasing to me     vii   the riddle of empire  at halfa one feels the first breath of a frontier here the egyptian government retires into the background and even the cook steamer does not draw up in the exact centre of the postcard at the telegraphoffice too there are traces diluted but quite recognisable of military administration nor does the town in any way or place whatever smellwhich is proof that it is not looked after on popular lines there is nothing to see in it any more than there is in hulk c 60 late of her majestys troopship himalaya now a coalhulk in the hamoaze at plymouth a river front a narrow terraced riverwalk of semioriental houses barracks a mosque and halfadozen streets at right angles the desert racing up to the end of each make all the town a mile or so up stream under palm trees are bungalows of what must have been cantonments some machinery repairshops and odds and ends of railway track it is all as paltry a collection of whitewashed houses pitiful gardens dead walls and trodden waste spaces as one would wish to find anywhere and every bit of it quivers with the remembered life of armies and riverfleets as the fingerbowl rings when the rubbing finger is lifted the most unlikely men have done time there stores by the thousand ton have been rolled and pushed and hauled up the banks by tens of thousands of scattered hands hospitals have pitched themselves there expanded enormously shrivelled up and drifted away with the drifting regiments railway sidings by the mile have been laid down and ripped up again as need changed and utterly wiped out by the sands  halfa has been the railhead army headquarters and hub of the universethe one place where a man could make sure of buying tobacco and sardines or could hope for letters for himself and medical attendance for his friend now she is a little shrunken shell of a town without a proper hotel where tourists hurry up from the river to buy complete sets of soudan stamps at the post office  i went for a purposeless walk from one end of the place to the other and found a crowd of native boys playing football on what might have been a paradeground of old days  and what school is that i asked in english of a small eager youth  madrissah said he most intelligently which being translated means just school  yes but what school  yes madrissah school sir and he tagged after to see what else the imbecile wanted  a line of railway track that must have fed big workshops in its time led me between bigroomed houses and offices labelled departmentally with here and there a clerk at work i was directed and redirected by polite egyptian officials i wished to get at a white officer if possible but there wasnt one about was turned out of a garden which belonged to an authority hung round the gate of a bungalow with an oldestablished compound and two white men sitting in chairs on a verandah wandered down towards the river under the palm trees where the last red light came through lost myself among rusty boilers and balks of timber and at last loafed back in the twilight escorted by the small boy and an entire brigade of ghosts not one of whom i had ever met before but all of whom i knew most intimately they said it was the evenings that used to depress them most too so they all came back after dinner and bore me company while i went to meet a friend arriving by the night train from khartoum  she was an hour late and we spent it the ghosts and i in a brickwalled tinroofed shed warm with the days heat a crowd of natives laughing and talking somewhere behind in the darkness we knew each other so well by that time that we had finished discussing every conceivable topic of conversationthe whereabouts of the mahdis head for instancework reward despair acknowledgment flat failure all the real motives that had driven us to do anything and all our other longings so we sat still and let the stars move as men must do when they meet this kind of train  presently i asked what is the name of the next station out from here  station number one said a ghost  and the next  station number two and so on to eight i think  and wasnt it worth while to name even one of these stations from some man living or dead who had something to do with making the line  well they didnt anyhow said another ghost i suppose they didnt think it worth while why what do you think  i think i replied it is the sort of snobbery that nations go to hades for  her headlight showed at last an immense distance off the economic electrics were turned up the ghosts vanished the dragomans of the various steamers flowed forward in beautiful garments to meet their passengers who had booked passages in the cook boats and the khartoum train decanted a joyous collection of folk all decorated with horns hoofs skins hides knives and assegais which they had been buying at omdurman and when the porters laid hold upon their bristling bundles it was like macneills zareba without the camels  two young men in tarboushes were the only people who had no part in the riot said one of them to the other  hullo  said the other hullo  they grunted together for a while then one pleasantly  oh im sorry for that i thought i was going to have you under me for a bit then youll use the resthouse there  i suppose so said the other do you happen to know if the roofs on  here a woman wailed aloud for her dervish spear which had gone adrift and i shall never know except from the back pages of the soudan almanack what state that resthouse there is in  the soudan administration by the little i heard is a queer service it extends itself in silence from the edges of abyssinia to the swamps of the equator at an average pressure of one white man to several thousand square miles it legislates according to the custom of the tribe where possible and on the common sense of the moment when there is no precedent it is recruited almost wholly from the army armed chiefly with binoculars and enjoys a deathrate a little lower than its own reputation it is said to be the only service in which a man taking leave is explicitly recommended to get out of the country and rest himself that he may return the more fit to his job a high standard of intelligence is required and lapses are not overlooked for instance one man on leave in london took the wrong train from boulogne and instead of going to paris which of course he had intended found himself at a station called kirk kilissie or adrianople west where he stayed for some weeks it was a mistake that might have happened to any one on a dark night after a stormy passage but the authorities would not believe it and when i left egypt were busily engaged in boiling him in hot oil they are grossly respectable in the soudan now  long and long ago before even the philippines were taken a friend of mine was reprimanded by a british member of parliament first for the sin of bloodguiltiness because he was by trade a soldier next for murder because he had fought in great battles and lastly and most important because he and his fellowbraves had saddled the british taxpayer with the expense of the soudan my friend explained that all the soudan had ever cost the british taxpayer was the price of about one dozen of regulation union jacksone for each province that said the mp triumphantly is all it will ever be worth he went on to justify himself and the soudan went on also today it has taken its place as one of those accepted miracles which are worked without heat or headlines by men who do the job nearest their hand and seldom fuss about their reputations  but less than sixteen years ago the length and breadth of it was one crazy hell of murder torture and lust where every man who had a sword used it till he met a stronger and became a slave it wasmen say who remember ita hysteria of blood and fanaticism and precisely as an hysterical woman is called to her senses by a dash of cold water so at the battle of omdurman the land was reduced to sanity by applied death on such a scale as the murderers and the torturers at their most unbridled could scarcely have dreamed in a day and a night all who had power and authority were wiped out and put under till as the old song says no chief remained to ask after any follower they had all charged into paradise the people who were left looked for renewed massacres of the sort they had been accustomed to and when these did not come they said helplessly we have nothing we are nothing will you sell us into slavery among the egyptians the men who remember the old days of the reconstructionwhich deserves an epic of its ownsay that there was nothing left to build on not even wreckage knowledge decency kinship property tide sense of possession had all gone the people were told they were to sit still and obey orders and they stared and fumbled like dazed crowds after an explosion bit by bit however they were fed and watered and marshalled into some sort of order set to tasks they never dreamed to see the end of and almost by physical force pushed and hauled along the ways of mere life they came to understand presently that they might reap what they had sown and that man even a woman might walk for a days journey with two goats and a native bedstead and live undespoiled but they had to be taught kindergartenfashion  and little by little as they realised that the new order was sure and that their ancient oppressors were quite dead there returned not only cultivators craftsmen and artisans but outlandish men of war scarred with old wounds and the generous dimples that the martinihenry bullet used to dealfighting men on the lookout for new employ they would hang about first on one leg then on the other proud or uneasily friendly till some white officer circulated near by and at his fourth or fifth passing brown and white having approved each other by eye the talkso men saywould run something like this  officer with air of sudden discovery oh you by the hut there what is your business  warrior at attention complicated by attempt to salute i am soandso son of soandso from such and such a place  officer i hear and   warrior repeating salute and a fighting man also  officer impersonally to horizon but they all say that nowadays  warrior very loudly but there is a man in one of your battalions who can testify to it he is the grandson of my fathers uncle  officer confidentially to his boots hell is quite full of such grandsons of just such fathers uncles and how do i know if private soandso speaks the truth about his family makes to go  warrior swiftly removing necessary garments perhaps but these dont lie look i got this ten twelve years ago when i was quite a lad close to the old border yes halfa it was a true snider bullet feel it this little one on the leg i got at the big fight that finished it all last year but i am not lame violent legexercise not in the least lame see i run i jump i kick praised be allah  officer praised be allah and then  warrior coquettishly then i shoot i am not a common spearman lapse into english yeh dam goo shot pumps lever of imaginary martini  officer unmoved i see and then  warrior indignantly i am come hereafter many days marching change to childlike wheedle are all the regiments full  at this point the relative in uniform generally discovered himself and if the officer liked the cut of his jib another old mahdis man would be added to the machine that made itself as it rolled along they dealt with situations in those days by the unclouded light of reason and a certain high and holy audacity  there is a tale of two sheikhs shortly after the reconstruction began one of them abdullah of the river prudent and the son of a slavewoman professed loyalty to the english very early in the day and used that loyalty as a cloak to lift camels from another sheikh farid of the desert still at war with the english but a perfect gentleman which abdullah was not naturally farid raided back on abdullahs kine abdullah complained to the authorities and the border fermented to farid in his desert camp with a clutch of abdullahs cattle round him entered alone and unarmed the officer responsible for the peace of those parts after compliments for they had had dealings with each other before youve been driving abdullahs stock again said the englishman  i should think i had was the hot answer he lifts my camels and scuttles back into your territory where he knows i cant follow him for the life and when i try to get a bit of my own back he whines to you hes a cadan utter cad  at any rate he is loyal if youd only come in and be loyal too youd both be on the same footing and then if he stole from you hed catch it  hed never dare to steal except under your protection give him what hed have got in the mahdis timea firstclass flogging you know he deserves it  im afraid that isnt allowed you have to let me shift all those bullocks of his back again  and if i dont  then i shall have to ride back and collect all my men and begin war against you  but what prevents my cutting your throat where you sit  for one thing you arent abdullah and  there you confess hes a cad  and for another the government would only send another officer who didnt understand your ways and then there would be war and no one would score except abdullah hed steal your camels and get credit for it  so he would the scoundrel this is a hard world for honest men now you admit abdullah is a cad listen to me and ill tell you a few more things about him he was etc etc he is etc etc  youre perfectly right sheikh but dont you see i cant tell him what i think of him so long as hes loyal and youre out against us now if you come in i promise you that ill give abdullah a tellingoffyes in your presencethat will do you good to listen to  no i wont come in buti tell you what i will do ill accompany you tomorrow as your guest understand to your camp then you send for abdullah and if i judge that his fat face has been sufficiently blackened in my presence ill think about coming in later  so it was arranged and they slept out the rest of the night side by side and in the morning they gathered up and returned all abdullahs cattle and in the evening in farids presence abdullah got the tonguelashing of his wicked old life and farid of the desert laughed and came in and they all lived happy ever afterwards  somewhere or other in the nearer provinces the old heady game must be going on still but the soudan proper has settled to civilisation of the brickbungalow and bougainvillea sort and there is a huge technical college where the young men are trained to become fitters surveyors draftsmen and telegraph employees at fabulous wages in due time they will forget how warily their fathers had to walk in the mahdis time to secure even half a bellyful then as has happened elsewhere they will honestly believe that they themselves originally created and since then have upheld the easy life into which they were bought at so heavy a price then the demand will go up for extension of local government soudan for the soudanese and so on till the whole cycle has to be retrodden it is a hard law but an old onerome died learning it as our western civilisation may diethat if you give any man anything that he has not painfully earned for himself you infallibly make him or his descendants your devoted enemies    the end
