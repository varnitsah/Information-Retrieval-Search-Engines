17969312	the puzzle of dickenss last plot     introduction    forster tells us that dickens in his later novels from bleak house onwards 1853 assiduously cultivated construction this essential of his art  some critics may think that since so many of the best novels in the world have no outline or if they have an outline it is a demned outline elaborate construction is not absolutely essential  really essential are character atmosphere humour  but as in the natural changes of life and under the strain of restless and unsatisfied activity his old buoyancy and unequalled high spirits deserted dickens he certainly wrote no longer in what scott speaking of himself calls the manner of hab nab at a venture  he constructed elaborate plots rich in secrets and surprises  he emulated the manner of wilkie collins or even of gaboriau while he combined with some of the elements of the detective novel or roman policier careful study of character except great expectations none of his later tales rivals in merit his early picaresque stories of the road such as pickwick and nicholas nickleby  youth will be served no sedulous care could compensate for the exuberance of the first sprightly runnings in the early books the melodrama of the plot the secrets of ralph nickleby of monk of jonas chuzzlewit were the least of the innumerable attractions  but dickens was more and more drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity and to the game of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret  in april 1869 dickens outworn by the strain of his american readings of that labour achieved under painful conditions of ominously bad healthfound himself as sir thomas watson reported on the brink of an attack of paralysis of his left side and possibly of apoplexy  he therefore abandoned a new series of readings  we think of scotts earlier seizures of a similar kind after which peveril he said smacked of the apoplexy  but dickenss new story of the mystery of edwin drood first contemplated in july 1869 and altered in character by the emergence of a very curious and new idea early in august does not smack of the apoplexy  we may think that the mannerisms of mr honeythunder the philanthropist and of miss twinkleton the schoolmistress are not in the authors best vein of humour  the billickin on the other hand the lodginghouse keeper is in very gracious fooling her unlookedfor sallies in skirmishes with miss twinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises  mr grewgious may be caricatured too much but not out of reason and dickens always good at boys presents a gamin in deputy who is in not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic jo of bleak house  opinions may differ as to edwin and rosa but the more closely one studies edwin the better one thinks of that character  as far as we are allowed to see helena landless the restraint which she puts on her tigerish blood is admirable  she is very fresh and original  the villain is all that melodrama can desire but what we do miss i think is the atmosphere of a small cathedral town  here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment  on the other hand the opium den is studied from the life  on the whole dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot his secret his surprises his game of hide and seek with the reader  he threw himself into the sport with zest  he spoke to his sisterinlaw miss hogarth about his fear that he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest numbers  yet when he died in june 1870 leaving three completed numbers still unpublished he left his secret as a puzzle to the curious  many efforts have been made to decipher his purpose especially his intentions as to the hero  was edwin drood killed or did he escape  by a coincidence in september 1869 dickens was working over the late lord lyttons tale for all the year round the disappearance of john ackland for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether ackland was alive or dead  but he was conspicuously defunct  all the year round septemberoctober 1869  the most careful of the attempts at a reply about edwin a study based on deep knowledge of dickens is watched by the dead by the late ingenious mr r a proctor 1887  this book to which i owe much aid is now out of print  in 1905 mr cuming walters revived the auld mysterie in his clues to dickenss edwin drood chapman  hall and heywood manchester  from the solution of mr walters i am obliged to dissent  of mr proctors theory i offer some necessary corrections and i hope that i have unravelled some skeins which mr proctor left in a state of tangle  as one read and reread the fragment points very dark seemed at least to become suddenly clear  especially one appeared to understand the meaning halfrevealed and halfconcealed by jaspers babblings under the influence of opium  he saw in his vision that i never saw that before  we may be sure that he was to see that in real life  we must remember that according to forster such was dickenss interest in things supernatural that but for the strong restraining power of his common sense he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism  his interest in such matters certainly peeps out in this novelthere are two specimens of the supernormaland he may have gone to the limited extent which my hypothesis requires  if i am right dickens went further and fared worse in the too material premonitions of the signalman in mugby junction  with this brief preface i proceed to the analysis of dickenss last plot  mr william archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions but is responsible for none of my theories  andrew lang st andrews september 4 1905    the storydramatis personae    for the discovery of dickenss secret in edwin drood it is necessary to obtain a clear view of the characters in the tale and of their relations to each other  about the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in cloisterham a cathedral city sketched from rochester a young university man mr bud who had a friend mr drood one of a firm of engineerssomewhere  they were fast friends and old college companions  both married young  mr bud wedded a lady unnamed by whom he was the father of one child a daughter rosa bud  mr drood whose wifes maiden name was jasper had one son edwin drood  mrs bud was drowned in a boating accident when her daughter rosa was a child  mr drood already a widower and the bereaved mr bud betrothed the two children rosa and edwin and then expired when the orphans were about seven and eleven years old  the guardian of rosa was a lawyer mr grewgious who had been in love with her mother  to grewgious mr bud entrusted his wifes engagement ring rubies and diamonds which grewgious was to hand over to edwin drood if when he attained his majority he and rosa decided to marry  grewgious was apparently legal agent for edwin while edwins maternal uncle john jasper aged about sixteen when the male parents died was edwins trustee as well as his uncle and devoted friend  rosas little fortune was an annuity producing 250 pounds ayear  edwin succeeded to his fathers share in an engineering firm  when the story opens edwin is nearly twentyone and is about to proceed to egypt as an engineer  rosa at school in cloisterham is about seventeen john jasper is twentysix  he is conductor of the choir of the cathedral a lay precentor he is very dark with thick black whiskers and for a number of years has been a victim to the habit of opium smoking  he began very early  he takes this drug both in his lodgings over the gate of the cathedral and in a den in east london kept by a woman nicknamed the princess puffer  this hag we learn has been a determined drunkardi drank heavenshardfor sixteen years before she took to opium  if she has been dealing in opium for ten years the exact period is not stated she has been very disreputable for twentysix years that is ever since john jaspers birth  mr cuming walters suggests that she is the mother of john jasper and therefore maternal grandmother of edwin drood  she detests her client jasper and plays the spy on his movements for reasons unexplained  jasper is secretly in love with rosa the fiancee of his nephew and his own pupil in the musical art  he makes her aware of his passion silently and she fears and detests him but keeps these emotions private  she is a saucy schoolgirl and she and edwin are on uncomfortable terms  she does not love him while he perhaps does love her but is annoyed by her manner and by the gossip about their betrothal  the bloom is off the plum of their prearranged loves he says to his friend uncle and confidant jasper whose own concealed passion for rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character  rosa is aware of this fact a glaze comes over his eyes sometimes she says and he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream in which he threatens most     the man appears to have these frightful dreams even when he is not under opium   opening of the tale   the tale opens abruptly with an opiumbred vision of the tower of cloisterham cathedral beheld by jasper as he awakens in the den of the princess puffer between a chinaman a lascar and the hag herself  this cathedral tower thus early and emphatically introduced is to play a great but more or less mysterious part in the romance  that is certain  jasper waking makes experiments on the talk of the old woman the lascar and chinaman in their sleep  he pronounces it unintelligible which satisfies him that his own babble when under opium must be unintelligible also  he is presumably acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of india and with chinese otherwise how could he hope to understand the sleepers  he is being watched by the hag who hates him  jasper returns to cloisterham where we are introduced to the dean a nonentity and to minor canon crisparkle a muscular christian in the pink of training a classical scholar and a good honest fellow  jasper gives edwin a dinner and gushes over his bright boy a lively lad full of chaff but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of heart  edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore  jasper admits that he loathes his life and that the church singing often sounds to me quite devilishand no wonder after this dinner jasper has a weird seizure a strange film comes over jaspers eyes he looks frightfully ill becomes rigid and admits that he has been taking opium for a pain an agony that sometimes overcomes me  this agony we learn is the pain of hearing edwin speak lightly of his love whom jasper so furiously desires  take it as a warning jasper says but edwin puzzled and full of confiding tenderness does not understand  in the next scene we meet the schoolgirl rosa who takes a walk and has a tiff with edwin  sir luke fildess illustration shows edwin as a lad with the bloom of a lass with a classic profile and a gracious head of long thick fair hair long though we learn it has just been cut  he wears a soft slouched hat and the peacoat of the period   sapsea and durdles   next jasper and sapsea a pompous ass auctioneer and mayor sit at their wine expecting a third guest  mr sapsea reads his absurd epitaph for his late wife who is buried in a monument a vault of some sort in the cathedral churchyard  to them enter durdles a man never sober yet trusted with the key of the crypt as contractor for rough repairs  in the crypt he habitually sleeps off the fumes of liquor  of course no dean would entrust keys to this incredibly dissipated dirty and insolent creature to whom sapsea gives the key of his vault for no reason at all as the epitaph of course is to be engraved on the outside by durdless men  however durdles insists on getting the key of the vault  he has two other large keys  jasper trifling with them keeps clinking them together so as to know even in the dark by the sound which is the key that opens sapseas vault in the railedoff burial ground beside the cloister arches  he has met durdles at sapseas for no other purpose than to obtain access at will to mrs sapseas monument  later in the evening jasper finds durdles more or less drunk and being stoned by a gamin deputy a retainer of a tramps lodginghouse  durdles fees deputy in fact to drive him home every night after ten  jasper and deputy fall into feud and jasper has thus a new keen and omnipresent enemy  as he walks with durdles that worthy explains in reply to a question by jasper that by tapping a wall even if over six feet thick with his hammer he can detect the nature of the contents of the vault solid in hollow and inside solid hollow again  old un crumbled away in stone coffin in vault  he can also discover the presence of rubbish left in that same six foot space by durdless men  thus if a foreign body were introduced into the sapsea vault durdles could detect its presence by tapping the outside wall  as jaspers purpose clearly is to introduce a foreign bodythat of edwin who stands between him and rosainto mrs sapseas vault this gift of durdles is for jasper an uncomfortable discovery  he goes home watches edwin asleep and smokes opium   the landlesses   two new characters are now introduced neville and helena landless 1 twins orphans of cingalese extraction probably eurasian very dark the girl almost of the gipsy type both are fierce of look  the young man is to read with canon crisparkle and live with him the girl goes to the same school as rosa  the education of both has been utterly neglected instruction has been denied to them  neville explains the cause of their fierceness to crisparkle  in ceylon they were bullied by a cruel stepfather and several times ran away  the girl was the leader always dressed as a boy and showing the daring of a man  edwin droods air of supercilious ownership of rosa bud indicated as a fault of youth and circumstance not of heart and character irritates neville landless who falls in love with rosa at first sight  as rosa sings at crisparkles while jasper plays the piano jaspers fixed stare produces an hysterical fit in the girl who is soothed by helena landless  helena shows her aversion to jasper who as even edwin now sees frightens rosa  you would be afraid of him under similar circumstances wouldnt you miss landless asks edwin  not under any circumstances answers helena and jasper thanks miss landless for this vindication of his character  the girls go back to their school where rosa explains to helena her horror of jaspers silent lovemaking  i feel that i am never safe from him    a glaze comes over his eyes and he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream in which he threatens most as already quoted  helena thus and she alone except rosa understands jasper thoroughly  she becomes rosas protectress let whomsoever it most concerned look well to it  thus jasper has a new observer and enemy in addition to the omnipresent street boy deputy and the detective old hag of the opium den  leaving the canons house neville and edwin quarrel violently over rosa in the open air they are followed by jasper and taken to his house to be reconciled over glasses of mulled wine  jasper drugs the wine and thus provokes a violent scene next day he tells crisparkle that neville is murderous  there is something of the tiger in his dark blood  he spreads the story of the fracas in the town  grewgious rosas guardian now comes down on business the girl fails to explain to him the unsatisfactory relations between her and edwin  grewgious is to return to her at christmas if she sends for him and she does send  grewgious an angular man all duty and sentiment he had loved rosas mother has an interview with edwins trustee jasper for whom he has no enthusiasm but whom he does not in any way suspect  they part on good terms to meet at christmas  crisparkle with whom helena has fallen suddenly in love arranges with jasper that edwin and landless shall meet and be reconciled as both are willing to be at a dinner in jaspers rooms on christmas eve  jasper when crisparkle proposes this denotes by his manner some close internal calculation  we see that he is reckoning how the dinner suits his plan of campaign and close calculation may refer as in mr proctors theory to the period of the moon  on christmas eve there will be no moonshine at midnight  jasper having worked out this problem accepts crisparkles proposal and his assurances about neville and shows crisparkle a diary in which he has entered his fears that edwins life is in danger from neville  edwin who is not in cloisterham at this moment accepts by letter the invitation to meet neville at jaspers on christmas eve  meanwhile edwin visits grewgious in his london chambers is lectured on his laggard and supercilious behaviour as a lover and receives the engagement ring of the late mrs bud rosas mother which is very dear to grewgiousin the presence of bazzard grewgiouss clerk a gloomy writer of an amateur unacted tragedy edwin is to return the ring to grewgious if he and rosa decide not to marry  the ring is in a case and edwin places it in his breast  we must understand in the breastpocket of his coat  no other interpretation will pass muster  her ringwill it come back to me reflects the mournful grewgious   the unaccountable expedition   jasper now tells sapsea and the dean that he is to make a moonlight expedition with durdles among the tombs vaults towers and ruins tonight  the impossible durdles has the keys necessary for this surely an unaccountable expedition dickens keeps remarking  the moon seems to rise on this night at about 730 pm jasper takes a big casebottle of liquordrugged of course and goes to the den of durdles  in the yard of this inspector of monuments he is bidden to beware of a mound of quicklime near the yard gate  with a little handy stirring quick enough to eat your bones says durdles  there is some considerable distance between this mound of quicklime and the crypt of which durdles has the key but the intervening space is quite empty of human presence as the citizens are unwilling to meet ghosts  in the crypt durdles drinks a good deal of the drugged liquor they are to ascend the great towerand why they do that is part of the mystery though not an insoluble part  before they climb durdles tells jasper that he was drunk and asleep in the crypt last christmas eve and was wakened by the ghost of one terrific shriek followed by the ghost of the howl of a dog a long dismal woeful howl such as a dog gives when a persons dead  durdles has made inquiries and as no one else heard the shriek and the howl he calls these sounds ghosts  they are obviously meant to be understood as supranormal premonitory sounds of the nature of second sight or rather of second hearing  forster gives examples of dickenss tendency to believe in such premonitions  dickens had himself a curious premonitory dream  he considerably overdid the premonitory business in his otherwise excellent story the signalman or so it seems to a student of these things  the shriek and howl heard by durdles are to be repeated we see in real life later on a christmas eve  the question iswhen  more probably not on the christmas eve just imminent when edwin is to vanish but on the christmas eve following when jasper is to be unmasked  all this while and later jasper examines durdles very closely studying the effects on him of the drugged drink  when they reach the top of the tower jasper closely contemplates that stillest part of it the landscape which the cathedral overshadows but he contemplates durdles quite as curiously  there is a motive for the scrutiny in either case  jasper examines the part of the precincts in the shadow of the cathedral because he wishes to assure himself that it is lonely enough for his later undescribed but easily guessed proceedings in this night of mystery  he will have much to do that could not brook witnesses after the drugged durdles has fallen sound asleep  we have already been assured that the whole area over which jasper is to operate is utterly deserted even when it lies in full moonlight about 830 pm  one might fancy that the tide of life was stemmed by mr jaspers own gatehouse  the people of cloisterham we hear would deny that they believe in ghosts but they give this part of the precinct a wide berth chapter xii  if the region is utterly deserted at nine oclock in the evening when it lies in the ivory moonlight much more will it be free from human presence when it lies in shadow between one and two oclock after midnight jasper however from the tower top closely scrutinizes the area of his future operations  it is probably for this very purpose of discovering whether the coast be clear or not that jasper climbs the tower  he watches durdles for the purpose of finding how the drug which he has administered works with a view to future operations on edwin durdles is now in such a state that he deems the ground so far below on a level with the tower and would as lief walk off the tower into the air as not  all this is apparently meant to suggest that jasper on christmas eve will repeat his expedition with edwin whom he will have drugged and that he will allow edwin to walk off the tower into the air  there are later suggestions to the same effect as we shall see but they are deliberately misleading  there are also strong suggestions to the very opposite effect  it is broadly indicated that jasper is to strangle edwin with a thick blacksilk scarf which he has just taken to wearing for the good of his throat  the pair return to the crypt durdles falls asleep dreams that jasper leaves him and that something touches him and something falls from his hand  then something clinks and gropes about and the lines of moonlight shift their direction as durdles finds that they have really done when he wakens with jasper beside him while the cathedral clock strikes two  they have had many hours not less than five for their expedition  the key of the crypt lies beside durdles on the ground  they go out and as deputy begins stonethrowing jasper half strangles him   purpose of the expedition   jasper has had ample time to take models in wax of all durdless keys  but he could have done that in a few minutes while durdles slept if he had wax with him without leaving the crypt  he has also had time to convey several wheelbarrowfuls of quicklime from durdless yard to mrs sapseas sepulchre of which monument he probably took the key from durdles and tried its identity by clinking  but even in a cathedral town even after midnight several successive expeditions of a lay precentor with a wheelbarrow full of quicklime would have been apt to attract the comment of some belated physician some cleric coming from a sick bed or some local roysterers  therefore it is that dickens insists on the utterly deserted character of the area and shows us that jasper has made sure of that essential fact by observations from the tower top  still his was a perilous expedition with his wheelbarrow  we should probably learn later that jasper was detected by the wakeful deputy who loathed him  moreover next morning durdles was apt to notice that some of his quicklime had been removed  as far as is shown durdles noticed nothing of that kind though he does observe peculiarities in jaspers behaviour  the next point in the tale is that edwin and rosa meet and have sense enough to break off their engagement  but edwin represented as really goodhearted now begins to repent his past behaviour and though he has a kind of fancy for miss landless he pretty clearly falls deeper in love with his late fiancee and weeps his loss in private  so we are told   christmas eve   christmas eve comes the day of the dinner of three jasper landless and edwin  the chapter describing this fateful day xiv is headed when shall these three meet again and mr proctor argues that dickens intends that they shall meet again the intention and the hint are much in dickenss manner landless means to start next day very early on a solitary walking tour and buys an exorbitantly heavy stick  we casually hear that jasper knows edwin to possess no jewellery except a watch and chain and a scarfpin  as edwin moons about he finds the old opium hag come down from london seeking a needle in a bottle of hay she saysthat is hunting vainly for jasper  please remark that jasper has run up to town on december 23 and has saturated his system with a debauch of opium on the very eve of the day when he clearly means to kill edwin  this was a most injudicious indulgence in the circumstances  a maiden murder needs nerve  we know that fiddlestrings was weakness to express the state of jaspers nerves on the day after the night of opium with which the story opens  on december 24 jasper returned home the hag at his heels  the old woman when met by edwin has a curious film over her eyes he seems to know her  great heaven he thinks next moment  like jack that night  this refers to a kind of fit of jaspers after dinner on the first evening of the story  edwin has then seen jack jasper in one of his filmy seizures  the woman prays edwin for three shillings and sixpence to buy opium  he gives her the money she asks his christian name  edwin  is eddy a sweethearts form of that he says that he has no sweetheart  he is told to be thankful that his name is not ned  now jasper alone calls edwin ned  ned is a threatened name a dangerous name says the hag who has heard jasper threaten ned in his opium dreams  edwin determines to tell this adventure to jasper but not on this night  tomorrow will do  now did he tell the story to jasper that night in the presence of landless at dinner  if so helena landless might later learn the fact from neville  if she knew it she would later tell mr grewgious  the three men meet and dine  there is a fearful storm  stones are displaced upon the summit of the great tower  next morning early jasper yells to crisparkle who is looking out of his window in minor canon row that edwin has disappeared  neville has already set out on his walking tour   after the disappearance   men go forth and apprehend neville who shows fight with his heavy stick  we learn that he and drood left jaspers house at midnight went for ten minutes to look at the river under the wind and parted at crisparkles door  neville now remains under suspicion jasper directs the search in the river on december 25 26 and 27 on the evening of december 27 grewgious visits jasper  now grewgious as we know was to be at cloisterham at christmas true he was engaged to dine on christmas day with bazzard his clerk but thoughtful as he was of the moody bazzard as edwin was leaving cloisterham he would excuse himself  he would naturally take a great part in the search for edwin above all as edwin had in his possession the ring so dear to the lawyer  edwin had not shown it to rosa when they determined to part  he kept it in his breast and the ring we learn was gifted with invincible force to hold and drag so dickens warns us  the ring is obviously to be a piece de conviction  but our point at present is that we do not know how grewgious to whom this ring was so dear employed himself at cloisterhamafter edwins disappearancebetween december 25 and december 27  on the evening of the 27th he came to jasper saying i have just left miss landless  he then slowly and watchfully told jasper that edwins engagement was broken off while the precentor gasped perspired tore his hair shrieked and finally subsided into a heap of muddy clothes on the floor  meanwhile mr grewgious calmly observing these phenomena warmed his hands at the fire for some time before he called in jaspers landlady  grewgious now knows by jaspers behaviour that he believes himself to have committed a superfluous crime by murdering edwin who no longer stood between him and rosa as their engagement was already at an end  whether a jasper in real life would excite himself so much is another question  we do not know as mr proctor insists what mr grewgious had been doing at cloisterham between christmas day and december 27 the date of his experiment on jaspers nerves mr proctor supposes him to have met the living edwin and obtained information from him after his escape from a murderous attack by jasper  mr proctor insists that this is the only explanation of grewgiouss conduct any other is absolutely impossible  in that case the experiment of grewgious was not made to gain information from jaspers demeanour but was the beginning of his punishment and was intended by grewgious to be so  but dickens has been careful to suggest with suspicious breadth of candour another explanation of the source of grewgiouss knowledge  if edwin has really escaped and met grewgious dickens does not want us to be sure of that as mr proctor was sure dickens deliberately puts his readers on another trail though neither mr walters nor mr proctor struck the scent  as we have noted grewgious at once says to jasper i have just come from miss landless  this tells jasper nothing but it tells a great deal to the watchful reader who remembers that miss landless and she only is aware that jasper loves bullies and insults rosa and that rosas life is embittered by jaspers silent wooing and his unspoken threats  helena may also know that ned is a threatened name as we have seen and that the menace comes from jasper  as jasper is now known to be edwins rival in love and as edwin has vanished the murderer mr grewgious reckons is jasper and his experiment with jaspers consequent shriek and fit confirms the hypothesis  thus grewgious had information enough from miss landless to suggest his experimentdickens intentionally made that clear though not clear enough for mr proctor and mr cuming walterswhile his experiment gives him a moral certainty of jaspers crime but yields no legal evidence  but does grewgious know no more than what helena and the fit and shriek of jasper have told him  is his knowledge limited to the evidence that jasper has murdered edwin  or does grewgious know more know that edwin in some way has escaped from death  that is dickenss secret  but whereas grewgious if he believes jasper to be an actual murderer should take him seriously in point of fact he speaks of jasper in so light a tone as our local friend that we feel no certainty that he is not really aware of edwins escape from a murderous attack by jasper and of his continued existence  presently crisparkle under some mysterious impression apparently telepathic the book is rich in such psychical phenomena visits the weir on the river at night and next day finds edwins watch and chain in the timbers his scarfpin in the pool below  the watch and chain must have been placed purposely where they were found they could not float thither and if neville had slain edwin he would not have stolen his property of course except as a blind neutralised by the placing of the watch in a conspicuous spot  however the increased suspicions drive neville away to read law in staple inn where grewgious also dwells and incessantly watches neville out of his window  about six months later helena landless is to join neville who is watched at intervals by jasper who again is watched by grewgious as the precentor lurks about staple inn   dick datchery   about the time when helena leaves cloisterham for town a new character appears in cloisterham a whiteheaded personage with black eyebrows buttoned up in a tightish blue surtout with a buff waistcoat grey trowsers and something of a military air  his shock of white hair was unusually thick and ample  this man a buffer living idly on his means named datchery is either as mr proctor believed edwin drood or as mr walters thinks helena landless  by making grewgious drop the remark that bazzard his clerk a moping owl of an amateur tragedian is off duty here at his chambers dickens hints that bazzard is datchery  but that is a mere false scent a ruse of the author scattering paper in the wrong place in this long paper hunt  as for helena mr walters justly argues that dickens has marked her for some important part in the ruin of jasper  there was a slumbering gleam of fire in her intense dark eyes  let whomsoever it most concerned look well to it  again we have been told that helena had high courage  she had told jasper that she feared him in no circumstances whatever  again we have learned that in childhood she had dressed as a boy when she ran away from home and she had the motives of protecting rosa and her brother neville from the machinations of jasper who needs watching as he is trying to ruin nevilles already dilapidated character and by spying on him to break down his nerve  really of course neville is quite safe  there is no corpus delicti no carcase of the missing edwin drood  for the reasons given datchery might be helena in disguise  if so the idea is highly ludicrous while nothing is proved either by the blackness of datcherys eyebrows helenas were black or by datcherys habit of carrying his hat under his arm not on his head  a person who goes so far as to wear a conspicuous white wig would not be afraid also to dye his eyebrows black if he were edwin while either edwin or helena must have made up the face by the use of paint and sham wrinkles  either helena or edwin would have been detected in real life of course but we allow for the accepted fictitious convention of successful disguise and for the necessities of the novelist  a tightly buttoned surtout would show helenas feminine figure but let that also pass  as to the hat edwins own hair was long and thick  add a wig and his hat would be a burden to him  what is most unlike the stern fierce sententious helena is datcherys habit of chaffing  he fools the ass of a mayor sapsea by most exaggerated diference  his tone is always that of indolent mockery which one doubts whether the intense and concentrated helena could assume  he takes rooms in the same house as jasper to whom as to durdles and deputy he introduces himself on the night of his arrival at cloisterham  he afterwards addresses deputy the little gamin by the name winks which is given to him by the people at the tramps lodgings  the name is a secret of deputys   jasper rosa and tartar   meanwhile jasper formally proposes to rosa in the school garden standing apart and leaning against a sundial as the garden is commanded by many windows  he offers to resign his hopes of bringing landless to the gallows perhaps this bad man would provide a corpus delicti of his own making if rosa will accept him  he threatens to pursue her to the death if she will not he frightens her so thoroughly that she rushes to grewgious in his chambers in london  she now suspects jasper of edwins murder but keeps her thoughts to herself  she tells grewgious who is watching nevillei have a fancy for keeping him under my eye that jasper has made love to her and grewgious replies in a parody of god save the king   on thee his hopes to fix damn him again   would he fool thus if he knew jasper to have killed edwin  he is not certain whether rosa should visit helena next day in landlesss rooms opposite and mr walters suggests that he may be aware that helena dressed as datchery is really absent at cloisterham  however next day helena is in her brothers rooms moreover it is really a sufficient explanation of grewgiouss doubt that jasper is lurking around and that not till next day is a private way of communication arranged between neville and his friends  in any case next day helena is in her brothers rooms and by aid of a mr tartars rooms she and rosa can meet privately  there is a good deal of conspiring to watch jasper when he watches neville and in this new friend mr tartar a lover is provided for rosa  tartar is a miraculously agile climber over roofs and up walls a retired lieutenant of the navy and a handy man being such a climber to chase jasper about the roof of the cathedral when jaspers day of doom arrives   jaspers opium visions   in july jasper revisits the london opium den and talks under opium watched by the old hag  he speaks of a thing which he often does in visions  a hazardous and perilous journey over abysses where a slip would be destruction  look down look down  you see what lies at the bottom there  he enacts the vision and says there was a fellow traveller  he speaks in a whisper and as if in the dark  the vision is in this case a poor vision  no struggle no consciousness of peril no entreaty  edwin in the reminiscent vision dies very easily and rapidly  when it comes to be real at last it is so short that it seems unreal for the first time  and yet i never saw that before  look what a poor miserable mean thing it is  that must be real  its over  what can all this mean  we have been told that shortly before christmas eve jasper took to wearing a thick blacksilk handkerchief for his throat  he hung it over his arm his face knitted and stern as he entered his house for his christmas eve dinner  if he strangled edwin with the scarf as we are to suppose he did not lead him drugged to the tower top and pitch him off  is part of jaspers vision reminiscentthe brief unresisting deathwhile another part is a separate vision is prospective premonitory  does he see himself pitching neville landless off the tower top or see him fallen from the cathedral roof  is nevilles body thati never saw that before  look what a poor miserable mean thing it is  that must be real jasper never saw thatthe dead body below the heightbefore this vision i think is of the future not of the past and is meant to bewilder the reader who thinks that the whole represents the slaying of drood  the tale is rich in warnings and telepathy   datchery and the opium woman   the hag now tracks jasper home to cloisterham  here she meets datchery whom she asks how she can see jasper  if datchery is drood he now learns what he did not know before that there is some connection between jasper and the hag  he walks with her to the place where edwin met the hag on christmas eve and gave her money and he jingles his own money as he walks  the place or the sound of the money makes the woman tell datchery about edwins gift of three shillings and sixpence for opium  datchery with a sudden change of countenance gives her a sudden look  it does not follow that he is not drood for though the hags love of opium was known to drood datchery is not to reveal his recognition of the woman  he does what any stranger would do he gives a sudden look as if surprised by the mention of opium  mr walters says drood would not have changed countenance on hearing a fact he had known six months previously  but if drood was playing at being somebody else he would of course give a kind of start and stare on hearing of the opium  when he also hears from the hag that her former benefactors name was edwin he asks her how she knew thata fatuously unnecessary question says mr walters  a needless question for datcherys information if he be drood but as useful a question as another if drood be datchery and wishes to maintain the conversation   datcherys score   datchery keeps a tavern score of his discoveries behind a door in cryptic chalk strokes  he does this says mr walters because being helena he would betray himself if he wrote in a female hand but nobody would write secrets on a door  he adds a moderate stroke after meeting the hag though says mr walters edwin drood would have learned nothing new whatever from the hag  but edwin would have learned something quite new and very importantthat the hag was hunting jasper  next day datchery sees the woman shake her fists at jasper in church and hears from her that she knows jasper better far than all the reverend parsons put together know him  datchery then adds a long thick line to his chalked score yet says mr walters datchery has learned nothing new to edwin drood if alive  this is an obvious error  it is absolutely new to edwin drood that the opium hag is intimately acquainted with his uncle jasper and hates jasper with a deadly hatred  all this is not only new to drood if alive but is rich in promise of further revelations drood on christmas eve had learned from the hag only that she took opium and that she had come from town to cloisterham and had hunted for a needle in a bottle of hay  that was the sum of his information  now he learns that the woman knows tracks has found and hates his worthy uncle jasper  he may well therefore add a heavy mark to his score  we must also ask how could helena fresh from ceylon know the old tavern way of keeping scores  illegible except to the scorer the scorer not committed the scored debited with what is against him as datchery observes  an eurasian girl of twenty new to england would not argue thus with herself  she would probably know nothing of english tavern scores  we do not hear that helena ever opened a book  we do know that education had been denied to her  what acquaintance could she have with old english tavern customs  if drood is datchery then dickens used a form of a very old and favourite ficelle of his  the watching of a villain by an improbable and unsuspected person in this case thought to be dead if helena is datchery the assumption or personation is in the highest degree improbable her whole bearing is quite out of her possibilities and the personation is very absurd  here the story ends    theories of the mystery    forsters evidence   we have some external evidence as to dickenss solution of his own problem from forster 2  on august 6 1869 some weeks before he began to work at his tale dickens in a letter told forster i have a very curious and new idea for my new story  not communicable or the interest of the book would be gone but a very strong one though difficult to work  forster must have instantly asked that the incommunicable secret should be communicated to him for he tells us that immediately after i learntthe secret  but did he learn it  dickens was ill and his plot whatever it may have been would be irritatingly criticized by forster before it was fully thought out  fules and bairns should not see halfdone work and dickens may well have felt that forster should not see work not even begun but merely simmering in the authors own fancy  forster does not tell us that dickens communicated the secret in a letter  he quotes none  he says i was told orally that is when he writes five years later 1874 landless was i think to have perished in assisting tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer he is clearly trusting not to a letter of dickenss but to a defective memory and he knows it  he says that a nephew was to be murdered by an uncle  the criminal was to confess in the condemned cell  he was to find out that his crime had been needless and to be convicted by means of the ring rosas mothers ring remaining in the quicklime that had destroyed the body of edwin  nothing new in all this as forster must have seen  the originality he explains was to consist in the review of the murderers career by himself at the close when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if not he the culprit but some other man were the tempted  but all this is not hard to work and is not original  as mr proctor remarks dickens had used that trick twice already madmans manuscript pickwick clock case confession in master humphreys clock  the quicklime trick is also very old indeed  the disguise of a woman as a man is as ancient as the art of fiction  yet helena may be datchery though nobody guessed it before mr cuming walters  she ought not to be datchery she is quite out of keeping in her speech and manner as datchery and is much more like drood   a new idea   there are no new ideas in plots  all the stories have been told and all the merit lies in the manner of the telling  dickens had used the unsuspected watcher as mr proctor shows in almost all his novels  in martin chuzzlewit when jonas finds that nadgett has been the watcher dickens writes the dead man might have come out of his grave and not confounded and appalled him so  now to jasper edwin was the dead man and edwins grave contained quicklime  jasper was sure that he had done for edwin  he had taken edwins watch chain and scarfpin he believed that he had left him drugged in quicklime in a locked vault  consequently the reappearance of edwin quite well in the vault where jasper had buried him would be a very new idea to jasper would confound and appall him  jasper would have emotions at that spectacle and so would the reader  it is not every day even in our age of sixpenny novels that a murderer is compelled to visit alone at night the vault which holds his victims cold remains and therein finds the victim come up smiling  yes for business purposes this idea was new enough  the idea was difficult to work says dickens with obvious truth  how was he to get the quicklime into the vault and drood alive out of the vault  as to the reader he would at first take datchery for drood and then think no that is impossible and also is stale datchery cannot be drood and thus the reader would remain in a pleasant state of puzzledom as he does unto this day  if edwin is dead there is not much mystery about him  we have as good as seen jasper strangle him and take his pin chain and watch  yet by adroitly managing the conduct of mr grewgious dickens persuaded mr proctor that certainly grewgious knew edwin to be alive  as grewgious knew from helena all that was necessary to provoke his experiment on jaspers nerves mr proctor argued on false premises but that was due to the craft of dickens mr proctor rejected forsters report from memory of what he understood to be the incommunicable secret of dickenss plot and i think that he was justified in the rejection  forster does not seem to have cared about the thinghe refers lightly to the reader curious in such matterswhen once he had received his explanation from dickens  his memory in the space of five years may have been inaccurate  he probably neither knew nor cared who datchery was and he may readily have misunderstood what dickens told him orally about the ring as the instrument of detection moreover forster quite overlooked one source of evidence as i shall show later   mr proctors theory   mr proctors theory of the story is that jasper after edwins return at midnight on christmas eve recommended a warm drink mulled wine druggedand then proposed another stroll of inspection of the effects of the storm  he then strangled him somewhere and placed him in the quicklime in the sapsea vault locked him in and went to bed  next according to mr proctor durdles then lying drunk in the precincts for some reason taps with his hammer on the wall of the sapsea vault detects the presence of a foreign body opens the tomb and finds drood in the quicklime his face fortunately protected by the strong silk shawl with which jasper has intended to throttle him   a mistaken theory   this is thin very thin  dickens must have had some better scheme than mr proctors  why did jasper not mak sikker like kirkpatrick with the red comyn  why did he leave his silk scarf it might come to be asked for to be sure the quicklime would destroy it but why did jasper leave it  why did the intoxicated durdles come out of the crypt if he was there enter the graveyard and begin tapping at the wall of the vault  why not open the door he had the key  suppose however all this to have occurred and suppose with mr proctor that durdles and deputy carried edwin to the tramps lodgings would durdles fail to recognize edwin  we are to guess that grewgious was present or disturbed at his inn or somehow brought into touch with edwin and bribed durdles to silence until a scheme for the punishment of jasper had been devised  all this set of conjectures is crude to the last degree  we do not know how dickens meant to get edwin into and out of the vault granting that edwin was drugged jasper might lead edwin in considering the licence extended to the effects of drugs in novels and might strangle him there  above all how did grewgious if in cloisterham come to be at hand at midnight   another way   if i must make a guess i conjecture that jasper had one of his filmy seizures was in a frightful sort of dream and bungled the murder  made an incomplete job of it  halfstrangled men and women have often recovered  in jaspers opium vision and reminiscence there was no resistance all was very soon over jasper might even bungle the locking of the door of the vault  he was apt to have a seizure after opium in moments of excitement and he had been at the opium den through the night of december 23 for the hag tracked him from her house in town to cloisterham on december 24 the day of the crime  grant that his accustomed fit came upon him during the excitement of the murder as it does come after a nicht wi opium in chapter ii when edwin excites him by contemptuous talk of the girl whom jasper loves so furiously and then anything may happen  jasper murders edwin inefficiently he has a fit while he is unconscious the quicklime revives edwin by burning his hand say and during jaspers swoon edwin like another famous prisoner has a happy thought he opens the door and walks out  being drugged he is in a dreamy state knows not clearly what has occurred or who attacked him  jasper revives look ont again he dare noton the body of his victimand he walks out and goes home where his red lamp has burned all the timethinking it all wery capital  another wayjasper not only fails to strangle drood but fails to lock the door of the vault and drood walks out after jasper has gone  jasper has before his fit removed from the body the most lasting the best known and most easily recognizable things upon it the watch and scarfpin  so dickens puts the popular view of the case against neville landless and so we are to presume that jasper acted  if he removed no more things from the body than these he made a fatal oversight  meanwhile how does edwin once out of the vault make good a secret escape from cloisterham  mr proctor invokes the aid of mr grewgious but does not explain why grewgious was on the spot  i venture to think it not inconceivable that mr grewgious having come down to cloisterham by a late train on christmas eve to keep his christmas appointment with rosa paid a darkling visit to the tomb of his lost love rosas mother  grewgious was very sentimental but too secretive to pay such a visit by daylight  a night of memories and sighs he might consecrate to his lost lady love as landor did to rose aylmer  grewgious was to have helped bazzard to eat a turkey on christmas day  but he could get out of that engagement  he would wish to see edwin and rosa together and edwin was leaving cloisterham  the date of grewgiouss arrival at cloisterham is studiously concealed  i offer at least a conceivable motive for grewgiouss possible presence at the churchyard  mrs bud his lost love we have been told was buried hard by the sapsea monument  if grewgious visited her tomb he was on the spot to help edwin supposing edwin to escape  unlikelier things occur in novels  i do not in fact call these probable occurrences in everyday life but none of the story is probable jaspers weird seizures are meant to lead up to something  they may have been meant to lead up to the failure of the murder and the escape of edwin  of course dickens would not have treated these incidents when he came to make edwin explainnobody else could explainin my studiously simple style  the drugged edwin himself would remember the circumstances but mistily  his evidence would be of no value against jasper  mr proctor next supposes we saw that drood got into touch with grewgious and i have added the circumstances which might take grewgious to the churchyard  next when edwin recovered health he came down perhaps as datchery to spy on jasper  i have elsewhere said as mr cuming walters quotes me that fancy can suggest no reason why edwin drood if he escaped from his wicked uncle should go spying about instead of coming openly forward  no plausible unfantastic reason could be invented  later i shall explain why edwin if he is datchery might go spying alone  it is also urged that edwin left rosa in sorrow and left blame on neville landless  why do this  mr proctor replies that grewgiouss intense and watchful interest in neville otherwise unexplained is due to his knowledge that drood is alive and that neville must be cared for while grewgious has told rosa that edwin lives  he also told her of edwins real love of her hence miss bud says poor poor eddy quite a propos de bottes when she finds herself many fathoms deep in love with lieutenant tartar rn  poor poor eddy thought rosa as they walked along tartar and she  this is a plausible suggestion of mr proctor edwin though known to rosa to be alive has no chance  but as to my own remark why should not edwin come forward at once instead of spying about  well if he did there would be no story  as for an unfantastic reason for his conduct dickens is not writing an unfantastic novel  moreover if things occurred as i have suggested i do not see what evidence drood had against jasper edwins clothes were covered with lime but when he told his story jasper would reply that drood never returned to his house on christmas eve but stayed out doing what was correct by the season in the way of giving it the welcome it had the right to expect like durdles on another occasion  droods evidence if it was what i have suggested would sound like the dream of an intoxicated man and what other evidence could be adduced  thus i had worked out droods condition if he really was not killed in this way  i had supposed him to escape in a very mixed frame of mind when he would be encountered by grewgious who of course could make little out of him in his befogged state  drood could not even prove that it was not landless who attacked him  the result would be that drood would lie low and later would have reason enough for disguising himself as datchery and playing the spy in cloisterham  at this point i was reinforced by an opinion which mr william archer had expressed unknown to me in a newspaper article  i had described edwins confused knowledge of his own experience if he were thoroughly drugged and then half strangled  mr archer also took that point and added that edwin being a goodhearted fellow and fond of his uncle jasper he would not bring or let grewgious bring a terrible charge against jasper till he knew more certainly the whole state of the case  for that reason he would come disguised to cloisterham and make inquiries  by letting jasper know about the ring he would compel him to enter the vault and then mr archer thinks would induce him to repent and begin life afresh  i scarcely think that datcherys purpose was so truly honourable he rather seems to be getting up a case against jasper  still the idea of mr archer is very plausible and at least given droods need of evidence and the lack of evidence against jasper we see reason good in a novel of this kind for his playing the part of amateur detective   dickenss unused draft of a chapter   forster found and published a very illegible sketch of a chapter of the tale  how mr sapsea ceased to be a member of the eight club told by himself  this was a cramped interlined and blotted draft on paper of only half the size commonly used by dickens  mr sapsea tells how his club mocked him about a stranger who had mistaken him for the dean  the jackass sapsea left the club and met the stranger a young man who fooled him to the top of his bent saying if i was to deny that i came to this town to see and hear you sir what would it avail me  apparently this paper was a rough draft of an idea for introducing a detective as a young man who mocks sapsea just as datchery does in the novel  but to make the spy a young man whether the spy was drood or helena landless was too difficult and therefore dickens makes datchery an elderly buffer in a white wig  if i am right it was easier for helena a girl to pose as a young man than for drood to reappear as a young man not himself  helena may be datchery and yet drood may be alive and biding his time but i have disproved my old objection that there was no reason why drood if alive should go spying about in disguise  there were good dickensian reasons   a question of taste   mr cuming walters argues that the story is very tame if edwin is still alive and left out of the marriages at the close  besides drood is little more than a namelabel attached to a body a man who never excites sympathy whose fate causes no emotion he is saved for no useful or sentimental purpose and lags superfluous on the stage  all of which is bad art so bad that dickens would never have been guilty of it  that is a question of taste  on rereading the novel i see that dickens makes drood as sympathetic as he can  he is very young and speaks of rosa with bad taste but he is really in love with her much more so than she with him and he is piqued by her ceaseless mockery and by their false position  to jasper he is singularly tender and remorseful when he thinks that he has shown want of tact  there is nothing ominous about his gaiety  as to his one fault we leave him on christmas eve a converted character  he has a kind word and look for every one whom he meets young and old  he accepts mr grewgiouss very stern lecture in the best manner possible  in short he is marked as faulty i am young so he excuses himself in the very words of darnley to queen mary if the glasgow letter be genuine but he is also marked as sympathetic  he was i think to have a lesson and to become a good fellow mr proctor rightly argues and forster thinks that dickens meant to kill neville landless  mr cuming walters agrees with him but mr proctor truly adds that edwin has none of the signs of dickenss doomed men his sidney cartons and the rest  you can tell as it were by the sound of the voice of dickens says mr proctor that edwin is to live  the impression is merely subjective but i feel the impression  the doom of landless is conspicuously fixed and why is landless to be killed by jasper merely to have a count on which to hang jasper  he cannot be hanged for killing drood if drood is alive   mr proctors theory continued   mr proctor next supposes that datchery and others by aid of the opium hag have found out a great deal of evidence against jasper they have discovered from the old woman that his crime was long premeditated  he had threatened ned in his opiated dreams  and had clearly removed edwins trinkets and watch because they would not be destroyed with his body by the quicklime  this is all very well but there is still so far no legal evidence on my theory that jasper attempted to take edwins life  jaspers enemies therefore can only do their best to make his life a burden to him and to give him a good fright probably with the hope of terrifying him into avowals  now the famous ring begins to drag and hold the murderer  he is given to know i presume that when edwin disappeared he had a gold ring in the pocket of his coat  jasper is thus compelled to revisit the vault at night and there in the light of his lantern he sees the longlost edwin with his hand in the breast of his great coat  horrified by this unexpected appearance jasper turns to fly  but he is confronted by neville landless crisparkle tartar and perhaps by mr grewgious who are all on the watch  he rushes up through the only outlet the winding staircase of the cathedral tower of which we know that he has had the key  neville who leads his pursuers receives his death wound and i think is pitched off the top of the roof  then jasper is collared by that agile climber tartar and by crisparkle always in the pink of condition  there is now something to hang jasper forthe slaying of landless though as far as i can see that was done in self defence  jasper confesses all tartar marries rosa helena marries crisparkle  edwin is only twentyone and may easily find a consoler of the fair sex  indeed he is ower young to marry yet  the capture of jasper was fixed of course for christmas eve  the phantom cry foreheard by durdles two years before was that of neville as he fell and the dog that howled was nevilles dog a character not yet introduced into the romance   mr cuming walterss theory   such is mr proctors theory of the story in which i mainly agree mr proctor relies on a piece of evidence overlooked by forster and certainly misinterpreted as i think i can prove to a certainty by mr cuming walters whose theory of the real conduct of the plot runs thus  after watching the storm at midnight with edwin neville left him and went home  his way lay in an opposite direction  near to the cathedral jasper intercepted his nephew    edwin may have been already drugged  how the murder was worked mr cuming walters does not say but he introduces at this point the two sounds foreheard by durdles without explaining the howl of a dog  durdles would hear the cries and deputy had seen what he could not understand whatever it was that he saw jasper not aware of droods possession of the ring takes only his watch chain and pin which he places on the timbers of the weir and in the river to be picked up by that persistent winterbather crisparkle of the telescopic and microscopic eyesight  as to the ring mr cuming walters erroneously declares that mr proctor ignores the power of the ring to hold and drag and says that potent passage is without meaning and must be disregarded  proctor in fact gives more than three pages to the meaning of the ring which drags jasper into the vault when he hears of its existence 3  next mr cuming walters supposes datchery to learn from durdles whom he is to visit about the second hearing of the cry and the dogs howl  deputy may have seen jasper carrying his burden edwin towards the sapsea vault in fact jasper probably saved trouble by making the drugged edwin walk into that receptacle  datchery would not think of the sapsea vault unaided  nounless datchery was drood   now durdles is useful again  tapping with his hammer he would find a change    inquiry must be made  why should durdles tap the sapsea monument as durdles had the key he would simply walk into the vault and find the quicklime  now jasper also we presume had a key made from a wax impression of the original  if he had any sense he would have removed the quicklime as easily as he inserted it for mr sapsea was mortal  he might die any day and be buried and then the quicklime lying where it ought not would give rise to awkward inquiries  inquiry being made in consequence of durdless tappings the ring would be found as mr cuming walters says  but even then unless deputy actually saw jasper carry a man into the vault nobody could prove jaspers connection with the presence of the ring in the vault  moreover deputy hated jasper and if he saw jasper carrying the body of a man on the night when a man disappeared he was clever enough to lead durdles to examine the vault at once deputy had a great dislike of the law and its officers but here was a chance for him to distinguish himself and conciliate them  however these things may be mr cuming walters supposes that jasper finding himself watched reenters the vault perhaps to see that every trace of the crime had been removed  in the vault he findsdatchery that is helena landless  jasper certainly visited the vault and found somebody   evidence of collinss drawings   we now come to the evidence which forster strangely overlooked which mr proctor and mr archer correctly deciphered and which mr cuming walters misinterprets  on december 22 1869 dickens wrote to forster that two numbers of his romance were now in type charles collins has designed an excellent cover  mr c a collins had married a daughter of dickens 4  he was an artist a great friend of dickens and author of that charming book a cruise on wheels  his design of the paper cover of the story it appeared in monthly numbers contained as usual sketches which give an inkling of the events in the tale  mr collins was to have illustrated the book but finally mr now sir luke fildes undertook the task  mr collins died in 1873  it appears that forster never asked him the meaning of his designsa singular oversight  the cover lies before the reader  in the lefthand top corner appears an allegorical female figure of joy with flowers  the central top space contains the front of cloisterham cathedral or rather the nave  to the left walks edwin with hyacinthine locks and a thoroughly classical type of face and grecian nose  like datchery he does not wear but carries his hat this means nothing if they are in the nave  he seems bored  on his arm is rosa she seems bored she trails her parasol and looks away from edwin looks down to her right  on the spectators right march the surpliced men and boys of the choir  behind them is jasper black whiskers and all he stares after edwin and rosa his right hand hides his mouth  in the corner above him is an allegorical female clasping a stiletto  beneath edwin and rosa is first an allegorical female figure looking at a placard headed lost on a door  under that again is a girl in a gardenchair a young man whiskerless with wavy hair kneels and kisses her hand  she looks rather unimpassioned i conceive the man to be landless taking leave of rosa after urging his hopeless suit for which helena we learn seems to compassionate him  he has avowed his passion early in the story to crisparkle  below the opium hag is smoking  on the other side under the figures of jasper and the choir the young man who kneels to the girl is seen bounding up a spiral staircase  his left hand is on the iron railing he stoops over it looking down at others who follow him  his right hand the index finger protruded points upward and by chance or design points straight at jasper in the vignette above  beneath this man clearly landless follows a tall man in a bowler hat a cutaway coat and trousers which show an inch of white stocking above the low shoes  his profile is hid by the wall of the spiral staircase  he might be grewgious of the shoes white stockings and short trousers but he may be tartar  he takes two steps at a stride beneath him a youngish man in a low soft clerical hat and a black peacoat ascends looking downwards and backwards  this is clearly crisparkle  a chinaman is smoking opium beneath  in the central lowest space a dark and whiskered man enters a dark chamber his left hand is on the lock of the door in his right he holds up a lantern  the light of the lantern reveals a young man in a soft hat of tyrolese shape  his features are purely classical his nose is grecian his locks are long at least according to the taste of today he wears a light paletot buttoned to the throat his right arm hangs by his side his left hand is thrust into the breast of his coat  he calmly regards the dark man with the lantern  that man of course is jasper  the young man is edwin drood of the grecian nose hyacinthine locks and classic features as in sir l fildess third illustration  mr proctor correctly understood the unmistakable meaning of this last design jasper entering the vault    today the dead are living the lost is found today   mr cuming walters tells us that he did not examine these designs by mr collins till he had formed his theory and finished his book  on the conclusion of the whole work the pictures were referred to for the first time and were then found to support in the most striking manner the opinions arrived at namely that drood was killed and that helena is datchery  thus does theory blind us to facts  mr cuming walters connects the figure of the whiskerless young man kneeling to a girl in a garden seat with the whiskered jaspers proposal to rosa in a garden seat  but jasper does not kneel to rosa he stands apart leaning on a sundial he only once vaguely touches her which she resents he does not kneel he does not kiss her hand rosa took the kiss sedately like maud in the poem andjasper had lustrous thick black whiskers  again the same whiskerless young man bounding up the spiral staircase in daylight and wildly pointing upwards is taken by mr cuming walters to represent jasper climbing the staircase to reconnoitre at night with a lantern and of course with black whiskers  the two welldressed men on the stairs grewgious or tartar and crisparkle also according to mr cuming walters relate to jaspers unaccountable expedition with durdles to the cathedral  neither of them is jasper neither of them is durdles in a suit of coarse flannela disreputable jacket as sir l fildes depicts himwith horn buttons and a battered old tall hat  these interpretations are quite demonstrably erroneous and even impossible  mr archer interprets the designs exactly as i do  as to the young man in the light of jaspers lamp mr cuming walters says the large hat and the tightlybuttoned surtout must be observed they are the articles of clothing on which most stress is laid in the description of datchery  but the face is young the face of datchery was elderly and he had a huge shock of white hair a wig  datchery wore a tightish blue surtout with a buff waistcoat and grey trousers he had something of a military air the young man in the vault has anything but a military air he shows no waistcoat and he does not wear a tightish blue surtout or any surtout at all  the surtout of the period is shown worn by jasper in sir l fildess sixth and ninth illustrations  it is a frockcoat the collar descends far below the top of the waistcoat buff or otherwise displaying that garment the coat is tightly buttoned beneath revealing the figure the tails of the coat do not reach the knees of the wearer  the young man in the vault on the other hand wears a loose paletot buttoned to the throat vaults are chilly places and the coat falls so as to cover the knees at least partially  the young man is not like helena very dark and fierce of look    of almost the gipsy type  he is blonde sedate and of the classic type as drood was  he is no more like helena than crisparkle is like durdles  mr cuming walters says that mr proctor was unable to allude to the prophetic picture by collins  as a fact this picture is fully described by mr proctor but mr walters used the wrong edition of his book unwittingly  mr proctor writes creeping down the crypt steps oppressed by growing horror and by terror of coming judgment sickening under fears engendered by the darkness of night and the charnelhouse air he breathed jasper opens the door of the tomb and holds up his lantern shuddering at the thought of what it may reveal to him  and what sees he  is it the spirit of his victim that stands there in his habit as he lived his hand clasped on his breast where the ring had been when he was murdered  what else can jasper deem it  there clearly visible in the gloom at the back of the tomb stands edwin drood with stern look fixed on himpale silent relentless  again on the titlepage are given two of the small pictures from the love side of the cover two from the murder side and the central picture below which presents the central horror of the storythe end and aim of the datchery assumption and of mr grewgiouss plansshowing jasper driven to seek for the proofs of his crime amid the dust to which as he thought the flesh and bones and the very clothes of his victim had been reduced  there are only two possible choices either collins under dickenss oral instructions depicted jasper finding drood alive in the vault an incident which was to occur in the story or dickens bade collins do this for the purpose of misleading his readers in an illegitimate manner while the young man in the vault was really to be some person made up to look like drood and so to frighten jasper with a pseudoghost of that hero  the latter device the misleading picture would be childish and the pseudoghost exactly like drood could not be acted by the gipsylike fierce helena or by any other person in the romance   mr walterss theory continued   mr cuming walters guesses that jasper was to aim a deadly blow with his left hand to judge from the picture at helena and that neville was to give his life for hers  but manifestly neville was to lead the hunt of jasper up the spiral stair as in collinss design and was to be dashed from the roof  his body beneath was to be that i never saw before  that must be real  look what a poor mean miserable thing it is as jasper says in his vision  mr cuming walters pursuing his idea of helena as both datchery and also as the owner of the young face of the youth in the vault and also of the young hands a young girls hands could never pass for those of an elderly buffer exclaims  imagine the intense power of the dramatic climax when datchery the elderly man is retransformed into helena landless the young and handsome woman and when she reveals the seemingly impenetrable secret which had been closed up in one guilty mans mind  the situations are startling i admit but how would canon crisparkle like them  he is we know to marry helena the young person my dear miss twinkleton would say who for months lived alone at inns wearing a blue surtout a buff waistcoat and grey   here horror chokes the utterance of miss twinkleton  then she was in the vault in another disguise not more womanly at that awful scene when poor mr jasper was driven mad so that he confessed all sorts of nonsense for my dear all the close believes that it was nonsense and that mr jasper was reduced to insanity by persecution  and mr crisparkle with that elegant dainty mother of hisit has broken her heartis marrying this halfcaste gipsy trollop with her blue surtout and greyoh it is a disgrace to cloisterham  the climax in fact as devised by mr cuming walters is rather too dramatic for the comfort of a minor canon  a humorist like dickens ought to have seen the absurdity of the situation  mr walters may be right helena may be datchery but she ought not to be   who was the princess puffer   who was the opium hag the princess puffer  mr cuming walters writes  we make a guess for dickens gives us no solid facts but when we remember that not a word is said throughout the volume of jaspers antecedents who he was and where he came from when we remember that but for his nephew he was a lonely man when we see that he was both criminal and artist when we observe his own wheedling propensity his false and fulsome protestations of affection his slyness his subtlety his heartlessness his tenacity and when above all we know that the opium vice is hereditary and that a young man would not be addicted to it unless born with the craving 5 then it is not too wild a conjecture that jasper was the wayward progeny of this same opiumeating woman all of whose characteristics he possessed and perchance of a man of criminal instincts but of a superior position  jasper is a morbid and diseased being while still in the twenties a mixture of genius and vice  he hates and he loves fiercely as if there were wild gipsy blood in his veins  though seemingly a model of decorum and devoted to his art he complains of his daily drudging round and the cramped monotony of his existence  he commits his crime with the ruthlessness of a beast his own nature being wholly untamed  if we deduce that his father was an adventurer and a vagabond we shall not be far wrong  if we deduce that his mother was the opiumeater prematurely aged who had transmitted her vicious propensity to her child we shall almost certainly be right   who was jasper   who was jasper  he was the brotherinlaw of the late mr drood a respected engineer and university man  we do not know whence came mrs drood jaspers sister but is it likely that her mother drank heavenshardso the hag says of herselfthen took to keeping an opium den and there entertained her son jasper already an accomplished vocalist but in a lower station than that to which his musical genius later raised him as lay precentor  if the princess puffer be as on mr cuming walterss theory she is edwins longlost grandmother her discovery would be unwelcome to edwin  probably she did not live much longer my lungs are like cabbage nets she says  mr cuming walters goes on   her purpose is left obscure  how easily however we see possibilities in a direction such as this  the father perhaps a proud handsome man deserts the woman and removes the child  the woman hates both for scorning her but the father dies or disappears and is beyond her vengeance  then the child victim to the ills in his blood creeps back to the opium den not knowing his mother but immediately recognized by her  she will make the child suffer for the sins of the father who had destroyed her happiness  such a theme was one which appealed to dickens  it must not however be urged and the crucial question after all is concerned with the opium woman as one of the unconscious instruments of justice aiding with her trifle of circumstantial evidence the nemesis awaiting jasper  another hypothesisfollowing on the carker theme in dombey and sonis that jasper a dissolute and degenerate man lascivious and heartless may have wronged a child of the womans but it is not likely that dickens would repeat the mrs brown story  jasper pere father of john jasper and of mrs drood however handsome ought not to have deserted mrs jasper  whether john jasper prematurely devoted to opium became edwins guardian at about the age of fifteen or whether on attaining his majority he succeeded to some other guardian is not very obvious  in short we cannot guess why the princess puffer hated jasper a paying client of long standing  we are only certain that jasper was a bad fellow and that the princess puffer said i know him better than all the reverend parsons put together know him  on the other hand edwin seems to know the opium woman when he meets her on christmas eve which may be a point in favour of her being his longlost grandmother  jasper was certainly tried and condemned for dickens intended to take mr fildes to a condemned cell in maidstone or some other gaol in order to make a drawing 6  possibly jasper managed to take his own life in the cell possibly he was duly hanged  jasper after all was a failure as a murderer even if we suppose him to have strangled his nephew successfully  it is obvious to the most excruciatingly feeble capacity that if he meant to get rid of proofs of the identity of droods body by means of quicklime it did not suffice to remove droods pin watch and chain  drood would have coins of the realm in his pockets gold silver bronze  quicklime would not destroy these metallic objects nor would it destroy keys which would easily prove droods identity  if jasper knew his business he would of course rifle all of edwins pockets minutely and would remove the metallic buttons of his braces which generally display the makers name or the tailors  on research i find h poole  co savile row on my buttons  in this inquiry of his jasper would have discovered the ring in edwins breast pocket and would have taken it away  perhaps dickens never thought of that little fact  if he did think of it no doubt he found some mode of accounting for jaspers unworkmanlike negligence  the trouserbuttons would have led any inquirer straight to edwins tailor i incline to suspect that neither dickens nor jasper noticed that circumstance  the conscientious artist in crime cannot afford to neglect the humblest and most obvious details    conclusion    according to my theory which mainly rests on the unmistakable evidence of the cover drawn by collins under dickenss directions all ends well  jasper comes to the grief he deserves  helena after her period of mourning for neville marries crisparkle  rosa weds her mariner  edwin at twentyone is not heartbroken but a greatly improved character takes to quote his own words a sensible interest in works of engineering skill especially when they are to change the whole condition of an undeveloped country egypt  these conclusions are inevitable unless we either suppose dickens to have arranged a disappointment for his readers in the tableau of jasper and drood in the vault on the cover or can persuade ourselves that not drood but some other young man is revealed by the light of jaspers lantern  now the young man is very like drood and very unlike the dark fierce helena landless  disguised as drood this time not as datchery  all the difficulty as to why drood if he escaped alive did not at once openly denounce jasper is removed when we remember as mr archer and i have independently pointed out that drood when attacked by jasper was like durdles in the unaccountable expedition stupefied by drugs and so had no valid evidence against his uncle  whether science is acquainted with the drugs necessary for such purposes is another question they are always kept in stock by starving and venal apothecaries in fiction and the drama and are a recognized convention of romance  so ends our unfolding of the mystery of edwin drood    footnotes  1  landless is not lackland but a form of de laundeles a lothian name of the twelfth century merged later in that of ormistoun  2  life of dickens vol iii pp 425439  3  j cuming walters p 102 proctor pp 131135  mr cuming walters used an edition of 1896 apparently a reprint of a paper by proctor written earlier than his final book of 1887  hence the error as to mr proctors last theory  4  mrs perugini the books say but certainly a daughter  5  what would weissmann say to all this  6  so mr cuming walters quotes mr hughes who quotes sir l fildes  he believes that jasper strangled edwin with the black silk scarf and no doubt jasper was for long of that opinion himself
