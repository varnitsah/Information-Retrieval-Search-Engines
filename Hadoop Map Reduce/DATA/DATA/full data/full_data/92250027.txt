92250027	the seahawk   by rafael sabatini     note  lord henry goade who had as we shall see some personal acquaintance with sir oliver tressilian tells us quite bluntly that he was illfavoured but then his lordship is addicted to harsh judgments and his perceptions are not always normal he says for instance of anne of cleves that she was the ugliest woman that ever i saw as far as we can glean from his own voluminous writings it would seem to be extremely doubtful whether he ever saw anne of cleves at all and we suspect him here of being no more than a slavish echo of the common voice which attributed cromwells downfall to the ugliness of this bride he procured for his bluebeard master to the common voice from the brush of holbein which permits us to form our own opinions and shows us a lady who is certainly very far from deserving his lordships harsh stricture similarly i like to believe that lord henry was wrong in his pronouncement upon sir oliver and i am encouraged in this belief by the penportrait which he himself appends to it he was he says a tall powerful fellow of a good shape if we except that his arms were too long and that his feet and hands were of an uncomely bigness in face he was swarthy with black hair and a black forked beard his nose was big and very high in the bridge and his eyes sunk deep under beetling eyebrows were very palecoloured and very cruel and sinister he hadand this i have ever remarked to be the sign of great virility in a mana big deep rough voice better suited to and no doubt oftener employed in quarterdeck oaths and foulnesses than the worship of his maker  thus my lord henry goade and you observe how he permits his lingering disapproval of the man to intrude upon his description of him the truth is thatas there is ample testimony in his prolific writingsis lordship was something of a misanthropist it was in fact his misanthropy which drove him as it has driven many another to authorship he takes up the pen not so much that he may carry out his professed object of writing a chronicle of his own time but to the end that he may vent the bitterness engendered in him by his fall from favour as a consequence he has little that is good to say of anyone and rarely mentions one of his contemporaries but to tap the sources of a picturesque invective after all it is possible to make excuses for him he was at once a man of thought and a man of actiona combination as rare as it is usually deplorable the man of action in him might have gone far had he not been ruined at the outset by the man of thought a magnificent seaman he might have become lord high admiral of england but for a certain proneness to intrigue fortunately for himsince head where nature had placed ithe came betimes under a cloud of suspicion his career suffered a check but it was necessary to afford him some compensation since after all the suspicions could not be substantiated  consequently he was removed from his command and appointed by the queens grace her lieutenant of cornwall a position in which it was judged that he could do little mischief there soured by this blighting of his ambitions and living a life of comparative seclusion he turned as so many other men similarly placed have turned to seek consolation in his pen he wrote his singularly crabbed narrow and superficial history of lord henry goade his own timeswhich is a miracle of injuvenations distortions misrepresentations and eccentric spelling in the eighteen enormous folio volumes which he filled with his minute and gothic characters he gives his own version of the story of what he terms his downfall and having notwithstanding his prolixity exhausted this subject in the first five of the eighteen tomes he proceeds to deal with so much of the history of his own day as came immediately under his notice in his cornish retirement  for the purposes of english history his chronicles are entirely negligible which is the reason why they have been allowed to remain unpublished and in oblivion but to the student who attempts to follow the history of that extraordinary man sir oliver tressilian they are entirely invaluable and since i have made this history my present task it is fitting that i should here at the outset acknowledge my extreme indebtedness to those chronicles without them indeed it were impossible to reconstruct the life of that cornish gentleman who became a renegade and a barbary corsair and might have become basha of algiersor argire as his lordship terms itbut for certain matters which are to be set forth  lord henry wrote with knowledge and authority and the tale he has to tell is very complete and full of precious detail he was himself an eyewitness of much that happened he pursued a personal acquaintance with many of those who were connected with sir olivers affairs that he might amplify his chronicles and he considered no scrap of gossip that was to be gleaned along the countryside too trivial to be recorded i suspect him also of having received no little assistance from jasper leigh in the matter of those events that happened out of england which seem to me to constitute by far the most interesting portion of his narrative                                                                 r s    contents    part one  sir oliver tressilian   chapter      i  the huckster     ii  rosamund

tressilian sat at his ease in the lofty diningroom of the handsome house of penarrow which he owed to the enterprise of his father of lamented and lamentable memory and to the skill and invention of an italian engineer named bagnolo who had come to england half a century ago as one of the assistants of the famous torrigiani  this house of such a startlingly singular and italianate grace for so remote a corner of cornwall deserves together with the story of its construction a word in passing  the italian bagnolo who combined with his salient artistic talents a quarrelsome volcanic humour had the mischance to kill a man in a brawl in a southwark tavern as a result he fled the town nor paused in his headlong flight from the consequences of that murderous deed until he had all but reached the very ends of england under what circumstances he became acquainted with tressilian the elder i do not know but certain it is that the meeting was a very timely one for both of them to the fugitive ralph tressilianwho appears to have been inveterately partial to the company of rascals of all denominationsafforded shelter and bagnolo repaid the service by offering to rebuild the decaying halftimbered house of penarrow having taken the task in hand he went about it with all the enthusiasm of your true artist and achieved for his protector a residence that was a marvel of grace in that crude age and outlandish district there arose under the supervision of the gifted engineer worthy associate of messer torrigiani a noble twostoried mansion of mellow red brick flooded with light and sunshine by the enormously tall mullioned windows that rose almost from base to summit of each pilastered facade the main doorway was set in a projecting wing and was overhung by a massive balcony the whole surmounted by a pillared pediment of extraordinary grace now partly clad in a green mantle of creepers above the burnt red tiles of the roof soared massive twisted chimneys in lofty majesty  but the glory of penarrowthat is of the new penarrow begotten of the fertile brain of bagnolowas the garden fashioned out of the tangled wilderness about the old house that had crowned the heights above penarrow point to the labours of bagnolo time and nature had added their own bagnolo had cut those handsome esplanades had built those noble balustrades bordering the three terraces with their fine connecting flights of steps himself he had planned the fountain and with his own hands had carved the granite faun presiding over it and the dozen other statues of nymphs and sylvan gods in a marble that gleamed in white brilliance amid the dusky green but time and nature had smoothed the lawns to a velvet surface had thickened the handsome boxwood hedges and thrust up those black spearlike poplars that completed the very italianate appearance of that cornish demesne  sir oliver took his ease in his diningroom considering all this as it was displayed before him in the mellowing september sunshine and found it all very good to see and life very good to live now no man has ever been known so to find life without some immediate cause other than that of his environment for his optimism sir oliver had several causes the first of thesealthough it was one which he may have been far from suspectingwas his equipment of youth wealth and good digestion the second was that he had achieved honour and renown both upon the spanish main and in the late harrying of the invincible armadaor more aptly perhaps might it be said in the harrying of the late invincible armadaand that he had received in that the twentyfifth year of his life the honour of knighthood from the virgin queen the third and last contributor to his pleasant moodand i have reserved it for the end as i account this to be the proper place for the most important factorwas dan cupid who for once seemed compounded entirely of benignity and who had so contrived matters that sir olivers wooing of mistress rosamund godolphin ran an entirely smooth and happy course  so then sir oliver sat at his ease in his tall carved chair his doublet untrussed his long legs stretched before him a pensive smile about the firm lips that as yet were darkened by no more than a small black line of moustachios lord henrys portrait of him was drawn at a much later period it was noon and our gentleman had just dined as the platters the broken meats and the halfempty flagon on the board beside him testified he pulled thoughtfully at a long pipefor he had acquired this newly imported habit of tobaccodrinkingand dreamed of his mistress and was properly and gallantly grateful that fortune had used him so handsomely as to enable him to toss a title and some measure of renown into his rosamunds lap  by nature sir oliver was a shrewd fellow cunning as twenty devils is my lord henrys phrase and he was also a man of some not inconsiderable learning yet neither his natural wit nor his acquired endowments appear to have taught him that of all the gods that rule the destinies of mankind there is none more ironic and malicious than that same dan cupid in whose honour as it were he was now burning the incense of that pipe of his the ancients knew that innocentseeming boy for a cruel impish knave and they mistrusted him sir oliver either did not know or did not heed that sound piece of ancient wisdom it was to be borne in upon him by grim experience and even as his light pensive eyes smiled upon the sunshine that flooded the terrace beyond the long mullioned window a shadow fell athwart it which he little dreamed to be symbolic of the shadow that was even falling across the sunshine of his life  after that shadow came the substancetall and gay of raiment under a broad black spanish hat decked with bloodred plumes swinging a long beribboned cane the figure passed the windows stalking deliberately as fate  the smile perished on sir olivers lips his swarthy face grew thoughtful his black brows contracted until no more than a single deep furrow stood between them then slowly the smile came forth again but no longer that erstwhile gentle pensive smile it was transformed into a smile of resolve and determination a smile that tightened his lips even as his brows relaxed and invested his brooding eyes with a gleam that was mocking crafty and almost wicked  came nicholas his servant to announce master peter godolphin and close upon the lackeys heels came master godolphin himself leaning upon his beribboned cane and carrying his broad spanish hat he was a tall slender gentleman with a shaven handsome countenance stamped with an air of haughtiness like sir oliver he had a highbridged intrepid nose and in age he was the younger by some two or three years he wore his auburn hair rather longer than was the mode just then but in his apparel there was no more foppishness than is tolerable in a gentleman of his years  sir oliver rose and bowed from his great height in welcome but a wave of tobaccosmoke took his graceful visitor in the throat and set him coughing and grimacing  i see he choked that ye have acquired that filthy habit  i have known filthier said sir oliver composedly  i nothing doubt it rejoined master godolphin thus early giving indications of his humour and the object of his visit  sir oliver checked an answer that must have helped his visitor to his ends which was no part of the knights intent  therefore said he ironically i hope you will be patient with my shortcomings nick a chair for master godolphin and another cup i bid you welcome to penarrow  a sneer flickered over the younger mans white face you pay me a compliment sir which i fear me tis not mine to return to you  time enough for that when i come to seek it said sir oliver with easy if assumed good humour  when you come to seek it  the hospitality of your house sir oliver explained  it is on that very matter i am come to talk with you  will you sit sir oliver invited him and spread a hand towards the chair which nicholas had set in the same gesture he waved the servant away  master godolphin ignored the invitation you were he said at godolphin court but yesterday i hear he paused and as sir oliver offered no denial he added stiffly i am come sir to inform you that the honour of your visits is one we shall be happy to forgo  in the effort he made to preserve his selfcontrol before so direct an affront sir oliver paled a little under his tan  you will understand peter he replied slowly that you have said too much unless you add something more he paused considering his visitor a moment i do not know whether rosamund has told you that yesterday she did me the honour to consent to become my wife  she is a child that does not know her mind broke in the other  do you know of any good reason why she should come to change it asked sir oliver with a slight air of challenge  master godolphin sat down crossed his legs and placed his hat on his knee  i know a dozen he answered but i need not urge them sufficient should it be to remind you that rosamund is but seventeen and that she is under my guardianship and that of sir john killigrew neither sir john nor i can sanction this betrothal  good lack broke out sir oliver who asks your sanction or sir johns by gods grace your sister will grow to be a woman soon and mistress of herself i am in no desperate haste to get me wed and by natureas you may be observingi am a wondrous patient man ill even wait and he pulled at his pipe  waiting cannot avail you in this sir oliver tis best you should understand we are resolved sir john and i  are you so gods light send sir john to me to tell me of his resolves and ill tell him something of mine tell him from me master godolphin that if he will trouble to come as far as penarrow ill do by him what the hangman should have done long since ill crop his pimpish ears for him by this hand  meanwhile said master godolphin whettingly will you not essay your rovers prowess upon me  you quoth sir oliver and looked him over with goodhumoured contempt im no butcher of fledgelings my lad besides you are your sisters brother and tis no aim of mine to increase the obstacles already in my path then his tone changed he leaned across the table come now peter what is at the root of all this matter can we not compose such differences as you conceive exist out with them tis no matter for sir john hes a curmudgeon who signifies not a fingers snap but you tis different you are her brother out with your plaints then let us be frank and friendly  friendly the other sneered again our fathers set us an example in that  does it matter what our fathers did more shame to them if being neighbours they could not be friends shall we follow so deplorable an example  youll not impute that the fault lay with my father cried the other with a show of ready anger  i impute nothing lad i cry shame upon them both  swounds swore master peter do you malign the dead  if i do i malign them both but i do not i no more than condemn a fault that both must acknowledge could they return to life  then sir confine your condemnings to your own father with whom no man of honour could have lived at peace  softly softly good sir  theres no call to go softly ralph tressilian was a dishonour a scandal to the countryside not a hamlet between here and truro or between here and helston but swarms with big tressilian noses like your own in memory of your debauched parent  sir olivers eyes grew narrower he smiled i wonder how you came by your own nose he wondered  master godolphin got to his feet in a passion and his chair crashed over behind him sir he blazed you insult my mothers memory  sir oliver laughed i make a little free with it perhaps in return for your pleasantries on the score of my father  master godolphin pondered him in speechless anger then swayed by his passion he leaned across the board raised his long cane and struck sir oliver sharply on the shoulder  that done he strode off magnificently towards the door halfway thither he paused  i shall expect your friends and the length of your sword said he  sir oliver laughed again i dont think i shall trouble to send them said he  master godolphin wheeled fully to face him again how you will take a blow  sir oliver shrugged none saw it given said he  but i shall publish it abroad that i have caned you  youll publish yourself a liar if you do for none will believe you then he changed his tone yet again come peter we are behaving unworthily as for the blow i confess that i deserved it a mans mother is more sacred than his father so we may cry quits on that score can we not cry quits on all else what can it profit us to perpetuate a foolish quarrel that sprang up between our fathers  there is more than that between us answered master godolphin ill not have my sister wed a pirate  a pirate gods light i am glad theres none to hear you for since her grace has knighted me for my doings upon the seas your words go very near to treason surely lad what the queen approves master peter godolphin may approve and even your mentor sir john killigrew youve been listening to him twas he sent you hither  i am no mans lackey answered the other hotly resenting the imputationand resenting it the more because of the truth in it  to call me a pirate is to say a foolish thing hawkins with whom i sailed has also received the accolade and who dubs us pirates insults the queen herself apart from that which as you see is a very empty charge what else have you against me i am i hope as good as any other here in cornwall rosamund honours me with her affection and i am rich and shall be richer still ere the wedding bells are heard  rich with the fruit of thieving upon the seas rich with the treasures of scuttled ships and the price of slaves captured in africa and sold to the plantations rich as the vampire is gluttedwith the blood of dead men  does sir john say that asked sir oliver in a soft deadly voice  i say it  i heard you but i am asking where you learnt that pretty lesson is sir john your preceptor he is he is no need to tell me ill deal with him meanwhile let me disclose to you the pure and disinterested source of sir johns rancour you shall see what an upright and honest gentleman is sir john who was your fathers friend and has been your guardian  ill not listen to what you say of him  nay but you shall in return for having made me listen to what he says of me sir john desires to obtain a licence to build at the mouth of the fal he hopes to see a town spring up above the haven there under the shadow of his own manor of arwenack he represents himself as nobly disinterested and all concerned for the prosperity of the country and he neglects to mention that the land is his own and that it is his own prosperity and that of his family which he is concerned to foster we met in london by a fortunate chance whilst sir john was about this business at the court now it happens that i too have interests in truro and penryn but unlike sir john i am honest in the matter and proclaim it if any growth should take place about smithick it follows from its more advantageous situation that truro and penryn must suffer and that suits me as little as the other matter would suit sir john i told him so for i can be blunt and i told the queen in the form of a counterpetition to sir johns he shrugged the moment was propitious to me i was one of the seamen who had helped to conquer the unconquerable armada of king philip i was therefore not to be denied and sir john was sent home as emptyhanded as he went to court dye marvel that he hates me knowing him for what he is dye marvel that he dubs me pirate and worse tis natural enough so to misrepresent my doings upon the sea since it is those doings have afforded me the power to hurt his profit he has chosen the weapons of calumny for this combat but those weapons are not mine as i shall show him this very day if you do not credit what i say come with me and be present at the little talk i hope to have with that curmudgeon  you forget said master godolphin that i too have interests in the neighbourhood of smithick and that you are hurting those  soho crowed sir oliver now at last the sun of truth peeps forth from all this cloud of righteous indignation at my bad tressilian blood and pirates ways you too are but a trafficker now see what a fool i am to have believed you sincere and to have stood here in talk with you as with an honest man his voice swelled and his lip curled in a contempt that struck the other like a blow i swear i had not wasted breath with you had i known you for so mean and pitiful a fellow  these words began master godolphin drawing himself up very stiffly  are a deal less than your deserts cut in the other and he raised his voice to callnick  you shall answer to them snapped his visitor  i am answering now was the stern answer to come here and prate to me of my dead fathers dissoluteness and of an ancient quarrel between him and yours to bleat of my trumpedup course of piracy and my own ways of life as a just cause why i may not wed your sister whilst the real consideration in your mind the real spur to your hostility is not more than the matter of some few paltry pounds a year that i hinder you from pocketing a gods name get you gone  nick entered at that moment  you shall hear from me again sir oliver said the other white with anger you shall account to me for these words  i do not fight with with hucksters flashed sir oliver  dye dare call me that  indeed tis to discredit an honourable class i confess it nick the door for master godolphin     chapter ii rosamund   anon after his visitor had departed sir oliver grew calm again then being able in his calm to consider his position he became angry anew at the very thought of the rage in which he had been a rage which had so mastered him that he had erected additional obstacles to the already considerable ones that stood between rosamund and himself in full blast his anger swung round and took sir john killigrew for its objective he would settle with him at once he would so by heavens light  he bellowed for nick and his boots  where is master lionel he asked when the boots had been fetched  he be just ridden in sir oliver  bid him hither  promptly in answer to that summons came sir olivers halfbrothera slender lad favouring his mother the dissolute ralph tressilians second wife he was as unlike sir oliver in body as in soul he was comely in a very gentle almost womanish way his complexion was fair and delicate his hair golden and his eyes of a deep blue he had a very charming stripling gracefor he was but in his twentyfirst yearand he dressed with all the care of a courtgallant  has that whelp godolphin been to visit you he asked as he entered  aye growled sir oliver he came to tell me some things and to hear some others in return  ha i passed him just beyond the gates and he was deaf to my greeting tis a most cursed insufferable pup  art a judge of men lal sir oliver stood up booted i am for arwenack to exchange a compliment or two with sir john  his tightpressed lips and resolute air supplemented his words so well that lionel clutched his arm  youre not youre not  i am and affectionately as if to soothe the lads obvious alarm he patted his brothers shoulder sir john he explained talks too much tis a fault that wants correcting i go to teach him the virtue of silence  there will be trouble oliver  so there willfor him if a man must be saying of me that i am a pirate a slavedealer a murderer and heaven knows what else he must be ready for the consequences but you are late lal where have you been  i rode as far as malpas  as far as malpas sir olivers eyes narrowed as was the trick with him i hear it whispered what magnet draws you thither he said be wary boy you go too much to malpas  how quoth lionel a trifle coldly  i mean that you are your fathers son remember it and strive not to follow in his ways lest they bring you to his own end i have just been reminded of these predilections of his by good master peter go not over often to malpas i say no more but the arm which he flung about his younger brothers shoulders and the warmth of his embrace made resentment of his warning quite impossible  when he was gone lionel sat him down to dine with nick to wait on him he ate but little and never addressed the old servant in the course of that brief repast he was very pensive in thought he followed his brother on that avenging visit of his to arwenack killigrew was no babe but man of his hands a soldier and a seaman if any harm should come to oliverhe trembled at the thought and then almost despite him his mind ran on to calculate the consequences to himself his fortune would be in a very different case he refected in a sort of horror he sought to put so detestable a reflection from his mind but it returned insistently it would not be denied it forced him to a consideration of his own circumstances  all that he had he owed to his brothers bounty that dissolute father of theirs had died as such men commonly die leaving behind him heavily encumbered estates and many debts the very house of penarrow was mortgaged and the moneys raised on it had been drunk or gambled or spent on one or another of ralph tressilians many lights o love then oliver had sold some little property near helston inherited from his mother he had sunk the money into a venture upon the spanish main he had fitted out and manned a ship and had sailed with hawkins upon one of those ventures which sir john killigrew was perfectly entitled to account pirate raids he had returned with enough plunder in specie and gems to disencumber the tressilian patrimony he had sailed again and returned still wealthier and meanwhile lionel had remained at home taking his ease he loved his ease his nature was inherently indolent and he had the wasteful extravagant tastes that usually go with indolence he was not born to toil and struggle and none had sought to correct the shortcomings of his character in that respect sometimes he wondered what the future might hold for him should oliver come to marry he feared his life might not be as easy as it was at present but he did not seriously fear it was not in his natureit never is in the natures of such mento give any excess of consideration to the future when his thoughts did turn to it in momentary uneasiness he would abruptly dismiss them with the reflection that when all was said oliver loved him and oliver would never fail to provide adequately for all his wants  in this undoubtedly he was fully justified oliver was more parent than brother to him when their father had been brought home to die from the wound dealt him by an outraged husbandand a shocking spectacle that sinners death had been with its hasty terrified repentancehe had entrusted lionel to his elder brothers care at the time oliver was seventeen and lionel twelve but oliver had seemed by so many years older than his age that the twicewidowed ralph tressilian had come to depend upon this steady resolute and masterful child of his first marriage it was into his ear that the dying man had poured the wretched tale of his repentance for the life he had lived and the state in which he was leaving his affairs with such scant provision for his sons for oliver he had no fear it was as if with the prescience that comes to men in his pass he had perceived that oliver was of those who must prevail a man born to make the world his oyster his anxieties were all for lionel whom he also judged with that same penetrating insight vouchsafed a man in his last hours hence his piteous recommendation of him to oliver and olivers ready promise to be father mother and brother to the youngster  all this was in lionels mind as he sat musing there and again he struggled with that hideous insistent thought that if things should go ill with his brother at arwenack there would be great profit to himself that these things he now enjoyed upon anothers bounty he would then enjoy in his own right a devil seemed to mock him with the whispered sneer that were oliver to die his own grief would not be longlived then in revolt against that voice of an egoism so loathsome that in his better moments it inspired even himself with horror he bethought him of olivers unvarying unwavering affection he pondered all the loving care and kindness that through these years past oliver had ever showered upon him and he cursed the rottenness of a mind that could even admit such thoughts as those which he had been entertaining so wrought upon was he by the welter of his emotions by that fierce strife between his conscience and his egotism that he came abruptly to his feet a cry upon his lips  vade retro sathanas  old nicholas looking up abruptly saw the lads face waxen his brow bedewed with sweat  master lionel master lionel he cried his small bright eyes concernedly scanning his young masters face what be amiss  lionel mopped his brow sir oliver has gone to arwenack upon a punitive business said he  an what be that zur quoth nicholas  he has gone to punish sir john for having maligned him  a grin spread upon the weatherbeaten countenance of nicholas  be that so marry twere time sir john he be over long i th tongue  lionel stood amazed at the mans easy confidence and supreme assurance of how his master must acquit himself  you you have no fear nicholas he did not add of what but the servant understood and his grin grew broader still  fear lackaday i baint afeeard for sir oliver and doant ee be afeeard sir oliverll be home to sup with a sharpset appetitetis the only difference fighting ever made to he  the servant was justified of his confidence by the events though through a slight error of judgment sir oliver did not quite accomplish all that promised and intended in anger and when he deemed that he had been affronted he wasas his chronicler never wearies of insisting and as you shall judge before the end of this tale is reachedof a tigerish ruthlessness he rode to arwenack fully resolved to kill his calumniator nothing less would satisfy him arrived at that fine embattled castle of the killigrews which commanded the entrance to the estuary of the fal and from whose crenels the country might be surveyed as far as the lizard fifteen miles away he found peter godolphin there before him and because of peters presence sir oliver was more deliberate and formal in his accusation of sir john than he had intended he desired in accusing sir john also to clear himself in the eyes of rosamunds brother to make the latter realize how entirely odious were the calumnies which sir john had permitted himself and how basely prompted  sir john however came halfway to meet the quarrel his rancour against the pirate of penarrowas he had come to dub sir oliverendered him almost as eager to engage as was his visitor  they found a secluded corner of the deerpark for their business and there sir johna slim sallow gentleman of some thirty years of agemade an onslaught with sword and dagger upon sir oliver full worthy of the onslaught he had made earlier with his tongue but his impetuosity availed him less than nothing sir oliver was come there with a certain purpose and it was his way that he never failed to carry through a thing to which he set his hand  in three minutes it was all over and sir oliver was carefully wiping his blade whilst sir john lay coughing upon the turf tended by whitefaced peter godolphin and a scared groom who had been bidden thither to make up the necessary tale of witnesses  sir oliver sheathed his weapons and resumed his coat then came to stand over his fallen foe considering him critically  i think i have silenced him for a little time only he said and i confess that i intended to do better i hope however that the lesson will suffice and that he will lie no moreat least concerning me  do you mock a fallen man was master godolphins angry protest  god forbid said sir oliver soberly there is no mockery in my heart there is believe me nothing but regretregret that i should not have done the thing more thoroughly i will send assistance from the house as i go give you good day master peter  from arwenack he rode round by penryn on his homeward way but he did not go straight home he paused at the gates of godolphin court which stood above trefusis point commanding the view of carrick roads he turned in under the old gateway and drew up in the courtyard leaping to the kidneystones that paved it he announced himself a visitor to mistress rosamund  he found her in her bowera light turreted chamber on the mansions eastern side with windows that looked out upon that lovely sheet of water and the wooded slopes beyond she was sitting with a book in her lap in the deep of that tall window when he entered preceded and announced by sally pentreath who now her tirewoman had once been her nurse  she rose with a little exclamation of gladness when he appeared under the lintelscarce high enough to admit him without stoopingand stood regarding him across the room with brightened eyes and flushing cheeks  what need is there to describe her in the blaze of notoriety into which she was anon to be thrust by sir oliver tressilian there was scarce a poet in england who did not sing the grace and loveliness of rosamund godolphin and in all conscience enough of those fragments have survived like her brother she was tawny headed and she was divinely tall though as yet her figure in its girlishness was almost too slender for her height  i had not looked for you so early she was beginning when she observed that his countenance was oddly stern why what has happened she cried her intuitions clamouring loudly of some mischance  naught to alarm you sweet yet something that may vex you he set an arm about that lissom waist of hers above the swelling farthingale and gently led her back to her chair then flung himself upon the windowseat beside her you hold sir john killigrew in some affection he said between statement and inquiry  why yes he was our guardian until my brother came of full age  sir oliver made a wry face aye theres the rub well ive all but killed him  she drew back into her chair recoiling before him and he saw horror leap to her eyes and blench her face he made haste to explain the causes that had led to this he told her briefly of the calumnies concerning him that sir john had put about to vent his spite at having been thwarted in a matter of his coveted licence to build at smithick  that mattered little he concluded i knew these tales concerning me were abroad and i held them in the same contempt as i hold their utterer but he went further rose he poisoned your brothers mind against me and he stirred up in him the slumbering rancour that in my fathers time was want to lie between our houses today peter came to me with the clear intent to make a quarrel he affronted me as no man has ever dared  she cried out at that her already great alarm redoubled he smiled  do not suppose that i could harm him he is your brother and so sacred to me he came to tell me that no betrothal was possible between us forbade me ever again to visit godolphin court dubbed me pirate and vampire to my face and reviled my fathers memory i tracked the evil of all this to its source in killigrew and rode straight to arwenack to dam that source of falsehood for all time i did not accomplish quite so much as i intended you see i am frank my rose it may be that sir john will live if so i hope that he may profit by this lesson i have come straight to you he concluded that you may hear the tale from me before another comes to malign me with false stories of this happening  you you mean peter she cried  alas he sighed  she sat very still and white looking straight before her and not at all at sir oliver at length she spoke  i am not skilled in reading men she said in a sad small voice how should i be that am but a maid who has led a cloistered life i was told of you that you were violent and passionate a man of bitter enmities easily stirred to hatreds cruel and ruthless in the persecution of them  you too have been listening to sir john he muttered and laughed shortly  all this was i told she pursued as if he had not spoken and all did i refuse to believe because my heart was given to you yet yet of what have you made proof today  of forbearance said he shortly  forbearance she echoed and her lips writhed in a smile of weary irony surely you mock me  he set himself to explain  i have told you what sir john had done i have told you that the greater part of itand matter all that touched my honouri know sir john to have done long since yet i suffered it in silence and contempt was that to show myself easily stirred to ruthlessness what was it but forbearance when however he carries his petty hucksters rancour so far as to seek to choke for me my source of happiness in life and sends your brother to affront me i am still so forbearing that i recognize your brother to be no more than a tool and go straight to the hand that wielded him because i know of your affection for sir john i gave him such latitude as no man of honour in england would have given him  then seeing that she still avoided his regard still sat in that frozen attitude of horror at learning that the man she loved had imbrued his hands with the blood of another whom she also loved his pleading quickened to a warmer note he flung himself upon his knees beside her chair and took in his great sinewy hands the slender fingers which she listlessly surrendered rose he cried and his deep voice quivered with intercession dismiss all that you have heard from out your mind consider only this thing that has befallen suppose that lionel my brother came to you and that having some measure of power and authority to support him he swore to you that you should never wed me swore to prevent this marriage because he deemed you such a woman as could not bear my name with honour to myself and suppose that to all this he added insult to the memory of your dead father what answer would you return him speak rose be honest with thyself and me deem yourself in my place and say in honesty if you can still condemn me for what i have done say if it differs much from what you would wish to do in such a case as i have named  her eyes scanned now his upturned face every line of which was pleading to her and calling for impartial judgment her face grew troubled and then almost fierce she set her hands upon his shoulders and looked deep into his eyes  you swear to me noll that all is as you have told it meyou have added naught you have altered naught to make the tale more favourable to yourself  you need such oaths from me he asked and she saw sorrow spread upon his countenance  if i did i should not love thee noll but in such an hour i need your own assurance will you not be generous and bear with me strengthen me to withstand anything that may be said hereafter  as gods my witness i have told you true in all he answered solemnly  she sank her head to his shoulder she was weeping softly overwrought by this climax to all that in silence and in secret she had suffered since he had come awooing her  then she said i believe you acted rightly i believe with you that no man of honour could have acted otherwise i must believe you noll for did i not then i could believe in naught and hope for naught you are as a fire that has seized upon the better part of me and consumed it all to ashes that you may hold it in your heart i am content so you be true  true i shall ever be sweetheart he whispered fervently could i be less since you are sent to make me so  she looked at him again and now she was smiling wistfully through her tears  and you will bear with peter she implored him  he shall have no power to anger me he answered i swear that too do you know that but today he struck me  struck you you did not tell me that  my quarrel was not with him but with the rogue that sent him i laughed at the blow was he not sacred to me  he is good at heart noll she pursued in time he will come to love you as you deserve and you will come to know that he too deserves your love  he deserves it now for the love he bears to you  and you will think ever thus during the little while of waiting that perforce must lie before us  i shall never think otherwise sweet meanwhile i shall avoid him and that no harm may come should he forbid me godolphin court ill even stay away in less than a year you will be of full age and none may hinder you to come and go what is a year with such hope as mine to still impatience  she stroked his face art very gentle with me ever noll she murmured fondly i cannot credit you are ever harsh to any as they say  heed them not he answered her i may have been something of all that but you have purified me rose what man that loved you could be aught but gentle he kissed her and stood up i had best be going now he said i shall walk along the shore towards trefusis point tomorrow morning if you should chance to be similarly disposed  she laughed and rose in her turn i shall be there dear noll  twere best so hereafter he assured her smiling and so took his leave  she followed him to the stairhead and watched him as he descended with eyes that took pride in the fine upright carriage of that stalwart masterful lover     chapter iii the forge   sir olivers wisdom in being the first to bear rosamund the story of that days happenings was established anon when master godolphin returned home he went straight in quest of his sister and in a frame of mind oppressed by fear and sorrow for sir john by his general sense of discomfiture at the hands of sir oliver and by the anger begotten of all this he was harsh in manner and disposed to hector  madam he announced abruptly sir john is like to die  the astounding answer she returned himthat is astounding to himdid not tend to soothe his sorely ruffled spirit  i know she said and i believe him to deserve no less who deals in calumny should be prepared for the wages of it  he stared at her in a long furious silence then exploded into oaths and finally inveighed against her unnaturalness and pronounced her bewitched by that foul dog tressilian  it is fortunate for me she answered him composedly that he was here before you to give me the truth of this affair then her assumed calm and the anger with which she had met his own all fell away from her oh peter peter she cried in anguish i hope that sir john will recover i am distraught by this event but be just i implore you sir oliver has told me how harddriven he had been  he shall be driven harder yet as gods my life if you think this deed shall go unpunished  she flung herself upon his breast and implored him to carry this quarrel no further she spoke of her love for sir oliver and announced her firm resolve to marry him in despite of all opposition that could be made all of which did not tend to soften her brothers humour yet because of the love that ever had held these two in closest bonds he went so far in the end as to say that should sir john recover he would not himself pursue the matter further but if sir john should dieas was very likelyhonour compelled him to seek vengeance of a deed to which he had himself so very largely contributed  i read that man as if he were an open book the boy announced with callow boastfulness he has the subtlety of satan yet he does not delude me it was at me he struck through killigrew because he desires you rosamund he could notas he bluntly told medeal with me however i provoked him not even though i went the length of striking him he might have killed me fort but he knew that to do so would place a barrier twixt him and you oh he is calculating as all the fiends of hell so to wipe out the dishonour which i did him he shifts the blame of it upon killigrew and goes out to kill him which he further thinks may act as a warning to me but if killigrew dies and thus he rambled on filling her gentle heart with anguish to see this feud increasing between the two men she loved best in all the world if the outcome of it should be that either were to kill the other she knew that she could never again look upon the survivor  she took heart at last in the memory of sir olivers sworn promise that her brothers life should be inviolate to him betide what might she trusted him she depended upon his word and that rare strength of his which rendered possible to him a course that no weaker man would dare pursue and in this reflection her pride in him increased and she thanked god for a lover who in all things was a giant among men  but sir john killigrew did not die he hovered between this world and a better one for some seven days at the end of which he began to recover by october he was abroad again gaunt and pale reduced to half the bulk that had been his before a mere shadow of a man  one of his first visits was to godolphin court he went to remonstrate with rosamund upon her betrothal and he did so at the request of her brother but his remonstrances were strangely lacking in the force that she had looked for  the odd fact is that in his near approach to death and with his earthly interest dwindling sir john had looked matters frankly in the face and had been driven to the conclusiona conclusion impossible to him in normal healththat he had got no more than he deserved he realized that he had acted unworthily if unconscious at the time of the unworthiness of what he did that the weapons with which he had fought sir oliver were not the weapons that become a gentleman or in which there is credit to be won he perceived that he had permitted his old enmity for the house of tressilian swollen by a sense of injury lately suffered in the matter of the licence to build at smithick to warp his judgment and to persuade him that sir oliver was all he had dubbed him he realized that jealousy too had taken a hand in the matter sir olivers exploits upon the seas had brought him wealth and with this wealth he was building up once more the tressilian sway in those parts which ralph tressilian had so outrageously diminished so that he threatened to eclipse the importance of the killigrews of arwenack  nevertheless in the hour of reaction he did not go so far as to admit that sir oliver tressilian was a fit mate for rosamund godolphin she and her brother had been placed in his care by their late father and he had nobly discharged his tutelage until such time as peter had come to full age his affection for rosamund was tender as that of a lover but tempered by a feeling entirely paternal he went very near to worshipping her and when all was said when he had cleared his mind of all dishonest bias he still found overmuch to dislike in oliver tressilian and the notion of his becoming rosamunds husband was repellent  first of all there was that bad tressilian bloodnotoriously bad and never more flagrantly displayed than in the case of the late ralph tressilian it was impossible that oliver should have escaped the taint of it nor could sir john perceive any signs that he had done so he displayed the traditional tressilian turbulence he was passionate and brutal and the pirates trade to which he had now set his hand was of all trades the one for which he was by nature best equipped he was harsh and overbearing impatient of correction and prone to trample other mens feelings underfoot was this he asked himself in all honesty a mate for rosamund could he entrust her happiness to the care of such a man assuredly he could not  therefore being whole again he went to remonstrate with her as he accounted it his duty and as master peter had besought him yet knowing the bias that had been his he was careful to understate rather than to overstate his reasons  but sir john she protested if every man is to be condemned for the sins of his forbears but few could escape condemnation and wherever shall you find me a husband deserving your approval  his father began sir john  tell me not of his father but of himself she interrupted  he frowned impatientlythey were sitting in that bower of hers above the river  i was coming to t he answered a thought testily for these interruptions which made him keep to the point robbed him of his best arguments however suffice it that many of his fathers vicious qualities he has inherited as we see in his ways of life that he has not inherited others only the future can assure us  in other words she mocked him yet very seriously i am to wait until he dies of old age to make quite sure that he has no such sins as must render him an unfitting husband  no no he cried good lack what a perverseness is thine  the perverseness is your own sir john i am but the mirror of it  he shifted in his chair and grunted be it so then he snapped we will deal with the qualities that already he displays and sir john enumerated them  but this is no more than your judgment of himno more than what you think him  tis what all the world thinks him  but i shall not marry a man for what others think of him but for what i think of him myself and in my view you cruelly malign him i discover no such qualities in sir oliver  tis that you should be spared such a discovery that i am beseeching you not to wed him  yet unless i wed him i shall never make such a discovery and until i make it i shall ever continue to love him and to desire to wed him is all my life to be spent so she laughed outright and came to stand beside him she put an arm about his neck as she might have put it about the neck of her father as she had been in the habit of doing any day in these past ten yearsand thereby made him feel himself to have reached an unconscionable age with her hand she rubbed his brow  why here are wicked wrinkles of illhumour she cried to him you are all undone and by a womans wit and you do not like it  i am undone by a womans wilfulness by a womans headstrong resolve not to see  you have naught to show me sir john  naught is all that i have said naught  words are not things judgments are not facts you say that he is so and so and so but when i ask you upon what facts you judge him your only answer is that you think him to be what you say he is your thoughts may be honest sir john but your logic is contemptible and she laughed again at his gaping discomfiture come now deal like an honest upright judge and tell me one act of hisone thing that he has ever done and of which you have sure knowledgethat will bear him out to be what you say he is now sir john  he looked up at her impatiently then at last he smiled  rogue he criedand upon a distant day he was to bethink him of those words if ever he be brought to judgment i can desire him no better advocate than thou  thereupon following up her advantage swiftly she kissed him nor could i desire him a more honest judge than you  what was the poor man to do thereafter what he did live up to her pronouncement and go forthwith to visit sir oliver and compose their quarrel  the acknowledgment of his fault was handsomely made and sir oliver received it in a spirit no less handsome but when sir john came to the matter of mistress rosamund he was out of his sense of duty to her less generous he announced that since he could not bring himself to look upon sir oliver as a suitable husband for her nothing that he had now said must mislead sir oliver into supposing him a consenting party to any such union  but that he added is not to say that i oppose it i disapprove but i stand aside until she is of full age her brother will refuse his sanction after that the matter will concern neither him nor myself  i hope said sir oliver he will take as wise a view but whatever view he takes will be no matter for the rest sir john i thank you for your frankness and i rejoice to know that if i may not count you for my friend at least i need not reckon you among my enemies  but if sir john was thus won round to a neutral attitude master peters rancour abated nothing rather it increased each day and presently there came another matter to feed it a matter of which sir oliver had no suspicion  he knew that his brother lionel rode almost daily to malpas and he knew the object of those daily rides he knew of the lady who kept a sort of court there for the rustic bucks of truro penryn and helston and he knew something of the illrepute that had attached to her in towna repute in fact which had been the cause of her withdrawal into the country he told his brother some frank and ugly truths concerning her by way of warning him and therein for the first time the twain went very near to quarrelling  after that he mentioned her no more he knew that in his indolent way lionel could be headstrong and he knew human nature well enough to be convinced that interference here would but set up a breach between himself and his brother without in the least achieving its real object so oliver shrugged resignedly and held his peace  there he left the affair nor ever spoke again of malpas and the siren who presided there and meanwhile the autumn faded into winter and with the coming of stormy weather sir oliver and rosamund had fewer opportunities of meeting to godolphin court he would not go since she did not desire it and himself he deemed it best to remain away since otherwise he must risk a quarrel with its master who had forbidden him the place in those days he saw peter godolphin but little and on the rare occasions when they did meet they passed each other with a very meagre salute  sir oliver was entirely happy and men noticed how gentler were his accents how sunnier had become a countenance that they had known for haughty and forbidding he waited for his coming happiness with the confidence of an immortal in the future patience was all the service fate asked of him and he gave that service blithely depending upon the reward that soon now would be his own indeed the year drew near its close and ere another winter should come round penarrow house would own a mistress that to him seemed as inevitable as the season itself and yet for all his supreme confidence for all his patience and the happiness he culled from it there were moments when he seemed oppressed by some elusive sense of overhanging doom by some subconsciousness of an evil in the womb of destiny did he challenge his oppression did he seek to translate it into terms of reason he found nothing upon which his wits could fastenand he came ever to conclude that it was his very happiness by its excessiveness that was oppressing him giving him at times that sense of premonitory weight about the heart as if to check its joyous soarings  one day a week from christmas he had occasion to ride to helston on some trifling affair for half a week a blizzard had whirled about the coast and he had been kept chafing indoors what time layer upon layer of snow was spread upon the countryside on the fourth day the storm being spent the sun came forth the skies were swept clear of clouds and all the countryside lay robed in a sundrenched dazzling whiteness sir oliver called for his horse and rode forth alone through the crisp snow he turned homeward very early in the afternoon but when a couple of miles from helston he found that his horse had cast a shoe he dismounted and bridle over arm tramped on through the sunlit vale between the heights of pendennis and arwenack singing as he went he came thus to smithick and the door of the forge about it stood a group of fishermen and rustics for in the absence of any inn just there this forge was ever a point of congregation in addition to the rustics and an itinerant merchant with his packhorses there were present sir andrew flack the parson from penryn and master gregory baine one of the justices from the neighbourhood of truro both were well known to sir oliver and he stood in friendly gossip with them what time he waited for his horse  it was all very unfortunate from the casting of that shoe to the meeting with those gentlemen for as sir oliver stood there down the gentle slope from arwenack rode master peter godolphin  it was said afterwards by sir andrew and master baine that master peter appeared to have been carousing so flushed was his face so unnatural the brightness of his eye so thick his speech and so extravagant and foolish what he said there can be little doubt that it was so he was addicted to canary and so indeed was sir john killigrew and he had been dining with sir john he was of those who turn quarrelsome in winewhich is but another way of saying that when the wine was in and the restraint out his natural humour came uppermost untrammelled the sight of sir oliver standing there gave the lad precisely what he needed to indulge that evil humour of his and he may have been quickened in his purpose by the presence of those other gentlemen in his halffuddled state of mind he may have recalled that once he had struck sir oliver and sir oliver had laughed and told him that none would believe it  he drew rein suddenly as he came abreast of the group so suddenly that he pulled his horse until it almost sat down like a cat yet he retained his saddle then he came through the snow that was all squelched and mudded just about the forge and leered at sir oliver  i am from arwenack he announced unnecessarily we have been talking of you  you could have had no better subject of discourse said sir oliver smiling for all that his eyes were hard and something scaredthough his fears did not concern himself  marry you are right you make an engrossing topicyou and your debauched father  sir replied sir oliver once already have i deplored your mothers utter want of discretion  the words were out of him in a flash under the spur of the gross insult flung at him uttered in the momentary blind rage aroused by that inflamed and taunting face above him no sooner were they sped than he repented them the more bitterly because they were greeted by a guffaw from the rustics he would have given half his fortune in that moment to have recalled them  master godolphins face had changed as utterly as if he had removed a mask from flushed that it had been it was livid now and the eyes were blazing the mouth twitching thus a moment he glowered upon his enemy then standing in his stirrups he swung aloft his whip  you dog he cried in a snarling sob you dog and his lash came down and cut a long red wheal across sir olivers dark face  with cries of dismay and anger the others the parson the justice and the rustics got between the pair for sir oliver was looking very wicked and all the world knew him for a man to be feared  master godolphin i cry shame upon you exclaimed the parson if evil comes of this i shall testify to the grossness of your aggression get you gone from here  go to the devil sir said master godolphin thickly is my mothers name to be upon the lips of that bastard by god man the matter rests not here he shall send his friends to me or i will horsewhip him every time we meet you hear sir oliver  sir oliver made him no reply  you hear he roared there is no sir john killigrew this time upon whom you can shift the quarrel come you to me and get the punishment of which that whiplash is but an earnest then with a thick laugh he drove spurs into his horses flanks so furiously that he all but sent the parson and another sprawling  stay but a little while for me roared sir oliver after him youll ride no more my drunken fool  and in a rage he bellowed for his horse flinging off the parson and master baine who endeavoured to detain and calm him he vaulted to the saddle when the nag was brought him and whirled away in furious pursuit  the parson looked at the justice and the justice shrugged his lips tightpressed  the young fool is drunk said sir andrew shaking his white head hes in no case to meet his maker  yet he seems very eager quoth master justice baine i doubt i shall hear more of the matter he turned and looked into the forge where the bellows now stood idle the smith himself grimy and aproned in leather in the doorway listening to the rustics account of the happening master baine it seems had a taste for analogies faith he said the place was excellently well chosen they have forged here today a sword which it will need blood to temper     chapter iv the intervener   the parson had notions of riding after sir oliver and begged master baine to join him but the justice looked down his long nose and opined that no good purpose was to be served that tressilians were ever wild and bloody men and that an angry tressilian was a thing to be avoided sir andrew who was far from valorous thought there might be wisdom in the justices words and remembered that he had troubles enough of his own with a froward wife without taking up the burdens of others master godolphin and sir oliver between them quoth the justice had got up this storm of theirs a gods name let them settle it and if in the settling they should cut each others throats haply the countryside would be well rid of a brace of turbulent fellows the pedlar deemed them a couple of madmen whose ways were beyond the understanding of a sober citizen the othersthe fishermen and the rusticshad not the means to follow even had they had the will  they dispersed to put abroad the news of that short furious quarrel and to prophesy that blood would be let in the adjusting of it this prognostication the they based entirely upon their knowledge of the short tressilian way but it was a matter in which they were entirely wrong it is true that sir oliver went galloping along that road that follows the penryn river and that he pounded over the bridge in the town of penryn in master godolphins wake with murder in his heart men who saw him riding wildly thus with the red wheal across his white furious face said that he looked a very devil  he crossed the bridge at penryn a halfhour after sunset as dusk was closing into night and it may be that the sharp frosty air had a hand in the cooling of his blood for as he reached the rivers eastern bank he slackened his breakneck pace even as he slackened the angry galloping of his thoughts the memory of that oath he had sworn three months ago to rosamund smote him like a physical blow it checked his purpose and reflecting this his pace fell to an amble he shivered to think how near he had gone to wrecking all the happiness that lay ahead of him what was a boys whiplash that his resentment of it should set all his future life in jeopardy even though men should call him a coward for submitting to it and leaving the insult unavenged what should that matter moreover upon the body of him who did so proclaim him he could brand the lie of a charge so foolish sir oliver raised his eyes to the deep sapphire dome of heaven where an odd star was glittering frostily and thanked god from a swelling heart that he had not overtaken peter godolphin whilst his madness was upon him  a mile or so below penryn he turned up the road that ran down to the ferry there and took his way home over the shoulder of the hill with a slack rein it was not his usual way he was wont ever to go round by trefusis point that he might take a glimpse at the walls of the house that harboured rosamund and a glance at the window of her bower but tonight he thought the shorter road over the hill would be the safer way if he went by godolphin court he might chance to meet peter again and his past anger warned him against courting such a meeting warned him to avoid it lest evil should betide indeed so imperious was the warning and such were his fears of himself after what had just passed that he resolved to leave penarrow on the next day whither he would go he did not then determine he might repair to london and he might even go upon another cruisean idea which he had lately dismissed under rosamunds earnest intercession but it was imperative that he should quit the neighbourhood and place a distance between peter godolphin and himself until such time as he might take rosamund to wife eight months or so of exile but what matter better so than that he should be driven into some deed that would compel him to spend his whole lifetime apart from her he would write and she would understand and approve when he told her what had passed that day  the resolve was firmly implanted in him by the time he reached penarrow and he felt himself uplifted by it and by the promise it afforded him that thus his future happiness would be assured  himself he stabled his horse for of the two grooms he kept one had by his leave set out yesterday to spend christmas in devon with his parents the other had taken a chill and had been ordered to bed that very day by sir oliver who was considerate with those that served him in the diningroom he found supper spread and a great log fire blazed in the enormous cowled fireplace diffusing a pleasant warmth through the vast room and flickering ruddily upon the trophies of weapons that adorned the walls upon the tapestries and the portraits of dead tressilians hearing his step old nicholas entered bearing a great candlebranch which he set upon the table  youm late sir oliver said the servant and master lionel baint home yet neither  sir oliver grunted and scowled as he crunched a log and set it sizzling under his wet heel he thought of malpas and cursed lionels folly as without a word he loosed his cloak and flung it on an oaken coffer by the wall where already he had cast his hat then he sat down and nicholas came forward to draw off his boots  when that was done and the old servant stood up again sir oliver shortly bade him to serve supper  master lionel cannot be long now said he and give me to drink nick tis what i most require  ive brewed ee a posset o canary sack announced nicholas therem no better supping o a frosty winters night sir oliver  he departed to return presently with a black jack that was steaming fragrantly he found his master still in the same attitude staring at the fire and frowning darkly sir olivers thoughts were still of his brother and malpas and so insistent were they that his own concerns were for the moment quite neglected he was considering whether it was not his duty after all to attempt a word of remonstrance at length he rose with a sigh and got to table there he bethought him of his sick groom and asked nicholas for news of him nicholas reported the fellow to be much as he had been whereupon sir oliver took up a cup and brimmed it with the steaming posset  take him that he said theres no better medicine for such an ailment  outside fell a clatter of hooves  here be master lionel at last said the servant  no doubt agreed sir oliver no need to stay for him here is all he needs carry that to tom ere it cools  it was his object to procure the servants absence when lionel should arrive resolved as he was to greet him with a sound rating for his folly reflection had brought him the assurance that this was become his duty in view of his projected absence from penarrow and in his brothers interest he was determined not to spare him  he took a deep draught of the posset and as he set it down he heard lionels step without then the door was flung open and his brother stood on the threshold a moment at gaze  sir oliver looked round with a scowl the wellconsidered reproof already on his lips  so he began and got no further the sight that met his eyes drove the ready words from his lips and mind instead it was with a sharp gasp of dismay that he came immediately to his feet lionel  lionel lurched in closed the door and shot home one of its bolts then he leaned against it facing his brother again he was deathly pale with great dark stains under his eyes his ungloved right hand was pressed to his side and the fingers of it were all smeared with blood that was still oozing and dripping from between them over his yellow doublet on the right side there was a spreading dark stain whose nature did not intrigue sir oliver a moment  my god he cried and ran to his brother whats happened lal who has done this  peter godolphin came the answer from lips that writhed in a curious smile  never a word said sir oliver but he set his teeth and clenched his hands until the nails cut into his palms then he put an arm about this lad he loved above all save one in the whole world and with anguish in his mind he supported him forward to the fire there lionel dropped to the chair that sir oliver had lately occupied  what is your hurt lad has it gone deep he asked in terror almost  tis naughta flesh wound but i have lost a mort of blood i thought i should have been drained or ever i got me home  with fearful speed sir oliver drew his dagger and ripped away doublet vest and shirt laying bare the lads white flesh a moments examination and he breathed more freely  art a very babe lal he cried in his relief to ride without thought to stanch so simple a wound and so lose all this bloodbad tressilian blood though it be he laughed in the immensity of his reaction from that momentary terror stay thou there whilst i call nick to help us dress this scratch  no no there was note of sudden fear in the lads voice and his hand clutched at his brothers sleeve nick must not know none must know or i am undone else  sir oliver stared bewildered lionel smiled again that curious twisted rather frightened smile  i gave better than i took noll said he master godolphin is as cold by now as the snow on which i left him  his brothers sudden start and the fixed stare from out of his slowly paling face scared lionel a little he observed almost subconsciously the dull red wheal that came into prominence as the colour faded out of sir olivers face yet never thought to ask how it came there his own affairs possessed him too completely  whats this quoth oliver at last hoarsely  lionel dropped his eyes unable longer to meet a glance that was becoming terrible  he would have it he growled almost sullenly answering the reproach that was written in every line of his brothers taut body i had warned him not to cross my path but tonight i think some madness had seized upon him he affronted me noll he said things which it was beyond human power to endure and he shrugged to complete his sentence  well well said oliver in a small voice first let us tend this wound of yours  do not call nick was the others swift admonition dont you see noll he explained in answer to the inquiry of his brothers stare dont you see that we fought there almost in the dark and without witnesses it he swallowed it will be called murder fair fight though it was and should it be discovered that it was i he shivered and his glance grew wild his lips twitched  i see said oliver who understood at last and he added bitterly you fool  i had no choice protested lionel he came at me with his drawn sword indeed i think he was halfdrunk i warned him of what must happen to the other did either of us fall but he bade me not concern myself with the fear of any such consequences to himself he was full of foul words of me and you and all whoever bore our name he struck me with the flat of his blade and threatened to run me through as i stood unless i drew to defend myself what choice had i i did not mean to kill himas gods my witness i did not noll  without a word oliver turned to a sidetable where stood a metal basin and ewer he poured water then came in the same silence to treat his brothers wound the tale that lionel told made blame impossible at least from oliver he had but to recall the mood in which he himself had ridden after peter godolphin he had but to remember that only the consideration of rosamundonly indeed the consideration of his futurehad set a curb upon his own bloodthirsty humour  when he had washed the wound he fetched some table linen from a press and ripped it into strips with his dagger he threaded out one of these and made a preliminary crisscross of the threads across the lips of the woundfor the blade had gone right through the muscles of the breast grazing the ribs these threads would help the formation of a clot then with the infinite skill and cunning acquired in the course of his rovings he proceeded to the bandaging  that done he opened the window and flung out the bloodtinted water the cloths with which he had mopped the wound and all other similar evidences of the treatment he cast upon the fire he must remove all traces even from the eyes of nicholas he had the most implicit trust in the old servants fidelity but the matter was too grave to permit of the slightest risk he realized fully the justice of lionels fears that however fair the fight might have been a thing done thus in secret must be accounted murder by the law  bidding lionel wrap himself in his cloak sir oliver unbarred the door and went upstairs in quest of a fresh shirt and doublet for his brother on the landing he met nicholas descending he held him a moment in talk of the sick man above and outwardly at least he was now entirely composed he dispatched him upstairs again upon a trumpedup errand that must keep him absent for some little time whilst himself he went to get the things he needed  he returned below with them and when he had assisted his brother into fresh garments with as little movement as possible so as not to disturb his dressing of the wound or set it bleeding afresh he took the bloodstained doublet vest and shirt which he had ripped and flung them too into the great fire  when some moments later nicholas entered the vast room he found the brothers sitting composedly at table had he faced lionel he would have observed little amiss with him beyond the deep pallor of his face but he did not even do so much lionel sat with his back to the door and the servants advance into the room was checked by sir oliver with the assurance that they did not require him nicholas withdrew again and the brothers were once more alone  lionel ate very sparingly he thirsted and would have emptied the measure of posset but that sir oliver restrained him and refused him anything but water lest he should contract a fever such a sparing meal as they madefor neither had much appetitewas made in silence at last sir oliver rose and with slow heavy steps suggestive of his humour he crossed to the fireplace he threw fresh logs on the blaze and took from the tall mantelshelf his pipe and a leaden jar of tobacco he filled the pipe pensively then with the short iron tongs seized a fragment of glowing wood and applied it to the herb  he returned to the table and standing over his brother he broke at last the silence that had now endured some time  what he asked gruffly was the cause of your quarrel  lionel started and shrank a little between finger and thumb he kneaded a fragment of bread his eyes upon it i scarce know he replied  lal that is not the truth  how  tis not the truth i am not to be put off with such an answer yourself you said that you had warned him not to cross your path what path was in your mind  lionel leaned his elbows on the table and took his head in his hands weak from loss of blood overwrought mentally as well in a state of revulsion and reaction also from the pursuit which had been the cause of tonights tragic affair he had not strength to withhold the confidence his brother asked on the contrary it seemed to him that in making such a confidence he would find a haven and refuge in sir oliver  twas that wanton at malpas was the cause of all he complained and sir olivers eye flashed at the words i deemed her quite other i was a fool a fool ihe choked and a sob shook himi thought she loved me i would have married her i would so by god  sir oliver swore softly under his breath  i believed her pure and good and he checked after all who am i to say even now that she was not twas no fault of hers twas he that foul dog godolphin who perverted her until he came all was well between us and then  i see said sir oliver quietly i think you have something for which to thank him if he revealed to you the truth of that strumpets nature i would have warned thee lad but perhaps i have been weak in that  it was not so it was not she  i say it was and if i say so i am to be believed lionel id smirch no womans reputation without just cause be very sure of that  lionel stared up at him o god he cried presently i know not what to believe i am a shuttlecock flung this way and that way  believe me said sir oliver grimly and set all doubts to rest then he smiled so that was the virtuous master peters secret pastime eh the hypocrisy of man there is no plumbing the endless depths of it  he laughed outright remembering all the things that master peter had said of ralph tressiliandelivering himself as though he were some chaste and selfdenying anchorite then on that laugh he caught his breath quite suddenly would she know he asked fearfully would that harlot know would she suspect that twas your hand did this  ayewould she replied the other i told her tonight when she flouted me and spoke of him that i went straight to find him and pay the score between us i was on my way to godolphin court when i came upon him in the park  then you lied to me again lionel for you said twas he attacked you  and so he did lionel countered instantly he never gave me time to speak but flung down from his horse and came at me snarling like a crossgrained mongrel oh he was as ready for the fight as ias eager  but the woman at malpas knows said sir oliver gloomily and if she tells  shell not cried lionel she dare not for her reputations sake  indeed i think you are right agreed his brother with relief she dare not for other reasons when i come to think of it her reputation is already such and so well detested is she that were it known she had been the cause however indirect of this the countryside would satisfy certain longings that it entertains concerning her you are sure none saw you either going or returning  none  sir oliver strode the length of the room and back pulling at his pipe all should be well then i think said he at last you were best abed ill carry you thither  he took up his stripling brother in his powerful arms and bore him upstairs as though he were a babe  when he had seen him safely disposed for slumber he returned below shut the door in the hall drew up the great oaken chair to the fire and sat there far into the night smoking and thinking  he had said to lionel that all should be well all should be well for lionel but what of himself with the burden of this secret on his soul were the victim another than rosamunds brother the matter would have plagued him but little the fact that godolphin was slain it must be confessed was not in itself the source of his oppression godolphin had more than deserved his end and he would have come by it months ago at sir olivers own hand but for the fact that he was rosamunds brother as we know there was the rub the bitter cruel rub her own brother had fallen by the hand of his she loved her brother more than any living being next to himself just as he loved lionel above any other but herself the pain that must be hers he knew he experienced some of it in anticipation participating it because it was hers and because all things that were hers he must account in some measure his own  he rose up at last cursing that wanton at malpas who had come to fling this fresh and terrible difficulty where already he had to face so many he stood leaning upon the overmantel his foot upon one of the dogs of the fender and considered what to do he must bear his burden in silence that was all he must keep this secret even from rosamund it split his heart to think that he must practise this deceit with her but naught else was possible short of relinquishing her and that was far beyond his strength  the resolve adopted he took up a taper and went off to bed     chapter v the buckler   it was old nicholas who brought the news next morning to the brothers as they were breaking their fast  lionel should have kept his bed that day but dared not lest the fact should arouse suspicion he had a little fever the natural result both of his wound and of his loss of blood he was inclined to welcome rather than deplore it since it set a flush on cheeks that otherwise must have looked too pale  so leaning upon his brothers arm he came down to a breakfast of herrings and small ale before the tardy sun of that december morning was well risen  nicholas burst in upon them with a white face and shaking limbs he gasped out his tale of the event in a voice of terror and both brothers affected to be shocked dismayed and incredulous but the worst part of that old mans news the true cause of his terrible agitation was yet to be announced  and they do zay he cried with anger quivering through his fear they do zay that it were you that killed he sir oliver  i quoth sir oliver staring and suddenly like a flood there burst upon his mind a hundred reasons overlooked until this moment that inevitably must urge the countryside to this conclusion and to this conclusion only where heard you that foul lie  in the tumult of his mind he never heeded what answer was returned by nicholas what could it matter where the fellow had heard the thing by now it would be the accusation on the lips of every man there was one course to take and he must take it instantlyas he had taken it once before in like case he must straight to rosamund to forestall the tale that others would carry to her god send he did not come too late already  he stayed for no more than to get his boots and hat then to the stables for a horse and he was away over the short mile that divided penarrow from godolphin court going by bridle and track meadow straight to his goal he met none until he fetched up in the courtyard at godolphin court thence a babble of excited voices had reached him as he approached but at sight of him there fell a general silence ominous and staring a dozen men or more were assembled there and their eyes considered him first with amazement and curiosity then with sullen anger  he leapt down from his saddle and stood a moment waiting for one of the three godolphin grooms he had perceived in that assembly to take his reins seeing that none stirred  how now he cried does no one wait here hither sirrah and hold my horse  the groom addressed hesitated a moment then under the stare of sir olivers hard commanding eye he shuffled sullenly forward to do as he was bid a murmur ran through the group sir oliver flashed a glance upon it and every tongue trembled into silence  in that silence he strode up the steps and entered the rushstrewn hall as he vanished he heard the hubbub behind him break out anew fiercer than it had been before but he nothing heeded it  he found himself face to face with a servant who shrank before him staring as those in the courtyard had stared his heart sank it was plain that he came a little late already that the tale had got there ahead of him  where is your mistress said he  ii will tell her you are here sir oliver the man replied in a voice that faltered and he passed through a doorway on the right sir oliver stood a moment tapping his boots with his whip his face pale a deep line between his brows then the man reappeared closing the door after him  mistress rosamund bids you depart sir she will not see you  a moment sir oliver scanned the servants faceor appeared to scan it for it is doubtful if he saw the fellow at all then for only answer he strode forward towards the door from which the man had issued the servant set his back to it his face resolute  sir oliver my mistress will not see you  out of my way he muttered in his angry contemptuous fashion and as the man persistent in his duty stood his ground sir oliver took him by the breast of his jacket heaved him aside and went in  she was standing in midapartment dressed by an odd irony all in bridal white that yet was not as white as was her face her eyes looked like two black stains solemn and haunting as they fastened up on this intruder who would not be refused her lips parted but she had no word for him she just stared in a horror that routed all his audacity and checked the masterfulness of his advance at last he spoke  i see that you have heard said he the lie that runs the countryside that is evil enough but i see that you have lent an ear to it and that is worse  she continued to regard him with a cold look of loathing this child that but two days ago had lain against his heart gazing up at him in trust and adoration  rosamund he cried and approached her by another step rosamund i am here to tell you that it is a lie  you had best go she said and her voice had in it a quality that made him tremble  go he echoed stupidly you bid me go you will not hear me  i consented to hear you more than once refused to hear others who knew better than i and was heedless of their warnings there is no more to be said between us i pray god that they may take and hang you  he was white to the lips and for the first time in his life he knew fear and felt his great limbs trembling under him  they may hang me and welcome since you believe this thing they could not hurt me more than you are doing nor by hanging me could they deprive me of aught i value since your faith in me is a thing to be blown upon by the first rumour of the countryside  he saw the pale lips twist themselves into a dreadful smile there is more than rumour i think said she there is more than all your lies will ever serve to cloak  my lies he cried rosamund i swear to you by my honour that i have had no hand in the slaying of peter may god rot me where i stand if this be not true  it seems said a harsh voice behind him that you fear god as little as aught else  he wheeled sharply to confront sir john killigrew who had entered after him  so he said slowly and his eyes grew hard and bright as agates this is your work and he waved a hand towards rosamund it was plain to what he alluded  my work quoth sir john he closed the door and advanced into the room sir it seems your audacity your shamelessness transcends all bounds your  have done with that sir oliver interrupted him and smote his great fist upon the table he was suddenly swept by a gust of passion leave words to fools sir john and criticisms to those that can defend them better  aye you talk like a man of blood you come hectoring it here in the very house of the deadin the very house upon which you have cast this blight of sorrow and murder  have done i say or murder there will be  his voice was a roar his mien terrific and bold man though sir john was he recoiled instantly sir oliver had conquered himself again he swung to rosamund ah forgive me he pleaded i am madstark mad with anguish at the thing imputed i have not loved your brother it is true but as i swore to you so have i done i have taken blows from him and smiled but yesterday in a public place he affronted me lashed me across the face with his ridingwhip as i still bear the mark the man who says i were not justified in having killed him for it is a liar and a hypocrite yet the thought of you rosamund the thought that he was your brother sufficed to quench the rage in which he left me and now that by some grim mischance he has met his death my recompense for all my patience for all my thought for you is that i am charged with slaying him and that you believe this charge  she has no choice rasped killigrew  sir john he cried i pray you do not meddle with her choice that you believe it marks you for a fool and a fools counsel is a rotten staff to lean upon at any time why god o mercy assume that i desired to take satisfaction for the affront he had put upon me do you know so little of men and of me of all men that you suppose i should go about my vengeance in this holeandcorner fashion to set a hangmans noose about my neck a fine vengeance that as god lives was it so i dealt with you sir john when you permitted your tongue to wag too freely as you have yourself confessed heavens light man take a proper view consider was this matter likely i take it you are a more fearsome antagonist than was ever poor peter godolphin yet when i sought satisfaction of you i sought it boldly and openly as is my way when we measured swords in your park at arwenack we did so before witnesses in proper form that the survivor might not be troubled with the justices you know me well and what manner of man i am with my weapons should i not have done the like by peter if i had sought his life should i not have sought it in the same open fashion and so killed him at my pleasure and leisure and without risk or reproach from any  sir john was stricken thoughtful here was logic hard and clear as ice and the knight of arwenack was no fool but whilst he stood frowning and perplexed at the end of that long tirade it was rosamund who gave sir oliver his answer  you ran no risk of reproach from any do you say  he turned and was abashed he knew the thought that was running in her mind  you mean he said slowly gently his accents charged with reproachful incredulity that i am so base and false that i could in this fashion do what i dared not for your sake do openly tis what you mean rosamund i burn with shame for you that you can think such thoughts of one whom whom you professed to love  her coldness fell from her under the lash of his bitter halfscornful accents her anger mounted whelming for a moment even her anguish in her brothers death  you false deceiver she cried there are those who heard you vow his death your very words have been reported to me and from where he lay they found a trail of blood upon the snow that ran to your own door will you still lie  they saw the colour leave his face they saw his arms drop limply to his sides and his eyes dilate with obvious sudden fear  a a trail of blood he faltered stupidly  aye answer that cut in sir john fetched suddenly from out his doubts by that reminder  sir oliver turned upon killigrew again the knights words restored to him the courage of which rosamunds had bereft him with a man he could fight with a man there was no need to mince his words  i cannot answer it he said but very firmly in a tone that brushed aside all implications if you say it was so so it must have been yet when all is said what does it prove does it set it beyond doubt that it was i who killed him does it justify the woman who loved me to believe me a murderer and something worse he paused and looked at her again a world of reproach in his glance she had sunk to a chair and rocked there her fingers locking and interlocking her face a mask of pain unutterable  can you suggest what else it proves sir quoth sir john and there was doubt in his voice  sir oliver caught the note of it and a sob broke from him  o god of pity he cried out there is doubt in your voice and there is none in hers you were my enemy once and have since been in a mistrustful truce with me yet you can doubt that i did this thing but she she who loved me has no room for any doubt  sir oliver she answered him the thing you have done has broken quite my heart yet knowing all the taunts by which you were brought to such a deed i could have forgiven it i think even though i could no longer be your wife i could have forgiven it i say but for the baseness of your present denial  he looked at her whitefaced an instant then turned on his heel and made for the door there he paused  your meaning is quite plain said he it is your wish that i shall take my trial for this deed he laughed who will accuse me to the justices will you sir john  if mistress rosamund so desires me replied the knight  ha be it so but do not think i am the man to suffer myself to be sent to the gallows upon such paltry evidence as satisfies that lady if any accuser comes to bleat of a trail of blood reaching to my door and of certain words i spoke yesterday in anger i will take my trialbut it shall be trial by battle upon the body of my accuser that is my right and i will have every ounce of it do you doubt how god will pronounce i call upon him solemnly to pronounce between me and such an one if i am guilty of this thing may he wither my arm when i enter the lists  myself i will accuse you came rosamunds dull voice and if you will you may claim your rights against me and butcher me as you butchered him  god forgive you rosamund said sir oliver and went out  he returned home with hell in his heart he knew not what the future might hold in store for him but such was his resentment against rosamund that there was no room in his bosom for despair they should not hang him he would fight them tooth and claw and yet lionel should not suffer he would take care of that and then the thought of lionel changed his mood a little how easily could he have shattered their accusation how easily have brought her to her proud knees imploring pardon of him by a word he could have done it yet he feared lest that word must jeopardize his brother  in the calm still watches of that night as he lay sleepless upon his bed and saw things without heat there crept a change into his mental attitude he reviewed all the evidence that had led her to her conclusions and he was forced to confess that she was in some measure justified of them if she had wronged him he had wronged her yet more for years she had listened to all the poisonous things that were said of him by his enemiesand his arrogance had made him not a few she had disregarded all because she loved him her relations with her brother had become strained on that account yet now all this returned to crush her repentance played its part in her cruel belief that it was by his hand peter godolphin had fallen it must almost seem to her that in a sense she had been a party to his murder by the headstrong course to which she had kept in loving the man her brother hated  he saw it now and was more merciful in judging her she had been more than human if she had not felt as he now saw that she must feel and since reactions are to be measured by the mental exaltations from which they spring so was it but natural that now she must hate him fiercely whom she had loved wellnigh as fiercely  it was a heavy cross to bear yet for lionels sake he must bear it with what fortitude he could lionel must not be sacrificed to his egoism for a deed that in lionel he could not account other than justified he were base indeed did he so much as contemplate such a way of escape as that  but if he did not contemplate it lionel did and went in terror during those days a terror that kept him from sleep and so fostered the fever in him that on the second day after that grim affair he had the look of a ghost holloweyed and gaunt sir oliver remonstrated with him and in such terms as to put heart into him anew moreover there was other news that day to allay his terrors the justices at truro had been informed of the event and the accusation that was made but they had refused pointblank to take action in the matter the reason of it was that one of them was that same master anthony baine who had witnessed the affront offered sir oliver he declared that whatever had happened to master godolphin as a consequence was no more than he deserved no more than he had brought upon himself and he gave it as his decision that his conscience as a man of honour would not permit him to issue any warrant to the constable  sir oliver received this news from that other witness the parson who himself had suffered such rudeness at godolphins hands and who man of the gospel and of peace though he was entirely supported the justices decisionor so he declared  sir oliver thanked him protesting that it was kind in him and in master baine to take such a view but for the rest avowing that he had had no hand in the affair however much appearances might point to him  when however it came to his knowledge two days later that the whole countryside was in a ferment against master baine as a consequence of the attitude he had taken up sir oliver summoned the parson and straightway rode with him to the justices house at truro there to afford certain evidence which he had withheld from rosamund and sir john killigrew  master baine he said when the three of them were closeted in that gentlemans library i have heard of the just and gallant pronouncement you have made and i am come to thank you and to express my admiration of your courage  master baine bowed gravely he was a man whom nature had made grave  but since i would not that any evil consequences might attend your action i am come to lay proof before you that you have acted more rightly even than you think and that i am not the slayer  you are not ejaculated master baine in amazement  oh i assure you i use no subterfuge with you as you shall judge i have proof to show you as i say and i am come to do so now before time might render it impossible i do not desire it to be made public just yet master baine but i wish you to draw up some such document as would satisfy the courts at any future time should this matter be taken further as well it may  it was a shrewd plea the proof that was not upon himself was upon lionel but time would efface it and if anon publication were made of what he was now about to show it would then be too late to look elsewhere  i assure you sir oliver that had you killed him after what happened i could not hold you guilty of having done more than punish a boorish and arrogant offender  i know sir but it was not so one of the pieces of evidence against meindeed the chief itemis that from godolphins body to my door there was a trail of blood  the other two grew tensely interested the parson watched him with unblinking eyes  now it follows logically i think inevitably indeed that the murderer must have been wounded in the encounter the blood could not possibly have been the victims therefore it must have been the slayers that the slayer was wounded indeed we know since there was blood upon godolphins sword now master baine and you sir andrew shall be witnesses that there is upon my body not so much as a scratch of recent date i will strip me here as naked as when first i had the mischance to stray into this world and you shall satisfy yourselves of that thereafter i shall beg you master baine to indite the document i have mentioned and he removed his doublet as he spoke but since i will not give these louts who accuse me so much satisfaction lest i seem to go in fear of them i must beg sirs that you will keep this matter entirely private until such time as its publication may be rendered necessary by events  they saw the reasonableness of his proposal and they consented still entirely sceptical but when they had made their examination they were utterly dumbfounded to find all their notions entirely overset master baine of course drew up the required document and signed and sealed it whilst sir andrew added his own signature and seal as witness thereunto  with this parchment that should be his buckler against any future need sir oliver rode home uplifted for once it were safe to do so that parchment should be spread before the eyes of sir john killigrew and rosamund and all might yet be well     chapter vi jasper leigh   if that christmas was one of sorrow at godolphin court it was nothing less at penarrow  sir oliver was moody and silent in those days given to sit for long hours staring into the heart of the fire and repeating to himself again and again every word of his interview with rosamund now in a mood of bitter resentment against her for having so readily believed his guilt now in a gentler sorrowing humour which made full allowance for the strength of the appearances against him  his halfbrother moved softly about the house now in a sort of selfeffacement never daring to intrude upon sir olivers abstractions he was well acquainted with their cause he knew what had happened at godolphin court knew that rosamund had dismissed sir oliver for all time and his heart smote him to think that he should leave his brother to bear this burden that rightly belonged to his own shoulders  the thing preyed so much upon his mind that in an expansive moment one evening he gave it tongue  noll he said standing beside his brothers chair in the firelit gloom and resting a hand upon his brothers shoulder were it not best to tell the truth  sir oliver looked up quickly frowning art mad quoth he the truth would hang thee lal  it might not and in any case you are suffering something worse than hanging oh i have watched you every hour this past week and i know the pain that abides in you it is not just and he insistedwe had best tell the truth  sir oliver smiled wistfully he put out a hand and took his brothers  tis noble in you to propose it lal  not half so noble as it is in you to bear all the suffering for a deed that was my own  bah sir oliver shrugged impatiently his glance fell away from lionels face and returned to the consideration of the fire after all i can throw off the burden when i will such knowledge as that will enhearten a man through any trial  he had spoken in a harsh cynical tone and lionel had turned cold at his words he stood a long while in silence there turning them over in his mind and considering the riddle which they presented him he thought of asking his brother bluntly for the key to it for the precise meaning of his disconcerting statement but courage failed him he feared lest sir oliver should confirm his own dread interpretation of it  he drew away after a time and soon after went to bed for days thereafter the phrase rankled in his mindi can throw off the burden when i will conviction grew upon him that sir oliver meant that he was enheartened by the knowledge that by speaking if he choose he could clear himself that sir oliver would so speak he could not think indeed he was entirely assured that sir oliver was very far from intending to throw off his burden yet he might come to change his mind the burden might grow too heavy his longings for rosamund too clamorous his grief at being in her eyes her brothers murderer too overwhelming  lionels soul shuddered to contemplate the consequences to himself his fears were selfrevelatory he realized how far from sincere had been his proposal that they should tell the truth he perceived that it had been no more than the emotional outburst of the moment a proposal which if accepted he must most bitterly have repented and then came the reflection that if he were guilty of emotional outbursts that could so outrageously play the traitor to his real desires were not all men subject to the same might not his brother too come to fall a prey to one of those moments of mental storm when in a climax of despair he would find his burden altogether too overwhelming and in rebellion cast it from him  lionel sought to assure himself that his brother was a man of stern fibres a man who never lost control of himself but against this he would argue that what had happened in the past was no guarantee of what might happen in the future that a limit was set to the endurance of every man be he never so strong and that it was far from impossible that the limit of sir olivers endurance might be reached in this affair if that happened in what case should he find himself the answer to this was a picture beyond his fortitude to contemplate the danger of his being sent to trial and made to suffer the extreme penalty of the law would be far greater now than if he had spoken at once the tale he could then have told must have compelled some attention for he was accounted a man of unsmirched honour and his word must carry some weight but now none would believe him they would argue from his silence and from his having suffered his brother to be unjustly accused that he was cravenhearted and dishonourable and that if he had acted thus it was because he had no good defence to offer for his deed not only would he be irrevocably doomed but he would be doomed with ignominy he would be scorned by all upright men and become a thing of contempt over whose end not a tear would be shed  thus he came to the dread conclusion that in his endeavours to screen himself he had but enmeshed himself the more inextricably if oliver but spoke he was lost and back he came to the question what assurance had he that oliver would not speak  the fear of this from occurring to him occasionally began to haunt him day and night and for all that the fever had left him and his wound was entirely healed he remained pale and thin and holloweyed indeed the secret terror that was in his soul glared out of his eyes at every moment he grew nervous and would start up at the least sound and he went now in a perpetual mistrust of oliver which became manifest in a curious petulance of which there were outbursts at odd times  coming one afternoon into the diningroom which was ever sir olivers favourite haunt in the mansion of penarrow lionel found his halfbrother in that brooding attitude elbow on knee and chin on palm staring into the fire this was so habitual now in sir oliver that it had begun to irritate lionels tense nerves it had come to seem to him that in this listlessness was a studied tacit reproach aimed at himself  why do you sit ever thus over the fire like some old crone he growled voicing at last the irritability that so long had been growing in him  sir oliver looked round with mild surprise in his glance then from lionel his eyes travelled to the long windows  it rains he said  it was not your wont to be driven to the fireside by rain but rain or shine tis ever the same you never go abroad  to what end quoth sir oliver with the same mildness but a wrinkle of bewilderment coming gradually between his dark brows do you suppose i love to meet lowering glances to see heads approach one another so that confidential curses of me may be muttered  ha cried lionel short and sharp his sunken eyes blazing suddenly it has come to this then that having voluntarily done this thing to shield me you now reproach me with it  i cried sir oliver aghast  your very words are a reproach dye think i do not read the meaning that lies under them  sir oliver rose slowly staring at his brother he shook his head and smiled  lal lal he said your wound has left you disordered boy with what have i reproached you what was this hidden meaning of my words if you will read aright you will see it to be that to go abroad is to involve myself in fresh quarrels for my mood is become short and i will not brook sour looks and mutterings that is all  he advanced and set his hands upon his brothers shoulders holding him so at arms length he considered him what time lionel drooped his head and a slow flush overspread his cheeks dear fool he said and shook him what ails you you are pale and gaunt and not yourself at all i have a notion ill furnish me a ship and you shall sail with me to my old huntinggrounds there is life out yonderlife that will restore your vigour and your zest and perhaps mine as well how say you now  lionel looked up his eye brightening then a thought occurred to him a thought so mean that again the colour flooded into his cheeks for he was shamed by it yet it clung if he sailed with oliver men would say that he was a partner in the guilt attributed to his brother he knewfrom more than one remark addressed him here or there and left by him uncontradictedthat the belief was abroad on the countryside that a certain hostility was springing up between himself and sir oliver on the score of that happening in godolphin park his pale looks and hollow eyes had contributed to the opinion that his brothers sin was weighing heavily upon him he had ever been known for a gentle kindly lad in all things the very opposite of the turbulent sir oliver and it was assumed that sir oliver in his present increasing harshness used his brother ill because the lad would not condone his crime a deal of sympathy was consequently arising for lionel and was being testified to him on every hand were he to accede to such a proposal as oliver now made him assuredly he must jeopardize all that  he realized to the full the contemptible quality of his thought and hated himself for conceiving it but he could not shake off its dominion it was stronger than his will  his brother observing this hesitation and misreading it drew him to the fireside and made him sit  listen he said as he dropped into the chair opposite there is a fine ship standing in the road below off smithick youll have seen her her master is a desperate adventurer named jasper leigh who is to be found any afternoon in the alehouse at penycumwick i know him of old and he and his ship are to be acquired he is ripe for any venture from scuttling spaniards to trading in slaves and so that the price be high enough we may buy him body and soul his is a stomach that refuses nothing so there be money in the venture so here is ship and master ready found the rest i will providethe crew the munitions the armament and by the end of march we shall see the lizard dropping astern what do you say lal tis surely better than to sit moping here in this place of gloom  illill think of it said lionel but so listlessly that all sir olivers quickening enthusiasm perished again at once and no more was said of the venture  but lionel did not altogether reject the notion if on the one hand he was repelled by it on the other he was attracted almost despite himself he went so far as to acquire the habit of riding daily over to penycumwick and there he made the acquaintance of that hardy and scarred adventurer of whom sir oliver had spoken and listened to the marvels the fellow had to tellmany of them too marvellous to be trueof hazards upon distant seas  but one day in early march master jasper leigh had a tale of another kind for him news that dispelled from lionels mind all interest in the captains ventures on the spanish main the seaman had followed the departing lionel to the door of the little inn and stood by his stirrup after he had got to horse  a word in your ear good master tressilian said he dye know what is being concerted here against our brother  against my brother  ayin the matter of the killing of master peter godolphin last christmas seeing that the justices would not move of theirselves some folk ha petitioned the lieutenant of cornwall to command them to grant a warrant for sir olivers arrest on a charge o murder but the justices ha refused to be driven by his lordship answering that they hold their office direct from the queen and that in such a matter they are answerable to none but her grace and now i hear that a petition be gone to london to the queen herself begging her to command her justices to perform their duty or quit their office  lionel drew a sharp breath and with dilating eyes regarded the mariner but made him no answer  jasper laid a long finger against his nose and his eyes grew cunning i thought id warn you sir so as you may bid sir oliver look to hisself tis a fine seaman and fine seamen be none so plentiful  lionel drew his purse from his pocket and without so much as looking into its contents dropped it into the seamans ready hand with a muttered word of thanks  he rode home in terror almost it was come the blow was about to fall and his brother would at last be forced to speak at penarrow a fresh shock awaited him he learnt from old nicholas that sir oliver was from home that he had ridden over to godolphin court  the instant conclusion prompted by lionels terror was that already the news had reached sir oliver and that he had instantly taken action for he could not conceive that his brother should go to godolphin court upon any other business  but his fears on that score were very idle sir oliver unable longer to endure the present state of things had ridden over to lay before rosamund that proof with which he had taken care to furnish himself he could do so at last without any fear of hurting lionel his journey however had been entirely fruitless she had refused pointblank to receive him and for all that with a humility entirely foreign to him he had induced a servant to return to her with a most urgent message yet he had been denied he returned stricken to penarrow there to find his brother awaiting him in a passion of impatience  well lionel greeted him what will you do now  sir oliver looked at him from under brows that scowled darkly in reflection of his thoughts  do now of what do you talk quoth he  have you not heard and lionel told him the news  sir oliver stared long at him when he had done then his lips tightened and he smote his brow  so he cried would that be why she refused to see me did she conceive that i went perhaps to plead could she think that could she  he crossed to the fireplace and stirred the logs with his boot angrily oh twere too unworthy yet of a certainty tis her doing this  what shall you do insisted lionel unable to repress the question that was uppermost in his mind and his voice shook  do sir oliver looked at him over his shoulder prick this bubble by heaven make an end of it for them confound them and cover them with shame  he said it roughly angrily and lionel recoiled deeming that roughness and anger aimed at himself he sank into a chair his knees loosened by his sudden fear so it seemed that he had had more than cause for his apprehensions this brother of his who boasted such affection for him was not equal to bearing this matter through and yet the thing was so unlike oliver that a doubt still lingered with him  you you will tell them the truth he said in small quavering voice  sir oliver turned and considered him more attentively  a gods name lal whats in thy mind now he asked almost roughly tell them the truth why of coursebut only as it concerns myself youre not supposing that i shall tell them it was you youll not be accounting me capable of that  what other way is there  sir oliver explained the matter the explanation brought lionel relief but this relief was ephemeral further reflection presented a new fear to him it came to him that if sir oliver cleared himself of necessity his own implication must follow his terrors very swiftly magnified a risk that in itself was so slender as to be entirely negligible in his eyes it ceased to be a risk it became a certain and inevitable danger if sir oliver put forward this proof that the trail of blood had not proceeded from himself it must thought lionel inevitably be concluded that it was his own as well might sir oliver tell them the whole truth for surely they could not fail to infer it thus he reasoned in his terror accounting himself lost irrevocably  had he but gone with those fears of his to his brother or had he but been able to abate them sufficiently to allow reason to prevail he must have been brought to understand how much further they carried him than was at all justified by probability oliver would have shown him this would have told him that with the collapsing of the charge against himself no fresh charge could be levelled against any there that no scrap of suspicion had ever attached to lionel or ever could but lionel dared not seek his brother in this matter in his heart he was ashamed of his fears in his heart he knew himself for a craven he realized to the full the hideousness of his selfishness and yet as before he was not strong enough to conquer it in short his love of himself was greater than his love of his brother or of twenty brothers  the morrowa blustering day of late march found him again at that alehouse at penycumwick in the company of jasper leigh a course had occurred to him as the only course now possible last night his brother had muttered something of going to killigrew with his proofs since rosamund refused to receive him through killigrew he would reach her he had said and he would yet see her on her knees craving his pardon for the wrong she had done him for the cruelty she had shown him  lionel knew that killigrew was absent from home just then but he was expected to return by easter and to easter there was but a week therefore he had little time in which to act little time in which to execute the project that had come into his mind he cursed himself for conceiving it but held to it with all the strength of a weak nature  yet when he came to sit face to face with jasper leigh in that little innparlour with the scrubbed table of plain deal between them he lacked the courage to set his proposal forth they drank sherry sack stiffly laced with brandy by lionels suggestion instead of the more customary mulled ale yet not until he had consumed the best part of a pint of it did lionel feel himself heartened to broaching his loathsome business through his head hummed the words his brother had said some time ago when first the name of jasper leigh had passed between thema desperate adventurer ripe for anything so the price be high enough you may buy him body and soul money enough to buy jasper leigh was ready to lionels hand but it was sir olivers moneythe money that was placed at lionels disposal by his halfbrothers openhanded bounty and this money he was to employ for olivers utter ruin he cursed himself for a filthy contemptible hound he cursed the foul fiend that whispered such suggestions into his mind he knew himself despised himself and reviled himself until he came to swear to be strong and to go through with whatever might await him sooner than be guilty of such a baseness the next moment that same resolve would set him shuddering again as he viewed the inevitable consequences that must attend it  suddenly the captain set him a question very softly that fired the train and blew all his lingering selfresistance into shreds  youll ha borne my warning to sir oliver he asked lowering his voice so as not to be overheard by the vintner who was stirring beyond the thin wooden partition  master lionel nodded nervously fingering the jewel in his ear his eyes shifting from their consideration of the seamans coarse weathertanned and hairy countenance  i did he said but sir oliver is headstrong he will not stir  will he not the captain stroked his bushy red beard and cursed profusely and horribly after the fashion of the sea ods wounds hes very like to swing if he bides him here  ay said lionel if he bides he felt his mouth turn dry as he spoke his heart thudded but its thuds were softened by a slight insensibility which the liquor had produced in him  he uttered the words in so curious a tone that the sailors dark eyes peered at him from under his heavy sandy eyebrows there was alert inquiry in that glance master lionel got up suddenly  let us take a turn outside captain said he  the captains eyes narrowed he scented business there was something plaguily odd about this young gentlemans manner he tossed off the remains of his sack slapped down the pot and rose  your servant master tressilian said he  outside our gentleman untethered his horse from the iron ring to which he had attached the bridle leading his horse he turned seaward and strode down the road that wound along the estuary towards smithick  a sharp breeze from the north was whipping the water into white peaks of foam the sky was of a hard brightness and the sun shone brilliantly the tide was running out and the rock in the very neck of the haven was thrusting its black crest above the water a cables length this side of it rode the black hull and naked spars of the swallowcaptain leighs ship  lionel stepped along in silence very gloomy and pensive hesitating even now and the crafty mariner reading this hesitation and anxious to conquer it for the sake of such profit as he conceived might lie in the proposal which he scented paved the way for him at last  i think that yell have some matter to propose to me said he slyly out with it sir for there never was a man more ready to serve you  the fact is said lionel watching the others face with a sidelong glance i am in a difficult position master leigh  ive been in a many laughed the captain but never yet in one through which i could not win strip forth your own and haply i can do as much for you as i am wont to do for myself  why it is this wise said the other my brother will assuredly hang as you have said if he bides him here he is lost if they bring him to trial and in that case faith i am lost too it dishonours a mans family to have a member of it hanged tis a horrible thing to have happen  indeed indeed the sailor agreed encouragingly  i would abstract him from this pursued lionel and at the same time cursed the foul fiend that prompted him such specious words to cloak his villainy i would abstract him from it and yet tis against my conscience that he should go unpunished for i swear to you master leigh that i abhor the deeda cowardly murderous deed  ah said the captain and lest that grim ejaculation should check his gentleman he made haste to addto be sure to be sure  master lionel stopped and faced the other squarely his shoulders to his horse they were quite alone in as lonely a spot as any conspirator could desire behind him stretched the empty beach ahead of him the ruddy cliffs that rise gently to the wooded heights of arwenack  ill be quite plain and open with you master leigh peter godolphin was my friend sir oliver is no more than my halfbrother i would give a deal to the man who would abstract sir oliver secretly from the doom that hangs over him and yet do the thing in such a way that sir oliver should not thereby escape the punishment he deserves  it was strange he thought even as he said it that he could bring his lips so glibly to utter words that his heart detested  the captain looked grim he laid a finger upon master lionels velvet doublet in line with that false heart of his  i am your man said he but the risk is great yet ye say that yeld give a deal  yourself shall name the price said lionel quickly his eyes burning feverishly his cheeks white  oh i can contrive it never fear said the captain i know to a nicety what you require how say you now if i was to carry him overseas to the plantations where they lack toilers of just such thews as his he lowered his voice and spoke with some slight hesitation fearing that he proposed perhaps more than his prospective employer might desire  he might return was the answer that dispelled all doubts on that score  ah said the skipper what o the barbary rovers then they lack slaves and are ever ready to trade though they be niggardly payers i never heard of none that returned once they had him safe aboard their galleys i ha done some trading with them bartering human freights for spices and eastern carpets and the like  master lionel breathed hard tis a horrible fate ist not  the captain stroked his beard yet tis the only really safe bestowal and when all is said tis not so horrible as hanging and certainly less dishonouring to a mans kin yeld be serving sir oliver and yourself  tis so tis so cried master lionel almost fiercely and the price  the seaman shifted on his short sturdy legs and his face grew pensive a hundred pound he suggested tentatively  done with you for a hundred pounds was the prompt answerso prompt that captain leigh realized he had driven a fools bargain which it was incumbent upon him to amend  that is a hundred pound for myself he corrected slowly then there be the crew to reckon forto keep their counsel and lend a hand twill mean another hundred at the least  master lionel considered a moment it is more than i can lay my hands on at short notice but look you you shall have a hundred and fifty pounds in coin and the balance in jewels you shall not be the loser in that i promise you and when you come again and bring me word that all is done as you now undertake there shall be the like again  upon that the bargain was settled and when lionel came to talk of ways and means he found that he had allied himself to a man who understood his business thoroughly all the assistance that the skipper asked was that master lionel should lure his gentleman to some concerted spot conveniently near the waterside there leigh would have a boat and his men in readiness and the rest might very safely be left to him  in a flash lionel bethought him of the proper place for this he swung round and pointed across the water to trefusis point and the grey pile of godolphin court all bathed in sunshine now  yonder at trefusis point in the shadow of godolphin court at eight tomorrow night when there will be no moon ill see that he is there but on your life do not miss him  trust me said master leigh and the money  when you have him safely aboard come to me at penarrow he replied which showed that after all he did not trust master leigh any further than he was compelled  the captain was quite satisfied for should his gentleman fail to disburse he could always return sir oliver to shore  on that they parted lionel mounted and rode away whilst master leigh made a trumpet of his hands and hallooed to the ship  as he stood waiting for the boat that came off to fetch him a smile slowly overspread the adventurers rugged face had master lionel seen it he might have asked himself how far it was safe to drive such bargains with a rogue who kept faith only in so far as it was profitable and in this matter master leigh saw a way to break faith with profit he had no conscience but he loved as all rogues love to turn the tables upon a superior rogue he would play master lionel most finely most poetically false and he found a deal to chuckle over in the contemplation of it     chapter vii trepanned   master lionel was absent most of the following day from penarrow upon a pretext of making certain purchases in truro it would be halfpast seven when he returned and as he entered he met sir oliver in the hall  i have a message for you from godolphin court he announced and saw his brother stiffen and his face change colour a boy met me at the gates and bade me tell you that mistress rosamund desires a word with you forthwith  sir olivers heart almost stopped then went off at a gallop she asked for him she had softened perhaps from her yesterdays relentlessness she would consent at last to see him  be thou blessed for these good tidings he answered on a note of high excitement i go at once and on the instant he departed such was his eagerness indeed that under the hot spur of it he did not even stay to fetch that parchment which was to be his unanswerable advocate the omission was momentous  master lionel said no word as his brother swept out he shrank back a little into the shadows he was white to the lips and felt as he would stifle as the door closed he moved suddenly he sprang to follow sir oliver conscience cried out to him that he could not do this thing but fear was swift to answer that outcry unless he permitted what was planned to take its course his life might pay the penalty  he turned and lurched into the diningroom upon legs that trembled  he found the table set for supper as on that other night when he had staggered in with a wound in his side to be cared for and sheltered by sir oliver he did not approach the table he crossed to the fire and sat down there holding out his hands to the blaze he was very cold and could not still his trembling his very teeth chattered  nicholas came in to know if he would sup he answered unsteadily that despite the lateness of the hour he would await sir olivers return  is sir oliver abroad quoth the servant in surprise  he went out a moment since i know not whither replied lionel but since he has not supped he is not like to be long absent  upon that he dismissed the servant and sat huddled there a prey to mental tortures which were not to be repressed his mind would turn upon naught but the steadfast unwavering affection of which sir oliver ever had been prodigal towards him in this very matter of peter godolphins death what sacrifices had not sir oliver made to shield him from so much love and selfsacrifice in the past he inclined to argue now that not even in extreme peril would his brother betray him and then that bad streak of fear which made a villain of him reminded him that to argue thus was to argue upon supposition that it would be perilous to trust such an assumption that if after all sir oliver should fail him in the crucial test then was he lost indeed  when all is said a mans final judgment of his fellows must be based upon his knowledge of himself and lionel knowing himself incapable of any such sacrifice for sir oliver could not believe sir oliver capable of persisting in such a sacrifice as future events might impose he reverted to those words sir oliver had uttered in that very room two nights ago and more firmly than ever he concluded that they could have but one meaning  then came doubt and finally assurance of another sort assurance that this was not so and that he knew it assurance that he lied to himself seeking to condone the thing he did he took his head in his hands and groaned loud he was a villain a blackhearted soulless villain he reviled himself again there came a moment when he rose shuddering resolved even in this eleventh hour to go after his brother and save him from the doom that awaited him out yonder in the night  but again that resolve was withered by the breath of selfish fear limply he resumed his seat and his thoughts took a fresh turn they considered now those matters which had engaged them on that day when sir oliver had ridden to arwenack to claim satisfaction of sir john killigrew he realized again that oliver being removed what he now enjoyed by his brothers bounty he would enjoy henceforth in his own unquestioned right the reflection brought him a certain consolation if he must suffer for his villainy at least there would be compensations  the clock over the stables chimed the hour of eight master lionel shrank back in his chair at the sound the thing would be doing even now in his mind he saw it allsaw his brother come running in his eagerness to the gates of godolphin court and then dark forms resolve themselves from the surrounding darkness and fall silently upon him he saw him struggling a moment on the ground then bound hand and foot a gag thrust into his mouth he beheld him in fancy borne swiftly down the slope to the beach and so to the waiting boat  another halfhour sat he there the thing was done by now and this assurance seemed to quiet him a little  then came nicholas again to babble of some possible mischance having overtaken his master  what mischance should have overtaken him growled lionel as if in scorn of the idea  i pray none indeed replied the servant but sir oliver lacks not for enemies nowadays and tis scarce zafe for he to be abroad after dark  master lionel dismissed the notion contemptuously for pretences sake he announced that he would wait no longer whereupon nicholas brought in his supper and left him again to go and linger about the door looking out into the night and listening for his masters return he paid a visit to the stables and knew that sir oliver had gone forth afoot  meanwhile master lionel must make pretence of eating though actual eating must have choked him he smeared his platter broke food and avidly drank a bumper of claret then he too feigned a growing anxiety and went to join nicholas thus they spent the weary night watching for the return of one who master lionel knew would return no more  at dawn they roused the servants and sent them to scour the countryside and put the news of sir olivers disappearance abroad lionel himself rode out to arwenack to ask sir john killigrew bluntly if he knew aught of this matter  sir john showed a startled face but swore readily enough that he had not so much as seen sir oliver for days he was gentle with lionel whom he liked as everybody liked him the lad was so mild and kindly in his ways so vastly different from his arrogant overbearing brother that his virtues shone the more brightly by that contrast  i confess it is natural you should come to me said sir john but my word on it i have no knowledge of him it is not my way to beset my enemies in the dark  indeed indeed sir john i had not supposed it in my heart replied the afflicted lionel forgive me that i should have come to ask a question so unworthy set it down to my distracted state i have not been the same man these months i think since that happening in godolphin park the thing has preyed upon my mind it is a fearsome burden to know your own brotherthough i thank god he is no more than my halfbrotherguilty of so foul a deed  how cried killigrew amazed you say that you believed it yourself  master lionel looked confused a look which sir john entirely misunderstood and interpreted entirely in the young mans favour and it was thus and in that moment that was sown the generous seed of the friendship that was to spring up between these two men its roots fertilized by sir johns pity that one so gentlenatured so honest and so upright should be cursed with so villainous a brother  i see i see he said and he sighed you know that we are daily expecting an order from the queen to her justices to take the action which hitherto they have refused against your against sir oliver he frowned thoughtfully dye think sir oliver had news of this  at once master lionel saw the drift of what was in the others mind  i know it he replied myself i bore it him but why do you ask  does it not help us perhaps to understand and explain sir olivers disappearance god lack surely knowing that he were a fool to have tarried here for he would hang beyond all doubt did he stay for the coming of her graces messenger  my god said lionel staring you you think he is fled then  sir john shrugged what else is to be thought  lionel hung his head what else indeed said he and took his leave like a man overwrought as indeed he was he had never considered that so obvious a conclusion must follow upon his work so fully to explain the happening and to set at rest any doubt concerning it  he returned to penarrow and bluntly told nicholas what sir john suspected and what he feared himself must be the true reason of sir olivers disappearance the servant however was none so easy to convince  but do ee believe that he done it cried nicholas do ee believe it master lionel there was reproach amounting to horror in the servants voice  god help me what else can i believe now that he is fled  nicholas sidled up to him with tightened lips he set two gnarled fingers on the young mans arm  hem not fled master lionel he announced with grim impressiveness hem never a turntail sir oliver he dont fear neither man nor devil and if so be him had killed master godolphin hed never ha denied it dont ee believe sir john killigrew sir john ever hated he  but in all that countryside the servant was the only one to hold this view if a doubt had lingered anywhere of sir olivers guilt that doubt was now dispelled by this flight of his before the approach of the expected orders from the queen  later that day came captain leigh to penarrow inquiring for sir oliver  nicholas brought word of his presence and his inquiry to master lionel who bade him be admitted  the thickset little seaman rolled in on his bowed legs and leered at his employer when they were alone  hes snug and safe aboard he announced the thing were done as clean as peeling an apple and as quiet  why did you ask for him quoth master lionel  why jasper leered again my business was with him there was some talk between us of him going a voyage with me ive heard the gossip over at smithick this will fit in with it he laid that finger of his to his nose trust me to help a sound tale along t were a clumsy business to come here asking for you sir yell know now how to account for my visit  lionel paid him the price agreed and dismissed him upon receiving the assurance that the swallow would put to sea upon the next tide  when it became known that sir oliver had been in treaty with master leigh for a passage overseas and that it was but on that account that master leigh had tarried in that haven even nicholas began to doubt  gradually lionel recovered his tranquillity as the days flowed on what was done was done and in any case being now beyond recall there was no profit in repining he never knew how fortune aided him as fortune will sometimes aid a villain the royal poursuivants arrived some six days later and master baine was the recipient of a curt summons to render himself to london there to account for his breach of trust in having refused to perform his sworn duty had sir andrew flack but survived the chill that had carried him off a month ago master justice baine would have made short work of the accusation lodged against him as it was when he urged the positive knowledge he possessed and told them how he had made the examination to which sir oliver had voluntarily submitted his single word carried no slightest conviction not for a moment was it supposed that this was aught but the subterfuge of one who had been lax in his duty and who sought to save himself from the consequences of that laxity and the fact that he cited as his fellowwitness a gentleman now deceased but served to confirm his judges in this opinion he was deposed from his office and subjected to a heavy fine and there the matter ended for the hueandcry that was afoot entirely failed to discover any trace of the missing sir oliver  for master lionel a new existence set in from that day looked upon as one in danger of suffering for his brothers sins the countryside determined to help him as far as possible to bear his burden great stress was laid upon the fact that after all he was no more than sir olivers halfbrother some there were who would have carried their kindness to the lengths of suggesting that perhaps he was not even that and that it was but natural that ralph tressilians second wife should have repaid her husband in kind for his outrageous infidelities this movement of sympathy was led by sir john killigrew and it spread in so rapid and marked a manner that very soon master lionel was almost persuaded that it was no more than he deserved and he began to sun himself in the favour of a countryside that hitherto had shown little but hostility for men of the tressilian blood     chapter viii the spaniard   the swallow having passed through a gale in the bay of biscaya gale which she weathered like the surprisingly steady old tub she wasrounded cape finisterre and so emerged from tempest into peace from leaden skies and mountainous seas into a sunny azure calm it was like a sudden transition from winter into spring and she ran along now close hauled to the soft easterly breeze with a gentle list to port  it had never been master leighs intent to have got so far as this without coming to an understanding with his prisoner but the wind had been stronger than his intentions and he had been compelled to run before it and to head to southward until its fury should abate thus it fell outand all marvellously to master lionels advantage as you shall seethat the skipper was forced to wait until they stood along the coast of portugalbut well out to sea for the coast of portugal was none too healthy just then to english seamenbefore commanding sir oliver to be haled into his presence  in the cramped quarters of the cabin in the poop of the little vessel sat her captain at a greasy table over which a lamp was swinging faintly to the gentle heave of the ship he was smoking a foul pipe whose fumes hung heavily upon the air of that little chamber and there was a bottle of nantes at his elbow  to him sitting thus in state was sir oliver introducedhis wrists still pinioned behind him he was haggard and holloweyed and he carried a weeks growth of beard on his chin also his garments were still in disorder from the struggle he had made when taken and from the fact that he had been compelled to lie in them ever since  since his height was such that it was impossible for him to stand upright in that lowceilinged cabin a stool was thrust forward for him by one of the ruffians of leighs crew who had haled him from his confinement beneath the hatchway  he sat down quite listlessly and stared vacantly at the skipper master leigh was somewhat discomposed by this odd calm when he had looked for angry outbursts he dismissed the two seamen who fetched sir oliver and when they had departed and closed the cabin door he addressed his captive  sir oliver said he stroking his red beard yeve been most foully abused  the sunshine filtered through one of the horn windows and beat full upon sir olivers expressionless face  it was not necessary you knave to bring me hither to tell me so much he answered  quite so said master leigh but i have something more to add yell be thinking that i ha done you a disservice there ye wrong me through me you are brought to know true friends from secret enemies henceforward yell know which to trust and which to mistrust  sir oliver seemed to rouse himself a little from his passivity stimulated despite himself by the impudence of this rogue he stretched a leg and smiled sourly  youll end by telling me that i am in your debt said he  youll end by saying so yourself the captain assured him dye know what i was bidden do with you  faith i neither know nor care was the surprising answer wearily delivered if it is for my entertainment that you propose to tell me i beg youll spare yourself the trouble  it was not an answer that helped the captain he pulled at his pipe a moment  i was bidden said he presently to carry you to barbary and sell you there into the service of the moors that i might serve you i made believe to accept this task  gods death swore sir oliver you carry makebelieve to an odd length  the weather has been against me it were no intention o mine to ha come so far south with you but weve been driven by the gale that is overpast and so that yell promise to bear no plaint against me and to make good some of the loss ill make by going out of my course and missing a cargo that i wot of ill put about and fetch you home again within a week  sir oliver looked at him and smiled grimly now what a rogue are you that can keep faith with none he cried first you take money to carry me off and then you bid me pay you to carry me back again  ye wrong me sir i vow ye do i can keep faith when honest men employ me and ye should know it sir oliver but who keeps faith with rogues is a fooland that i am not as ye should also know i ha done this thing that a rogue might be revealed to you and thwarted as well as that i might make some little profit out of this ship o mine i am frank with ye sir oliver i ha had some two hundred pounds in money and trinkets from your brother give me the like and  but now of a sudden sir olivers listlessness was all dispelled it fell from him like a cloak and he sat forward wide awake and with some show of anger even  how do you say he cried on a sharp high note  the captain stared at him his pipe neglected i say that if so be as yell pay me the same sum which your brother paid me to carry you off  my brother roared the knight do you say my brother  i said your brother  master lionel the other demanded still  what other brothers have you quoth master leigh  there fell a pause and sir oliver looked straight before him his head sunken a little between his shoulders let me understand he said at length do you say that my brother lionel paid you money to carry me offin short that my presence aboard this foul hulk of yours is due to him  whom else had ye suspected or did ye think that i did it for my own personal diversion  answer me bellowed sir oliver writhing in his bonds  i ha answered you more than once already still i tell you once again since ye are slow to understand it that i was paid a matter of two hundred pound by your brother master lionel tressilian to carry you off to barbary and there sell you for a slave is that plain to you  as plain as it is false you lie you dog  softly softly quoth master leigh goodhumouredly  i say you lie  master leigh considered him a moment sets the wind so said he at length and without another word he rose and went to a seachest ranged against the wooden wall of the cabin he opened it and took thence a leather bag from this he produced a handful of jewels he thrust them under sir olivers nose haply said he yell be acquainted with some of them they was given me to make up the sum since your brother had not the whole two hundred pound in coin take a look at them  sir oliver recognized a ring and a long pearshaped pearl earring that had been his brothers he recognized a medallion that he himself had given lionel two years ago and so one by one he recognized every trinket placed before him  his head drooped to his breast and he sat thus awhile like a man stunned my god he groaned miserably at last who then is left to me lionel too lionel a sob shook the great frame two tears slowly trickled down that haggard face and were lost in the stubble of beard upon his chin i am accursed he said  never without such evidence could he have believed this thing from the moment that he was beset outside the gates of godolphin court he had conceived it to be the work of rosamund and his listlessness was begotten of the thought that she could have suffered conviction of his guilt and her hatred of him to urge her to such lengths as these never for an instant had he doubted the message delivered him by lionel that it was mistress rosamund who summoned him and just as he believed himself to be going to godolphin court in answer to her summons so did he conclude that the happening there was the real matter to which she had bidden him a thing done by her contriving her answer to his attempt on the previous day to gain speech with her her manner of ensuring that such an impertinence should never be repeated  this conviction had been gall and wormwood to him it had drugged his very senses reducing him to a listless indifference to any fate that might be reserved him yet it had not been so bitter a draught as this present revelation after all in her case there were some grounds for the hatred that had come to take the place of her erstwhile love but in lionels what grounds were possible what motives could exist for such an action as this other than a monstrous a loathly egoism which desired perhaps to ensure that the blame for the death of peter godolphin should not be shifted from the shoulders that were unjustly bearing it and the accursed desire to profit by the removal of the man who had been brother father and all else to him he shuddered in sheer horror it was incredible and yet beyond a doubt it was true for all the love which he had showered upon lionel for all the sacrifices of self which he had made to shield him this was lionels return were all the world against him he still must have believed lionel true to him and in that belief must have been enheartened a little and nowhis sense of loneliness of utter destitution overwhelmed him then slowly of his sorrow resentment was begotten and being begotten it grew rapidly until it filled his mind and whelmed in its turn all else he threw back his great head and his bloodshot gleaming eyes fastened upon captain leigh who seated now upon the seachest was quietly observing him and waiting patiently until he should recover the wits which this revelation had scattered  master leigh said he what is your price to carry me home again to england  why sir oliver said he i think the price i was paid to carry you off would be a fair one the one would wipe out tother as it were  you shall have twice the sum when you land me on trefusis point again was the instant answer  the captains little eyes blinked and his shaggy red eyebrows came together in a frown here was too speedy an acquiescence there must be guile behind it or he knew naught of the ways of men  what mischief are ye brooding he sneered  mischief man to you sir oliver laughed hoarsely gods light knave dye think i consider you in this matter or dye think ive room in my mind for such petty resentments together with that other  it was the truth so absolute was the bitter sway of his anger against lionel that he could give no thought to this rascally seamans share in the adventure  will ye give me your word for that  my word pshaw man i have given it already i swear that you shall be paid the sum ive named the moment you set me ashore again in england is that enough for you then cut me these bonds and let us make an end of my present condition  faith i am glad to deal with so sensible a man ye take it in the proper spirit ye see that what i ha done i ha but done in the way of my calling that i am but a tool and that what blame there be belongs to them which hired me to this deed  aye yere but a toola dirty tool whetted with gold no more tis admitted cut me these bonds a gods name im weary o being trussed like a capon  the captain drew his knife crossed to sir olivers side and slashed his bonds away without further word sir oliver stood up so suddenly that he smote his head against the low ceiling of the cabin and so sat down again at once and in that moment from without and above there came a cry which sent the skipper to the cabin door he flung it open and so let out the smoke and let in the sunshine he passed out on to the poopdeck and sir oliverconceiving himself at liberty to do sofollowed him  in the waist below a little knot of shaggy seamen were crowding to the larboard bulwarks looking out to sea on the forecastle there was another similar assembly all staring intently ahead and towards the land they were off cape roca at the time and when captain leigh saw by how much they had lessened their distance from shore since last he had conned the ship he swore ferociously at his mate who had charge of the wheel ahead of them away on their larboard bow and in line with the mouth of the tagus from which she had issuedand where not a doubt but she had been lying in wait for such stray craft as thiscame a great tallmasted ship equipped with topgallants running wellnigh before the wind with every foot of canvas spread  closehauled as was the swallow and with her topsails and mizzen reefed she was not making more than one knot to the spaniards fivefor that she was a spaniard was beyond all doubt judging by the haven whence she issued  luff alee bawled the skipper and he sprang to the wheel thrusting the mate aside with a blow of his elbow that almost sent him sprawling  twas yourself set the course the fellow protested  thou lubberly fool roared the skipper i bade thee keep the same distance from shore if the land comes jutting out to meet us are we to keep straight on until we pile her up he spun the wheel round in his hands and turned her down the wind then he relinquished the helm to the mate again hold her thus he commanded and bellowing orders as he went he heaved himself down the companion to see them executed men sprang to the ratlines to obey him and went swarming aloft to let out the reefs of the topsails others ran astern to do the like by the mizzen and soon they had her leaping and plunging through the green water with every sheet unfurled racing straight out to sea  from the poop sir oliver watched the spaniard he saw her veer a point or so to starboard heading straight to intercept them and he observed that although this manceuvre brought her fully a point nearer to the wind than the swallow yet equipped as she was with half as much canvas again as captain leighs piratical craft she was gaining steadily upon them none the less  the skipper came back to the poop and stood there moodily watching that other ships approach cursing himself for having sailed into such a trap and cursing his mate more fervently still  sir oliver meanwhile took stock of so much of the swallows armament as was visible and wondered what like were those on the maindeck below he dropped a question on that score to the captain dispassionately as though he were no more than an indifferently interested spectator and with never a thought to his position aboard  should i be racing her afore the wind if i as properly equipped growled leigh am i the man to run before a spaniard as it is i do no more than lure her well away from land  sir oliver understood and was silent thereafter he observed a bosun and his mates staggering in the waist under loads of cutlasses and small arms which they stacked in a rack about the mainmast then the gunner a swarthy massive fellow stark to the waist with a faded scarf tied turbanwise about his head leapt up the companion to the brass carronade on the larboard quarter followed by a couple of his men  master leigh called up the bosun bade him take the wheel and dispatched the mate forward to the forecastle where another gun was being prepared for action  thereafter followed a spell of racing the spaniard ever lessening the distance between them and the land dropping astern until it was no more than a hazy line above the shimmering sea suddenly from the spaniard appeared a little cloud of white smoke and the boom of a gun followed and after it came a splash a cables length ahead of the swallows bows  linstock in hand the brawny gunner on the poop stood ready to answer them when the word should be given from below came the gunners mate to report himself ready for action on the maindeck and to receive his orders  came another shot from the spaniard again across the bows of the swallow  tis a clear invitation to heave to said sir oliver  the skipper snarled in his fiery beard she has a longer range than most spaniards said he but ill not waste powder yet for all that weve none to spare  scarcely had he spoken when a third shot boomed there was a splintering crash overhead followed by a sough and a thud as the maintopmast came hurtling to the deck and in its fall stretched a couple of men in death battle was joined it seemed yet captain leigh did nothing in a hurry  hold there he roared to the gunner who swung his linstock at that moment in preparation  she was losing way as a result of that curtailment of her mainmast and the spaniard came on swiftly now at last the skipper accounted her near enough and gave the word with an oath the swallow fired her first and last shot in that encounter after the deafening thunder of it and through the cloud of suffocating smoke sir oliver saw the high forecastle of the spaniard rent open  master leigh was cursing his gunner for having aimed too high then he signalled to the mate to fire the culverin of which he had charge that second shot was to be the signal for the whole broadside from the maindeck below but the spaniard anticipated them even as the skipper of the swallow signalled the whole side of the spaniard burst into flame and smoke  the swallow staggered under the blow recovered an instant then listed ominously to larboard  hell roared leigh shes bilging and sir oliver saw the spaniard standing off again as if satisfied with what she had done the mates gun was never fired nor was the broadside from below indeed that sudden list had set the muzzles pointing to the sea within three minutes of it they were on a level with the water the swallow had received her deathblow and she was settling down  satisfied that she could do no further harm the spaniard luffed and hove to awaiting the obvious result and intent upon picking up what slaves she could to man the galleys of his catholic majesty on the mediterranean  thus the fate intended sir oliver by lionel was to be fulfilled and it was to be shared by master leigh himself which had not been at all in that venal fellows reckoning       part ii sakrelbahr     chapter i the captive   sakrelbahr the hawk of the sea the scourge of the mediterranean and the terror of christian spain lay prone on the heights of cape spartel  above him on the crest of the cliff ran the dark green line of the orange groves of araishthe reputed garden of the hesperides of the ancients where the golden apples grew a mile or so to eastward were dotted the huts and tents of a bedouin encampment on the fertile emerald pastureland that spread away as far as eye could range towards ceuta nearer astride of a grey rock an almost naked goatherd a lithe brown stripling with a cord of camelhair about his shaven head intermittently made melancholy and unmelodious sounds upon a reed pipe from somewhere in the blue vault of heaven overhead came the joyous trilling of a lark from below the silken rustling of the tideless sea  sakrelbahr lay prone upon a cloak of woven camelhair amid luxuriating fern and samphire on the very edge of the shelf of cliff to which he had climbed on either side of him squatted a negro from the sus both naked of all save white loincloths their muscular bodies glistening like ebony in the dazzling sunshine of midmay they wielded crude fans fashioned from the yellowing leaves of date palms and their duty was to wave these gently to and fro above their lords head to give him air and to drive off the flies  sakrelbahr was in the very prime of life a man of a great length of body with a deep herculean torso and limbs that advertised a giant strength his hawknosed face ending in a black forked beard was of a swarthiness accentuated to exaggeration by the snowy white turban wound about his brow his eyes by contrast were singularly light he wore over his white shirt a long green tunic of very light silk woven along its edges with arabesques in gold a pair of loose calico breeches reached to his knees his brown muscular calves were naked and his feet were shod in a pair of moorish shoes of crimson leather with upcurling and very pointed toes he had no weapons other than the heavybladed knife with a jewelled hilt that was thrust into his girdle of plaited leather  a yard or two away on his left lay another supine figure elbows on the ground and hands arched above his brow to shade his eyes gazing out to sea he too was a tall and powerful man and when he moved there was a glint of armour from the chain mail in which his body was cased and from the steel casque about which he had swathed his green turban beside him lay an enormous curved scimitar in a sheath of brown leather that was heavy with steel ornaments his face was handsome and bearded but swarthier far than his companions and the backs of his long fine hands were almost black  sakrelbahr paid little heed to him lying there he looked down the slope clad with stunted corktrees and evergreen oaks here and there was the golden gleam of broom yonder over a spur of whitish rock sprawled the green and living scarlet of a cactus below him about the caves of hercules was a space of sea whose clear depths shifted with its slow movement from the deep green of emerald to all the colours of the opal a little farther off behind a projecting screen of rock that formed a little haven two enormous masted galleys each of fifty oars and a smaller galliot of thirty rode gently on the slight heave of the water the vast yellow oars standing out almost horizontally from the sides of each vessel like the pinions of some gigantic bird that they lurked there either in concealment or in ambush was very plain above them circled a flock of seagulls noisy and insolent  sakrelbahr looked out to sea across the straits towards tarifa and the faint distant european coastline just visible through the limpid summer air but his glance was not concerned with that hazy horizon it went no further than a fine whitesailed ship that closehauled was beating up the straits some four miles off a gentle breeze was blowing from the east and with every foot of canvas spread to catch it she stood as close to it as was possible nearer she came on her larboard tack and not a doubt but her master would be scanning the hostile african littoral for a sight of those desperate rovers who haunted it and who took toll of every christian ship that ventured overnear sakrelbahr smiled to think how little the presence of his galleys could be suspected how innocent must look the sunbathed shore of africa to the christian skippers diligently searching spyglass and there from his height like the hawk they had dubbed him poised in the cobalt heavens to plumb down upon his prey he watched the great white ship and waited until she should come within striking distance  a promontory to eastward made something of a lee that reached out almost a mile from shore from the watchers eyrie the line of demarcation was sharply drawn they could see the point at which the white crests of the windwhipped wavelets ceased and the water became smoother did she but venture as far southward on her present tack she would be slow to go about again and that should be their opportunity and all unconscious of the lurking peril she held steadily to her course until not half a mile remained between her and that inauspicious lee  excitement stirred the mailclad corsair he kicked his heels in the air then swung round to the impassive and watchful sakrelbahr  she will come she will come he cried in the frankish jargonthe lingua franca of the african littoral  insh allah was the laconic answerif god will  a tense silence fell between them again as the ship drew nearer so that now with each forward heave of her they caught a glint of the white belly under her black hull sakrelbahr shaded his eyes and concentrated his vision upon the square ensign flying from her mainmast he could make out not only the red and yellow quarterings but the devices of the castle and the lion  a spanish ship biskaine he growled to his companion it is very well the praise to the one  will she venture in wondered the other  be sure she will venture was the confident answer she suspects no danger and it is not often that our galleys are to be found so far westward aye there she comes in all her spanish pride  even as he spoke she reached that line of demarcation she crossed it for there was still a moderate breeze on the leeward side of it intent no doubt upon making the utmost of that southward run  now cried biskainebiskaineelborak was he called from the lightninglike impetuousness in which he was wont to strike he quivered with impatience like a leashed hound  not yet was the calm restraining answer every inch nearer shore she creeps the more certain is her doom time enough to sound the charge when she goes about give me to drink abiad he said to one of his negroes whom in irony he had dubbed the white  the slave turned aside swept away a litter of ferns and produced an amphora of porous red clay he removed the palmleaves from the mouth of it and poured water into a cup sakrelbahr drank slowly his eyes never leaving the vessel whose every ratline was clearly defined by now in the pellucid air they could see men moving on her decks and the watchman stationed in the foremast fightingtop she was not more than half a mile away when suddenly came the manceuvre to go about  sakrelbahr leapt instantly to his great height and waved a long green scarf from one of the galleys behind the screen of rocks a trumpet rang out in immediate answer to that signal it was followed by the shrill whistles of the bosuns and that again by the splash and creak of oars as the two larger galleys swept out from their ambush the long armoured poops were aswarm with turbaned corsairs their weapons gleaming in the sunshine a dozen at least were astride of the crosstree of each mainmast all armed with bows and arrows and the ratlines on each side of the galleys were black with men who swarmed there like locusts ready to envelop and smother their prey  the suddenness of the attack flung the spaniard into confusion there was a frantic stir aboard her trumpet blasts and shootings and wild scurryings of men hither and thither to the posts to which they were ordered by their too reckless captain in that confusion her manceuvre to go about went all awry and precious moments were lost during which she stood floundering with idly flapping sails in his desperate haste the captain headed her straight to leeward thinking that by running thus before the wind he stood the best chance of avoiding the trap but there was not wind enough in that sheltered spot to make the attempt successful the galleys sped straight on at an angle to the direction in which the spaniard was moving their yellow dripping oars flashing furiously as the bosuns plied their whips to urge every ounce of sinew in the slaves  of all this sakrelbahr gathered an impression as followed by biskaine and the negroes he swiftly made his way down from that eyrie that had served him so well he sprang from red oak to corktree and from corktree to red oak he leapt from rock to rock or lowered himself from ledge to ledge gripping a handful of heath or a projecting stone but all with the speed and nimbleness of an ape he dropped at last to the beach then sped across it at a run and went bounding along a black reef until he stood alongside of the galliot which had been left behind by the other corsair vessels she awaited him in deep water the length of her oars from the rock and as he came alongside these oars were brought to the horizontal and held there firmly he leapt down upon them his companions following him and using them as a gangway reached the bulwarks he threw a leg over the side and alighted on a decked space between two oars and the two rows of six slaves that were manning each of them  biskaine followed him and the negroes came last they were still astride of the bulwarks when sakrelbahr gave the word up the middle gangway ran a bosun and two of his mates cracking their long whips of bullockhide down went the oars there was a heave and they shot out in the wake of the other two to join the fight  sakrelbahr scimitar in hand stood on the prow a little in advance of the mob of eager babbling corsairs who surrounded him quivering in their impatience to be let loose upon the christian foe above along the yardarm and up the ratlines swarmed his bowmen from the masthead floated out his standard of crimson charged with a green crescent  the naked christian slaves groaned strained and sweated under the moslem lash that drove them to the destruction of their christian brethren  ahead the battle was already joined the spaniard had fired one single hasty shot which had gone wide and now one of the corsairs grapplingirons had seized her on the larboard quarter a withering hail of arrows was pouring down upon her decks from the muslim crosstrees up her sides crowded the eager moors ever most eager when it was a question of tackling the spanish dogs who had driven them from their andalusian caliphate under her quarter sped the other galley to take her on the starboard side and even as she went her archers and stingers hurled death aboard the galleon  it was a short sharp fight the spaniards in confusion from the beginning having been taken utterly by surprise had never been able to order themselves in a proper manner to receive the onslaught still what could be done they did they made a gallant stand against this pitiless assailant but the corsairs charged home as gallantly utterly reckless of life eager to slay in the name of allah and his prophet and scarcely less eager to die if it should please the allpitiful that their destinies should be here fulfilled up they went and back fell the castilians outnumbered by at least ten to one  when sakrelbahrs galliot came alongside that brief encounter was at an end and one of his corsairs was aloft hacking from the mainmast the standard of spain and the wooden crucifix that was nailed below it a moment later and to a thundering roar of alhamdolliah the green crescent floated out upon the breeze  sakrelbahr thrust his way through the press in the galleons waist his corsairs fell back before him making way and as he advanced they roared his name deliriously and waved their scimitars to acclaim him this hawk of the sea as he was named this most valiant of all the servants of islam true he had taken no actual part in the engagement it had been too brief and he had arrived too late for that but his had been the daring to conceive an ambush at so remote a western point and his the brain that had guided them to this swift sweet victory in the name of allah the one  the decks were slippery with blood and strewn with wounded and dying men whom already the muslimeen were heaving overboarddead and wounded alike when they were christians for to what end should they be troubled with maimed slaves  about the mainmast were huddled the surviving spaniards weaponless and broken in courage a herd of timid bewildered sheep  sakrelbahr stood forward his light eyes considering them grimly they must number close upon a hundred adventurers in the main who had set out from cadiz in high hope of finding fortune in the indies their voyage had been a very brief one their fate they knewto toil at the oars of the muslim galleys or at best to be taken to algiers or tunis and sold there into the slavery of some wealthy moor  sakrelbahrs glance scanned them appraisingly and rested finally on the captain who stood slightly in advance his face livid with rage and grief he was richly dressed in the castilian black and his velvet thimbleshaped hat was heavily plumed and decked by a gold cross  sakrelbahr salaamed ceremoniously to him fortuna de guerra senor capitan said he in fluent spanish what is your name  i am don paulo de guzman the man answered drawing himself erect and speaking with conscious pride in himself and manifest contempt of his interlocutor  so a gentleman of family and wellnourished and sturdy i should judge in the sôk at algiers you might fetch two hundred philips you shall ransom yourself for five hundred  por las entranas de dios swore don paulo who like all pious spanish catholics favoured the oath anatomical what else he would have added in his fury is not known for sakrelbahr waved him contemptuously away  for your profanity and want of courtesy we will make the ransom a thousand philips then said he and to his followersaway with him let him have courteous entertainment against the coming of his ransom  he was borne away cursing  of the others sakrelbahr made short work he offered the privilege of ransoming himself to any who might claim it and the privilege was claimed by three the rest he consigned to the care of biskaine who acted as his kayla or lieutenant but before doing so he bade the ships bosun stand forward and demanded to know what slaves there might be on board there were he learnt but a dozen employed upon menial duties on the shipthree jews seven muslimeen and two hereticsand they had been driven under the hatches when the peril threatened  by sakrelbahrs orders these were dragged forth from the blackness into which they had been flung the muslimeen upon discovering that they had fallen into the hands of their own people and that their slavery was at an end broke into cries of delight and fervent praise of allah than whom they swore there was no other god the three jews lithe stalwart young men in black tunics that fell to their knees and black skullcaps upon their curly black locks smiled ingratiatingly hoping for the best since they were fallen into the hands of people who were nearer akin to them than christians and allied to them at least by the bond of common enmity to spain and common suffering at the hands of spaniards the two heretics stood in stolid apathy realizing that with them it was but a case of passing from charybdis to scylla and that they had as little to hope for from heathen as from christian one of these was a sturdy bowlegged fellow whose garments were little better than rags his weatherbeaten face was of the colour of mahogany and his eyes of a dark blue under tufted eyebrows that once had been redlike his hair and beardbut were now thickly intermingled with grey he was spotted like a leopard on the hands by enormous dark brown freckles  of the entire dozen he was the only one that drew the attention of sakrelbahr he stood despondently before the corsair with bowed head and his eyes upon the deck a weary dejected spiritless slave who would as soon die as live thus some few moments during which the stalwart muslim stood regarding him then as if drawn by that persistent scrutiny he raised his dull weary eyes at once they quickened the dulness passed out of them they were bright and keen as of old he thrust his head forward staring in his turn then in a bewildered way he looked about him at the ocean of swarthy faces under turbans of all colours and back again at sakrelbahr  gods light he said at last in english to vent his infinite amazement then reverting to the cynical manner that he had ever affected and effacing all surprise  good day to you sir oliver said he i suppose yell give yourself the pleasure of hanging me  allah is great said sakrelbahr impassively     chapter ii the renegade   how it came to happen that sakrelbahr the hawk of the sea the muslim rover the scourge of the mediterranean the terror of christians and the beloved of asadeddin basha of algiers would be one and the same as sir oliver tressilian the cornish gentleman of penarrow is at long length set forth in the chronicles of lord henry goade his lordship conveys to us some notion of how utterly overwhelming he found that fact by the tedious minuteness with which he follows step by step this extraordinary metamorphosis he devotes to it two entire volumes of those eighteen which he has left us the whole however may with advantage be summarized into one short chapter  sir oliver was one of a score of men who were rescued from the sea by the crew of the spanish vessel that had sunk the swallow another was jasper leigh the skipper all of them were carried to lisbon and there handed over to the court of the holy office since they were heretics allor nearly allit was fit and proper that the brethren of st dominic should undertake their conversion in the first place sir oliver came of a family that never had been famed for rigidity in religious matters and he was certainly not going to burn alive if the adoption of other mens opinions upon an extremely hypothetical future state would suffice to save him from the stake he accepted catholic baptism with an almost contemptuous indifference as for jasper leigh it will be conceived that the elasticity of the skippers conscience was no less than sir olivers and he was certainly not the man to be roasted for a trifle of faith  no doubt there would be great rejoicings in the holy house over the rescue of these two unfortunate souls from the certain perdition that had awaited them it followed that as converts to the faith they were warmly cherished and tears of thanksgiving were profusely shed over them by the hounds of god so much for their heresy they were completely purged of it having done penance in proper form at an auto held on the rocio at lisbon candle in hand and sanbenito on their shoulders the church dismissed them with her blessing and an injunction to persevere in the ways of salvation to which with such meek kindness she had inducted them  now this dismissal amounted to a rejection they were as a consequence thrown back upon the secular authorities and the secular authorities had yet to punish them for their offence upon the seas no offence could be proved it is true but the courts were satisfied that this lack of offence was but the natural result of a lack of opportunity conversely they reasoned it was not to be doubted that with the opportunity the offence would have been forthcoming their assurance of this was based upon the fact that when the spaniard fired across the bows of the swallow as an invitation to heave to she had kept upon her course thus with unanswerable castilian logic was the evil conscience of her skipper proven captain leigh protested on the other hand that his action had been dictated by his lack of faith in spaniards and his firm belief that all spaniards were pirates to be avoided by every honest seaman who was conscious of inferior strength of armaments it was a plea that won him no favour with his narrowminded judges  sir oliver fervently urged that he was no member of the crew of the swallow that he was a gentleman who found himself aboard her very much against his will being the victim of a villainous piece of trepanning executed by her venal captain the court heard his plea with respect and asked to know his name and rank he was so very indiscreet as to answer truthfully the result was extremely educative to sir oliver it showed him how systematically conducted was the keeping of the spanish archives the court produced documents enabling his judges to recite to him most of that portion of his life that had been spent upon the seas and many an awkward little circumstance which had slipped his memory long since which he now recalled and which certainly was not calculated to make his sentence lighter  had he not been in the barbados in such a year and had he not there captured the galleon maria de las dolores what was that but an act of villainous piracy had he not scuttled a spanish carack four years ago in the bay of funchal had he not been with that pirate hawkins in the affair at san juan de ulloa and so on questions poured upon him and engulfed him  he almost regretted that he had given himself the trouble to accept conversion and all that it entailed at the hands of the brethren of st dominic it began to appear to him that he had but wasted time and escaped the clerical fire to be dangled on a secular rope as an offering to the vengeful gods of outraged spain  so much however was not done the galleys in the mediterranean were in urgent need of men at the time and to this circumstance sir oliver captain leigh and some others of the luckless crew of the swallow owed their lives though it is to be doubted whether any of them found the matter one for congratulation chained each man to a fellow ankle to ankle with but a short length of links between they formed part of a considerable herd of unfortunates who were driven across portugal into spain and then southward to cadiz the last that sir oliver saw of captain leigh was on the morning on which he set out from the reeking lisbon gaol thereafter throughout that weary march each knew the other to be somewhere in that wretched regiment of galleyslaves but they never came face to face again  in cadiz sir oliver spent a month in a vast enclosed space that was open to the sky but nevertheless of an indescribable foulness a place of filth disease and suffering beyond human conception the details of which the curious may seek for himself in my lord henrys chronicles they are too revolting by far to be retailed here  at the end of that month he was one of those picked out by an officer who was manning a galley that was to convey the infanta to naples he owed this to his vigorous constitution which had successfully withstood the infections of that mephitic place of torments and to the fine thews which the officer pummelled and felt as though he were acquiring a beast of burdenwhich indeed is precisely what he was doing  the galley to which our gentleman was dispatched was a vessel of fifty oars each manned by seven men they were seated upon a sort of staircase that followed the slope of the oar running from the gangway in the vessels middle down to the shallow bulwarks  the place allotted to sir oliver was that next the gangway here stark naked as when he was born he was chained to the bench and in those chains let us say at once he remained without a single moments intermission for six whole months  between himself and the hard timbers of his seat there was naught but a flimsy and dirty sheepskin from end to end the bench was not more than ten feet in length whilst the distance separating it from the next one was a bare four feet in that cramped space of ten feet by four sir oliver and his six oarmates had their miserable existence waking and sleepingfor they slept in their chains at the oar without sufficient room in which to lie at stretch  anon sir oliver became hardened and inured to that unspeakable existence that living death of the galleyslave but that first long voyage to naples was ever to remain the most terrible experience of his life for spells of six or eight endless hours at a time and on one occasion for no less than ten hours did he pull at his oar without a single moments pause with one foot on the stretcher the other on the bench in front of him grasping his part of that appallingly heavy fifteenfoot oar he would bend his back to thrust forwardand upwards so to clear the shoulders of the groaning sweating slaves in front of himthen he would lift the end so as to bring the blade down to the water and having gripped he would rise from his seat to throw his full weight into the pull and so fall back with clank of chain upon the groaning bench to swing forward once more and so on until his senses reeled his sight became blurred his mouth parched and his whole body a living straining ache then would come the sharp fierce cut of the boatswains whip to revive energies that flagged however little and sometimes to leave a bleeding stripe upon his naked back  thus day in day out now broiled and blistered by the pitiless southern sun now chilled by the night dews whilst he took his cramped and unrefreshing rest indescribably filthy and dishevelled his hair and beard matted with endless sweat unwashed save by the rains which in that season were all too rare choked almost by the stench of his miserable comrades and infested by filthy crawling things begotten of decaying sheepskins and heaven alone knows what other foulnesses of that floating hell he was sparingly fed upon weevilled biscuit and vile messes of tallowy rice and to drink he was given lukewarm water that was often stale saving that sometimes when the spell of rowing was more than usually protracted the boatswains would thrust lumps of bread sodden in wine into the mouths of the toiling slaves to sustain them  the scurvy broke out on that voyage and there were other diseases among the rowers to say nothing of the festering sores begotten of the friction of the bench which were common to all and which each must endure as best he could with the slave whose disease conquered him or who reaching the limit of his endurance permitted himself to swoon the boatswains had a short way the diseased were flung overboard the swooning were dragged out upon the gangway or bridge and flogged there to revive them if they did not revive they were flogged on until they were a horrid bleeding pulp which was then heaved into the sea  once or twice when they stood to windward the smell of the slaves being wafted abaft and reaching the fine gilded poop where the infanta and her attendants travelled the helmsmen were ordered to put about and for long weary hours the slaves would hold the galley in position backing her up gently against the wind so as not to lose way  the number that died in the first week of that voyage amounted to close upon a quarter of the total but there were reserves in the prow and these were drawn upon to fill the empty places none but the fittest could survive this terrible ordeal  of these was sir oliver and of these too was his immediate neighbour at the oar a stalwart powerful impassive uncomplaining young moor who accepted his fate with a stoicism that aroused sir olivers admiration for days they exchanged no single word together their religions marking them out they thought for enemies despite the fact that they were fellows in misfortune but one evening when an aged jew who had collapsed in merciful unconsciousness was dragged out and flogged in the usual manner sir oliver chancing to behold the scarlet prelate who accompanied the infanta looking on from the pooprail with hard unmerciful eyes was filled with such a passion at all this inhumanity and at the cold pitilessness of that professed servant of the gentle and pitiful saviour that aloud he cursed all christians in general and that scarlet prince of the church in particular  he turned to the moor beside him and addressing him in spanish  hell he said was surely made for christians which may be why they seek to make earth like it  fortunately for him the creak and dip of the oars the clank of chains and the lashes beating sharply upon the wretched jew were sufficient to muffle his voice but the moor heard him and his dark eyes gleamed  there is a furnace seven times heated awaiting them  my brother he replied with a confidence which seemed to be the source of his present stoicism but art thou then not a christian  he spoke in that queer language of the north african seaboard that lingua franca which sounded like some french dialect interspersed with arabic words but sir oliver made out his meaning almost by intuition he answered him in spanish again since although the moor did not appear to speak it yet it was plain he understood it  i renounce from this hour he answered in his passion i will acknowledge no religion in whose name such things are done look me at that scarlet fruit of hell up yonder see how daintily he sniffs at his pomander lest his saintly nostrils be offended by the exhalations of our misery yet are we gods creatures made in gods image like himself what does he know of god religion he knows as he knows good wine rich food and soft women he preaches selfdenial as the way to heaven and by his own tenets is he damned he growled an obscene oath as he heaved the great oar forward a christian i he cried and laughed for the first time since he had been chained to that bench of agony i am done with christians and christianity  verily we are gods and to him shall we return said the moor  that was the beginning of a friendship between sir oliver and this man whose name was yusufbenmoktar the muslim conceived that in sir oliver he saw one upon whom the grace of allah had descended one who was ripe to receive the prophets message yusuf was devout and he applied himself to the conversion of his fellowslave sir oliver listened to him however with indifference having discarded one creed he would need a deal of satisfying on the score of another before he adopted it and it seemed to him that all the glorious things urged by yusuf in praise of islam he had heard before in praise of christianity but he kept his counsel on that score and meanwhile his intercourse with the muslim had the effect of teaching him the lingua franca so that at the end of six months he found himself speaking it like a mauretanian with all the muslims imagery and with more than the ordinary seasoning of arabic  it was towards the end of that six months that the event took place which was to restore sir oliver to liberty in the meanwhile those limbs of his which had ever been vigorous beyond the common wont had acquired an elephantine strength it was ever thus at the oar either you died under the strain or your thews and sinews grew to be equal to their relentless task sir oliver in those six months was become a man of steel and iron impervious to fatigue superhuman almost in his endurance  they were returning home from a trip to genoa when one evening as they were standing off minorca in the balearic isles they were surprised by a fleet of four muslim galleys which came skimming round a promontory to surround and engage them  aboard the spanish vessel there broke a terrible cry of asadeddinthe name of the most redoubtable muslim corsair since the italian renegade ochialithe ali pasha who had been killed at lepanto trumpets blared and drums beat on the poop and the spaniards in morion and corselet armed with calivers and pikes stood to defend their lives and liberty the gunners sprang to the culverins but fire had to be kindled and linstocks ignited and in the confusion much time was lostso much that not a single cannon shot was fired before the grappling irons of the first galley clanked upon and gripped the spaniards bulwarks the shock of the impact was terrific the armoured prow of the muslim galleyasadeddins ownsmote the spaniard a slanting blow amidships that smashed fifteen of the oars as if they had been so many withered twigs  there was a shriek from the slaves followed by such piteous groans as the damned in hell may emit fully two score of them had been struck by the shafts of their oars as these were hurled back against them some had been killed outright others lay limp and crushed some with broken backs others with shattered limbs and ribs  sir oliver would assuredly have been of these but for the warning advice and example of yusuf who was well versed in galleyfighting and who foresaw clearly what must happen he thrust the oar upward and forward as far as it would go compelling the others at his bench to accompany his movement then he slipped down upon his knees released his hold of the timber and crouched down until his shoulders were on a level with the bench he had shouted to sir oliver to follow his example and sir oliver without even knowing what the manoeuvre should portend but gathering its importance from the others urgency of tone promptly obeyed the oar was struck an instant later and ere it snapped off it was flung back braining one of the slaves at the bench and mortally injuring the others but passing clean over the heads of sir oliver and yusuf a moment later the bodies of the oarsmen of the bench immediately in front were flung back atop of them with yells and curses  when sir oliver staggered to his feet he found the battle joined the spaniards had fired a volley from their calivers and a dense cloud of smoke hung above the bulwarks through this surged now the corsairs led by a tall lean elderly man with a flowing white beard and a swarthy eagle face a crescent of emeralds flashed from his snowy turban above it rose the peak of a steel cap and his body was cased in chain mail he swung a great scimitar before which spaniards went down like wheat to the reapers sickle he fought like ten men and to support him poured a neverending stream of muslimeen to the cry of din din allah yallah back and yet back went the spaniards before that irresistible onslaught  sir oliver found yusuf struggling in vain to rid himself of his chain and went to his assistance he stooped seized it in both hands set his feet against the bench exerted all his strength and tore the staple from the wood yusuf was free save of course that a length of heavy chain was dangling from his steel anklet in his turn he did the like service by sir oliver though not quite as speedily for strong man though he was either his strength was not equal to the cornishmans or else the latters staple had been driven into sounder timber in the end however it yielded and sir oliver too was free then he set the foot that was hampered by the chain upon the bench and with the staple that still hung from the end of it he prised open the link that attached it to his anklet  that done he took his revenge crying din as loudly as any of the muslimeen boarders he flung himself upon the rear of the spaniards brandishing his chain in his hands it became a terrific weapon he used it as a scourge lashing it to right and left of him splitting here a head and crushing there a face until he had hacked a way clean through the spanish press which bewildered by this sudden rear attack made but little attempt to retaliate upon the escaped galleyslave after him whirling the remaining ten feet of the broken oar came yusuf  sir oliver confessed afterwards to knowing very little of what happened in those moments he came to a full possession of his senses to find the fight at an end a cloud of turbaned corsairs standing guard over a huddle of spaniards others breaking open the cabin and dragging thence the chests that it contained others again armed with chisels and mallets passing along the benches liberating the surviving slaves of whom the great majority were children of islam  sir oliver found himself face to face with the whitebearded leader of the corsairs who was leaning upon his scimitar and regarding him with eyes at once amused and amazed our gentlemans naked body was splashed from head to foot with blood and in his right hand he still clutched that yard of iron links with which he had wrought such ghastly execution yusuf was standing at the corsair leaders elbow speaking rapidly  by allah was ever such a lusty fighter seen cried the latter the strength of the prophet is within him thus to smite the unbelieving pigs  sir oliver grinned savagely  i was returning them some of their whiplasheswith interest said he  and those were the circumstances under which he came to meet the formidable asadeddin basha of algiers those the first words that passed between them  anon when aboard asads own galley he was being carried to barbary he was washed and his head was shaved all but the forelock by which the prophet should lift him up to heaven when his earthly destiny should come to be fulfilled he made no protest they washed and fed him and gave him ease and so that they did these things to him they might do what else they pleased at last arrayed in flowing garments that were strange to him and with a turban wound about his head he was conducted to the poop where asad sat with yusuf under an awning and he came to understand that it was in compliance with the orders of yusuf that he had been treated as if he were a truebeliever  yusufbenmoktar was discovered as a person of great consequence the nephew of asadeddin and a favourite with that exalted of allah the sublime portal himself a man whose capture by christians had been a thing profoundly deplored accordingly his delivery from that thraldom was matter for rejoicing being delivered he bethought him of his oarmate concerning whom indeed asadeddin manifested the greatest curiosity for in all this world there was nothing the old corsair loved so much as a fighter and in all his days he vowed never had he seen the equal of that stalwart galleyslave never the like of his performance with that murderous chain yusuf had informed him that the man was a fruit ripe for the prophets plucking that the grace of allah was upon him and in spirit already he must be accounted a good muslim  when sir oliver washed perfumed and arrayed in white caftan and turban which gave him the air of being even taller than he was came into the presence of asadeddin it was conveyed to him that if he would enter the ranks of the faithful of the prophets house and devote the strength and courage with which allah the one had endowed him to the upholding of the true faith and to the chastening of the enemies of islam great honour wealth and dignity were in store for him  of all that proposal made at prodigious length and with great wealth of eastern circumlocution the only phrase that took root in his rather bewildered mind was that which concerned the chastening of the enemies of islam the enemies of islam he conceived were his own enemies and he further conceived that they stood in great need of chastening and that to take a hand in that chastening would be a singularly grateful task so he considered the proposals made him he considered too that the alternativein the event of his refusing to make the protestations of faith required of himwas that he must return to the oar of a galley of a muslim galley now now that was an occupation of which he had had more than his fill and since he had been washed and restored to the normal sensations of a clean human being he found that whatever might be within the scope of his courage he could not envisage returning to the oar we have seen the ease with which he had abandoned the religion in which he was reared for the roman faith and how utterly deluded he had found himself with the same degree of ease did he now go over to islam and with much greater profit moreover he embraced the religion of mahomet with a measure of fierce conviction that had been entirely lacking from his earlier apostasy  he had arrived at the conclusion whilst aboard the galley of spain as we have seen that christianity as practised in his day was a grim mockery of which the world were better rid it is not to be supposed that his convictions that christianity was at fault went the length of making him suppose that islam was right or that his conversion to the faith of mahomet was anything more than superficial but forced as he was to choose between the rowers bench and the poopdeck the oar and the scimitar he boldly and resolutely made the only choice that in his case could lead to liberty and life  thus he was received into the ranks of the faithful whose pavilions wait them in paradise set in an orchard of neverfailing fruit among rivers of milk of wine and of clarified honey he became the kayia or lieutenant to yusuf on the galley of that corsairs command and seconded him in half a score of engagements with an ability and a conspicuity that made him swiftly famous throughout the ranks of the mediterranean rovers some six months later in a fight off the coast of sicily with one of the galleys of the religionas the vessels of the knights of malta were calledyusuf was mortally wounded in the very moment of the victory he died an hour later in the arms of sir oliver naming the latter his successor in the command of the galley and enjoining upon all implicit obedience to him until they should be returned to algiers and the basha should make known his further will in the matter  the bashas will was to confirm his nephews dying appointment of a successor and sir oliver found himself in full command of a galley from that hour he became oliverreis but very soon his valour and fury earned him the byname of sakrelbahr the hawk of the sea his fame grew rapidly and it spread across the tideless sea to the very shores of christendom soon he became asads lieutenant the second in command of all the algerine galleys which meant in fact that he was the commanderinchief for asad was growing old and took the sea more and more rarely now sakrelbahr sallied forth in his name and his stead and such was his courage his address and his good fortune that never did he go forth to return emptyhanded  it was clear to all that the favour of allah was upon him that he had been singled out by allah to be the very glory of islam asad who had ever esteemed him grew to love him an intensely devout man could he have done less in the case of one for whom the pitying the pitiful showed so marked a predilection it was freely accepted that when the destiny of asadeddin should come to be fulfilled sakrelbahr must succeed him in the bashalik of algiers and that thus oliverreis would follow in the footsteps of barbarossa ochiali and other christian renegades who had become corsairprinces of islam  in spite of certain hostilities which his rapid advancement begot and of which we shall hear more presently once only did his power stand in danger of suffering a check coming one morning into the reeking bagnio at algiers some six months after he had been raised to his captaincy he found there a score of countrymen of his own and he gave orders that their letters should instantly be struck off and their liberty restored them  called to account by the basha for this action he took a highhanded way since no other was possible he swore by the beard of the prophet that if he were to draw the sword of mahomet and to serve islam upon the seas he would serve it in his own way and one of his ways was that his own countrymen were to have immunity from the edge of that same sword islam he swore should not be the loser since for every englishman he restored to liberty he would bring two spaniards frenchmen greeks or italians into bondage  he prevailed but only upon condition that since captured slaves were the property of the state if he desired to abstract them from the state he must first purchase them for himself since they would then be his own property he could dispose of them at his good pleasure thus did the wise and just asad resolve the difficulty which had arisen and oliverreis bowed wisely to that decision  thereafter what english slaves were brought to algiers he purchased manumitted and found means to send home again true it cost him a fine price yearly but he was fast amassing such wealth as could easily support this tax  as you read lord henry goades chronicles you might come to the conclusion that in the whorl of that new life of his sir oliver had entirely forgotten the happenings in his cornish home and the woman he had loved who so readily had believed him guilty of the slaying of her brother you might believe this until you come upon the relation of how he found one day among some english seamen brought captive to algiers by biskaineelborakwho was become his own second in commanda young cornish lad from helston named pitt whose father he had known  he took this lad home with him to the fine palace which he inhabited near the babeloueb treated him as an honoured guest and sat through a whole summer night in talk with him questioning him upon this person and that person and thus gradually drawing from him all the little history of his native place during the two years that were sped since he had left it in this we gather an impression of the wistful longings the fierce nostalgia that must have overcome the renegade and his endeavours to allay it by his endless questions the cornish lad had brought him up sharply and agonizingly with that past of his upon which he had closed the door when he became a muslim and a corsair the only possible inference is that in those hours of that summers night repentance stirred in him and a wild longing to return rosamund should reopen for him that door which harddriven by misfortune he had slammed that she would do so when once she knew the truth he had no faintest doubt and there was now no reason why he should conceal the truth why he should continue to shield that dastardly halfbrother of his whom he had come to hate as fiercely as he had erstwhile loved him  in secret he composed a long letter giving the history of all that had happened to him since his kidnapping and setting forth the entire truth of that and of the deed that had led to it his chronicler opines that it was a letter that must have moved a stone to tears and moreover it was not a mere matter of passionate protestations of innocence or of unsupported accusation of his brother it told her of the existence of proofs that must dispel all doubt it told her of that parchment indited by master baine and witnessed by the parson which document was to be delivered to her together with the letter further it bade her seek confirmation of that documents genuineness did she doubt it at the hands of master baine himself that done it besought her to lay the whole matter before the queen and thus secure him faculty to return to england and immunity from any consequences of his subsequent regenade act to which his sufferings had driven him he loaded the young cornishman with gifts gave him that letter to deliver in person and added instructions that should enable him to find the document he was to deliver with it that precious parchment had been left between the leaves of an old book on falconry in the library at penarrow where it would probably be found still undisturbed since his brother would not suspect its presence and was himself no scholar pitt was to seek out nicholas at penarrow and enlist his aid to obtain possession of that document if it still existed  then sakrelbahr found means to conduct pitt to genoa and there put him aboard an english vessel  three months later he received an answera letter from pitt which reached him by way of genoawhich was at peace with the algerines and served then as a channel of communication with christianity in this letter pitt informed him that he had done all that sir oliver had desired him that he had found the document by the help of nicholas and that in person he had waited upon mistress rosamund godolphin who dwelt now with sir john killigrew at arwenack delivering to her the letter and the parchment but that upon learning on whose behalf he came she had in his presence flung both unopened upon the fire and dismissed him with his tale untold  sakrelbahr spent the night under the skies in his fragrant orchard and his slaves reported in terror that they had heard sobs and weeping if indeed his heart wept it was for the last time thereafter he was more inscrutable more ruthless cruel and mocking than men had ever known him nor from that day did he ever again concern himself to manumit a single english slave his heart was become a stone  thus five years passed counting from that spring night when he was trepanned by jasper leigh and his fame spread his name became a terror upon the seas and fleets put forth from malta from naples and from venice to make an end of him and his ruthless piracy but allah kept watch over him and sakrelbahr never delivered battle but he wrested victory to the scimitars of islam  then in the spring of that fifth year there came to him another letter from the cornish pitt a letter which showed him that gratitude was not as dead in the world as he supposed it for it was purely out of gratitude that the lad whom he had delivered from thraldom wrote to inform him of certain matters that concerned him this letter reopened that old wound it did more it dealt him a fresh one he learnt from it that the writer had been constrained by sir john killigrew to give such evidence of sir olivers conversion to islam as had enabled the courts to pronounce sir oliver as one to be presumed dead at law granting the succession to his halfbrother master lionel tressilian pitt professed himself deeply mortified at having been forced unwittingly to make sir oliver so evil a return for the benefits received from him and added that sooner would he have suffered them to hang him than have spoken could he have foreseen the consequences of his testimony  so far sir oliver read unmoved by any feeling other than cold contempt but there was more to follow the letter went on to tell him that mistress rosamund was newly returned from a two years sojourn in france to become betrothed to his halfbrother lionel and that they were to be wed in june he was further informed that the marriage had been contrived by sir john killigrew in his desire to see rosamund settled and under the protection of a husband since he himself was proposing to take the seas and was fitting out a fine ship for a voyage to the indies the writer added that the marriage was widely approved and it was deemed to be an excellent measure for both houses since it would weld into one the two contiguous estates of penarrow and godolphin court  oliverreis laughed when he had read thus far the marriage was approved not for itself it would seem but because by means of it two stretches of earth were united into one it was a marriage of two parks of two estates of two tracts of arable and forest and that two human beings were concerned in it was apparently no more than an incidental circumstance  then the irony of it all entered his soul and spread it with bitterness after dismissing him for the supposed murder of her brother she was to take the actual murderer to her arms and he that cur that false villainout of what depths of hell did he derive the courage to go through with this mummeryhad he no heart no conscience no sense of decency no fear of god  he tore the letter into fragments and set about effacing the matter from his thoughts pitt had meant kindly by him but had dealt cruelly in his efforts to seek distraction from the torturing images ever in his mind he took to the sea with three galleys and thus some two weeks later came face to face with master jasper leigh aboard the spanish carack which he captured under cape spartel     chapter iii homeward bound   in the cabin of the captured spaniard jasper leigh found himself that evening face to face with sakrelbahr haled thither by the corsairs gigantic nubians  sakrelbahr had not yet pronounced his intentions concerning the piratical little skipper and master leigh full conscious that he was a villain feared the worst and had spent some miserable hours in the forecastle awaiting a doom which he accounted foregone  our positions have changed master leigh since last we talked in a ships cabin was the renegades inscrutable greeting  indeed master leigh agreed but i hope yell remember that on that occasion i was your friend  at a price sakrelbahr reminded him and at a price you may find me your friend today  the rascally skippers heart leapt with hope  name it sir oliver he answered eagerly and so that it ties within my wretched power i swear ill never boggle at it ive had enough of slavery he ran on in a plaintive whine five years of it and four of them spent aboard the galleys of spain and no day in all of them but that i prayed for death did you but know what i ha suffered  never was suffering more merited never punishment more fitting never justice more poetic said sakrelbahr in a voice that made the skippers blood run cold you would have sold me a man who did you no hurt indeed a man who once befriended youyou would have sold me into slavery for a matter of two hundred pounds  nay nay cried the other fearfully as gods my witness twas never part of my intent yell never ha forgot the words i spoke to you the offer that i made to carry you back home again  ay at a price tis true sakrelbahr repeated and it is fortunate for you that you are today in a position to pay a price that should postpone your dirty necks acquaintance with a rope i need a navigator he added in explanation and what five years ago you would have done for two hundred pounds you shall do today for your life how say you will you navigate this ship for me  sir cried jasper leigh who could scarce believe that this was all that was required of him ill sail it to hell at your bidding  i am not for spain this voyage answered sakrelbahr you shall sail me precisely as you would have done five years ago back to the mouth of the fal and set me ashore there is that agreed  ay and gladly replied master leigh without a seconds pause  the conditions are that you shall have your life and your liberty sakrelbahr explained but do not suppose that arrived in england you are to be permitted to depart you must sail us back again though once you have done that i shall find a way to send you home if you so desire it and perhaps there will be some measure of reward for you if you serve me faithfully throughout follow the habits of a lifetime by playing me false and theres an end to you you shall have for constant bodyguard these two lilies of the desert and he pointed to the colossal nubians who stood there invisible almost in the shadow but for the flash of teeth and eyeballs they shall watch over you and see that no harm befalls you so long as you are honest with me and they shall strangle you at the first sign of treachery you may go you have the freedom of the ship but you are not to leave it here or elsewhere save at my express command  jasper leigh stumbled out counting himself fortunate beyond his expectations or deserts and the nubians followed him and hung behind him ever after like some vast twin shadow  to sakrelbahr entered now biskaine with a report of the prize captured beyond the prisoners however and the actual vessel which had suffered nothing in the fight the cargo was of no account outward bound as she was it was not to be expected that any treasures would be discovered in her hold they found great store of armaments and powder and a little money but naught else that was worthy of the corsairs attention  sakrelbahr briefly issued his surprising orders  thoult set the captives aboard one of the galleys biskaine and thyself convey them to algiers there to be sold all else thoult leave aboard here and two hundred picked corsairs to go a voyage with me overseas men that will act as mariners and fighters  art thou then not returning to algiers o sakrelbahr  not yet i am for a longer voyage convey my service to asadeddin whom allah guard and cherish and tell him to look for me in some six weeks time  this sudden resolve of oliverreis created no little excitement aboard the galleys the corsairs knew nothing of navigation upon the open seas none of them had ever been beyond the mediterranean few of them indeed had ever voyaged as far west as cape spartel and it is doubtful if they would have followed any other leader into the perils of the open atlantic but sakrelbahr the child of fortune the protected of allah had never yet led them to aught but victory and he had but to call them to heel and they would troop after him whithersoever he should think well to go so now there was little trouble in finding the two hundred muslimeen he desired for his fighting crew rather was the difficulty to keep the number of those eager for the adventure within the bounds he had indicated  you are not to suppose that in all this sir oliver was acting upon any preconcerted plan whilst he had lain on the heights watching that fine ship beating up against the wind it had come to him that with such a vessel under him it were a fond adventure to sail to england to descend upon that cornish coast abruptly as a thunderbolt and present the reckoning to his craven dastard of a brother he had toyed with the fancy dreamily almost as men build their castles in spain then in the heat of conflict it had entirely escaped his mind to return in the shape of a resolve when he came to find himself face to face with jasper leigh  the skipper and the ship conjointly provided him with all the means to realize that dream he had dreamt there was none to oppose his will no reason not to indulge his cruel fancy perhaps too he might see rosamund again might compel her to hear the truth from him and there was sir john killigrew he had never been able to determine whether sir john had been his friend or his foe in the past but since it was sir john who had been instrumental in setting up lionel in sir olivers placeby inducing the courts to presume sir olivers death on the score that being a renegade he must be accounted dead at lawand since it was sir john who was contriving this wedding between lionel and rosamund why sir john too should be paid a visit and should be informed of the precise nature of the thing he did  with the forces at his disposal in those days of his absolute lordship of life and death along the african littoral to conceive was with oliverreis no more than the prelude to execution the habit of swift realization of his every wish had grown with him and that habit guided now his course  he made his preparations quickly and on the morrow the spanish caracklately labelled nuestra senora de las llagas but with that label carefully effaced from her quartertrimmed her sails and stood out for the open atlantic navigated by captain jasper leigh the three galleys under the command of biskaineelborak crept slowly eastward and homeward to algiers hugging the coast as was the corsair habit the wind favoured oliver so well that within ten days of rounding cape st vincent he had his first glimpse of the lizard     chapter iv the raid   in the estuary of the river fal a splendid ship on the building of which the most cunning engineers had been employed and no money spared rode proudly at anchor just off smithick under the very shadow of the heights crowned by the fine house of arwenack she was fitting out for a distant voyage and for days the work of bringing stores and munitions aboard had been in progress so that there was an unwonted bustle about the little forge and the huddle of cottages that went to make up the fishing village as if in earnest of the great traffic that in future days was to be seen about that spot for sir john killigrew seemed at last to be on the eve of prevailing and of laying there the foundations of the fine port of his dreams  to this state of things his friendship with master lionel tressilian had contributed not a little the opposition made to his project by sir oliverand supported largely at sir olivers suggestion by truro and helstonhad been entirely withdrawn by lionel more indeed lionel had actually gone so far in the opposite direction as to support sir john in his representations to parliament and the queen it followed naturally enough that just as sir olivers opposition of that cherished project had been the seed of the hostility between arwenack and penarrow so lionels support of it became the root of the staunch friendship that sprang up between himself and sir john  what lionel lacked of his brothers keen intelligence he made up for in cunning he realized that although at some future time it was possible that helston and truro and the tressilian property there might come to suffer as a consequence of the development of a port so much more advantageously situated yet that could not be in his own lifetime and meanwhile he must earn in return sir johns support for his suit of rosamund godolphin and thus find the godolphin estates merged with his own this certain immediate gain was to master lionel well worth the other future possible loss  it must not however be supposed that lionels courtship had thenceforward run a smooth and easy course the mistress of godolphin court showed him no favour and it was mainly that she might abstract herself from the importunities of his suit that she had sought and obtained sir john killigrews permission to accompany the latters sister to france when she went there with her husband who was appointed english ambassador to the louvre sir johns authority as her guardian had come into force with the decease of her brother  master lionel moped awhile in her absence but cheered by sir johns assurance that in the end he should prevail he quitted cornwall in his turn and went forth to see the world he spent some time in london about the court where however he seems to have prospered little and then he crossed to france to pay his devoirs to the lady of his longings  his constancy the humility with which he made his suit the obvious intensity of his devotion began at last to wear away that gentlewomans opposition as dripping water wears away a stone yet she could not bring herself to forget that he was sir olivers brotherthe brother of the man she had loved and the brother of the man who had killed her own brother between them stood then two things the ghost of that old love of hers and the blood of peter godolphin  of this she reminded sir john on her return to cornwall after an absence of some two years urging these matters as reasons why an alliance between herself and lionel tressilian must be impossible  sir john did not at all agree with her  my dear he said there is your future to be thought of you are now of full age and mistress of your own actions yet it is not well for a woman and a gentlewoman to dwell alone as long as i live or as long as i remain in england all will be well you may continue indefinitely your residence here at arwenack and you have been wise i think in quitting the loneliness of godolphin court yet consider that that loneliness may be yours again when i am not here  i should prefer that loneliness to the company you would thrust upon me she answered him  ungracious speech he protested is this your gratitude for that lads burning devotion for his patience his gentleness and all the rest  he is oliver tressilians brother she replied  and has he not suffered enough for that already is there to be no end to the price that he must pay for his brothers sins besides consider that when all is said they are not even brothers they are but halfbrothers  yet too closely kin she said if you must have me wed i beg youll find me another husband  to this he would answer that expediently considered no husband could be better than the one he had chosen her he pointed out the contiguity of their two estates and how fine and advantageous a thing it would be to merge these two into one  he was persistent and his persistence was increased when he came to conceive his notion to take the seas again his conscience would not permit him to heave anchor until he had bestowed her safely in wedlock lionel too was persistent in a quiet almost selfeffacing way that never set a strain upon her patience and was therefore the more difficult to combat  in the end she gave way under the pressure of these mens wills and did so with the best grace she could summon resolved to drive from her heart and mind the one real obstacle of which for very shame she had made no mention to sir john the fact is that in spite of all her love for sir oliver was not dead it was stricken down it is true until she herself failed to recognize it for what it really was but she caught herself thinking of him frequently and wistfully she found herself comparing him with his brother and for all that she had bidden sir john find her some other husband than lionel she knew full well that any suitor brought before her must be submitted to that same comparison to his inevitable undoing all this she accounted evil in herself it was in vain that she lashed her mind with the reminder that sir oliver was peters murderer as time went on she found herself actually making excuses for her sometime lover she would admit that peter had driven him to the step that for her sake sir oliver had suffered insult upon insult from peter until being but human the cup of his endurance had overflowed in the end and weary of submitting to the others blows he had risen up in his anger and smitten in his turn  she would scorn herself for such thoughts as these yet she could not dismiss them in act she could be strongas witness how she had dealt with that letter which oliver sent her out of barbary by the hand of pittbut her thoughts she could not govern and her thoughts were full often traitors to her will there were longings in her heart for oliver which she could not stifle and there was ever the hope that he would one day return although she realized that from such a return she might look for nothing  when sir john finally slew the hope of that return he did a wiser thing than he conceived never since olivers disappearance had they heard any news of him until pitt came to arwenack with that letter and his story they had heard as had all the world of the corsair sakrelbahr but they had been far indeed from connecting him with oliver tressilian now that his identity was established by pitts testimony it was an easy matter to induce the courts to account him dead and to give lionel the coveted inheritance  this to rosamund was a small matter but a great one was that sir oliver was dead at law and must be so in fact should he ever again set foot in england it extinguished finally that curiously hopeless and almost subconscious hope of hers that one day he would return thus it helped her perhaps to face and accept the future which sir john was resolved to thrust upon her  her betrothal was made public and she proved if not an ardently loving at least a docile and gentle mistress to lionel he was content he could ask no more in reason at the moment and he was buoyed up by every lovers confidence that given opportunity and time he could find the way to awaken a response and it must be confessed that already during their betrothal he gave some proof of his reason for his confidence she had been lonely and he dispelled her loneliness by his complete surrender of himself to her his restraint and his cautious almost insidious creeping along a path which a more clumsy fellow would have taken at a dash made companionship possible between them and very sweet to her upon this foundation her affection began gradually to rise and seeing them together and such excellent friends sir john congratulated himself upon his wisdom and went about the fitting out of that fine ship of histhe silver heronfor the coming voyage  thus they came within a week of the wedding and sir john all impatience now the marriage bells were to be his signal for departure as they fell silent the silver heron should spread her wings  it was the evening of the first of june the peal of the curfew had faded on the air and lights were being set in the great diningroom at arwenack where the company was to sup it was a small party just sir john and rosamund and lionel who had lingered on that day and lord henry goadeour chroniclerthe queens lieutenant of cornwall together with his lady they were visiting sir john and they were to remain yet a week his guests at arwenack that they might grace the coming nuptials  above in the house there was great stir of preparation for the departure of sir john and his ward the latter into wedlock the former into unknown seas in the turret chamber a dozen sempstresses were at work upon the bridal outfit under the directions of that sally pentreath who had been no less assiduous in the preparation of swaddling clothes and the like on the eve of rosamunds appearance in this world  at the very hour at which sir john was leading his company to table sir oliver tressilian was setting foot ashore not a mile away  he had deemed it wiser not to round pendennis point so in the bay above swanpool on the western side of that promontory he had dropped anchor as the evening shadows were deepening he had launched the ships two boats and in these he had conveyed some thirty of his men ashore twice had the boats returned until a hundred of his corsairs stood ranged along that foreign beach the other hundred he left on guard aboard he took so great a force upon an expedition for which a quarter of the men would have sufficed so as to ensure by overwhelming numbers the avoidance of all unnecessary violence  absolutely unobserved he led them up the slope towards arwenack through the darkness that had now closed in to tread his native soil once more went near to drawing tears from him how familiar was the path he followed with such confidence in the night how well known each bush and stone by which he went with his silent multitude hard upon his heels who could have foretold him such a return as this  who could have dreamt when he roamed amain in his youth here with dogs and fowlingpiece that he would creep one night over these dunes a renegade muslim leading a horde of infidels to storm the house of sir john killigrew of arwenack  such thoughts begot a weakness in him but he made a quick recovery when his mind swung to all that he had so unjustly suffered when he considered all that he came thus to avenge  first to arwenack to sir john and rosamund to compel them to hear the truth at least and then away to penarrow for master lionel and the reckoning such was the project that warmed him conquered his weakness and spurred him relentless onward and upward to the heights and the fortified house that dominated them  he found the massive ironstudded gates locked as was to have been expected at that hour he knocked and presently the postern gaped and a lantern was advanced instantly that lantern was dashed aside and sir oliver had leapt over the sill into the courtyard with a hand gripping the porters throat to choke all utterance sir oliver heaved him out to his men who swiftly gagged him  that done they poured silently through that black gap of the postern into the spacious gateway on he led them at a run almost towards the tall mullioned windows whence a flood of golden light seemed invitingly to beckon them  with the servants who met them in the hall they dealt in the same swift silent fashion as they had dealt with the gatekeeper and such was the speed and caution of their movements that sir john and his company had no suspicion of their presence until the door of the diningroom crashed open before their eyes  the sight which they beheld was one that for some moments left them mazed and bewildered lord henry tells us how at first he imagined that here was some mummery some surprise prepared for the bridal couple by sir johns tenants or the folk of smithick and penycumwick and he adds that he was encouraged in this belief by the circumstance that not a single weapon gleamed in all that horde of outlandish intruders  although they came full armed against any eventualities yet by their leaders orders not a blade was bared what was to do was to be done with their naked hands alone and without bloodshed such were the orders of sakrelbahr and sakrelbahrs were not orders to be disregarded  himself he stood forward at the head of that legion of brownskinned men arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow their heads swathed in turbans of every hue he considered the company in grim silence and the company in amazement considered this turbaned giant with the masterful face that was tanned to the colour of mahogany the black forked beard and those singularly light eyes glittering like steel under his black brows  thus a little while in silence then with a sudden gasp lionel tressilian sank back in his tall chair as if bereft of strength  the agate eyes flashed upon him smiling cruelly  i see that you at least i recognize me said sakrelbahr in his deep voice i was assured i could depend upon the eyes of brotherly love to pierce the change that time and stress have wrought in me  sir john was on his feet his lean swarthy face flushing darkly an oath on his lips rosamund sat on as if frozen with horror considering sir oliver with dilating eyes whilst her hands clawed the table before her they too recognized him now and realized that here was no mummery that something sinister was intended sir john could not for a moment doubt but of what that something might be he could form no notion it was the first time that barbary rovers were seen in england that famous raid of theirs upon baltimore in ireland did not take place until some thirty years after this date  sir oliver tressilian killigrew gasped and sir oliver tressilian echoed lord henry goade to add by god  not sir oliver tressilian came the answer but sakrelbahr the scourge of the sea the terror of christendom the desperate corsair your lies cupidity and falseheartedness have fashioned out of a sometime cornish gentleman he embraced them all in his denunciatory gesture behold me here with my seahawks to present a reckoning long overdue  writing now of what his own eyes beheld lord henry tells us how sir john leapt to snatch a weapon from the armoured walls how sakrelbahr barked out a single word in arabic and how at that word a halfdozen of his supple blackamoors sprang upon the knight like greyhounds upon a hare and bore him writhing to the ground  lady henry screamed her husband does not appear to have done anything or else modesty keeps him silent on the score of it rosamund white to the lips continued to look on whilst lionel overcome covered his face with his hands in sheer horror one and all of them expected to see some ghastly deed of blood performed there coldly and callously as the wringing of a capons neck but no such thing took place the corsairs merely turned sir john upon his face dragged his wrists behind him to make them fast and having performed that duty with a speedy silent dexterity they abandoned him  sakrelbahr watched their performance with those grimly smiling eyes of his when it was done he spoke again and pointed to lionel who leapt up in sudden terror with a cry that was entirely inarticulate lithe brown arms encircled him like a legion of snakes powerless he was lifted in the air and borne swiftly away for an instant he found himself held face to face with his turbaned brother into that pallid terrorstricken human mask the renegades eyes stabbed like two daggers then deliberately and after the fashion of the muslim he was become he spat upon it  away he growled and through the press of corsairs that thronged the hall behind him a lane was swiftly opened and lionel was swallowed up lost to the view of those within the room  what murderous deed do you intend cried sir john indomitably he had risen and stood grimly dignified in his bonds  will you murder your own brother as you murdered mine demanded rosamund speaking now for the first time and rising as she spoke a faint flush coming to overspread her pallor she saw him wince she saw the mocking lustful anger perish in his face leaving it vacant for a moment then it became grim again with a fresh resolve her words had altered all the current of his intentions they fixed in him a dull fierce rage they silenced the explanations which he was come to offer and which he scorned to offer here after that taunt  it seems you love thatwhelp that thing that was my brother he said sneering i wonder will you love him still when you come to be better acquainted with him though faith naught would surprise me in a woman and her love yet i am curious to seecurious to see he laughed i have a mind to gratify myself i will not separate younot just yet  he advanced upon her come thou with me lady he commanded and held out his hand  and now lord henry seems to have been stirred to futile action  at that he writes i thrust myself between to shield her thou dog i criedthou shalt be made to suffer  suffer quoth he and mocked me with his deep laugh i have suffered already tis for that reason i am here  and thou shalt suffer again thou pirate out of hell i warned him thou shalt suffer for this outrage as gods my life  shall i so quoth he very calm and sinister and at whose hands i pray you  at mine sir i roared being by now stirred to a great fury  at thine he sneered thoult hunt the hawk of the sea thou thou plump partridge away hinder me not  and he adds that again sir oliver spoke that short arabic command whereupon a dozen blackamoors whirled the queens lieutenant aside and bound him to a chair  face to face stood now sir oliver with rosamundface to face after five long years and he realized that in every moment of that time the certainty had never departed from him of some such future meeting  come lady he bade her sternly  a moment she looked at him with hate and loathing in the clear depths of her deep blue eyes then swiftly as lightning she snatched a knife from the board and drove it at his heart but his hand moved as swiftly to seize her wrist and the knife clattered to the ground its errand unfulfilled  a shuddering sob escaped her then to express at once her horror of her own attempt and of the man who held her that horror mounting until it overpowered her she sank suddenly against him in a swoon  instinctively his arms went round her and a moment he held her thus recalling the last occasion on which she had lain against his breast on an evening five years and more ago under the grey wall of godolphin court above the river what prophet could have told him that when next he so held her the conditions would be these it was all grotesque and incredible like the fantastic dream of some sick mind but it was all true and she was in his arms again  he shifted his grip to her waist heaved her to his mighty shoulder as though she were a sack of grain and swung about his business at arwenack accomplishedindeed more of it accomplished than had been his intent and also something less  away away he cried to his rovers and away they sped as fleetly and silently as they had come no man raising now so much as a voice to hinder them  through the hall and across the courtyard flowed that human tide out into the open and along the crest of the hill it surged then away down the slope towards the beach where their boats awaited them sakrelbahr ran as lightly as though the swooning woman he bore were no more than a cloak he had flung across his shoulder ahead of him went a halfdozen of his fellows carrying his gagged and pinioned brother  once only before they dipped from the heights of arwenack did oliver check he paused to look across the dark shimmering water to the woods that screened the house of penarrow from his view it had been part of his purpose to visit it as we know but the necessity had now been removed and he was conscious of a pang of disappointment of a hunger to look again upon his home but to shift the current of his thoughts just then came two of his officersothmani and ali who had been muttering one with the other as they overtook him othmani set now a hand upon his arm and pointed down towards the twinkling lights of smithick and penycumwick  my lord he cried there will be lads and maidens there should fetch fat prices in the sôkelabeed  no doubt said sakrelbahr scarce heeding him heeding indeed little in this world but his longings to look upon penarrow  why then my lord shall i take fifty truebelievers and make a raid upon them it were an easy task all unsuspicious as they must be of our presence  sakrelbahr came out of his musings othmani said he art a fool the very father of fools else wouldst thou have come to know by now that those who once were of my own race those of the land from which i am sprung are sacred to me here we take no slave but these we have on then in the name of allah  but othmani was not yet silenced and is our perilous voyage across these unknown seas into this far heathen land to be rewarded by no more than just these two captives is that a raid worthy of sakrelbahr  leave sakrelbahr to judge was the curt answer  but reflect my lord there is another who will judge how shall our basha the glorious asadeddin welcome thy return with such poor spoils as these what questions will he set thee and what account shalt thou render him for having imperilled the lives of all these truebelievers upon the seas for so little profit  he shall ask me what he pleases and i shall answer what i please and as allah prompts me on i say  and on they went sakrelbahr conscious now of little but the warmth of that body upon his shoulder and knowing not so tumultuous were his emotions whether it fired him to love or hate  they gained the beach they reached the ship whose very presence had continued unsuspected the breeze was fresh and they stood away at once by sunrise there was no more sign of them than there had been at sunset there was no more clue to the way they had taken than to the way they had come it was as if they had dropped from the skies in the night upon that cornish coast and but for the mark of their swift silent passage but for the absence of rosamund and lionel tressilian the thing must have been accounted no more than a dream of those few who had witnessed it  aboard the carack sakrelbahr bestowed rosamund in the cabin over the quarter taking the precaution to lock the door that led to the sterngallery lionel he ordered to be dropped into a dark hole under the hatchway there to lie and meditate upon the retribution that had overtaken him until such time as his brother should have determined upon his fatefor this was a matter upon which the renegade was still undecided  himself he lay under the stars that night and thought of many things one of these things which plays some part in the story though it is probable that it played but a slight one in his thoughts was begotten of the words othmani had used what indeed would be asads welcome of him on his return if he sailed into algiers with nothing more to show for that long voyage and the imperilling of the lives of two hundred truebelievers than just those two captives whom he intended moreover to retain for himself what capital would not be made out of that circumstance by his enemies in algiers and by asads sicilian wife who hated him with all the bitterness of a hatred that had its roots in the fertile soil of jealousy  this may have spurred him in the cool dawn to a very daring and desperate enterprise which destiny sent his way in the shape of a tallmasted dutchman homeward bound he gave chase for all that he was full conscious that the battle he invited was one of which his corsairs had no experience and one upon which they must have hesitated to venture with another leader than himself but the star of sakrelbahr was a star that never led to aught but victory and their belief in him the very javelin of allah overcame any doubts that may have been begotten of finding themselves upon an unfamiliar craft and on a rolling unfamiliar sea  this fight is given in great detail by my lord henry from the particulars afforded him by jasper leigh but it differs in no great particular from other seafights and it is none of my purpose to surfeit you with such recitals enough to say that it was stern and fierce entailing great loss to both combatants that cannon played little part in it for knowing the quality of his men sakrelbahr made haste to run in and grapple he prevailed of course as he must ever prevail by the very force of his personality and the might of his example he was the first to leap aboard the dutchman clad in mail and whirling his great scimitar and his men poured after him shouting his name and that of allah in a breath  such was ever his fury in an engagement that it infected and inspired his followers it did so now and the shrewd dutchmen came to perceive that this heathen horde was as a body to which he supplied the brain and soul they attacked him fiercely in groups intent at all costs upon cutting him down convinced almost by instinct that were he felled the victory would easily be theirs and in the end they succeeded a dutch pike broke some links of his mail and dealt him a flesh wound which went unheeded by him in his fury a dutch rapier found the breach thus made in his defences and went through it to stretch him bleeding upon the deck yet he staggered up knowing as full as did they that if he succumbed then all was lost armed now with a short axe which he had found under his hand when he went down he hacked a way to the bulwarks set his back against the timbers and hoarse of voice ghastly of face spattered with the blood of his wound he urged on his men until the victory was theirsand this was fortunately soon and then as if he had been sustained by no more than the very force of his will he sank down in a heap among the dead and wounded huddled against the vessels bulwarks  griefstricken his corsairs bore him back aboard the carack were he to die then was their victory a barren one indeed they laid him on a couch prepared for him amidships on the main deck where the vessels pitching was least discomfiting a moorish surgeon came to tend him and pronounced his hurt a grievous one but not so grievous as to close the gates of hope  this pronouncement gave the corsairs all the assurance they required it could not be that the gardener could already pluck so fragrant a fruit from allahs garden the pitiful must spare sakrelbahr to continue the glory of islam  yet they were come to the straits of gibraltar before his fever abated and he recovered complete consciousness to learn of the final issue of that hazardous fight into which he had led those children of the prophet  the dutchman othmani informed him was following in their wake with ali and some others aboard her steering ever in the wake of the carack which continued to be navigated by the nasrani dog jasper leigh when sakrelbahr learnt the value of the capture when he was informed that in addition to a hundred ablebodied men under the hatches to be sold as slaves in the sôkelabeed there was a cargo of gold and silver pearls amber spices and ivory and such lesser matters as gorgeous silken fabrics rich beyond anything that had ever been seen upon the seas at any one time he felt that the blood he had shed had not been wasted  let him sail safely into algiers with these two ships both captured in the name of allah and his prophet one of them an argosy so richly fraught a floating treasurehouse and he need have little fear of what his enemies and the crafty evil sicilian woman might have wrought against him in his absence  then he made inquiry touching his two english captives to be informed that othmani had taken charge of them and that he had continued the treatment meted out to them by sakrelbahr himself when first they were brought aboard  he was satisfied and fell into a gentle healing sleep whilst on the decks above his followers rendered thanks to allah the pitying the pitiful the master of the day of judgment who alone is allwise allknowing     chapter v the lion of the faith   asadeddin the lion of the faith basha of algiers walked in the evening cool in the orchard of the kasbah upon the heights above the city and at his side stepping daintily came fenzileh his wife the first lady of his hareem whom eighteen years ago he had carried off in his mighty arms from that little whitewashed village above the straits of messina which his followers had raided  she had been a lissom maid of sixteen in those faroff days the child of humble peasantfolk and she had gone uncomplaining to the arms of her swarthy ravisher today at thirtyfour she was still beautiful more beautiful indeed than when first she had fired the passion of asadreisas he then was one of the captains of the famous alibasha there were streaks of red in her heavy black tresses her skin was of a soft pearliness that seemed translucent her eyes were large of a goldenbrown agleam with sombre fires her lips were full and sensuous she was tall and of a shape that in europe would have been accounted perfect which is to say that she was a thought too slender for oriental taste she moved along beside her lord with a sinuous languorous grace gently stirring her fan of ostrich plumes she was unveiled indeed it was her immodest habit to go naked of face more often than was seemly which is but the least of the many undesirable infidel ways which had survived her induction into the faith of islama necessary step before asad who was devout to the point of bigotry would consent to make her his wife he had found her such a wife as it is certain he could never have procured at home a woman who not content to be his toy the plaything of his idle hour insinuated herself into affairs demanded and obtained his confidences and exerted over him much the same influence as the wife of a european prince might exert over her consort in the years during which he had lain under the spell of her ripening beauty he had accepted the situation willingly enough later when he would have curtailed her interferences it was too late she had taken a firm grip of the reins and asad was in no better case than many a european husbandan anomalous and outrageous condition this for a basha of the prophets house it was also a dangerous one for fenzileh for should the burden of her at any time become too heavy for her lord there was a short and easy way by which he could be rid of it do not suppose her so foolish as not to have realized thisshe realized it fully but her sicilian spirit was daring to the point of recklessness her very dauntlessness which had enabled her to seize a control so unprecedented in a muslim wife urged her to maintain it in the face of all risks  dauntless was she now as she paced there in the cool of the orchard under the pink and white petals of the apricots the flaming scarlet of pomegranate blossoms and through orangegroves where the golden fruit glowed and amid foliage of sombre green she was at her eternal work of poisoning the mind of her lord against sakrelbahr and in her maternal jealousy she braved the dangers of such an undertaking fully aware of how dear to the heart of asadeddin was that absent renegade corsair it was this very affection of the bashas for his lieutenant that was the fomenter of her own hate of sakrelbahr for it was an affection that transcended asads love for his own son and hers and it led to the common rumour that for sakrelbahr was reserved the high destiny of succeeding asad in the bashalik  i tell thee thourt abused by him o source of my life  i hear thee answered asad sourly and were thine own hearing less infirm woman thou wouldst have heard me answer thee that thy words weigh for naught with me against his deeds words may be but a mask upon our thoughts deeds are ever the expression of them bear thou that in mind o fenzileh  do i not bear in mind thine every word o fount of wisdom she protested and left him as she often did in doubt whether she fawned or sneered and it is his deeds i would have speak for him not indeed my poor words and still less his own  then by the head of allah let those same deeds speak and be thou silent  the harsh tone of his reproof and the scowl upon his haughty face gave her pause for a moment he turned about  come he said soon it will be the hour of prayer and he paced back towards the yellow huddle of walls of the kasbah that overtopped the green of that fragrant place  he was a tall gaunt man stooping slightly at the shoulders under the burden of his years but his eagle face was masterful and some lingering embers of his youth still glowed in his dark eyes thoughtfully with a jewelled hand he stroked his long white beard with the other he leaned upon her soft plump arm more from habit than for support for he was full vigorous still  high in the blue overhead a lark burst suddenly into song and from the depths of the orchard came a gentle murmur of doves as if returning thanks for the lessening of the great heat now that the sun was sinking rapidly towards the worlds edge and the shadows were lengthening  came fenzilehs voice again more musical than either yet laden with words of evil poison wrapped in honey  o my dear lord thourt angered with me now woe me that never may i counsel thee for thine own glory as my heart prompts me but i must earn thy coldness  abuse not him i love said the basha shortly i have told thee so full oft already  she nestled closer to him and her voice grew softer more akin to the amorous cooing of the doves and do i not love thee o master of my soul is there in all the world a heart more faithful to thee than mine is not thy life my life have not my days been all devoted to the perfecting of thine happiness and wilt thou then frown upon me if i fear for thee at the hands of an intruder of yesterday  fear for me he echoed and laughed jeeringly what shouldst thou fear for me from sakrelbahr  what all believers must ever fear from one who is no true muslim from one who makes a mock and travesty of the true faith that he may gain advancement  the basha checked in his stride and turned upon her angrily  may thy tongue rot thou mother of lies  i am as the dust beneath thy feet o my sweet lord yet am i not what thine heedless anger calls me  heedless quoth he not heedless but righteous to hear one whom the prophet guards who is the very javelin of islam against the breast of the unbeliever who carries the scourge of allah against the infidel frankish pigs so maligned by thee no more i say lest i bid thee make good thy words and pay the liars price if thou shouldst fail  and should i fear the test she countered nothing daunted i tell thee o father of marzak that i should hail it gladly why hear me now thou settest store by deeds not words tell me then is it the deed of a truebeliever to waste substance upon infidel slaves to purchase them that he may set them free  asad moved on in silence that erstwhile habit of sakrelbahrs was one not easy to condone it had occasioned him his moments of uneasiness and more than once had he taxed his lieutenant with the practice ever to receive the same answer the answer which he now made to fenzileh for every slave that he so manumitted he brought a dozen into bondage  perforce else would he be called to account twas so much dust he flung into the face of true muslimeen those manumissions prove a lingering fondness for the infidel country whence he springs is there room for that in the heart of a true member of the prophets immortal house hast ever known me languish for the sicilian shore from which in thy might thou wrested me or have i ever besought of thee the life of a single sicilian infidel in all these years that i have lived to serve thee such longings are betrayed i say by such a practice and such longings could have no place in one who had uprooted infidelity from his heart and now this voyage of his beyond the seasrisking a vessel that he captured from the archenemy of islam which is not his to risk but thine in whose name he captured it and together with it he imperils the lives of two hundred truebelievers to what end to bear him overseas perchance that he may look again upon the unhallowed land that gave him birth so biskaine reported and what if he should founder on the way  thou at least wouldst be content thou fount of malice growled asad  call me harsh names o sun that warms me am i not thine to use and abuse at thy sweet pleasure pour salt upon the heart thou woundest since it is thy hand ill never murmur a complaint but heed meheed my words or since words are of no account with thee then heed his deeds which i am drawing to thy tardy notice heed them i say as my love bids me even though thou shouldst give me to be whipped or slain for my temerity  woman thy tongue is like the clapper of a bell with the devil swinging from the rope what else dost thou impute  naught else since thou dost but mock me withdrawing thy love from thy fond slave  the praise to allah then said he come it is the hour of prayer  but he praised allah too soon womanlike though she protested she had done she had scarce begun as yet  there is thy son o father of marzak  there is o mother of marzak  and a mans son should be the partner of his soul yet is marzak passed over for this foreign upstart yet does this nasrani of yesterday hold the place in thy heart and at thy side that should be marzaks  could marzak fill that place he asked could that beardless boy lead men as sakrelbahr leads them or wield the scimitar against the foes of islam and increase as sakrelbahr increases the glory of the prophets holy law upon the earth  if sakrelbahr does this he does it by thy favour o my lord and so might marzak young though he be sakrelbahr is but what thou hast made himno more no less  there art thou wrong indeed o mother of error sakrelbahr is what allah hath made him he is what allah wills he shall become what allah wills hast yet to learn that allah has bound the fate of each man about his neck  and then a golden glory suffused the deep sapphire of the sky heralding the setting of the sun and made an end of that altercation conducted by her with a daring as singular as the patience that had endured it he quickened his steps in the direction of the courtyard that golden glow paled as swiftly as it had spread and night fell as suddenly as if a curtain had been dropped  in the purple gloom that followed the white cloisters of the courtyard glowed with a faintly luminous pearliness dark forms of slaves stirred as asad entered from the garden followed by fenzileh her head now veiled in a thin blue silken gauze she flashed across the quadrangle and vanished through one of the archways even as the distant voice of a mueddin broke plaintively upon the brooding stillness reciting the shehad  la illaha illa allah wa muhammad er rasool allah  a slave spread a carpet a second held a great silver bowl into which a third poured water the basha having washed turned his face towards mecca and testified to the unity of allah the compassionate the merciful king of the day of judgment whilst the cry of the mueddin went echoing over the city from minaret to minaret  as he rose from his devotions there came a quick sound of steps without and a sharp summons turkish janissaries of the bashas guard invisible almost in their flowing black garments moved to answer that summons and challenge those who came  from the dark vaulted entrance of the courtyard leapt a gleam of lanterns containing tiny clay lamps in which burned a wick that was nourished by mutton fat asad waiting to learn who came halted at the foot of the white glistening steps whilst from doors and lattices of the palace flooded light to suffuse the courtyard and set the marbles shimmering  a dozen nubian javelinmen advanced then ranged themselves aside whilst into the light stepped the imposing gorgeously robed figure of asads wazeer tsamanni after him came another figure in mail that clanked faintly and glimmered as he moved  peace and the prophets blessings upon thee o mighty asad was the wazeers greeting  and peace upon thee tsamanni was the answer art the bearer of news  of great and glorious tidings o exalted one sakrelbahr is returned  the praise to him exclaimed the basha with uplifted hands and there was no mistaking the thrill of his voice  there fell a soft step behind him and a shadow from the doorway he turned a graceful stripling in turban and caftan of cloth of gold salaamed to him from the topmast step and as he came upright and the light of the lanterns fell full upon his face the astonishingly white fairness of it was revealeda womans face it might have been so softly rounded was it in its beardlessness  asad smiled wrily in his white beard guessing that the boy had been sent by his everwatchful mother to learn who came and what the tidings that they bore  thou hast heard marzak he said sakrelbahr is returned  victoriously i hope the lad lied glibly  victorious beyond aught that was ever known replied tsamanni he sailed at sunset into the harbour his company aboard two mighty frankish ships which are but the lesser part of the great spoil he brings  allah is great was the bashas glad welcome of this answer to those insidious promptings of his sicilian wife why does he not come in person with his news  his duty keeps him yet awhile aboard my lord replied the wazeer but he hath sent his kayia othmani here to tell the tale of it  thrice welcome be thou othmani he beat his hands together whereat slaves placed cushions for him upon the ground he sat and beckoned marzak to his side and now thy tale  and othmani standing forth related how they had voyaged to distant england in the ship that sakrelbahr had captured through seas that no corsair yet had ever crossed and how on their return they had engaged a dutchman that was their superior in strength and numbers how none the less sakrelbahr had wrested victory by the help of allah his protector how he had been dealt a wound that must have slain any but one miraculously preserved for the greater glory of islam and of the surpassing wealth of the booty which at dawn tomorrow should be laid at asads feet for his division of it     chapter vi the convert   that tale of othmanis being borne anon to fenzileh by her son was gall and wormwood to her jealous soul evil enough to know that sakrelbahr was returned in spite of the fervent prayers for his foundering which she had addressed both to the god of her forefathers and to the god of her adoption but that he should have returned in triumph bringing with him heavy spoils that must exalt him further in the affection of asad and the esteem of the people was bitterness indeed it left her mute and stricken bereft even of the power to curse him  anon when her mind recovered from the shock she turned it to the consideration of what at first had seemed a trivial detail in othmanis tale as reported by marzak  it is most singularly odd that he should have undertaken that long voyage to england to wrest thence just those two captives that being there he should not have raided in true corsair fashion and packed his ship with slaves most singularly odd  they were alone behind the green lattices through which filtered the perfumes of the garden and the throbbing of a nightingales voice laden with the tale of its love for the rose fenzileh reclined upon a divan that was spread with silken turkey carpets and one of her goldembroidered slippers had dropped from her hennastained toes her lovely arms were raised to support her head and she stared up at the lamp of many colours that hung from the fretted ceiling  marzak paced the length of the chamber back and forth and there was silence save for the soft swish of his slippers along the floor  well she asked him impatiently at last does it not seem odd to thee  odd indeed o my mother the youth replied coming to a halt before her  and canst think of naught that was the cause of it  the cause of it quoth he his lovely young face so closely modelled upon her own looking blank and vacant  ay the cause of it she cried impatiently canst do naught but stare am i the mother of a fool wilt thou simper and gape and trifle away thy days whilst that dogdescended frank tramples thee underfoot using thee but as a steppingstone to the power that should be thine own and that be so marzak i would thou hadst been strangled in my womb  he recoiled before the italian fury of her was dully resentful even suspecting that in such words from a woman were she twenty times his mother there was something dishonouring to his manhood  what can i do he cried  dost ask me art thou not a man to think and act i tell thee that misbegotten son of a christian and a jew will trample thee in the dust he is greedy as the locust wily as the serpent and ferocious as the panther by allah i would i had never borne a son rather might men point at me the finger of scorn and call me mother of the wind than that i should have brought forth a man who knows not how to be a man  show me the way he cried set me a task tell me what to do and thou shalt not find me lacking o my mother until then spare me these insults or i come no more to thee  at this threat that strange woman heaved herself up from her soft couch she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck set her cheek against his own not eighteen years in the bashas hareem had stifled the european mother in her the passionate sicilian woman fierce as a tiger in her maternal love  o my child my lovely boy she almost sobbed it is my fear for thee that makes me harsh if i am angry it is but my love that speaks my rage for thee to see another come usurping the place beside thy father that should be thine ah but we will prevail sweet son of mine i shall find a way to return that foreign offal to the dungheap whence it sprang trust me o marzak sh thy father comes away leave me alone with him  she was wise in that for she knew that alone asad was more easily controlled by her since the pride was absent which must compel him to turn and rend her did she speak so before others marzak vanished behind the screen of fretted sandalwood that masked one doorway even as asad loomed in the other  he came forward smiling his slender brown fingers combing his long beard his white djellaba trailing behind him along the ground  thou hast heard not a doubt o fenzileh said he art thou answered enough  she sank down again upon her cushions and idly considered herself in a steel mirror set in silver  answered she echoed lazily with infinite scorn and a hint of rippling contemptuous laughter running through the word answered indeed sakrelbahr risks the lives of two hundred children of islam and a ship that being taken was become the property of the state upon a voyage to england that has no object but the capturing of two slavestwo slaves when had his purpose been sincere it might have been two hundred  ha and is that all that thou hast heard he asked her mocking in his turn  all that signifies she replied still mirroring herself i heard as a matter of lesser import that on his return meeting fortuitously a frankish ship that chanced to be richly laden he seized it in thy name  fortuitously sayest thou  what else she lowered the mirror and her bold insolent eyes met his own quite fearlessly thoult not tell me that it was any part of his design when he went forth  he frowned his head sank slowly in thought observing the advantage gained she thrust it home it was a lucky wind that blew that dutchman into his path and luckier still her being so richly fraught that he may dazzle thine eyes with the sight of gold and gems and so blind thee to the real purpose of his voyage  its real purpose he asked dully what was its real purpose she smiled a smile of infinite knowledge to hide her utter ignorance her inability to supply even a reason that should wear an air of truth  dost ask me o perspicuous asad are not thine eyes as sharp thy wits as keen at least as mine that what is clear to me should be hidden from thee or hath this sakrelbahr bewitched thee with enchantments of babyl  he strode to her and caught her wrist in a cruelly rough grip of his sinewy old hand  his purpose thou jade pour out the foulness of thy mind speak  she sat up flushed and defiant  i will not speak said she  thou wilt not now by the head of allah dost dare to stand before my face and defy me thy lord ill have thee whipped fenzileh i have been too tender of thee these many yearsso tender that thou hast forgot the rods that await the disobedient wife speak then ere thy flesh is bruised or speak thereafter at thy pleasure  i will not she repeated though i be flung to the hooks not another word will i say of sakrelbahr shall i unveil the truth to be spurned and scorned and dubbed a liar and the mother of lies then abruptly changing she fell to weeping o source of my life she cried to him how cruelly unjust to me thou art she was grovelling now a thing of supplest grace her lovely arms entwining his knees when my love for thee drives me to utter what i see i earn but thy anger which is more than i can endure i swoon beneath the weight of it  he flung her off impatiently what a weariness is a womans tongue he cried and stalked out again convinced from past experiences that did he linger he would be whelmed in a torrent of words  but her poison was shrewdly administered and slowly did its work it abode in his mind to torture him with the doubts that were its very essence no reason however well founded that she might have urged for sakrelbahrs strange conduct could have been half so insidious as her suggestion that there was a reason it gave him something vague and intangible to consider something that he could not repel since it had no substance he could grapple with impatiently he awaited the morning and the coming of sakrelbahr himself but he no longer awaited it with the ardent wholehearted eagerness as of a father awaiting the coming of a beloved son  sakrelbahr himself paced the poop deck of the carack and watched the lights perish one by one in the little town that straggled up the hillside before him the moon came up and bathed it in a white hard light throwing sharp inky shadows of rustling date palm and spearlike minaret and flinging shafts of silver athwart the peaceful bay  his wound was healed and he was fully himself once more two days ago he had come on deck for the first time since the fight with the dutchman and he had spent there the greater portion of the time since then once only had he visited his captives he had risen from his couch to repair straight to the cabin in the poop where rosamund was confined he had found her pale and very wistful but with her courage entirely unbroken the godolphins were a stiffnecked race and rosamund bore in her frail body the spirit of a man she looked up when he entered started a little in surprise to see him at last for it was the first time he stood before her since he had carried her off from arwenack some four weeks ago then she had averted her eyes and sat there elbows on the table as if carved of wood as if blind to his presence and deaf to his words  to the expressions of regretand they were sincere for already he repented him his unpremeditated act so far as she was concernedshe returned no slightest answer gave no sign indeed that she heard a word of it baffled he stood gnawing his lip a moment and gradually unreasonably perhaps anger welled up from his heart he turned and went out again next he had visited his brother to consider in silence a moment the haggard wildeyed unshorn wretch who shrank and cowered before him in the consciousness of guilt at last he returned to the deck and there as i have said he spent the greater portion of the last three days of that strange voyage reclining for the most part in the sun and gathering strength from its ardour  tonight as he paced under the moon a stealthy shadow crept up the companion to call him gently by his english name  sir oliver  he started as if a ghost had suddenly leapt up to greet him it was jasper leigh who hailed him thus  come up he said and when the fellow stood before him on the poopi have told you already that here is no sir oliver i am oliverreis or sakrelbahr as you please one of the faithful of the prophets house and now what is your will  have i not served you faithfully and well quoth captain leigh  who has denied it  none but neither has any acknowledged it when you lay wounded below it had been an easy thing for me to ha played the traitor i might ha sailed these ships into the mouth of tagus i might so by god  yould have been carved in pieces on the spot said sakrelbahr  i might have hugged the land and run the risk of capture and then claimed my liberation from captivity  and found yourself back on the galleys of his catholic majesty but there i grant that you have dealt loyally by me you have kept your part of the bond i shall keep mine never doubt it  i do not but your part of the bond was to send me home again  well  the hell of it is that i know not where to find a home i know not where home may be after all these years if ye send me forth i shall become a wanderer of no account  what else am i to do with you  faith now i am as full weary of christians and christendom as you was yourself when the muslims took the galley on which you toiled i am a man of parts sir olsakrelbahr no better navigator ever sailed a ship from an english port and i ha seen a mort o fighting and know the art of it upon the sea can ye make naught of me here  you would become a renegade like me his tone was bitter  i ha been thinking that renegade is a word that depends upon which side youre on id prefer to say that ive a wish to be converted to the faith of mahound  converted to the faith of piracy and plunder and robbery upon the seas is what you mean said sakrelbahr  nay now to that i should need no converting for all that i were afore captain leigh admitted frankly i ask but to sail under another flag than the jolly roger  youll need to abjure strong drink said sakrelbahr  there be compensations said master leigh  sakrelbahr considered the rogues appeal smote a responsive chord in his heart it would be good to have a man of his own race beside him even though it were but such a rascal as this  be it as you will he said at last you deserve to be hanged in spite of what promises i made you but no matter for that so that you become a muslim i will take you to serve beside me one of my own lieutenants to begin with and so long as you are loyal to me jasper all will be well but at the first sign of faithlessness a rope and the yardarm my friend and an airy dance into hell for you  the rascally skipper stooped in his emotion caught up sakrelbahrs hand and bore it to his lips it is agreed he said ye have shown me mercy who have little deserved it from you never fear for my loyalty my life belongs to you and worthless thing though it may be ye may do with it as ye please  despite himself sakrelbahr tightened his grip upon the rogues hand and jasper shuffled off and down the companion again touched to the heart for once in his rough villainous life by a clemency that he knew to be undeserved but which he swore should be deserved ere all was done     chapter vii marzakbenasad   it took no less than forty camels to convey the cargo of that dutch argosy from the mole to the kasbah and the processioncarefully marshalled by sakrelbahr who knew the value of such pageants to impress the mobwas such as never yet had been seen in the narrow streets of algiers upon the return of any corsair it was full worthy of the greatest muslim conqueror that sailed the seas of one who not content to keep to the tideless mediterranean as had hitherto been the rule of his kind had ventured forth upon the wider ocean  ahead marched a hundred of his rovers in their short caftans of every conceivable colour their waists swathed in gaudy scarves some of which supported a very arsenal of assorted cutlery many wore body armour of mail and the gleaming spike of a casque thrust up above their turbans after them dejected and in chains came the five score prisoners taken aboard the dutchman urged along by the whips of the corsairs who flanked them then marched another regiment of corsairs and after these the long line of stately sneering camels shuffling cumbrously along and led by shouting saharowis after them followed yet more corsairs and then mounted on a white arab jennet his head swathed in a turban of cloth of gold came sakrelbahr in the narrower streets with their white and yellow washed houses which presented blank windowless walls broken here and there by no more than a slit to admit light and air the spectators huddled themselves fearfully into doorways to avoid being crushed to death by the camels whose burdens bulging on either side entirely filled those narrow ways but the more open spaces such as the strand on either side of the mole the square before the sôk and the approaches of asads fortress were thronged with a motley roaring crowd there were stately moors in flowing robes cheek by jowl with halfnaked blacks from the sus and the draa lean enduring arabs in their spotless white djellabas rubbed shoulders with berbers from the highlands in black camelhair cloaks there were levantine turks and jewish refugees from spain ostentatiously dressed in european garments tolerated there because bound to the moor by ties of common suffering and common exile from that land that once had been their own  under the glaring african sun this amazing crowd stood assembled to welcome sakrelbahr and welcome him it did with such vocal thunder that an echo of it from the mole reached the very kasbah on the hilltop to herald his approach  by the time however that he reached the fortress his procession had dwindled by more than half at the sôk his forces had divided and his corsairs headed by othmani had marched the captives away to the bagnioor banyard as my lord henry calls itwhilst the camels had continued up the hill under the great gateway of the kasbah they padded into the vast courtyard to be ranged along two sides of it by their saharowi drivers and there brought clumsily to their knees after them followed but some two score corsairs as a guard of honour to their leader they took their stand upon either side of the gateway after profoundly salaaming to asadeddin the basha sat in the shade of an awning enthroned upon a divan attended by his wazeer tsamanni and by marzak and guarded by a halfdozen janissaries whose sable garments made an effective background to the green and gold of his jewelled robes in his white turban glowed an emerald crescent  the bashas countenance was dark and brooding as he watched the advent of that line of burdened camels his thoughts were still labouring with the doubt of sakrelbahr which fenzilehs crafty speech and craftier reticence had planted in them but at sight of the corsair leader himself his countenance cleared suddenly his eyes sparkled and he rose to his feet to welcome him as a father might welcome a son who had been through perils on a service dear to both  sakrelbahr entered the courtyard on foot having dismounted at the gate tall and imposing with his head high and his forked beard thrusting forward he stalked with great dignity to the foot of the divan followed by ali and a mahoganyfaced fellow turbaned and redbearded in whom it needed more than a glance to recognize the rascally jasper leigh now in all the panoply of your complete renegado  sakrelbahr went down upon his knees and prostrated himself solemnly before his prince  the blessing of allah and his peace upon thee my lord was his greeting  and asad stooping to lift that splendid figure in his arms gave him a welcome that caused the spying fenzileh to clench her teeth behind the fretted lattice that concealed her  the praise to allah and to our lord mahomet that thou art returned and in health my son already hath my old heart been gladdened by the news of thy victories in the service of the faith  then followed the display of all those riches wrested from the dutch and greatly though asads expectations had been fed already by othmani the sight now spread before his eyes by far exceeded all those expectations  in the end all was dismissed to the treasury and tsamanni was bidden to go cast up the account of it and mark the share that fell to the portion of those concernedfor in these ventures all were partners from the basha himself who represented the state down to the meanest corsair who had manned the victorious vessels of the faith and each had his share of the booty greater or less according to his rank one twentieth of the total falling to sakrelbahr himself  in the courtyard were left none but asad marzak and the janissaries and sakrelbahr with ali and jasper it was then that sakrelbahr presented his new officer to the bashal as one upon whom the grace of allah had descended a great fighter and a skilled seaman who had offered up his talents and his life to the service of islam who had been accepted by sakrelbahr and stood now before asad to be confirmed in his office  marzak interposed petulantly to exclaim that already were there too many erstwhile nasrani dogs in the ranks of the soldiers of the faith and that it was unwise to increase their number and presumptuous in sakrelbahr to take so much upon himself  sakrelbahr measured him with an eye in which scorn and surprise were nicely blended  dost say that it is presumptuous to win a convert to the banner of our lord mahomet quoth he go read the most perspicuous book and see what is there enjoined as a duty upon every truebeliever and bethink thee o son of asad that when thou dost in thy little wisdom cast scorn upon those whom allah has blessed and led from the night wherein they dwelt into the bright noontide of faith thou dost cast scorn upon me and upon thine own mother which is but a little matter and thou dost blaspheme the blessed name of allah which is to tread the ways that lead unto the pit  angry but defeated and silenced marzak fell back a step and stood biting his lip and glowering upon the corsair what time asad nodded his head and smiled approval  verily art thou full learned in the true belief sakrelbahr he said thou art the very father of wisdom as of valour and thereupon he gave welcome to master leigh whom he hailed to the ranks of the faithful under the designation of jasperreis  that done the renegade and ali were both dismissed as were also the janissaries who quitting their position behind asad went to take their stand on guard at the gateway then the basha beat his hands together and to the slaves who came in answer to his summons he gave orders to set food and he bade sakrelbahr to come sit beside him on the divan  water was brought that they might wash that done the slaves placed before them a savoury stew of meat and eggs with olives limes and spices  asad broke bread with a reverently pronounced bismillah and dipped his fingers into the earthenware bowl leading the way for sakrelbahr and marzak and as they ate he invited the corsair himself to recite the tale of his adventure  when he had done so and again asad had praised him in high and loving terms marzak set him a question  was it to obtain just these two english slaves that thou didst undertake this perilous voyage to that distant land  that was but a part of my design was the calm reply i went to rove the seas in the prophets service as the result of my voyage gives proof  thou didst not know that this dutch argosy would cross thy path said marzak in the very words his mother had prompted him  did i not quoth sakrelbahr and he smiled confidently so confidently that asad scarce needed to hear the words that so cunningly gave the lie to the innuendo had i no trust in allah the allwise the allknowing  well answered by the koran asad approved him heartily the more heartily since it rebutted insinuations which he desired above all to hear rebutted  but marzak did not yet own himself defeated he had been soundly schooled by his guileful sicilian mother  yet there is something in all this i do not understand he murmured with false gentleness  all things are possible to allah said sakrelbahr in tones of incredulity as if he suggestednot without a suspicion of ironythat it was incredible there should be anything in all the world that could elude the penetration of marzak  the youth bowed to him in acknowledgment tell me o mighty sakrelbahr he begged how it came to pass that having reached those distant shores thou wert content to take thence but two poor slaves since with thy followers and the favour of the allseeing thou might easily have taken fifty times that number and he looked ingenuously into the corsairs swarthy rugged face whilst asad frowned thoughtfully for the thought was one that had occurred to him already  it became necessary that sakrelbahr should lie to clear himself here no highsounding phrase of faith would answer and explanation was unavoidable and he was conscious that he could not afford one that did not go a little lame  why as to that said he these prisoners were wrested from the first house upon which we came and their capture occasioned some alarm moreover it was nighttime when we landed and i dared not adventure the lives of my followers by taking them further from the ship and attacking a village which might have risen to cut off our good retreat  the frown remained stamped upon the brow of asad as marzak slyly observed  yet othmani said he urged thee to fall upon a slumbering village all unconscious of thy presence and thou didst refuse  asad looked up sharply at that and sakrelbahr realized with a tightening about the heart something of the undercurrents at work against him and all the pains that had been taken to glean information that might be used to his undoing  is it so demanded asad looking from his son to his lieutenant with that lowering look that rendered his face evil and cruel  sakrelbahr took a high tone he met asads glance with an eye of challenge  and if it were so my lord he demanded  i asked thee is it so  ay but knowing thy wisdom i disbelieved my ears said sakrelbahr shall it signify what othmani may have said do i take my orders or am i to be guided by othmani if so best set othmani in my place give him the command and the responsibility for the lives of the faithful who fight beside him he ended with an indignant snort  thou art overquick to anger asad reproved him scowling still  and by the head of allah who will deny my right to it am i to conduct such an enterprise as this from which i am returned laden with spoils that might well be the fruits of a years raiding to be questioned by a beardless stripling as to why i was not guided by othmani  he heaved himself up and stood towering there in the intensity of a passion that was entirely simulated he must bluster here and crush down suspicion with whorling periods and broad fierce gesture  to what should othmani have guided me he demanded scornfully could he have guided me to more than i have this day laid at thy feet what i have done speaks eloquently with its own voice what he would have had me do might well have ended in disaster had it so ended would the blame of it have fallen upon othmani nay by allah but upon me and upon me rests then the credit and let none dare question it without better cause  now these were daring words to address to the tyrant asad and still more daring was the tone the light hard eyes aflash and the sweeping gestures of contempt with which they were delivered but of his ascendancy over the basha there was no doubt and here now was proof of it  asad almost cowered before his fury the scowl faded from his face to be replaced by an expression of dismay  nay nay sakrelbahr this tone he cried  sakrelbahr having slammed the door of conciliation in the face of the basha now opened it again he became instantly submissive  forgive it he said blame the devotion of thy servant to thee and to the faith he serves with little reck to life in this very expedition was i wounded nigh unto death the livid scar of it is a dumb witness to my zeal where are thy scars marzak  marzak quailed before the sudden blaze of that question and sakrelbahr laughed softly in contempt  sit asad bade him i have been less than just  thou art the very fount and spring of justice o my lord as this thine admission proves protested the corsair he sat down again folding his legs under him i will confess to you that being come so near to england in that cruise of mine i determined to land and seize one who some years ago did injure me and between whom and me there was a score to settle i exceeded my intentions in that i carried off two prisoners instead of one these prisoners he ran on judging that the moment of reaction in asads mind was entirely favourable to the preferment of the request he had to make are not in the bagnio with the others they are still confined aboard the carack i seized  and why is this quoth asad but without suspicion now  because my lord i have a boon to ask in some reward for the service i have rendered  ask it my son  give me leave to keep these captives for myself  asad considered him frowning again slightly despite himself despite his affection for sakrelbahr and his desire to soothe him now that rankling poison of fenzilehs infusing was at work again in his mind  my leave thou hast said he but not the laws and the law runs that no corsair shall subtract so much as the value of an asper from his booty until the division has been made and his own share allotted him was the grave answer  the law quoth sakrelbahr but thou art the law exalted lord  not so my son the law is above the basha who must himself conform to it so that he be just and worthy of his high office and the law i have recited thee applies even should the corsair raider be the basha himself these slaves of thine must forthwith be sent to the bagnio to join the others that tomorrow all may be sold in the sôk see it done sakrelbahr  the corsair would have renewed his pleadings but that his eye caught the eager white face of marzak and the gleaming expectant eyes looking so hopefully for his ruin he checked and bowed his head with an assumption of indifference  name thou their price then and forthwith will i pay it into thy treasury  but asad shook his head it is not for me to name their price but for the buyers he replied i might set the price too high and that were unjust to thee or too low and that were unjust to others who would acquire them deliver them over to the bagnio  it shall be done said sakrelbahr daring to insist no further and dissembling his chagrin  very soon thereafter he departed upon that errand giving orders however that rosamund and lionel should be kept apart from the other prisoners until the hour of the sale on the morrow when perforce they must take their place with the rest  marzak lingered with his father after oliver had taken his leave and presently they were joined there in the courtyard by fenzilehthis woman who had brought said many the frankish ways of shaitan into algiers     chapter viii mother and son   early on the morrowso early that scarce had the shehad been recitedcame biskaineelborak to the basha he had just landed from a galley which had come upon a spanish fishing boat aboard of which there was a young morisco who was being conducted over seas to algiers the news of which the fellow was the bearer was of such urgency that for twenty hours without intermission the slaves had toiled at the oars of biskaines vesselthe capitana of his fleetto bring her swiftly home  the morisco had a cousina newchristian like himself and like himself it would appear still a muslim at heartwho was employed in the spanish treasury at malaga this man had knowledge that a galley was fitting out for sea to convey to naples the gold destined for the pay of the spanish troops in garrison there through parsimony this treasuregalley was to be afforded no escort but was under orders to hug the coast of europe where she should be safe from all piratical surprise it was judged that she would be ready to put to sea in a week and the morisco had set out at once to bring word of it to his algerine brethren that they might intercept and capture her  asad thanked the young morisco for his news bade him be housed and cared for and promised him a handsome share of the plunder should the treasuregalley be captured that done he sent for sakrelbahr whilst marzak who had been present at the interview went with the tale of it to his mother and beheld her fling into a passion when he added that it was sakrelbahr had been summoned that he might be entrusted with this fresh expedition thus proving that all her crafty innuendoes and insistent warnings had been so much wasted labour  with marzak following at her heels she swept like a fury into the darkened room where asad took his ease  what is this i hear o my lord she cried in tone and manner more the european shrew than the submissive eastern slave is sakrelbahr to go upon this expedition against the treasuregalley of spain  reclining on his divan he looked her up and down with a languid eye dost know of any better fitted to succeed quoth he  i know of one whom it is my lords duty to prefer to that foreign adventurer one who is entirely faithful and entirely to be trusted one who does not attempt to retain for himself a portion of the booty garnered in the name of islam  bah said asad wilt thou talk forever of those two slaves and who may be this paragon of thine  marzak she answered fiercely flinging out an arm to drag forward her son is he to waste his youth here in softness and idleness but yesternight that ribald mocked him with his lack of scars shall he take scars in the orchard of the kasbah here is he to be content with those that come from the scratch of a bramble or is he to learn to be a fighter and leader of the children of the faith that himself he may follow in the path his father trod  whether he so follows said asad is as the sultan of istambul the sublime portal shall decree we are but his vicegerents here  but shall the grand sultan appoint him to succeed thee if thou hast not equipped him so to do i cry shame on thee o father of marzakl for that thou art lacking in due pride in thine own son  may allah give me patience with thee have i not said that he is still over young  at his age thyself thou wert upon the seas serving with the great ochiali  at his age i was by the favour of allah taller and stronger than is he i cherish him too dearly to let him go forth and perchance be lost to me before his strength is full grown  look at him she commanded he is a man asad and such a son as another might take pride in is it not time he girt a scimitar about his waist and trod the poop of one of thy galleys  indeed indeed o my father begged marzak himself  what barked the old moor and is it so and wouldst thou go forth then against the spaniard what knowledge hast thou that shall equip thee for such a task  what can his knowledge be since his father has never been concerned to school him returned fenzileh dost thou sneer at shortcomings that are the natural fruits of thine own omissions  i will be patient with thee said asad showing every sign of losing patience i will ask thee only if in thy judgment he is in case to win a victory for islam answer me straightly now  straightly i answer thee that he is not and as straightly i tell thee that it is full time he were thy duty is to let him go upon this expedition that he may learn the trade that lies before him  asad considered a moment then be it so he answered slowly shalt set forth then with sakrelbahr my son  with sakrelbahr cried fenzilch aghast  i could find him no better preceptor  shall thy son go forth as the servant of another  as the pupil asad amended what else  were i a man o fountain of my soul said she and had i a son none but myself should be his preceptor i should so mould and fashion him that he should be another me that o my dear lord is thy duty to marzak entrust not his training to another and to one whom despite thy love for him i cannot trust go forth thyself upon this expedition with marzak here for thy kayia  asad frowned i grow too old he said i have not been upon the seas these two years past who can say that i may not have lost the art of victory no no he shook his head and his face grew overcast and softened by wistfulness sakrelbahr commands this time and if marzak goes he goes with him  my lord she began then checked a nubian had entered to announce that sakrelbahr was come and was awaiting the orders of his lord in the courtyard asad rose instantly and for all that fenzileh greatly daring as ever would still have detained him he shook her off impatiently and went out  she watched his departure with anger in those dark lovely eyes of hers an anger that went near to filming them in tears and after he had passed out into the glaring sunshine beyond the door a silence dwelt in the cool darkened chambera silence disturbed only by distant trills of silvery laughter from the lesser women of the bashas house the sound jarred her taut nerves she moved with an oath and beat her hands together to answer her came a negress lithe and muscular as a wrestler and naked to the waist the slave ring in her ear was of massive gold  bid them make an end of that screeching she snapped to vent some of her fierce petulance tell them i will have the rods to them if they again disturb me  the negress went out and silence followed for those other lesser ladies of the bashas hareem were more obedient to the commands of fenzileh than to those of the basha himself  then she drew her son to the fretted lattice commanding the courtyard a screen from behind which they could see and hear all that passed out yonder asad was speaking informing sakrelbahr of what he had learnt and what there was to do  how soon canst thou put to sea again he ended  as soon as the service of allah and thyself require was the prompt answer  it is well my son asad laid a hand affectionately upon the corsairs shoulder entirely conquered by this readiness best set out at sunrise tomorrow thoult need so long to make thee ready for the sea  then by thy leave i go forthwith to give orders to prepare replied sakrelbahr for all that he was a little troubled in his mind by this need to depart again so soon  what galleys shalt thou take  to capture one galley of spain my own galeasse no more she will be full equal to such an enterprise and i shall be the better able then to lurk and take covera thing which might well prove impossible with a fleet  aythou art wise in thy daring asad approved him may allah prosper thee upon the voyage  have i thy leave to go  a moment yet there is my son marzak he is approaching manhood and it is time he entered the service of allah and the state it is my desire that he sail as thy lieutenant on this voyage and that thou be his preceptor even as i was thine of old  now here was something that pleased sakrelbahr as little as it pleased marzak knowing the bitter enmity borne him by the son of fenzileh he had every cause to fear trouble if this project of asads were realized  as i was thine of old he answered with crafty wistfulness wilt thou not put to sea with us tomorrow o asad there is none like thee in all islam and what a joy were it not to stand beside thee on the prow as of old when we grapple with the spaniard  asad considered him dost thou too urge this quoth he  have others urged it the mans sharp wits rendered still sharper by his sufferings were cutting deeply and swiftly into this matter they did well but none could have urged it more fervently than i for none knows so well as i the joy of battle against the infidel under thy command and the glory of prevailing in thy sight come then my lord upon this enterprise and be thyself thine own sons preceptor since tis the highest honour thou canst bestow upon him  thoughtfully asad stroked his long white beard his eagle eyes growing narrow thou temptest me by allah  let me do more  nay more thou canst not i am old and worn and i am needed here shall an old lion hunt a young gazelle peace peace the sun has set upon my fighting day let the brood of fighters i have raised up keep that which my arm conquered and maintain my name and the glory of the faith upon the seas he leaned upon sakrelbahrs shoulder and sighed his eyes wistfully dreamy it were a fond adventure in good truth but noi am resolved go thou and take marzak with thee and bring him safely home again  i should not return myself else was the answer but my trust is in the allknowing  upon that he departed dissembling his profound vexation both at the voyage and the company and went to bid othmani make ready his great galeasse equipping it with carronades three hundred slaves to row it and three hundred fighting men  asadeldin returned to that darkened room in the kasbah overlooking the courtyard where fenzileh and marzak still lingered he went to tell them that in compliance with the desires of both marzak should go forth to prove himself upon this expedition  but where he had left impatience he found thinly veiled wrath  o sun that warms me fenzileh greeted him and from long experience he knew that the more endearing were her epithets the more vicious was her mood do then my counsels weigh as naught with thee are they but as the dust upon thy shoes  less said asad provoked out of his habitual indulgence of her licences of speech  that is the truth indeed she cried bowing her head whilst behind her the handsome face of her son was overcast  it is asad agreed at dawn marzak thou settest forth upon the galeasse of sakrelbahr to take the seas under his tutelage and to emulate the skill and valour that have rendered him the stoutest bulwark of islam the very javelin of allah  but marzak felt that in this matter his mother was to be supported whilst his detestation of this adventurer who threatened to usurp the place that should rightly be his own spurred him to mad lengths of daring  when i take the seas with that dogdescended nasrani he answered hoarsely he shall be where rightly he belongsat the rowers bench  how it was a bellow of rage upon the word asad swung to confront his son and his face suddenly inflamed was so cruel and evil in its expression that it terrified that intriguing pair by the beard of the prophet what words are these to me he advanced upon marzak until fenzileh in sudden terror stepped between and faced him like a lioness springing to defend her cub but the basha enraged now by this want of submission in his son enraged both against that son and the mother who he knew had prompted him caught her in his sinewy old hands and flung her furiously aside so that she stumbled and fell in a panting heap amid the cushions of her divan  the curse of allah upon thee he screamed and marzak recoiled before him has this presumptuous hellcat who bore thee taught thee to stand before my face to tell me what thou wilt and wilt not do by the koran too long have i endured her evil foreign ways and now it seems she has taught thee how to tread them after her and how to beard thy very father tomorrow thoult take the sea with sakrelbahr i have said it another word and thoult go aboard his galeasse even as thou saidst should be the case with himat the rowers bench to learn submission under the slave masters whip  terrified marzak stood numb and silent scarcely daring to draw breath never in all his life had he seen his father in a rage so royal yet it seemed to inspire no fear in fenzileh that congenital shrew whose tongue not even the threat of rods or hooks could silence  i shall pray allah to restore sight to thy soul o father of marzak she panted to teach thee to discriminate between those that love thee and the selfseekers that abuse thy trust  how he roared at her art not yet done  nor ever shall be until i am lain dumb in death for having counselled thee out of my great love o light of these poor eyes of mine  maintain this tone he said with concentrated anger and that will soon befall  i care not so that the sleek mask be plucked from the face of that dogdescended sakrelbahr may allah break his bones what of those slaves of histhose two from england o asad i am told that one is a woman tall and of that white beauty which is the gift of eblis to these northerners what is his purpose with herthat he would not show her in the suk as the law prescribes but comes slinking here to beg thee set aside the law for him ha i talk in vain i have shown thee graver things to prove his vile disloyalty and yet thoult fawn upon him whilst thy fangs are bared to thine own son  he advanced upon her stooped caught her by the wrist and heaved her up  his face showed grey under its deep tan his aspect terrified her at last and made an end of her reckless forward courage  he raised his voice to call  ya anta ayoub  she gasped livid in her turn with sudden terror my lord my lord she whimpered stream of my life be not angry what wilt thou do  he smiled evilly do he growled what i should have done ten years ago and more well have the rods to thee and again he called more insistentlyayoub  my lord my lord she gasped in shuddering horror now that at last she found him set upon the thing to which so often she had dared him pity pity she grovelled and embraced his knees in the name of the pitying the pitiful be merciful upon the excesses to which my love for thee may have driven this poor tongue of mine o my sweet lord o father of marzak  her distress her beauty and perhaps more than either her unusual humility and submission may have moved him for even as at that moment ayoubthe sleek and portly eunuch who was her wazeer and chamberlainloomed in the inner doorway salaaming he vanished again upon the instant dismissed by a peremptory wave of the bashas hand  asad looked down upon her sneering that attitude becomes thee best he said continue it in future contemptuously he shook himself free of her grasp turned and stalked majestically out wearing his anger like a royal mantle and leaving behind him two terrorshaken beings who felt as if they had looked over the very edge of death  there was a long silence between them then at long length fenzileh rose and crossed to the meshrabiyahthe latticed windowbox she opened it and took from one of its shelves an earthenware jar placed there so as to receive the slightest breeze from it she poured water into a little cup and drank greedily that she could perform this menial service for herself when a mere clapping of hands would have brought slaves to minister to her need betrayed something of her disordered state of mind  she slammed the inner lattice and turned to marzak and now quoth she  now said the lad  ay what now what are we to do are we to lie crushed under his rage until we are ruined indeed he is bewitched that jackal has enchanted him so that he must deem well done all that is done by him allah guide us here marzak or thoult be trampled into dust by sakrelbahr  marzak hung his head slowly he moved to the divan and flung himself down upon its pillows there he lay prone his hands cupping his chin his heels in the air  what can i do he asked at last  that is what i most desire to know something must be done and soon may his bones rot if he lives thou art destroyed  ay said marzak with sudden vigour and significance if he lives and he sat up whilst we plan and plot and our plans and plots come to naught save to provoke the anger of my father we might be better employed in taking the shorter way  she stood in the middle of the chamber pondering him with gloomy eyes i too have thought of that said she i could hire me men to do the thing for a handful of gold but the risk of it  where would be the risk once he is dead  he might pull us down with him and then what would our profit be in his death thy father would avenge him terribly  if it were craftily done we should not be discovered  not be discovered she echoed and laughed without mirth how young and blind thou art o marzak we should be the first to be suspected i have made no secret of my hate of him and the people do not love me they would urge thy father to do justice even were he himself averse to it which i will not credit would be the case this sakrelbahrmay allah wither himis a god in their eyes bethink thee of the welcome given him what basha returning in triumph was ever greeted by the like these victories that fortune has vouchsafed him have made them account him divinely favoured and protected i tell thee marzak that did thy father die tomorrow sakrelbahr would be proclaimed basha of algiers in his stead and woe betide us then and asadeldin grows old true he does not go forth to fight he clings to life and may last long but if he should not and if sakrelbahr should still walk the earth when thy fathers destiny is fulfilled i dare not think what then will be thy fate and mine  may his grave be defiled growled matzak  his grave said she the difficulty is to dig it for him without hurt to ourselves shaitan protects the dog  may he make his bed in hell said marzak  to curse him will not help us up marzak and consider how the thing is to be done  marzak came to his feet nimble and supple as a greyhound listen now he said since i must go this voyage with him perchance upon the seas on some dark night opportunity may serve me  wait let me consider it allah guide me to find some way she beat her hands together and bade the slave girl who answered her to summon her wazeer ayoub and bid a litter be prepared for her well to the sôk o marzak and see these slaves of his who knows but that something may be done by means of them guile will serve us better than mere strength against that misbegotten son of shame  may his house be destroyed said marzak     chapter ix competitors   the open space before the gates of the sôkelabeed was thronged with a motley jostling noisy crowd that at every moment was being swelled by the human streams pouring to mingle in it from the debauching labyrinth of narrow unpaved streets  there were brownskinned berbers in black goathair cloaks that were made in one piece with a cowl and decorated by a lozenge of red or orange colour on the back their shaven heads encased in skullcaps or simply bound in a cord of plaited camelhair there were black saharowi who went almost naked and stately arabs who seemed overmuffled in their flowing robes of white with the cowls overshadowing their swarthy finely featured faces there were dignified and prosperouslooking moors in brightly coloured selhams astride of sleek mules that were richly caparisoned and there were tagareenes the banished moors of andalusia most of whom followed the trade of slavedealers there were native jews in sombre black djellabas and christianjewssocalled because bred in christian countries whose garments they still wore there were levantine turks splendid of dress and arrogant of demeanour and there were humble cololies kabyles and biscaries here a waterseller laden with his goatskin vessel tinkled his little bell there an orangehawker balancing a basket of the golden fruit upon his ragged turban bawled his wares there were men on foot and men on mules men on donkeys and men on slim arab horses an evershifting medley of colours all jostling laughing cursing in the ardent african sunshine under the blue sky where pigeons circled in the shadow of the yellow tapia wall squatted a line of whining beggars and cripples soliciting alms near the gates a little space had been cleared and an audience had gathered in a ring about a meddaha beggartroubadourwho to the accompaniment of gimbri and gaitah from two acolytes chanted a doleful ballad in a thin nasal voice  those of the crowd who were patrons of the market held steadily amain and leaving their mounts outside passed through the gates through which there was no admittance for mere idlers and mean folk within the vast quadrangular space of bare dry ground enclosed by dustcoloured walls there was more space the sale of slaves had not yet begun and was not due to begin for another hour and meanwhile a little trading was being done by those merchants who had obtained the coveted right to set up their booths against the walls they were vendors of wool of fruit of spices and one or two traded in jewels and trinkets for the adornment of the faithful  a well was sunk in the middle of the ground a considerable octagon with a low parapet in three steps upon the nethermost of these sat an aged bearded jew in a black djellaba his head swathed in a coloured kerchief upon his knees reposed a broad shallow black box divided into compartments each filled with lesser gems and rare stones which he was offering for sale about him stood a little group of young moors and one or two turkish officers with several of whom the old israelite was haggling at once  the whole of the northern wall was occupied by a long penthouse its contents completely masked by curtains of camelhair from behind it proceeded a subdued murmur of human voices these were the pens in which were confined the slaves to be offered for sale that day before the curtains on guard stood some dozen corsairs with attendant negro slaves  beyond and above the wall glistened the white dome of a zowia flanked by a spearlike minaret and the tall heads of a few date palms whose long leaves hung motionless in the hot air  suddenly in the crowd beyond the gates there was a commotion from one of the streets six colossal nubians advanced with shouts of  oak oak warda way make way  they were armed with great staves grasped in their two hands and with these they broke a path through that motley press hurling men to right and left and earning a shower of curses in return  balâk make way way for the lord asadeddin the exalted of allah way  the crowd pressing back went down upon its knees and grovelled as asadeddin on a milkwhite mule rode forward escorted by tsamanni his wazeer and a cloud of blackrobed janissaries with flashing scimitars  the curses that had greeted the violence of his negroes were suddenly silenced instead blessings as fervent filled the air  may allah increase thy might may allah lengthen thy days the blessings of our lord mahomet upon thee allah send thee more victories were the benedictions that showered upon him on every hand he returned them as became a man who was supremely pious and devout  the peace of allah upon the faithful of the prophets house he would murmur in response from time to time until at last he had reached the gates there he bade tsamanni fling a purse to the crouching beggarsfor is it not written in the most perspicuous book that of alms ye shall bestow what ye can spare for such as are saved from their own greed shall prosper and whatever ye give in alms as seeking the face of allah shall be doubled unto you  submissive to the laws as the meanest of his subjects asad dismounted and passed on foot into the sôk he came to a halt by the well and facing the curtained penthouse he blessed the kneeling crowd and commanded all to rise  he beckoned sakrelbahrs officer aliwho was in charge of the slaves of the corsairs latest raid and announced his will to inspect the captives at a sign from ali the negroes flung aside the camelhair curtains and let the fierce sunlight beat in upon those pentup wretches they were not only the captives taken by sakrelbahr but some others who were the result of one or two lesser raids by biskaine  asad beheld a huddle of men and womenthough the proportion of women was very smallof all ages races and conditions there were pale fairhaired men from france or the north oliveskinned italians and swarthy spaniards negroes and halfcastes there were old men young men and mere children some handsomely dressed some almost naked others hung with rags in the hopeless dejection of their countenances alone was there any uniformity but it was not a dejection that could awaken pity in the pious heart of asad they were unbelievers who would never look upon the face of gods prophet accursed and unworthy of any tenderness from man for a moment his glance was held by a lovely blackhaired spanish girl who sat with her locked hands held fast between her knees in an attitude of intense despair and sufferingthe glory of her eyes increased and magnified by the dark brown stains of sleeplessness surrounding them leaning on tsamannis arm he stood considering her for a little while then his glance travelled on suddenly he tightened his grasp of tsamannis arm and a quick interest leapt into his sallow face  on the uppermost tier of the pen that he was facing sat a very glory of womanhood such a woman as he had heard tell existed but the like of which he had never yet beheld she was tall and graceful as a cypresstree her skin was white as milk her eyes two darkest sapphires her head of a coppery golden that seemed to glow like metal as the sunlight caught it she was dressed in a close gown of white the bodice cut low and revealing the immaculate loveliness of her neck  asadeddin turned to ali what pearl is this that hath been cast upon this dungheap he asked  she is the woman our lord sakrelbahr carried off from england slowly the bashas eyes returned to consider her and insensible though she had deemed herself by now he saw her cheeks slowly reddening under the cold insult of his steady insistent glance the glow heightened her beauty effacing the weariness which the face had worn  bring her forth said the basha shortly  she was seized by two of the negroes and to avoid being roughly handled by them she came at once bracing herself to bear with dignity whatever might await her a goldenhaired young man beside her his face haggard and stubbled with a beard of some growth looked up in alarm as she was taken from his side then with a groan he made as if to clutch her but a rod fell upon his raised arms and beat them down  asad was thoughtful it was fenzileh who had bidden him come look at the infidel maid whom sakrelbahr had risked so much to snatch from england suggesting that in her he would behold some proof of the bad faith which she was forever urging against the corsair leader he beheld the woman but he discovered about her no such signs as fenzileh had suggested he must find nor indeed did he look for any out of curiosity had he obeyed her prompting but that and all else were forgotten now in the contemplation of this noble ensample of northern womanhood statuesque almost in her terrible restraint  he put forth a hand to touch her arm and she drew it back as if his fingers were of fire  he sighed how inscrutable are the ways of allah that he should suffer so luscious a fruit to hang from the foul tree of infidelity  tsamanni watching him craftily a mastersycophant profoundly learned in the art of playing upon his masters moods made answer  even so perchance that a faithful of the prophets house may pluck it verily all things are possible to the one  yet is it not set down in the book to be read that the daughters of the infidel are not for truebelievers and again he sighed  but tsamanni knowing full well how the basha would like to be answered trimmed his reply to that desire  allah is great and what hath befallen once may well befall again my lord  asads kindling eyes flashed a glance at his wazeer  thou meanest fenzileh but then by the mercy of allah i was rendered the instrument of her enlightenment  it may well be written that thou shalt be the same again my lord murmured the insidious tsamanni there was more stirring in his mind than the mere desire to play the courtier now twixt fenzileh and himself there had long been a feud begotten of the jealousy which each inspired in the other where asad was concerned were fenzileh removed the wazeers influence must grow and spread to his own profit it was a thing of which he had often dreamed but a dream he feared that was never like to be realized for asad was ageing and the fires that had burned so fiercely in his earlier years seemed now to have consumed in him all thought of women yet here was one as by a miracle of a beauty so amazing and so diverse from any that ever yet had feasted the bashas sight that plainly she had acted as a charm upon his senses  she is white as the snows upon the atlas luscious as the dates of tafilalt he murmured fondly his gleaming eyes considering her what time she stood immovable before him suddenly he looked about him and wheeled upon tsamanni his manner swiftly becoming charged with anger  her face has been bared to a thousand eyes and more he cried  even that has been so before replied tsamanni  and then quite suddenly at their elbow a voice that was naturally soft and musical of accent but now rendered harsh cut in to ask  what woman may this be  startled both the basha and his wazeer swung round fenzileh becomingly veiled and hooded stood before them escorted by marzak a little behind them were the eunuchs and the litter in which unperceived by asad she had been borne thither beside the litter stood her wazeer ayoubelsamin  asad scowled down upon her for he had not yet recovered from the resentment she and marzak had provoked in him moreover that in private she should be lacking in the respect which was his due was evil enough though he had tolerated it but that she should make so bold as to thrust in and question him in this peremptory fashion before all the world was more than his dignity could suffer never yet had she dared so much nor would she have dared it now but that her sudden anxiety had effaced all caution from her mind she had seen the look with which asad had been considering that lovely slave and not only jealousy but positive fear awoke in her her hold upon asad was growing tenuous to snap it utterly no more was necessary than that he who of late years had scarce bestowed a thought or glance upon a woman should be taken with the fancy to bring some new recruit to his hareem  hence her desperate reckless courage to stand thus before him now for although her face was veiled there was hardy arrogance in every line of her figure of his scowl she took no slightest heed  if this be the slave fetched by sakrelbahr from england then rumour has lied to me she said i vow it was scarce worth so long a voyage and the endangering so many valuable muslim lives to fetch this yellowfaced longshanked daughter of perdition into barbary  asads surprise beat down his anger he was not subtle  yellowfaced longshanked quoth he then reading fenzileh at last he displayed a slow crooked smile already have i observed thee to grow hard of hearing and now thy sight is failing too it seems assuredly thou art growing old and he looked her over with such an eye of displeasure that she recoiled  he stepped close up to her too long already hast thou queened it in my hareem with thine infidel frankish ways he muttered so that none but those immediately about overheard his angry words thou art become a very scandal in the eyes of the faithful he added very grimly it were well perhaps that we amended that  abruptly then he turned away and by a gesture he ordered ali to return the slave to her place among the others leaning on the arm of tsamanni he took some steps towards the entrance then halted and turned again to fenzileh  to thy litter he bade her peremptorily rebuking her thus before all and get thee to the house as becomes a seemly muslim woman nor ever again let thyself be seen roving the public places afoot  she obeyed him instantly without a murmur and he himself lingered at the gates with tsamanni until her litter had passed out escorted by ayoub and marzak walking each on one side of it and neither daring to meet the angry eye of the basha  asad looked sourly after that litter a sneer on his heavy lips  as her beauty wanes so her presumption waxes he growled she is growing old tsamanniold and lean and shrewish and no fit mate for a member of the prophets house it were perhaps a pleasing thing in the sight of allah that we replaced her and then referring obviously to that other one his eye turning towards the penthouse the curtains of which were drawn again he changed his tone  didst thou mark o tsamanni with what a grace she movedlithely and nobly as a young gazelle verily so much beauty was never created by the allwise to be cast into the pit  may it not have been sent to comfort some truebeliever wondered the subtle wazeer to allah all things are possible  why else indeed said asad it was written and even as none may obtain what is not written so none may avoid what is i am resolved stay thou here tsamanni remain for the outcry and purchase her she shall be taught the true faith she shall be saved from the furnace the command had come the thing that tsamanni had so ardently desired  he licked his lips and the price my lord he asked in a small voice  price quoth asad have i not bid thee purchase her bring her to me though her price be a thousand philips  a thousand philips echoed tsamanni amazed allah is great  but already asad had left his side and passed out under the arched gateay where the grovelling anew at the sight of him  it was a fine thing for asad to bid him remain for the sale but the dalal would part with no slave until the money was forthcoming and tsamanni had no considerable sum upon his person therefore in the wake of his master he set out forthwith to the kasbah it wanted still an hour before the sale would be held and he had time and to spare in which to go and return  it happened however that tsamanni was malicious and that the hatred of fenzileh which so long he had consumed in silence and dissembled under fawning smiles and profound salaams included also her servants there was none in all the world of whom he entertained a greater contempt than her sleek and greasy eunuch ayoubelsamin of the majestic rolling gait and fat supercilious lips  it was written too that in the courtyard of the kasbah he should stumble upon ayoub who indeed had by his mistresss commands been set to watch for the wazeer the fat fellow rolled forward his hands supporting his paunch his little eyes agleam  allah increase thy health tsamanni was his courteous greeting thou bearest news  news what news quoth tsamanni in truth none that will gladden thy mistress  merciful allah what now doth it concern that frankish slavegirl  tsamanni smiled a thing that angered ayoub who felt that the ground he trod was becoming insecure it followed that if his mistress fell from influence he fell with her and became as the dust upon tsamannis slippers  by the koran thou tremblest ayoub tsamanni mocked him thy soft fat is all aquivering and well it may for thy days are numbered o father of nothing  dost deride me dog came the others voice shrill now with anger  callest me dog thou deliberately tsamanni spat upon his shadow go tell thy mistress that i am bidden by my lord to buy the frankish girl tell her that my lord will take her to wife even as he took fenzileh that he may lead her into the true belief and cheat shaitan of so fair a jewel add that i am bidden to buy her though she cost my lord a thousand philips bear her that message o father of wind and may allah increase thy paunch and he was gone lithe active and mocking  may thy sons perish and thy daughters become harlots roared the eunuch maddened at once by this evil news and the insult with which it was accompanied  but tsamanni only laughed as he answered him over his shoulder  may thy sons be sultans all ayoub  quivering still with a rage that entirely obliterated his alarm at what he had learnt ayoub rolled into the presence of his mistress with that evil message  she listened to him in a dumb white fury then she fell to reviling her lord and the slavegirl in a breath and called upon allah to break their bones and blacken their faces and rot their flesh with all the fervour of one born and bred in the true faith when she recovered from that burst of fury it was to sit brooding awhile at length she sprang up and bade ayoub see that none lurked to listen about the doorways  we must act ayoub and act swiftly or i am destroyed and with me will be destroyed marzak who alone could not stand against his fathers face sakrelbahr will trample us into the dust she checked on a sudden thought by allah it may have been a part of his design to have brought hither that whitefaced wench but we must thwart him and we must thwart asad or thou art ruined too ayoub  thwart him quoth her wazeer gaping at the swift energy of mind and body with which this woman was endowed the like of which he had never seen in any woman yet thwart him he repeated  first ayoub to place this frankish girl beyond his reach  that is well thoughtbut how  how can thy wit suggest no way hast thou wits at all in that fat head of thine thou shalt outbid tsamanni or better still set someone else to do it for thee and so buy the girl for me then well contrive that she shall vanish quietly and quickly before asad can discover a trace of her  his face blanched and the wattles about his jaws were shaking and and the cost hast thou counted the cost o fenzileh what will happen when asad gains knowledge of this thing  he shall gain no knowledge of it she answered him or if he does the girl being gone beyond recall he shall submit him to what was written trust me to know how to bring him to it  lady lady he cried and wrung his bunches of fat fingers i dare not engage in this  engage in what if i bid thee go buy this girl and give thee the money thoult require what else concerns thee dog what else is to be done a man shall do come now thou shalt have the money all i have which is a matter of some fifteen hundred philips and what is not laid out upon this purchase thou shalt retain for thyself  he considered an instant and conceived that she was right none could blame him for executing the commands she gave him and there would be profit in it clearlyay and it would be sweet to outbid that dog tsamanni and send him emptyhanded home to face the wrath of his frustrated master he spread his hands and salaamed in token of complete acquiescence     chapter x the slavemarket   at the sôkelabeed it was the hour of the outcry announced by a blast of trumpets and the thudding of tomtoms the traders that until then had been licensed to ply within the enclosure now put up the shutters of their little booths the hebrew pedlar of gems closed his box and effaced himself leaving the steps about the well clear for the most prominent patrons of the market these hastened to assemble there surrounding it and facing outwards whilst the rest of the crowd was ranged against the southern and western walls of the enclosure  came negro watercarriers in white turbans with aspersers made of palmetto leaves to sprinkle the ground and lay the dust against the tramp of slaves and buyers the trumpets ceased for an instant then wound a fresh imperious blast and fell permanently silent the crowd about the gates fell back to right and left and very slowly and stately three tall dalals dressed from head to foot in white and with immaculate turbans wound about their heads advanced into the open space they came to a halt at the western end of the long wall the chief dalal standing slightly in advance of the other two  the chattering of voices sank upon their advent it became a hissing whisper then a faint drone like that of bees and then utter silence in the solemn and grave demeanour of the dalals there was something almost sacerdotal so that when that silence fell upon the crowd the affair took on the aspect of a sacrament  the chief dalal stood forward a moment as if in an abstraction with downcast eyes then with hands outstretched to catch a blessing he raised his voice and began to pray in a monotonous chant  in the name of allah the pitying the pitiful who created man from clots of blood all that is in the heavens and in the earth praiseth allah who is the mighty the wise his the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth he maketh alive and killeth and he hath power over all things he is the first and the last the seen and the unseen and he knoweth all things  ameen intoned the crowd  the praise to him who sent us mahomet his prophet to give the world the true belief and curses upon shaitan the stoned who wages war upon allah and his children  ameen  the blessings of allah and our lord mahomet upon this market and upon all who may buy and sell herein and may allah increase their wealth and grant them length of days in which to praise him  ameen replied the crowd as with a stir and rustle the close ranks relaxed from the tense attitude of prayer and each man sought elbowroom  the dalal beat his hands together whereupon the curtains were drawn aside and the huddled slaves displayedsome three hundred in all occupying three several pens  in the front rank of the middle penthe one containing rosamund and lionelstood a couple of stalwart young nubians sleek and muscular who looked on with completest indifference no whit appalled by the fate which had haled them thither they caught the eye of the dalal and although the usual course was for a buyer to indicate a slave he was prepared to purchase yet to the end that good beginning should be promptly made the dalal himself pointed out that stalwart pair to the corsairs who stood on guard in compliance the two negroes were brought forth  here is a noble twain the dalal announced strong of muscle and long of limb as all may see whom it were a shameful thing to separate who needs such a pair for strong labour let him say what he will give he set out on a slow circuit of the well the corsairs urging the two slaves to follow him that all buyers might see and inspect them  in the foremost ranks of the crowd near the gate stood ali sent thither by othmani to purchase a score of stout fellows required to make up the contingent of the galeasse of sakrelbahr he had been strictly enjoined to buy naught but the stoutest stuff the market could affordwith one exception aboard that galeasse they wanted no weaklings who would trouble the boatswain with their swoonings ali announced his business forthwith  i need such tall fellows for the oars of sakrelbahr said he with loud importance thus drawing upon himself the eyes of the assembly and sunning himself in the admiring looks bestowed upon one of the officers of oliverreis one of the rovers who were the pride of islam and a swordedge to the infidel  they were born to toil nobly at the oar o alireis replied the dalal in all solemnity what wilt thou give for them  two hundred philips for the twain  the dalal paced solemnly on the slaves following in his wake  two hundred philips am i offered for a pair of the lustiest slaves that by the favour of allah were ever brought into this market who will say fifty philips more  a portly moor in a flowing blue selham rose from his seat on the step of the well as the dalal came abreast of him and the slaves scenting here a buyer and preferring any service to that of the galleys with which they were threatened came each in turn to kiss his hands and fawn upon him for all the world like dogs  calm and dignified he ran his hands over them feeling their muscles and then forced back their lips and examined their teeth and mouths  two hundred and twenty for the twain he said and the dalal passed on with his wares announcing the increased price he had been offered  thus he completed the circuit and came to stand once more before ali  two hundred and twenty is now the price o ali by the koran they are worth three hundred at the least wilt say three hundred  two hundred and thirty was the answer  back to the moor went the dalal two hundred and thirty i am now offered o hamet thou wilt give another twenty  not i by allah said hamet and resumed his seat let him have them  another ten philips pleaded the dalal  not another asper  they are thine then o ali for two hundred and thirty give thanks to allah for so good a bargain  the nubians were surrendered to alis followers whilst the dalals two assistants advanced to settle accounts with the corsair  wait wait said he is not the name of sakrelbahr good warranty  the inviolable law is that the purchase money be paid ere a slave leaves the market o valiant ali  it shall be observed was the impatient answer and i will so pay before they leave but i want others yet and we will make one account an it please thee that fellow yonder now i have orders to buy him for my captain and he indicated lionel who stood at rosamunds side the very incarnation of woefulness and debility  contemptuous surprise flickered an instant in the eyes of the dalal but this he made haste to dissemble  bring forth that yellowhaired infidel he commanded  the corsairs laid hands on lionel he made a vain attempt to struggle but it was observed that the woman leaned over to him and said something quickly whereupon his struggles ceased and he suffered himself to be dragged limply forth into the full view of all the market  dost want him for the oar ali cried ayoubelsamin across the quadrangle a jest this that evoked a general laugh  what else quoth ali he should be cheap at least  cheap quoth the dalal in an affectation of surprise nay now tis a comely fellow and a young one what wilt thou give now a hundred philips  a hundred philips cried ali derisively a hundred philips for that skinful of bones mashallah five philips is my price o dalal  again laughter crackled through the mob but the dalal stiffened with increasing dignity some of that laughter seemed to touch himself and he was not a person to be made the butt of mirth  tis a jest my master said he with a forgiving yet contemptuous wave behold how sound he is he signed to one of the corsairs and lionels doublet was slit from neck to girdle and wrenched away from his body leaving him naked to the waist and displaying better proportions than might have been expected in a passion at that indignity lionel writhed in the grip of his guards until one of the corsairs struck him a light blow with a whip in earnest of what to expect if he continued to be troublesome consider him now said the dalal pointing to that white torso and behold how sound he is see how excellent are his teeth he seized lionels head and forced the jaws apart  ay said ali but consider me those lean shanks and that womans arm  tis a fault the oar will mend the dalal insisted  you filthy blackamoors burst from lionel in a sob of rage  he is muttering curses in his infidel tongue said ali his temper is none too good you see i have said five philips ill say no more  with a shrug the dalal began his circuit of the well the corsairs thrusting lionel after him here one rose to handle him there another but none seemed disposed to purchase  five philips is the foolish price offered me for this fine young frank cried the dalal will no truebeliever pay ten for such a slave wilt not thou o ayoub thou hametten philips  but one after another those to whom he was offered shook their heads the haggardness of lionels face was too unprepossessing they had seen slaves with that look before and experience told them that no good was ever to be done with such fellows moreover though shapely his muscles were too slight his flesh looked too soft and tender of what use a slave who must be hardened and nourished into strength and who might very well die in the process even at five philips he would be dear so the disgusted dalal came back to ali  he is thine then for five philipsallah pardon thy avarice  ali grinned and his men seized upon lionel and bore him off into the background to join the two negroes previously purchased  and then before ali could bid for another of the slaves he desired to acquire a tall elderly jew dressed in black doublet and hose like a castilian gentleman with a ruffle at his neck a plumed bonnet on his grey locks and a serviceable dagger hanging from his girdle of hammered gold had claimed the attention of the dalal  in the pen that held the captives of the lesser raids conducted by biskaine sat an andalusian girl of perhaps some twenty years of a beauty entirely spanish  her face was of the warm pallor of ivory her massed hair of an ebony black her eyebrows were finely pencilled and her eyes of deepest and softest brown she was dressed in the becoming garb of the castilian peasant the folded kerchief of red and yellow above her bodice leaving bare the glories of her neck she was very pale and her eyes were wild in their look but this detracted nothing from her beauty  she had attracted the jews notice and it is not impossible that there may have stirred in him a desire to avenge upon her some of the cruel wrongs some of the rackings burning confiscations and banishment suffered by the men of his race at the hands of the men of hers he may have bethought him of invaded ghettos of jewish maidens ravished and jewish children butchered in the name of the god those spanish christians worshipped for there was something almost of contemptuous fierceness in his dark eyes and in the hand he flung out to indicate her  yonder is a castilian wench for whom i will give fifty philips o dalal he announced the datal made a sign whereupon the corsairs dragged her struggling forth  so much loveliness may not be bought for fifty philips o ibrahim said he yusuf here will pay sixty at least and he stood expectantly before a resplendent moor  the moor however shook his head  allah knows i have three wives who would destroy her loveliness within the hour and so leave me the loser  the dalal moved on the girl following him but contesting every step of the way with those who impelled her forward and reviling them too in hot castilian she drove her nails into the arms of one and spat fiercely into the face of another of her corsair guards rosamunds weary eyes quickened to horror as she watched hera horror prompted as much by the fate awaiting that poor child as by the undignified fury of the futile battle she waged against it but it happened that her behaviour impressed a levantine turk quite differently he rose a short squat figure from his seat on the steps of the well  sixty philips will i pay for the joy of taming that wild cat said he  but ibrahim was not to be outbidden he offered seventy the turk countered with a bid of eighty and ibrahim again raised the price to ninety and there fell a pause  the dalal spurred on the turk wilt thou be beaten then and by an israelite shall this lovely maid be given to a perverter of the scriptures to an inheritor of the fire to one of a race that would not bestow on their fellowmen so much as the speck out of a datestone it were a shame upon a truebeliever  urged thus the turk offered another five philips but with obvious reluctance the jew however entirely unabashed by a tirade against him the like of which he heard a score of times a day in the course of trading pulled forth a heavy purse from his girdle  here are one hundred philips he announced tis overmuch but i offer it  ere the dalals pious and seductive tongue could urge him further the turk sat down again with a gesture of finality  i give him joy of her said he  she is thine then o ibrahim for one hundred philips  the israelite relinquished the purse to the dalals whiterobed assistants and advanced to receive the girl the corsairs thrust her forward against him still vainly battling and his arms closed about her for a moment  thou has cost me dear thou daughter of spain said he but i am content come and he made shift to lead her away suddenly however fierce as a tigercat she writhed her arms upwards and clawed at his face with a scream of pain he relaxed his hold of her and in that moment quick as lightning she plucked the dagger that hung from his girdle so temptingly within her reach  valga me dios she cried and ere a hand could be raised to prevent her she had buried the blade in her lovely breast and sank in a laughing coughing heap at his feet a final convulsive heave and she lay there quite still whilst ibrahim glared down at her with eyes of dismay and over all the market there hung a hush of sudden awe  rosamund had risen in her place and a faint colour came to warm her pallor a faint light kindled in her eyes god had shown her the way through this poor spanish girl and assuredly god would give her the means to take it when her own turn came she felt herself suddenly uplifted and enheartened death was a sharp swift severing an easy door of escape from the horror that threatened her and god in his mercy she knew would justify selfmurder under such circumstances as were her own and that poor dead andalusian maids  at length ibrahim roused himself from his momentary stupor he stepped deliberately across the body his face inflamed and stood to beard the impassive dalal  she is dead he bleated i am defrauded give me back my gold  are we to give back the price of every slave that dies the dalal questioned him  but she was not yet delivered to me raved the jew my hands had not touched her give me back my gold  thou liest son of a dog was the answer dispassionately delivered she was thine already i had so pronounced her bear her hence since she belongs to thee  the jew his face empurpling seemed to fight for breath  how he choked am i to lose a hundred philips  what is written is written replied the serene dalal  ibrahim was frothing at the lips his eyes were bloodinjected but it was never written that  peace said the dalal had it not been written it could not have come to pass it is the will of allah who dares rebel against it  the crowd began to murmur  i want my hundred philips the jew insisted whereupon the murmur swelled into a sudden roar  thou hearest said the dalal allah pardon thee thou art disturbing the peace of this market away ere ill betide thee  hence hence roared the crowd and some advanced threateningly upon the luckless ibrahim away thou perverter of holy writ thou filth thou dog away  such was the uproar such the menace of angry countenances and clenched fists shaken in his very face that ibrahim quailed and forgot his loss in fear  i go i go he said and turned hastily to depart  but the dalal summoned him back take hence thy property said he and pointed to the body and so ibrahim was forced to suffer the further mockery of summoning his slaves to bear away the lifeless body for which he had paid in lively potent gold  yet by the gates he paused again i will appeal me to the basha he threatened asadeddin is just and he will have my money restored to me  so he will said the dalal when thou canst restore the dead to life and he turned to the portly ayoub who was plucking at his sleeve he bent his head to catch the muttered words of fenzilehs wazeer then in obedience to them he ordered rosamund to be brought forward  she offered no least resistance advancing in a singularly lifeless way like a sleepwalker or one who had been drugged in the heat and glare of the open market she stood by the dalals side at the head of the well whilst he dilated upon her physical merits in that lingua franca which he used since it was current coin among all the assorted races represented therea language which the knowledge of french that her residence in france had taught her she was to her increasing horror and shame able to understand  the first to make an offer for her was that same portly moor who had sought to purchase the two nubeans he rose to scrutinize her closely and must have been satisfied for the price he offered was a good one and he offered it with contemptuous assurance that he would not be outbidden  one hundred philips for the milkfaced girl  tis not enough consider me the moonbright loveliness of her face said the dalal as he moved on chigil yields us fair women but no woman of chigil was ever half so fair  one hundred and fifty said the levantine turk with a snap  not yet enough behold the stately height which allah hath vouchsafed her see the noble carriage of her head the lustre of her eye by allah she is worthy to grace the sultans own hareem  he said no more than the buyers recognized to be true and excitement stirred faintly through their usually impassive ranks a tagareen moor named yusuf offered at once two hundred  but still the dalal continued to sing her praises he held up one of her arms for inspection and she submitted with lowered eyes and no sign of resentment beyond the slow flush that spread across her face and vanished again  behold me these limbs smooth as arabian silks and whiter than ivory look at those lips like pomegranate blossoms the price is now two hundred philips what wilt thou give o hamet  hamet showed himself angry that his original bid should so speedily have been doubled by the koran i have purchased three sturdy girls from the sus for less  wouldst thou compare a squatfaced girl from the sus with this narcissuseyed glory of womanhood scoffed the dalal  two hundred and ten then was hamets sulky grunt  the watchful tsamanni considered that the time had come to buy her for his lord as he had been bidden  three hundred he said curtly to make an end of matters and  four hundred instantly piped a shrill voice behind him  he spun round in his amazement and met the leering face of ayoub a murmur ran through the ranks of the buyers the people craned their necks to catch a glimpse of this openhanded purchaser  yusuf the tagareen rose up in a passion he announced angrily that never again should the dust of the sôk of algiers defile his slippers that never again would he come there to purchase slaves  by the well of zemzem he swore all men are bewitched in this market four hundred philips for a frankish girl may allah increase your wealth for verily youll need it and in his supreme disgust he stalked to the gates and elbowed his way through the crowd and so vanished from the sôk  yet ere he was out of earshot her price had risen further whilst tsamanni was recovering from his surprise at the competitor that had suddenly appeared before him the dalal had lured an increased offer from the turk  tis a madness the latter deplored but she pleaseth me and should it seem good to allah the merciful to lead her into the true faith she may yet become the light of my hareem four hundred and twenty philips then o dalal and allah pardon me my prodigality  yet scarcely was his little speech concluded than tsamanni with laconic eloquence rapped out five hundred  yallah cried the turk raising his hands to heaven and yallah echoed the crowd  five hundred and fifty shrilled ayoubs voice above the general din  six hundred replied tsamanni still unmoved  and now such was the general hubbub provoked by these unprecedented prices that the dalal was forced to raise his voice and cry for silence  when this was restored ayoub at once raised the price to seven hundred  eight hundred snapped tsamanni showing at last a little heat  nine hundred replied ayoub  tsamanni swung round upon him again white now with fury  is this a jest o father of wind he cried and excited laughter by the taunt implicit in that appellation  and thourt the jester replied ayoub with forced calm thoult find the jest a costly one  with a shrug tsamanni turned again to the dalal a thousand philips said he shortly  silence there cried the dalal again silence and praise allah who sends good prices  one thousand and one hundred said ayoub the irrepressible  and now tsamanni not only found himself outbidden but he had reached the outrageous limit appointed by asad he lacked authority to go further dared not do so without first consulting the basha yet if he left the sôk for that purpose ayoub would meanwhile secure the girl he found himself between sword and wall on the one hand did he permit himself to be outbidden his master might visit upon him his disappointment on the other did he continue beyond the limit so idly mentioned as being far beyond all possibility it might fare no less ill with him  he turned to the crowd waving his arms in furious gesticulation by the beard of the prophet this bladder of wind and grease makes sport of us he has no intent to buy what man ever heard of the half of such a price for a slave girl  ayoubs answer was eloquent he produced a fat bag and flung it on the ground where it fell with a mellow chink there is my sponsor he made answer grinning in the very best of humours savouring to the full his enemys rage and discomfiture and savouring it at no cost to himself shall i count out one thousand and one hundred philips o dalal  if the wazeer tsamanni is content  dost thou know for whom i buy roared tsamanni for the basha himself asadeddin the exalted of allah he advanced upon ayoub with hands upheld what shalt thou say to him o dog when he calls thee to account for daring to outbid him  but ayoub remained unruffled before all this fury he spread his fat hands his eyes twinkling his great lips pursed how should i know since allah has not made me allknowing thou shouldst have said so earlier tis thus i shall answer the basha should he question me and the basha is just  i would not be thee ayoubnot for the throne of istambul  nor i thee tsamanni for thou art jaundiced with rage  and so they stood glaring each at the other until the dalal called them back to the business that was to do  the price is now one thousand and one hundred philips wilt thou suffer defeat o wazeer  since allah wills i have no authority to go further  then at one thousand and one hundred philips ayoub she is  but the sale was not yet to be completed from the dense and eager throng about the gates rang a crisp voice  one thousand and two hundred philips for the frankish girl  the dalal who had conceived that the limits of madness had been already reached stood gaping now in fresh amazement the mob crowed and cheered and roared between enthusiasm and derision and even tsamanni brightened to see another champion enter the lists who perhaps would avenge him upon ayoub the crowd parted quickly to right and left and through it into the open strode sakrelbahr they recognized him instantly and his name was shouted in acclamation by that idolizing multitude  that barbary name of his conveyed no information to rosamund and her back being turned to the entrance she did not see him but she had recognized his voice and she had shuddered at the sound she could make nothing of the bidding nor what the purpose that surely underlay it to account for the extraordinary excitement of the traders vaguely had she been wondering what dastardly purpose oliver might intend to serve but now that she heard his voice that wonder ceased and understanding took its place he had hung there somewhere in the crowd waiting until all competitors but one should have been outbidden and now he stepped forth to buy her for his ownhis slave she closed her eyes a moment and prayed god that he might not prevail in his intent any fate but that she would rob him even of the satisfaction of driving her to sheathe a poniard in her heart as that poor andalusian girl had done a wave almost of unconsciousness passed over her in the intensity of her horror for a moment the ground seemed to rock and heave under her feet  then the dizziness passed and she was herself again she heard the crowd thundering mashallah and sakrelbahr and the dalal clamouring sternly for silence when this was at last restored she heard his exclamation  the glory to allah who sends eager buyers what sayest thou o wazeer ayoub  ay sneered tsamanni what now  one thousand and three hundred said ayoub with a quaver of uneasy defiance  another hundred o dalal came from sakrelbahr in a quiet voice  one thousand and five hundred screamed ayoub thus reaching not only the limit imposed by his mistress but the very limit of the resources at her immediate disposal gone too with that bid was all hope of profit to himself  but sakrelbahr impassive as fate and without so much as deigning to bestow a look upon the quivering eunuch said again  another hundred o dalal  one thousand and six hundred philips cried the dalal more in amazement than to announce the figure reached then controlling his emotions he bowed his head in reverence and made confession of his faith all things are possible if allah wills them the praise to him who sends wealthy buyers  he turned to the crestfallen ayoub so crestfallen that in the contemplation of him tsamanni was fast gathering consolation for his own discomfiture vicariously tasting the sweets of vengeance what say you now o perspicuous wazeer  i say choked ayoub that since by the favour of shaitan he hath so much wealth he must prevail  but the insulting words were scarcely uttered than sakrelbahrs great hand had taken the wazeer by the nape of his fat neck a growl of anger running through the assembly to approve him  by the favour of shaitan sayest thou thou sexless dog he growled and tightened his grip so that the wazeer squirmed and twisted in an agony of pain down was his head thrust and still down until his fat body gave way and he lay supine and writhing in the dust of the sôk shall i strangle thee thou father of filth or shall i fling thy soft flesh to the hooks to teach thee what is a mans due from thee and as he spoke he rubbed the too daring fellows face roughly on the ground  mercy squealed the wazeer mercy o mighty sakrelbahr as thou lookest for mercy  unsay thy words thou offal pronounce thyself a liar and a dog  i do unsay them i have foully lied thy wealth is the reward sent thee by allah for thy glorious victories over the unbelieving  put out thine offending tongue said sakrelbahr and cleanse it in the dust put it forth i say  ayoub obeyed him in fearful alacrity whereupon sakrelbahr released his hold and allowed the unfortunate fellow to rise at last halfchoked with dirt livid of face and quaking like a jelly an object of ridicule and cruel mockery to all assembled  now get thee hence ere my seahawks lay their talons on thee go  ayoub departed in all haste to the increasing jeers of the multitude and the taunts of tsamanni whilst sakrelbahr turned him once more to the dalal  at one thousand and six hundred philips this slave is thine o sakrelbahr thou glory of islam may allah increase thy victories  pay him ali said the corsair shortly and he advanced to receive his purchase  face to face stood he now with rosamund for the first time since that day before the encounter with the dutch argosy when he had sought her in the cabin of the carack  one swift glance she bestowed on him then her senses reeling with horror at her circumstance she shrank back her face of a deathly pallor in his treatment of ayoub she had just witnessed the lengths of brutality of which he was capable and she was not to know that this brutality had been a deliberate piece of mummery calculated to strike terror into her  pondering her now he smiled a tightlipped cruel smile that only served to increase her terror  come he said in english  she cowered back against the dalal as if for protection sakrelbahr reached forward caught her by the wrists and almost tossed her to his nubians abiad and zalzer who were attending him  cover her face he bade them bear her to my house away     chapter xi the truth   the sun was dipping swiftly to the worlds rim when sakrelbahr with his nubians and his little retinue of corsairs came to the gates of that white house of his on its little eminence outside the babeloueb and beyond the walls of the city  when rosamund and lionel brought in the wake of the corsair found themselves in the spacious courtyard beyond the dark and narrow entrance the blue of the sky contained but the paling embers of the dying day and suddenly sharply upon the evening stillness came a mueddins voice calling the faithful unto prayer  slaves fetched water from the fountain that played in the middle of the quadrangle and tossed aloft a slender silvery spear of water to break into a myriad gems and so shower down into the broad marble basin sakrelbahr washed as did his followers and then he went down upon the prayingmat that had been set for him whilst his corsairs detached their cloaks and spread them upon the ground to serve them in like stead  the nubians turned the two slaves about lest their glances should defile the orisons of the faithful and left them so facing the wall and the green gate that led into the garden whence were wafted on the cooling air the perfumes of jessamine and lavender through the laths of the gate they might have caught a glimpse of the riot of colour there and they might have seen the slaves arrested by the persian waterwheel at which they had been toiling and chanting until the call to prayer had come to strike them into statues  sakrelbahr rose from his devotions uttered a sharp word of command and entered the house the nubians followed him urging their captives before them up the narrow stairs and so brought them out upon the terrace on the roof that space which in eastern houses is devoted to the women but which no womans foot had ever trodden since this house had been tenanted by sakrelbahr the wifeless  this terrace which was surrounded by a parapet some four feet high commanded a view of the city straggling up the hillside to eastward from the harbour and of the island at the end of the mole which had been so laboriously built by the labour of christian slaves from the stones of the ruined fortressthe peñon which kheyreddin barbarossa had wrested from the spaniards the deepening shroud of evening was now upon all transmuting white and yellow walls alike to a pearly greyness to westward stretched the fragrant gardens of the house where the doves were murmuring fondly among the mulberries and lotus trees beyond it a valley wound its way between the shallow hills and from a pool fringed with sedges and bullrushes above which a great stork was majestically sailing came the harsh croak of frogs  an awning supported upon two gigantic spears hung out from the southern wall of the terrace which rose to twice the height of that forming the parapet on its other three sides under this was a divan and silken cushions and near it a small moorish table of ebony inlaid with motherofpearl and gold over the opposite parapet where a lattice had been set rioted a trailing rosetree charged with bloodred blossoms though now their colours were merged into the allencompassing greyness  here lionel and rosamund looked at each other in the dim light their faces gleaming ghostly each to each whilst the nubians stood like twin statues by the door that opened from the stairhead  the man groaned and clasped his hands before him the doublet which had been torn from him in the sôk had since been restored and temporarily repaired by a strand of palmetto cord but he was woefully bedraggled yet his thoughts if his first words are to be taken as an indication of them were for rosamunds condition rather than his own  o god that you should be subjected to this he cried that you should have suffered what you have suffered the humiliation of it the barbarous cruelty oh he covered his haggard face with his hands  she touched him gently on the arm  what i have suffered is but a little thing she said and her voice was wonderfully steady and soothing have i not said that these godolphins were brave folk even their women were held to have something of the male spirit in their breasts and to this none can doubt that rosamund now bore witness do not pity me lionel for my sufferings are at an end or very nearly she smiled strangely the smile of exaltation that you may see upon the martyrs face in the hour of doom  how quoth he in faint surprise  how she echoed is there not always a way to thrust aside lifes burden when it grows too heavyheavier than god would have us bear  his only answer was a groan indeed he had done little but groan in all the hours they had spent together since they were brought ashore from the carack and had the season permitted her so much reflection she might have considered that she had found him singularly wanting during those hours of stress when a man of worth would have made some effort however desperate to enhearten her rather than repine upon his own plight  slaves entered bearing four enormous flaming torches which they set in iron sconces protruding from the wall of the house thence they shed a lurid ruddy glow upon the terrace the slaves departed again and presently in the black gap of the doorway between the nubians a third figure appeared unheralded it was sakrelbahr  he stood a moment at gaze his attitude haughty his face expressionless then slowly he advanced he was dressed in a short white caftan that descended to his knees and was caught about his waist in a shimmering girdle of gold that quivered like fire in the glow of the torches as he moved his arms from the elbow and his legs from the knee were bare and his feet were shod with goldembroidered red turkish slippers he wore a white turban decked by a plume of osprey attached by a jewelled clasp  he signed to the nubians and they vanished silently leaving him alone with his captives  he bowed to rosamund this mistress he said is to be your domain henceforth which is to treat you more as wife than slave for it is to muslim wives that the housetops in barbary are allotted i hope you like it  lionel staring at him out of a white face his conscience bidding him fear the very worst his imagination painting a thousand horrid fates for him and turning him sick with dread shrank back before his halfbrother who scarce appeared to notice him just then  but rosamund confronted him drawn to the full of her splendid height and if her face was pale yet it was as composed and calm as his own if her bosom rose and fell to betray her agitations yet her glance was contemptuous and defiant her voice calm and steady when she answered him with the questionwhat is your intent with me  my intent said he with a little twisted smile yet for all that he believed he hated her and sought to hurt to humble and to crush her he could not stifle his admiration of her spirits gallantry in such an hour as this  from behind the hills peeped the edge of the moona sickle of burnished copper  my intent is not for you to question he replied there was a time rosamund when in all the world you had no slave more utter than was i yourself in your heartlessness and in your lack of faith you broke the golden fetters of that servitude youll find it less easy to break the shackles i now impose upon you  she smiled her scorn and quiet confidence he stepped close to her you are my slave do you understandbought in the marketplace as i might buy me a mule a goat or a cameland belonging to me body and soul you are my property my thing my chattel to use or abuse to cherish or break as suits my whim without a will that is not my will holding your very life at my good pleasure  she recoiled a step before the dull hatred that throbbed in his words before the evil mockery of his swarthy bearded face  you beast she gasped  so now you understand the bondage into which you are come in exchange for the bondage which in your own wantonness you dissolved  may god forgive you she panted  i thank you for that prayer said he may he forgive you no less  and then from the background came an inarticulate sound a strangled snarling sob from lionel  sakrelbahr turned slowly he eyed the fellow a moment in silence then he laughed  ha my sometime brother a pretty fellow as god lives is it not consider him rosamund behold how gallantly misfortune is borne by this pillar of manhood upon which you would have leaned by this stalwart husband of your choice look at him look at this dear brother of mine  under the lash of that mocking tongue lionels mood was stung to anger where before it had held naught but fear  you are no brother of mine he retorted fiercely your mother was a wanton who betrayed my father  sakrelbahr quivered a moment as if he had been struck yet he controlled himself  let me hear my mothers name but once again on thy foul tongue and ill have it ripped out by the roots her memory i thank god is far above the insults of such a crawling thing as you none the less take care not to speak of the only woman whose name i reverence  and then turning at bay as even the rat will do lionel sprang upon him with clawing hands outstretched to reach his throat but sakrelbahr caught him in a grip that bent him howling to his knees  you find me strong eh he gibed is it matter for wonder consider that for six endless months i toiled at the oar of a galley and youll understand what it was that turned my body into iron and robbed me of a soul  he flung him off and sent him crashing into the rosebush and the lattice over which it rambled  do you realize the horror of the rowers bench to sit day in day out night in night out chained naked to the oar amid the reek and stench of your fellows in misfortune unkempt unwashed save by the rain broiled and roasted by the sun festering with sores lashed and cut and scarred by the boatswains whip as you faint under the ceaseless endless cruel toil  do you realize it from a tone of suppressed fury his voice rose suddenly to a roar you shall for that horror which was mine by your contriving shall now be yours until you die  he paused but lionel made no attempt to avail himself of this his courage all gone out of him again as suddenly as it had flickered up he cowered where he had been flung  before you go there is something else sakrelbahr resumed something for which i have had you brought hither tonight  not content with having delivered me to all this not content with having branded me a murderer destroyed my good name filched my possessions and driven me into the very path of hell you must further set about usurping my place in the false heart of this woman i once loved  i hope he went on reflectively that in your own poor way you love her too lionel thus to the torment that awaits your body shall be added torment for your treacherous soulsuch torture of mind as only the damned may know to that end have i brought you hither that you may realize something of what is in store for this woman at my hands that you may take the thought of it with you to be to your mind worse than the boatswains lash to your pampered body  you devil snarled lionel oh you fiend out of hell  if you will manufacture devils little toad of a brother do not upbraid them for being devils when next you meet them  give him no heed lionel said rosamund i shall prove him as much a boaster as he has proved himself a villain never think that he will be able to work his evil will  tis you are the boaster there said sakrelbahr and for the rest i am what you and he between you have made me  did we make you liar and cowardfor that is what you are indeed she answered  coward he echoed in genuine surprise twill be some lie that he has told you with the others in what pray was i ever a coward  in what in this that you do now in this taunting and torturing of two helpless beings in our power  i speak not of what i am he replied for i have told you that i am what you have made me i speak of what i was i speak of the past  she looked at him and she seemed to measure him with her unwavering glance  you speak of the past she echoed her voice low you speak of the past and to me you dare  it is that we might speak of it together that i have fetched you all the way from england that at last i may tell you things i was a fool to have kept from you five years ago that we may resume a conversation which you interrupted when you dismissed me  i did you a monstrous injury no doubt she answered him with bitter irony i was surely wanting in consideration it would have become me better to have smiled and fawned upon my brothers murderer  i swore to you then that i was not his murderer he reminded her in a voice that shook  and i answered you that you lied  ay and on that you dismissed methe word of the man whom you professed to love the word of the man to whom you had given your trust weighing for naught with you  when i gave you my trust she retorted i did so in ignorance of your true self in a headstrong wilful ignorance that would not be guided by what all the world said of you and your wild ways for that blind wilfulness i have been punished as perhaps i deserved to be  liesall lies he stormed those ways of mineand god knows they were none so wild when all is saidi abandoned when i came to love you no lover since the world began was ever so cleansed so purified so sanctified by love as was i  spare me this at least she cried on a note of loathing  spare you he echoed what shall i spare you  the shame of it all the shame that is ever mine in the reflection that for a season i believed i loved you  he smiled if you can still feel shame it shall overwhelm you ere i have done for you shall hear me out here there are none to interrupt us none to thwart my sovereign will reflect then and remember remember what a pride you took in the change you had wrought in me your vanity welcomed that flattery that tribute to the power of your beauty yet all in a moment upon the paltriest grounds you believed me the murderer of your brother  the paltriest grounds she cried protesting almost despite herself  so paltry that the justices at truro would not move against me  because she cut in they accounted that you had been sufficiently provoked because you had not sworn to them as you swore to me that no provocation should ever drive you to raise your hand against my brother because they did not realize how false and how forsworn you were  he considered her a moment then he took a turn on the terrace lionel crouching ever by the rosetree was almost entirely forgotten by him now  god give me patience with you he said at length i need it for i desire you to understand many things this night i mean you to see how just is my resentment how just the punishment that is to overtake you for what you have made of my life and perhaps of my hereafter justice baine and another who is dead knew me for innocent  they knew you for innocent there was scornful amazement in her tone were they not witnesses of the quarrel betwixt you and peter and of your oath that you would kill him  that was an oath sworn in the heat of anger afterwards i bethought me that he was your brother  afterwards said she after you had murdered him  i say again oliver replied calmly that i did not do this thing  and i say again that you lie  he considered her for a long moment then he laughed have you ever he asked known a man to lie without some purpose men lie for the sake of profit they lie out of cowardice or malice or else because they are vain and vulgar boasters i know of no other causes that will drive a man to falsehood save thatah yes and he flashed a sidelong glance at lionelsave that sometimes a man will lie to shield another out of selfsacrifice there you have all the spurs that urge a man to falsehood can any of these be urging me tonight reflect ask yourself what purpose i could serve by lying to you now consider further that i have come to loathe you for your unfaith that i desire naught so much as to punish you for that and for all its bitter consequences to me that i have brought you hither to exact payment from you to the uttermost farthing what end then can i serve by falsehood  all this being so what end could you serve by truth she countered  to make you realize to the full the injustice that you did to make you understand the wrongs for which you are called to pay to prevent you from conceiving yourself a martyr to make you perceive in all its deadly bitterness that what now comes to you is the inevitable fruit of your own faithlessness  sir oliver do you think me a fool she asked him  madam i doand worse he answered  ay that is clear she agreed scornfully since even now you waste breath in attempting to persuade me against my reason but words will not blot out facts and though you talk from now till the day of judgment no word of yours can efface those bloodstains in the snow that formed a trail from that poor murdered body to your own door no word of yours can extinguish the memory of the hatred between him and you and of your own threat to kill him nor can it stifle the recollection of the public voice demanding your punishment you dare to take such a tone as you are taking with me you dare here under heaven to stand and lie to me that you may give false gloze to the villainy of your present deedfor that is the purpose of your falsehood since you asked me what purpose there could be for it what had you to set against all that to convince me that your hands were clean to induce me to keep the troth whichgod forgive mei had plighted to you  my word he answered her in a ringing voice  your lie she amended  do not suppose said he that i could not support my word by proofs if called upon to do so  proofs she stared at him wideeyed a moment then her lip curled and that no doubt was the reason of your flight when you heard that the queens pursuivants were coming in response to the public voice to call you to account  he stood at gaze a moment utterly dumbfounded my flight he said what fables that  you will tell me next that you did not flee that that is another false charge against you  so he said slowly it was believed i fled  and then light burst upon him to dazzle and stun him it was so inevitably what must have been believed and yet it had never crossed his mind o the damnable simplicity of it at another time his disappearance must have provoked comment and investigation perhaps but happening when it did the answer to it came promptly and convincingly and no man troubled to question further thus was lionels task made doubly easy thus was his own guilt made doubly sure in the eyes of all his head sank upon his breast what had he done could he still blame rosamund for having been convinced by so overwhelming a piece of evidence could he still blame her if she had burnt unopened the letter which he had sent her by the hand of pitt what else indeed could any suppose but that he had fled and that being so clearly such a flight must brand him irrefutably for the murderer he was alleged to be how could he blame her if she had ultimately been convinced by the only reasonable assumption possible  a sudden sense of the wrong he had done rose now like a tide about him  my god he groaned like a man in pain my god  he looked at her and then averted his glance again unable now to endure the haggard strained yet fearless gaze of those brave eyes of hers  what else indeed could you believe he muttered brokenly thus giving some utterance to what was passing through his mind  naught else but the whole vile truth she answered fiercely and thereby stung him anew whipped him out of his sudden weakening back to his mood of resentment and vindictiveness  she had shown herself he thought in that moment of reviving anger too ready to believe what told against him  the truth he echoed and eyed her boldly now do you know the truth when you see it we shall discover for by gods light you shall have the truth laid stark before you now and you shall find it hideous beyond all your hideous imaginings  there was something so compelling now in his tone and manner that it drove her to realize that some revelation was impending she was conscious of a faint excitement a reflection perhaps of the wild excitement that was astir in him  your brother he began met his death at the hands of a false weakling whom i loved towards whom i had a sacred duty straight from the deed he fled to me for shelter a wound he had taken in the struggle left that trail of blood to mark the way he had come he paused and his tone became gentler it assumed the level note of one who reasons impassively was it not an odd thing now that none should ever have paused to seek with certainty whence that blood proceeded and to consider that i bore no wound in those days master baine knew it for i submitted my body to his examination and a document was drawn up and duly attested which should have sent the queens pursuivants back to london with drooping tails had i been at penarrow to receive them  faintly through her mind stirred the memory that master baine had urged the existence of some such document that in fact he had gone so far as to have made oath of this very circumstance now urged by sir oliver and she remembered that the matter had been brushed aside as an invention of the justices to answer the charge of laxity in the performance of his duty particularly as the only cowitness he could cite was sir andrew flack the parson since deceased sir olivers voice drew her attention from that memory  but let that be he was saying let us come back to the story itself i gave the craven weakling shelter thereby i drew down suspicion upon myself and since i could not clear myself save by denouncing him i kept silent that suspicion drew to certainty when the woman to whom i was betrothed recking nothing of my oaths freely believing the very worst of me made an end of our betrothal and thereby branded me a murderer and a liar in the eyes of all indignation swelled against me the queens pursuivants were on their way to do what the justices of truro refused to do  so far i have given you facts now i give you surmisemy own conclusionsbut surmise that strikes as you shall judge the very bullseye of truth that dastard to whom i had given sanctuary to whom i had served as a cloak measured my nature by his own and feared that i must prove unequal to the fresh burden to be cast upon me he feared lest under the strain of it i should speak out advance my proofs and so destroy him there was the matter of that wound and there was something still more unanswerable he feared i might have urged there was a certain womana wanton up at malpaswho could have been made to speak who could have revealed a rivalry concerning her betwixt the slayer and your brother for the affair in which peter godolphin met his death was a pitifully shamefully sordid one at bottom  for the first time she interrupted him fiercely do you malign the dead  patience mistress he commanded i malign none i speak the truth of a dead man that the truth may be known of two living ones hear me out then i have waited long and survived a deal that i might tell you this  that craven then conceived that i might become a danger to him so he decided to remove me he contrived to have me kidnapped one night and put aboard a vessel to be carried to barbary and sold there as a slave that is the truth of my disappearance and the slayer whom i had befriended and sheltered at my own bitter cost profited yet further by my removal god knows whether the prospect of such profit was a further temptation to him in time he came to succeed me in my possessions and at last to succeed me even in the affections of the faithless woman who once had been my affianced wife  at last she started from the frozen patience in which she had listened hitherto do you say that that lionel she was beginning in a voice choked by indignation  and then lionel spoke at last straightening himself into a stiffly upright attitude  he lies he cried he lies rosamund do not heed him  i do not she answered turning away  a wave of colour suffused the swarthy face of sakrelbahr a moment his eyes followed her as she moved away a step or two then they turned their blazing light of anger upon lionel he strode silently across to him his mien so menacing that lionel shrank back in fresh terror  sakrelbahr caught his brothers wrist in a grip that was as that of a steel manacle well have the truth this night if we have to tear it from you with redhot pincers he said between his teeth  he dragged him forward to the middle of the terrace and held him there before rosamund forcing him down upon his knees into a cowering attitude by the violence of that grip upon his wrist  do you know aught of the ingenuity of moorish torture he asked him you may have heard of the rack and the wheel and the thumbscrew at home they are instruments of voluptuous delight compared with the contrivances of barbary to loosen stubborn tongues  white and tense her hands clenched rosamund seemed to stiffen before him  you coward you cur you craven renegade dog she branded him  oliver released his brothers wrist and beat his hands together without heeding rosamund he looked down upon lionel who cowered shuddering at his feet  what do you say to a match between your fingers or do you think a pair of bracelets of living fire would answer better to begin with  a squat sandybearded turbaned fellow rolling slightly in his gait cameas had been prearrangedto answer the corsairs summons  with the toe of his slipper sakrelbahr stirred his brother  look up dog he bade him consider me that man and see if you know him again look at him i say and lionel looked yet since clearly he did so without recognition his brother explained his name among christians was jasper leigh he was the skipper you bribed to carry me into barbary he was taken in his own toils when his ship was sunk by spaniards later he fell into my power and because i forebore from hanging him he is today my faithful follower i should bid him tell you what he knows he continued turning to rosamund if i thought you would believe his tale but since i am assured you would not i will take other means he swung round to jasper again bid ali heat me a pair of steel manacles in a brazier and hold them in readiness against my need of them and he waved his hand  jasper bowed and vanished  the bracelets shall coax confession from your own lips my brother  i have naught to confess protested lionel you may force lies from me with your ruffianly tortures  oliver smiled not a doubt but that lies will flow from you more readily than truth but we shall have truth too in the end never doubt it he was mocking and there was a subtle purpose underlying his mockery and you shall tell a full story he continued in all its details so that mistress rosamunds last doubt shall vanish you shall tell her how you lay in wait for him that evening in godolphin park how you took him unawares and  that is false cried lionel in a passion of sincerity that brought him to his feet  it was false indeed and oliver knew it and deliberately had recourse to falsehood using it as a fulcrum upon which to lever out the truth he was cunning as all the fiends and never perhaps did he better manifest his cunning  false he cried with scorn come now be reasonable the truth ere torture sucks it out of you reflect that i know allexactly as you told it me how was it now lurking behind a bush you sprang upon him unawares and ran him through before he could so much as lay a hand to his sword and so  the lie of that is proven by the very facts themselves was the furious interruption a subtle judge of tones might have realized that here was truth indeed angry indignant truth that compelled conviction his sword lay beside him when they found him  but oliver was loftily disdainful do i not know yourself you drew it after you had slain him  the taunt performed its deadly work for just one instant lionel was carried off his feet by the luxury of his genuine indignation and in that one instant he was lost  as gods my witness that is false he cried wildly and you know it i fought him fair  he checked on a long shuddering indrawn breath that was horrible to hear  then silence followed all three remaining motionless as statues rosamund white and tense oliver grim and sardonic lionel limp and overwhelmed by the consciousness of how he had been lured into selfbetrayal  at last it was rosamund who spoke and her voice shook and shifted from key to key despite her strained attempt to keep it level  what what did you say lionel she asked oliver laughed softly he was about to add proof of his statement i think he jeered he was about to mention the wound he took in that fight which left those tracks in the snow thus to prove that i liedas indeed i didwhen i said that he took peter unawares  lionel she cried she advanced a step and made as if to hold out her arms to him then let them fall again beside her he stood stricken answering nothing lionel she cried again her voice growing suddenly shrill is this true  did you not hear him say it quoth oliver  she stood swaying a moment looking at lionel her white face distorted into a mask of unutterable pain oliver stepped towards her ready to support her fearing that she was about to fall but with an imperious hand she checked his advance and by a supreme effort controlled her weakness yet her knees shook under her refusing their office she sank down upon the divan and covered her face with her hands  god pity me she moaned and sat huddled there shaken with sobs  lionel started at that heartbroken cry cowering he approached her and oliver grim and sardonic stood back a spectator of the scene he had precipitated he knew that given rope lionel would enmesh himself still further there must be explanations that would damn him utterly oliver was well content to look on  rosamund came lionels piteous cry rose have mercy listen ere you judge me listen lest you misjudge me  ay listen to him oliver flung in with his soft hateful laugh listen to him i doubt hell be vastly entertaining  that sneer was a spur to the wretched lionel rosamund all that he has told you of it is false iiit was done in selfdefence it is a lie that i took him unawares his words came wildly now we had quarrelled about about a certain matter and as the devil would have it we met that evening in godolphin park he and i he taunted me he struck me and finally he drew upon me and forced me to draw that i might defend my life that is the truth i swear to you here on my knees in the sight of heaven and  enough sir enough she broke in controlling herself to check these protests that but heightened her disgust  nay hear me yet i implore you that knowing all you may be merciful in your judgment  merciful she cried and almost seemed to laugh  it was an accident that i slew him lionel raved on i never meant it i never meant to do more than ward and preserve my life but when swords are crossed more may happen than a man intends i take god to witness that his death was an accident resulting from his own fury  she had checked her sobs and she considered him now with eyes that were hard and terrible  was it also an accident that you left me and all the world in the belief that the deed was your brothers she asked him  he covered his face as if unable to endure her glance did you but know how i loved youeven in those days in secretyou would perhaps pity me a little he whimpered  pity she leaned forward and seemed to spit the word at him sdeath man do you sue for pityyou  yet you must pity me did you know the greatness of the temptation to which i succumbed  i know the greatness of your infamy of your falseness of your cowardice of your baseness oh  he stretched out suppliant hands to her there were tears now in his eyes of your charity rosamund he was beginning when at last oliver intervened  i think you are wearying the lady he said and stirred him with his foot relate to us instead some more of your astounding accidents they are more diverting elucidate the accident by which you had me kidnapped to be sold into slavery tell us of the accident by which you succeeded to my property expound to the full the accidental circumstances of which throughout you have been the unfortunate victim come man ply your wits twill make a pretty tale  and then came jasper to announce that ali waited with the brazier and the heated manacles  they are no longer needed said oliver take this slave hence with you bid ali to take charge of him and at dawn to see him chained to one of the oars of my galeasse away with him  lionel rose to his feet his face ashen wait ah wait rosamund he cried  oliver caught him by the nape of his neck spun him round and flung him into the arms of jasper take him away he growled and jasper took the wretch by the shoulders and urged him out leaving rosamund and oliver alone with the truth under the stars of barbary     chapter xii the subtlety of fenzileh   oliver considered the woman for a long moment as she sat halfcrouching on the divan her hands locked her face set and stony her eyes lowered he sighed gently and turned away he paced to the parapet and looked out upon the city bathed in the white glare of the full risen moon there arose thence a hum of sound dominated however by the throbbing song of a nightingale somewhere in his garden and the croaking of the frogs by the pool in the valley  now that truth had been dragged from its well and tossed as it were into rosamunds lap he felt none of the fierce exultation which he had conceived that such an hour as this must bring him rather indeed was he saddened and oppressed to poison the unholy cup of joy which he had imagined himself draining with such thirsty zest there was that discovery of a measure of justification for her attitude towards him in her conviction that his disappearance was explained by flight  he was weighed down by a sense that he had put himself entirely in the wrong that in his vengeance he had overreached himself and he found the fruits of it which had seemed so desirably luscious turning to ashes in his mouth  long he stood there the silence between them entirely unbroken then at length he stirred turned from the parapet and paced slowly back until he came to stand beside the divan looking down upon her from his great height  at last you have heard the truth he said and as she made no answer he continued i am thankful it was surprised out of him before the torture was applied else you might have concluded that pain was wringing a false confession from him he paused but still she did not speak indeed she made no sign that she had heard him that he concluded was the man whom you preferred to me faith you did not flatter me as perhaps you may have learnt  at last she was moved from her silence and her voice came dull and hard i have learnt how little there is to choose between you she said it was to have been expected i might have known two brothers could not have been so dissimilar in nature oh i am learning a deal and swiftly  it was a speech that angered him that cast out entirely the softer mood that had been growing in him  you are learning he echoed what are you learning  knowledge of the ways of men  his teeth gleamed in his wry smile i hope the knowledge will bring you as much bitterness as the knowledge of womenof one womanhas brought me to have believed me what you believed meme whom you conceived yourself to love he felt perhaps the need to repeat it that he might keep the grounds of his grievance well before his mind  if i have a mercy to beg of you it is that you will not shame me with the reminder  of your faithlessness he asked of your disloyal readiness to believe the worst evil of me  of my ever having believed that i loved you that is the thought that shames me as nothing else in life could shame me as not even the slavemarket and all the insult to which you have submitted me could shame me you taunt me with my readiness to believe evil of you  i do more than taunt you with it he broke in his anger mounting under the pitiless lash of her scorn i lay to your charge the wasted years of my life all the evil that has followed out of it all that i have suffered all that i have lost all that i am become  she looked up at him coldly astonishingly mistress of herself you lay all this to my charge she asked him  i do he was very vehement had you not used me as you did had you not lent a ready ear to lies that whelp my brother would never have gone to such lengths nor should i ever have afforded him the opportunity  she shifted on the cushions of the divan and turned her shoulder to him  all this is very idle she said coldly yet perhaps because she felt that she had need to justify herself she continued if after all i was so ready to believe evil of you it is that my instincts must have warned me of the evil that was ever in you you have proved to me tonight that it was not you who murdered peter but to attain that proof you have done a deed that is even fouler and more shameful a deed that reveals to the full the blackness of your heart have you not proved yourself a monster of vengeance and impiety she rose and faced him again in her sudden passion are you notyou that were born a cornish christian gentlemanbecome a heathen and a robber a renegade and a pirate have you not sacrificed your very god to your vengeful lust  he met her glance fully never quailing before her denunciation and when she had ended on that note of question he counterquestioned her  and your instincts had forewarned you of all this gods life woman can you invent no better tale than that he turned aside as two slaves entered bearing an earthenware vessel here comes your supper i hope your appetite is keener than your logic  they set the vessel from which a savoury smell proceeded upon the little moorish table by the divan on the ground beside it they placed a broad dish of baked earth in which there were a couple of loaves and a red shortnecked amphora of water with a drinkingcup placed over the mouth of it to act as a stopper  they salaamed profoundly and padded softly out again  sup he bade her shortly  i want no supper she replied her manner sullen  his cold eye played over her henceforth girl you will consider not what you want but what i bid you do i bid you eat about it therefore  i will not  will not he echoed slowly is that a speech from slave to master eat i say  i cannot i cannot she protested  a slave may not live who cannot do her masters bidding  then kill me she answered fiercely leaping up to confront and dare him kill me you are used to killing and for that at least i should be grateful  i will kill you if i please he said in level icy tones but not to please you you dont yet understand you are my slave my thing my property and i will not suffer you to be damaged save at my own good pleasure therefore eat or my nubians shall whip you to quicken appetite  for a moment she stood defiant before him white and resolute then quite suddenly as if her will was being bent and crumpled under the insistent pressure of his own she drooped and sank down again to the divan slowly reluctantly she drew the dish nearer watching her he laughed quite silently  she paused appearing to seek for something failing to find it she looked up at him again between scorn and intercession  am i to tear the meat with my fingers she demanded  his eyes gleamed with understanding or at least with suspicion but he answered her quite calmlyit is against the prophets law to defile meat or bread by the contact of a knife you must use the hands that god has given you  do you mock me with the prophet and his laws what are the prophets laws to me if eat i must at least i will not eat like a heathen dog but in christian fashion  to indulge her as it seemed he slowly drew the richly hilted dagger from his girdle let that serve you then he said and carelessly he tossed it down beside her  with a quick indrawn breath she pounced upon it at last she said you give me something for which i can be grateful to you and on the words she laid the point of it against her breast  like lightning he had dropped to one knee and his hand had closed about her wrist with such a grip that all her arm felt limp and powerless he was smiling into her eyes his swarthy face close to her own  did you indeed suppose i trusted you did you really think me deceived by your sudden pretence of yielding when will you learn that i am not a fool i did it but to test your spirit  then now you know its temper she replied you know my intention  forewarned forearmed said he  she looked at him with something that would have been mockery but for the contempt that coloured it too deeply is it so difficult a thing she asked to snap the thread of life are there no ways of dying save by the knife you boast yourself my master that i am your slave that having bought me in the marketplace i belong to you body and soul how idle is that boast my body you may bind and confine but my soul be very sure that you shall be cheated of your bargain you boast yourself lord of life and death a lie death is all that you can command  quick steps came pattering up the stairs and before he could answer her before he had thought of words in which to do so ali confronted him with the astounding announcement that there was a woman below asking urgently to speak with him  a woman he questioned frowning a nasrani woman do you mean  no my lord a muslim was the still more surprising information  a muslim woman here impossible  but even as he spoke a dark figure glided like a shadow across the threshold on to the terrace she was in black from head to foot including the veil that shrouded her a veil of the proportions of a mantle serving to dissemble her very shape  ali swung upon her in a rage did i not bid thee wait below thou daughter of shame he stormed she has followed me up my lord to thrust herself in here upon you shall i drive her forth  let her be said sakrelbahr and he waved ali away leave us  something about that black immovable figure arrested his attention and fired his suspicions unaccountably almost it brought to his mind the thought of ayoubelsarnin and the bidding there had been for rosamund in the sôk  he stood waiting for his visitor to speak and disclose herself she on her side continued immovable until alis footsteps had faded in the distance then with a boldness entirely characteristic with the recklessness that betrayed her european origin intolerant of the muslim restraint imposed upon her sex she did what no truebelieving woman would have done she tossed back that long black veil and disclosed the pale countenance and languorous eyes of fenzileh  for all that it was no more than he had expected yet upon beholding herher countenance thus bared to his regardhe recoiled a step  fenzileh he cried what madness is this  having announced herself in that dramatic fashion she composedly readjusted her veil so that her countenance should once more be decently concealed  to come here to my house and thus he protested should this reach the ears of thy lord how will it fare with thee and with me away woman and at once he bade her  no need to fear his knowing of this unless thyself thou tell him she answered to thee i need no excuse if thoult but remember that like thyself i was not born a muslim  but algiers is not thy native sicily and whatever thou wast born it were well to remember what thou art become  he went on at length to tell her of the precise degree of her folly but she cut in stemming his protestation in full flow  these are idle words that but delay me  to thy purpose then in allahs name that thus thou mayest depart the sooner  she came to it straight enough on that uncompromising summons she pointed to rosamund it concerns that slave said she i sent my wazeer to the sôk today with orders to purchase her for me  so i had supposed he said  but it seems that she caught thy fancy and the fool suffered himself to be outbidden  well  thoult relinquish her to me at the price she cost thee a faint note of anxiety trembled in her voice  i am anguished to deny thee o fenzileh she is not for sale  ah wait she cried the price paid was highmany times higher than i have ever heard tell was given for a slave however lovely yet i covet her tis a whim of mine and i cannot suffer to be thwarted in my whims to gratify this one i will pay three thousand philips  he looked at her and wondered what devilries might be stirring in her mind what evil purpose she desired to serve  thoult pay three thousand philips he said slowly then bluntly asked her why  to gratify a whim to please a fancy  what is the nature of this costly whim he insisted  the desire to possess her for my own she answered evasively  and this desire to possess her whence is it sprung he returned as patient as he was relentless  you ask too many questions she exclaimed with a flash of anger  he shrugged and smiled you answer too few  she set her arms akimbo and faced him squarely faintly through her veil he caught the gleam of her eyes and he cursed the advantage she had in that her face was covered from his reading  in a word oliverreis said she wilt sell her for three thousand philips  in a wordno he answered her  thoult not not for three thousand philips her voice was charged with surprise and he wondered was it real or assumed  not for thirty thousand answered he she is mine and ill not relinquish her so since i have proclaimed my mind and since to tarry here is fraught with peril for us both i beg thee to depart  there fell a little pause and neither of them noticed the alert interest stamped upon the white face of rosamund neither of them suspected her knowledge of french which enabled her to follow most of what was said in the lingua franca they employed  fenzileh drew close to him thoult not relinquish her eh she asked and he was sure she sneered be not so confident thoult be forced to it my friendif not to me why then to asad he is coming for her himself in person  asad he cried startled now  asadeddin she answered and upon that resumed her pleading come then it were surely better to make a good bargain with me than a bad one with the basha  he shook his head and planted his feet squarely i intend to make no bargain with either of you this slave is not for sale  shalt thou dare resist asad i tell thee he will take her whether she be for sale or not  i see he said his eyes narrowing and the fear of this then is the source of thy whim to acquire her for thyself thou art not subtle o fenzileh the consciousness that thine own charms are fading sets thee trembling lest so much loveliness should entirely cast thee from thy lords regard eh  if he could not see her face and study there the effect of that thrust of his at least he observed the quiver that ran through her muffled figure he caught the note of anger that throbbed in her replyand if that were so what ist to thee  it may be much or little he replied thoughtfully  indeed it should be much she answered quickly breathlessly have i not ever been thy friend have i not ever urged thy valour on my lords notice and wrought like a true friend for thine advancement sakrelbahr  he laughed outright hast thou so quoth he  laugh as thou wilt but it is true she insisted lose me and thy most valuable ally is lostone who has the ear and favour of her lord for look sakrelbahr it is what would befall if another came to fill my place another who might poison asads mind with lies against theefor surely she cannot love thee this frankish girl whom thou hast torn from her home  be not concerned for that he answered lightly his wits striving in vain to plumb the depths and discover the nature of her purpose this slave of mine shall never usurp thy place beside asad  o fool asad will take her whether she be for sale or not  he looked down upon her head on one side and arms akimbo if he can take her from me the more easily can he take her from thee no doubt thou hast considered that and in some dark sicilian way considered too how to provide against it but the costhast thou counted that what will asad say to thee when he learns how thou hast thwarted him  what do i care for that she cried in sudden fury her gestures becoming a little wild she will be at the bottom of the harbour by then with a stone about her neck he may have me whipped no doubt he will but twill end there he will require me to console him for his loss and so all will be well again  at last he had drawn her pumped her dry as he imagined indeed indeed he thought he had been right to say she was not subtle he had been a fool to have permitted himself to be intrigued by so shallow so obvious a purpose he shrugged and turned away from her  depart in peace o fenzileh he said i yield her to nonebe his name asad or shaitan  his tone was final and her answer seemed to accept at last his determination yet she was very quick with that answer so quick that he might have suspected it to be preconceived  then it is surely thine intent to wed her no voice could have been more innocent and guileless than was hers now if so she went on it were best done quickly for marriage is the only barrier asad will not overthrow he is devout and out of his deep reverence for the prophets law he would be sure to respect such a bond as that but be very sure that he will respect nothing short of it  yet notwithstanding her innocence and assumed simplicitybecause of it perhapshe read her as if she had been an open book it no longer mattered that her face was veiled  and thy purpose would be equally well served eh he questioned her sly in his turn  equally she admitted  say better fenzileh he rejoined i said thou art not subtle by the koran i lied thou art subtle as the serpent yet i see whither thou art gliding were i to be guided by thine advice a twofold purpose would be served first i should place her beyond asads reach and second i should be embroiled with him for having done so what could more completely satisfy thy wishes  thou dost me wrong she protested i have ever been thy friend i would that she broke off suddenly to listen the stillness of the night was broken by cries from the direction of the babeloueb she ran swiftly to the parapet whence the gate was to be seen and leaned far out  look look she cried and there was a tremor of fear in her voice it is heasadeddin  sakrelbahr crossed to her side and in a glare of torches saw a body of men coming forth from the black archway of the gate  it almost seems as if departing from thy usual custom thou hast spoken truth o fenzileh  she faced him and he suspected the venomous glance darted at him through her veil yet her voice when she spoke was cold in a moment thoult have no single doubt of it but what of me the question was added in a quickening tone he must not find me here he would kill me i think  i am sure he would sakrelbahr agreed yet muffled thus who should recognize thee away then ere he comes take cover in the courtyard until he shall have passed didst thou come alone  should i trust anyone with the knowledge that i had visited thee she asked and he admired the strong sicilian spirit in her that not all these years in the bashas hareem had sufficed to extinguish  she moved quickly to the door to pause again on the threshold  thoult not relinquish her thoult not  be at ease he answered her on so resolved a note that she departed satisfied     chapter xiii in the sight of allah   sakrelbahr stood lost in thought after she had gone again he weighed her every word and considered precisely how he should meet asad and how refuse him if the bashas were indeed such an errand as fenzileh had heralded  thus in silence he remained waiting for ali or another to summon him to the presence of the basha instead however when ali entered it was actually to announce asadeddin who followed immediately upon his heels having insisted in his impatience upon being conducted straight to the presence of sakrelbahr  the peace of the prophet upon thee my son was the bashas greeting  and upon thee my lord sakrelbahr salaamed my house is honoured with a gesture he dismissed ali  i come to thee a suppliant said asad advancing  a suppliant thou no need my lord i have no will that is not the echo of thine own  the bashas questing eyes went beyond him and glowed as they rested upon rosamund  i come in haste he said like any callow lover guided by my every instinct to the presence of her i seekthis frankish pearl this penfaced captive of thy latest raid i was away from the kasbah when that pig tsamanni returned thither from the sôk but when at last i learnt that he had failed to purchase her as i commanded i could have wept for very grief i feared at first that some merchant from the sus might have bought her and departed but when i heardblessed be allahthat thou wert the buyer i was comforted again for thoult yield her up to me my son  he spoke with such confidence that oliver had a difficulty in choosing the words that were to disillusion him therefore he stood in hesitancy a moment  i will make good thy loss asad ran on thou shalt have the sixteen hundred philips paid and another five hundred to console thee say that will content thee for i boil with impatience  sakrelbahr smiled grimly it is an impatience well known to me my lord where she is concerned he answered slowly i boiled with it myself for five interminable years to make an end of it i went a distant perilous voyage to england in a captured frankish vessel thou didst not know o asad else thou wouldst  bah broke in the basha thourt a huckster born there is none like thee sakrelbahr in any game of wits well well name thine own price strike thine own profit out of my impatience and let us have done  my lord he said quietly it is not the profit that is in question she is not for sale  asad blinked at him speechless and slowly a faint colour crept into his sallow cheeks  not not for sale he echoed faltering in his amazement  not if thou offered me thy bashalik as the price of her was the solemn answer then more warmly in a voice that held a note of intercessionask anything else that is mine he continued and gladly will i lay it at thy feet in earnest of my loyalty and love for thee  but i want nothing else asads tone was impatient petulant almost i want this slave  then replied oliver i cast myself upon thy mercy and beseech thee to turn thine eyes elsewhere  asad scowled upon him dost thou deny me he demanded throwing back his head  alas said sakrelbahr  there fell a pause darker and darker grew the countenance of asad fiercer glowed the eyes he bent upon his lieutenant i see he said at last with a calm so oddly at variance with his looks as to be sinister i see it seems that there is more truth in fenzileh than i suspected so he considered the corsair a moment with his sunken smouldering eyes  then he addressed him in a tone that vibrated with his suppressed anger bethink thee sakrelbahr of what thou art of what i have made thee bethink thee of all the bounty these hands have lavished on thee thou art my own lieutenant and mayest one day be more in algiers there is none above thee save myself art then so thankless as to deny me the first thing i ask of thee truly is it written ungrateful is man  didst thou know began sakrelbahr all that is involved for me in this  i neither know nor care asad cut in whatever it may be it should be as naught when set against my will then he discarded anger for cajolery he set a hand upon sakrelbahrs stalwart shoulder come my son i will deal generously with thee out of my love and i will put thy refusal from my mind  be generous my lord to the point of forgetting that ever thou didst ask me for her  dost still refuse the voice honeyed an instant ago rang harsh again take care how far thou strain my patience even as i have raised thee from the dirt so at a word can i cast thee down again even as i broke the shackles that chained thee to the rowers bench so can i rivet them on thee anew  all this canst thou do sakrelbahr agreed and since knowing it i still hold to what is doubly mineby right of capture and of purchasethou mayest conceive how mighty are my reasons be merciful then asad  must i take her by force in spite of thee roared the basha  sakrelbahr stiffened he threw back his head and looked the basha squarely in the eyes  whilst i live not even that mayest thou do he answered  disloyal mutinous dog wilt thou resist meme  it is my prayer that thoult not be so ungenerous and unjust as to compel thy servant to a course so hateful  asad sneered is that thy last word he demanded  save only that in all things else i am thy slave o asad  a moment the basha stood regarding him his glance baleful then deliberately as one who has taken his resolve he strode to the door on the threshold he paused and turned again wait he said and on that threatening word departed  sakrelbahr remained a moment where he had stood during the interview then with a shrug he turned he met rosamunds eyes fixed intently upon him and invested with a look he could not read he found himself unable to meet it and he turned away it was inevitable that in such a moment the earlier stab of remorse should be repeated he had overreached himself indeed despair settled down upon him a full consciousness of the horrible thing he had done which seemed now so irrevocable in his silent anguish he almost conceived that he had mistaken his feelings for rosamund that far from hating her as he had supposed his love for her had not yet been slain else surely he should not be tortured now by the thought of her becoming asads prey if he hated her indeed as he had supposed he would have surrendered her and gloated  he wondered was his present frame of mind purely the result of his discovery that the appearances against him had been stronger far than he imagined so strong as to justify her conviction that he was her brothers slayer  and then her voice crisp and steady cut into his torture of consideration  why did you deny him  he swung round again to face her amazed horrorstricken  you understood he gasped  i understood enough said she this lingua franca is none so different from french and again she askedwhy did you deny him  he paced across to her side and stood looking down at her  do you ask why  indeed she said bitterly there is scarce the need perhaps and yet can it be that your lust of vengeance is so insatiable that sooner than willingly forgo an ounce of it you will lose your head  his face became grim again of course he sneered it would be so that youd interpret me  nay if i have asked it is because i doubt  do you realize what it can mean to become the prey of asadeddin  she shuddered and her glance fell from his yet her voice was composed when she answered himis it so very much worse than becoming the prey of oliverreis or sakrelbahr or whatever they may call you  if you say that it is all one to you theres an end to my opposing him he answered coldly you may go to him if i resisted himlike a fool perhapsit was for no sake of vengeance upon you it was because the thought of it fills me with horror  then it should fill you with horror of yourself no less said she  his answer startled her  perhaps it does he said scarcely above a murmur perhaps it does  she flashed him an upward glance and looked as if she would have spoken but he went on suddenly passionate without giving her time to interrupt him o god it needed this to show me the vileness of the thing i have done asad has no such motives as had i i wanted you that i might punish you but heo god he groaned and for a moment put his face to his hands  she rose slowly a strange agitation stirring in her her bosom galloping but in his overwrought condition he failed to observe it and then like a ray of hope to illumine his despair came the counsel that fenzileh had given him the barrier which she had said that asad being a devout muslim would never dare to violate  there is a way he cried there is the way suggested by fenzileh at the promptings of her malice an instant he hesitated his eyes averted then he made his plunge you must marry me  it was almost as if he had struck her she recoiled instantly suspicion awoke in her swiftly it drew to a conviction that he had but sought to trick her by a pretended penitence  marry you she echoed  ay he insisted and he set himself to explain to her how if she were his wife she must be sacred and inviolable to all good muslimeen that none could set a finger upon her without doing outrage to the prophets holy law and that whoever might be so disposed asad was not of those since asad was perfervidly devout thus only he ended can i place you beyond his reach  but she was still scornfully reluctant  it is too desperate a remedy even for so desperate an ill said she and thus drove him into a frenzy of impatience with her  you must i say he insisted almost angrily you mustor else consent to be borne this very night to asads hareemand not even as his wife but as his slave oh you must trust me for your own sake you must  trust you she cried and almost laughed in the intensity of her scorn trust you how can i trust one who is a renegade and worse  he controlled himself that he might reason with her that by cold logic he might conquer her consent  you are very unmerciful he said in judging me you leave out of all account the suffering through which i have gone and what yourself contributed to it knowing now how falsely i was accused and what other bitter wrongs i suffered consider that i was one to whom the man and the woman i most loved in all this world had proven false i had lost faith in man and in god and if i became a muslim a renegade and a corsair it was because there was no other gate by which i could escape the unutterable toil of the oar to which i had been chained he looked at her sadly can you find no excuse for me in all that  it moved her a little for if she maintained a hostile attitude at least she put aside her scorn  no wrongs she told him almost with sorrow in her voice could justify you in outraging chivalry in dishonouring your manhood in abusing your strength to persecute a woman whatever the causes that may have led to it you have fallen too low sir to make it possible that i should trust you  he bowed his head under the rebuke which already he had uttered in his own heart it was just and most deserved and since he recognized its justice he found it impossible to resent it  i know he said but i am not asking you to trust me to my profit but to your own it is for your sake alone that i implore you to do this upon a sudden inspiration he drew the heavy dagger from his girdle and proffered it hilt foremost if you need an earnest of my good faith he said take this knife with which tonight you attempted to stab yourself at the first sign that i am false to my trust use it as you willupon me or upon yourself  she pondered him in some surprise then slowly she put out her hand to take the weapon as he bade her  are you not afraid she asked him that i shall use it now and so make an end  i am trusting you he said that in return you may trust me further i am arming you against the worst for if it comes to choice between death and asad i shall approve your choice of death but let me add that it were foolish to choose death whilst yet there is a chance of life  what chance she asked with a faint return of her old scorn the chance of life with you  no he answered firmly if you will trust me i swear that i will seek to undo the evil i have done listen at dawn my galeasse sets out upon a raid i will convey you secretly aboard and find a way to land you in some christian countryitaly or francewhence you may make your way home again  but meanwhile she reminded him i shall have become your wife  he smiled wistfully do you still fear a trap can naught convince you of my sincerity a muslim marriage is not binding upon a christian and i shall account it no marriage it will be no more than a pretence to shelter you until we are away  how can i trust your word in that  how he paused baffled but only for a moment you have the dagger he answered pregnantly  she stood considering her eyes upon the weapons lividly gleaming blade and this marriage she asked how is it to take place  he explained to her then that by the muslim law all that was required was a declaration made before a kadi or his superior and in the presence of witnesses he was still at his explanation when from below there came a sound of voices the tramp of feet and the flash of torches  here is asad returning in force he cried and his voice trembled do you consent  but the kadi she inquired and by the question he knew that she was won to his way of saving her  i said the kadi or his superior asad himself shall be our priest his followers our witnesses  and if he refuses he will refuse she cried clasping her hands before her in her excitement  i shall not ask him i shall take him by surprise  it it must anger him he may avenge himself for what he must deem a trick  ay he answered wildeyed i have thought of that too but it is a risk we must run if we do not prevail then  i have the dagger she cried fearlessly  and for me there will be the rope or the sword he answered be calm they come  but the steps that pattered up the stairs were alis he flung upon the terrace in alarm  my lord my lord asadeddin is here in force he has an armed following with him  there is naught to fear said sakrelbahr with every show of calm all will be well  asad swept up the stairs and out upon that terrace to confront his rebellious lieutenant after him came a dozen blackrobed janissaries with scimitars along which the light of the torches rippled in little runnels as of blood  the basha came to a halt before sakrelbahr his arms majestically folded his head thrown back so that his long white beard jutted forward  i am returned he said to employ force where gentleness will not avail yet i pray that allah may have lighted thee to a wiser frame of mind  he has indeed my lord replied sakrelbahr  the praise to him exclaimed asad in a voice that rang with joy the girl then and he held out a hand  sakrelbahr stepped back to her and took her hand in his as if to lead her forward then he spoke the fateful words  in allahs holy name and in his allseeing eyes before thee asadeddin and in the presence of these witnesses i take this woman to be my wife by the merciful law of the prophet of allah the allwise the allpitying  the words were out and the thing was done before asad had realized the corsairs intent a gasp of dismay escaped him then his visage grew inflamed his eyes blazed  but sakrelbahr cool and undaunted before that royal anger took the scarf that lay about rosamunds shoulders and raising it flung it over her head so that her face was covered by it  may allah rot off the hand of him who in contempt of our lord mahomets holy law may dare to unveil that face and may allah bless this union and cast into the pit of gehenna any who shall attempt to dissolve a bond that is tied in his allseeing eyes  it was formidable too formidable for asadeddin behind him his janissaries like hounds in leash stood eagerly awaiting his command but none came he stood there breathing heavily swaying a little and turning from red to pale in the battle that was being fought within him between rage and vexation on the one hand and his profound piety on the other and as he yet hesitated perhaps sakrelbahr assisted his piety to gain the day  now you will understand why i would not yield her o mighty asad he said thyself hast thou oft and rightly reproached me with my celibacy reminding me that it is not pleasing in the sight of allah that it is unworthy a good muslim at last it hath pleased the prophet to send me such a maid as i could take to wife  asad bowed his head what is written is written he said in the voice of one who admonished himself then he raised his arms aloft allah is allknowing he declared his will be done  ameen said sakrelbahr very solemnly and with a great surge of thankful prayer to his own longforgotten god  the basha stayed yet a moment as if he would have spoken then abruptly he turned and waved a hand to his janissaries away was all he said to them and stalked out in their wake     chapter xiv the sign   from behind her lattice still breathless from the haste she had made and with her whelp marzak at her side fenzileh had witnessed that first angry return of the basha from the house of sakrelbahr  she had heard him bawling for abdul mohktar the leader of his janissaries and she had seen the hasty mustering of a score of these soldiers in the courtyard where the ruddy light of torches mingled with the white light of the full moon she had seen them go hurrying away with asad himself at their head and she had not known whether to weep or to laugh whether to fear or to rejoice  it is done marzak had cried exultantly the dog hath withstood him and so destroyed himself there will be an end to sakrelbahr this night and he had added the praise to allah  but from fenzileh came no response to his prayer of thanksgiving true sakrelbahr must be destroyed and by a sword that she herself had forged yet was it not inevitable that the stroke which laid him low must wound her on its repercussion that was the question to which now she sought an answer for all her eagerness to speed the corsair to his doom she had paused sufficiently to weigh the consequences to herself she had not overlooked the circumstance that an inevitable result of this must be asads appropriation of that frankish slavegirl but at the time it had seemed to her that even this price was worth paying to remove sakrelbahr definitely and finally from her sons pathwhich shows that after all fenzileh the mother was capable of some selfsacrifice she comforted herself now with the reflection that the influence whose waning she feared might be occasioned by the introduction of a rival into asads hareem would no longer be so vitally necessary to herself and marzak once sakrelbahr were removed the rest mattered none so much to her yet it mattered something and the present state of things left her uneasy her mind a cockpit of emotions her grasp could not encompass all her desires at once it seemed and whilst she could gloat over the gratification of one she must bewail the frustration of another yet in the main she felt that she should account herself the gainer  in this state of mind she had waited scarce heeding the savagely joyous and entirely selfish babblings of her cub who cared little what might betide his mother as the price of the removal of that hated rival from his path for him at least there was nothing but profit in the business no cause for anything but satisfaction and that satisfaction he voiced with a fine contempt for his mothers feelings  anon they witnessed asads return they saw the janissaries come swinging into the courtyard and range themselves there whilst the basha made his appearance walking slowly with steps that dragged a little his head sunk upon his breast his hands behind him they waited to see slaves following him leading or carrying the girl he had gone to fetch but they waited in vain intrigued and uneasy  they heard the harsh voice in which asad dismissed his followers and the clang of the closing gate and they saw him pacing there alone in the moonlight ever in that attitude of dejection  what had happened had he killed them both had the girl resisted him to such an extent that he had lost all patience and in one of those rages begotten of such resistance made an end of her  thus did fenzileh question herself and since she could not doubt but that sakrelbahr was slain she concluded that the rest must be as she conjectured yet the suspense torturing her she summoned ayoub and sent him to glean from abdul mohktar the tale of what had passed in his own hatred of sakrelbahr ayoub went willingly enough and hoping for the worst he returned disappointed with a tale that sowed dismay in fenzileh and marzak  fenzileh however made a swift recovery after all it was the best that could have happened it should not be difficult to transmute that obvious dejection of asads into resentment and to fan this into a rage that must end by consuming sakrelbahr and so the thing could be accomplished without jeopardy to her own place at asads side for it was inconceivable that he should now take rosamund to his hareem already the fact that she had been paraded with naked face among the faithful must in itself have been a difficult obstacle to his pride but it was utterly impossible that he could so subject his selfrespect to his desire as to take to himself a woman who had been the wife of his servant  fenzileh saw her way very clearly it was through asads devoutnessas she herself had advised though scarcely expecting such rich results as thesethat he had been thwarted by sakrelbahr that same devoutness must further be played upon now to do the rest  taking up a flimsy silken veil she went out to him where he now sat on the divan under the awning alone there in the tepidscented summer night she crept to his side with the soft graceful questing movements of a cat and sat there a moment unheeded almostsuch was his abstractionher head resting lightly against his shoulder  lord of my soul she murmured presently thou art sorrowing her voice was in itself a soft and soothing caress  he started and she caught the gleam of his eyes turned suddenly upon her  who told thee so he asked suspiciously  my heart she answered her voice melodious as a viol can sorrow burden thine and mine go light she wooed him is happiness possible to me when thou art downcast in there i felt thy melancholy and thy need of me and i am come to share thy burden or to bear it all for thee her arms were raised and her fingers interlocked themselves upon his shoulder  he looked down at her and his expression softened he needed comfort and never was she more welcome to him  gradually and with infinite skill she drew from him the story of what had happened when she had gathered it she loosed her indignation  the dog she cried the faithless ungrateful hound yet have i warned thee against him o light of my poor eyes and thou hast scorned me for the warnings uttered by my love now at last thou knowest him and he shall trouble thee no longer thoult cast him off reduce him again to the dust from which thy bounty raised him  but asad did not respond he sat there in a gloomy abstraction staring straight before him at last he sighed wearily he was just and he had a conscience as odd a thing as it was awkward in a corsair basha  in what hath befallen he answered moodily there is naught to justify me in casting aside the stoutest soldier of islam my duty to allah will not suffer it  yet his duty to thee suffered him to thwart thee o my lord she reminded him very softly  in my desiresay he answered and for a moment his voice quivered with passion then he repressed it and continued more calmlyshall my selfseeking overwhelm my duty to the faith shall the matter of a slavegirl urge me to sacrifice the bravest soldier of islam the stoutest champion of the prophets law shall i bring down upon my head the vengeance of the one by destroying a man who is a scourge of scorpions unto the infideland all this that i may gratify my personal anger against him that i may avenge the thwarting of a petty desire  dost thou still say o my life that sakrelbahr is the stoutest champion of the prophets law she asked him softly yet on a note of amazement  it is not i that say it but his deeds he answered sullenly  i know of one deed no truebeliever could have wrought if proof were needed of his infidelity he hath now afforded it in taking to himself a nasrani wife is it not written in the book to be read marry not idolatresses is not that the prophets law and hath he not broken it offending at once against allah and against thee o fountain of my soul  asad frowned here was truth indeed something that he had entirely overlooked yet justice compelled him still to defend sakrelbahr or else perhaps he but reasoned to prove to himself that the case against the corsair was indeed complete  he may have sinned in thoughtlessness he suggested  at that she cried out in admiration of him what a fount of mercy and forbearance art thou o father of marzak thourt right as in all things it was no doubt in thoughtlessness that he offended but would such thoughtlessness be possible in a truebelieverin one worthy to be dubbed by thee the champion of the prophets holy law  it was a shrewd thrust that pierced the armour of conscience in which he sought to empanoply himself he sat very thoughtful scowling darkly at the inky shadow of the wall which the moon was casting suddenly he rose  by allah thou art right he cried so that he thwarted me and kept that frankish woman for himself he cared not how he sinned against the law  she glided to her knees and coiled her arms about his waist looking up at him still art thou ever merciful ever sparing in adverse judgment is that all his fault o asad  all he questioned looking down at her what more is there  i would there were no more yet more there is to which thy angelic mercy blinds thee he did worse not merely was he reckless of how he sinned against the law he turned the law to his own base uses and so defiled it  how he asked quickly eagerly almost  he employed it as a bulwark behind which to shelter himself and her knowing that thou who art the lion and defender of the faith wouldst bend obediently to what is written in the book he married her to place her beyond thy reach  the praise to him who is allwise and lent me strength to do naught unworthy he cried in a great voice glorifying himself i might have slain him to dissolve the impious bond yet i obeyed what is written  thy forbearance hath given joy to the angels she answered him and yet a man was found so base as to trade upon it and upon thy piety o asad  he shook off her clasp and strode away from her a prey to agitation he paced to and fro in the moonlight there and she wellcontent reclined upon the cushions of the divan a thing of infinite grace her gleaming eyes discreetly veiled from himwaiting until her poison should have done its work  she saw him halt and fling up his arms as if apostrophizing heaven as if asking a question of the stars that twinkled in the wideflung nimbus of the moon  then at last he paced slowly back to her he was still undecided there was truth in what she had said yet he knew and weighed her hatred of sakrelbahr knew how it must urge her to put the worst construction upon any act of his knew her jealousy for marzak and so he mistrusted her arguments and mistrusted himself also there was his own love of sakrelbahr that would insist upon a place in the balance of his judgment his mind was in turmoil  enough he said almost roughly i pray that allah may send me counsel in the night and upon that he stalked past her up the steps and so into the house  she followed him all night she lay at his feet to be ready at the first peep of dawn to buttress a purpose that she feared was still weak and whilst he slept fitfully she slept not at all but lay wideeyed and watchful  at the first note of the mueddins voice he leapt from his couch obedient to its summons and scarce had the last note of it died upon the winds of dawn than he was afoot beating his hands together to summon slaves and issuing his orders from which she gathered that he was for the harbour there and then  may allah have inspired thee o my lord she cried and asked him what is thy resolve  i go to seek a sign he answered her and upon that departed leaving her in a frame of mind that was far from easy  she summoned marzak and bade him accompany his father breathed swift instructions of what he should do and how do it  thy fate has been placed in thine own hands she admonished him see that thou grip it firmly now  in the courtyard marzak found his father in the act of mounting a white mule that had been brought him  he was attended by his wazeer tsamanni biskaine and some other of his captains marzak begged leave to go with him it was carelessly granted and they set out marzak walking by his fathers stirrup a little in advance of the others for a while there was silence between father and son then the latter spoke  it is my prayer o my father that thou art resolved to depose the faithless sakrelbahr from the command of this expedition  asad considered his son with a sombre eye even now the galeasse should be setting out if the argosy is to be intercepted he said if sakrelbahr does not command who shall in heavens name  try me o my father cried marzak  asad smiled with grim wistfulness art weary of life o my son that thou wouldst go to thy death and take the galeasse to destruction  thou art less than just o my father marzak protested  yet more than kind o my son replied asad and they went on in silence thereafter until they came to the mole  the splendid galeasse was moored alongside and all about her there was great bustle of preparation for departure porters moved up and down the gangway that connected her with the shore carrying bales of provisions barrels of water kegs of gunpowder and other necessaries for the voyage and even as asad and his followers reached the head of that gangway four negroes were staggering down it under the load of a huge palmetto bale that was slung from staves yoked to their shoulders  on the poop stood sakrelbahr with othmani ali jasperreis and some other officers up and down the gangway paced larocque and vigitello two renegade boatswains one french and the other italian who had sailed with him on every voyage for the past two years larocque was superintending the loading of the vessel bawling his orders for the bestowal of provisions here of water yonder and of powder about the mainmast vigitello was making a final inspection of the slaves at the oars  as the palmetto pannier was brought aboard larocque shouted to the negroes to set it down by the mainmast but here sakrelbahr interfered bidding them instead to bring it up to the stern and place it in the poophouse  asad had dismounted and stood with marzak at his side at the head of the gangway when the youth finally begged his father himself to take command of this expedition allowing him to come as his lieutenant and so learn the ways of the sea  asad looked at him curiously but answered nothing he went aboard marzak and the others following him it was at this moment that sakrelbahr first became aware of the bashas presence and he came instantly forward to do the honours of his galley if there was a sudden uneasiness in his heart his face was calm and his glance as arrogant and steady as ever  may the peace of allah overshadow thee and thy house o mighty asad was his greeting we are on the point of casting off and i shall sail the more securely for thy blessing  asad considered him with eyes of wonder so much effrontery so much ease after their last scene together seemed to the basha a thing incredible unless indeed it were accompanied by a conscience entirely at peace  it has been proposed to me that i shall do more than bless this expeditionthat i shall command it he answered watching sakrelbahr closely he observed the sudden flicker of the corsairs eyes the only outward sign of his inward dismay  command it echoed sakrelbahr twas proposed to thee and he laughed lightly as if to dismiss that suggestion  that laugh was a tactical error it spurred asad he advanced slowly along the vessels waistdeck to the mainmastfor she was rigged with main and foremasts there he halted again to look into the face of sakrelbahr who stepped along beside him  why didst thou laugh he questioned shortly  why at the folly of such a proposal said sakrelbahr in haste too much in haste to seek a diplomatic answer  darker grew the bashas frown folly quoth he wherein lies the folly  sakrelbahr made haste to cover his mistake in the suggestion that such poor quarry as waits us should be worthy thine endeavour should warrant the lion of the faith to unsheathe his mighty claws thou he continued with ringing scorn thou the inspirer of a hundred glorious fights in which whole fleets have been engaged to take the seas upon so trivial an errandone galeasse to swoop upon a single galley of spain it were unworthy thy great name beneath the dignity of thy valour and by a gesture he contemptuously dismissed the subject  but asad continued to ponder him with cold eyes his face inscrutable why heres a change since yesterday he said  a change my lord  but yesterday in the marketplace thyself didst urge me to join this expedition and to command it asad reminded him speaking with deliberate emphasis thyself invoked the memory of the days that are gone when scimitar in hand we charged side by side aboard the infidel and thou didst beseech me to engage again beside thee and now he spread his hands anger gathered in his eyes whence this change he demanded sternly  sakrelbahr hesitated caught in his own toils he looked away from asad a moment he had a glimpse of the handsome flushed face of marzak at his fathers elbow of biskaine tsamanni and the others all staring at him in amazement and even of some grimy sunburned faces from the rowers bench on his left that were looking on with dull curiosity  he smiled seeming outwardly to remain entirely unruffled why it is that i have come to perceive thy reasons for refusing for the rest it is as i say the quarry is not worthy of the hunter  marzak uttered a soft sneering laugh as if the true reason of the corsairs attitude were quite clear to him he fancied too and he was right in this that sakrelbahrs odd attitude had accomplished what persuasions addressed to asadeddin might to the end have failed to accomplishhad afforded him the sign he was come to seek for it was in that moment that asad determined to take command himself  it almost seems he said slowly smiling as if thou didst not want me if so it is unfortunate for i have long neglected my duty to my son and i am resolved at last to repair that error we accompany thee upon this expedition sakrelbahr myself i will command it and marzak shall be my apprentice in the ways of the sea  sakrelbahr said not another word in protest against that proclaimed resolve he salaamed and when he spoke there was almost a note of gladness in his voice  the praise to allah then since thourt determined it is not for me to urge further the unworthiness of the quarry since i am the gainer by thy resolve     chapter xv the voyage   his resolve being taken asad drew tsamanni aside and spent some moments in talk with him giving him certain instructions for the conduct of affairs ashore during his absence that done and the wazeer dismissed the basha himself gave the order to cast off an order which there was no reason to delay since all was now in readiness  the gangway was drawn ashore the boatswains whistle sounded and the steersmen leapt to their niches in the stern grasping the shafts of the great steeringoars a second blast rang out and down the gangwaydeck came vigitello and two of his mates all three armed with long whips of bullockhide shouting to the slaves to make ready and then on the note of a third blast of larocques whistle the fiftyfour poised oars dipped to the water two hundred and fifty bodies bent as one and when they heaved themselves upright again the great galeasse shot forward and so set out upon her adventurous voyage from her mainmast the red flag with its green crescent was unfurled to the breeze and from the crowded mole and the beach where a long line of spectators had gathered there burst a great cry of valediction  that breeze blowing stiffly from the desert was lionels friend that day without it his career at the oar might have been short indeed he was chained like the rest stark naked save for a loincloth in the place nearest the gangway on the first starboard bench abaft the narrow waistdeck and ere the galeasse had made the short distance between the mole and the island at the end of it the boatswains whip had coiled itself about his white shoulders to urge him to better exertion than he was putting forth he had screamed under the cruel cut but none had heeded him lest the punishment should be repeated he had thrown all his weight into the next strokes of the oar until by the time the peñon was reached the sweat was running down his body and his heart was thudding against his ribs it was not possible that it could have lasted and his main agony lay in that he realized it and saw himself face to face with horrors inconceivable that must await the exhaustion of his strength he was not naturally robust and he had led a soft and pampered life that was very far from equipping him for such a test as this  but as they reached the peñon and felt the full vigour of that warm breeze sakrelbahr who by asads command remained in charge of the navigation ordered the unfurling of the enormous lateen sails on main and foremasts they ballooned out swelling to the wind and the galeasse surged forward at a speed that was more than doubled the order to cease rowing followed and the slaves were left to return thanks to heaven for their respite and to rest in their chains until such time as their sinews should be required again  the vessels vast prow which ended in a steel ram and was armed with a culverin on either quarter was crowded with lounging corsairs who took their ease there until the time to engage should be upon them they leaned on the high bulwarks or squatted in groups talking laughing some of them tailoring and repairing garments others burnishing their weapons or their armour and one swarthy youth there was who thrummed a gimri and sang a melancholy shilha lovesong to the delight of a score or so of bloodthirsty ruffians squatting about him in a ring of variegated colour  the gorgeous poop was fitted with a spacious cabin to which admission was gained by two archways curtained with stout silken tapestries upon whose deep red ground the crescent was wrought in brilliant green above the cabin stood the three cressets or sternlamps great structures of gilded iron surmounted each by the orb and crescent as if to continue the cabin forward and increase its size a green awning was erected from it to shade almost half the poopdeck here cushions were thrown and upon these squatted now asadeddin with marzak whilst biskaine and some three or four other officers who had escorted him aboard and whom he had retained beside him for that voyage were lounging upon the gilded balustrade at the poops forward end immediately above the rowers benches  sakrelbahr alone a solitary figure resplendent in caftan and turban that were of cloth of silver leaned upon the bulwarks of the larboard quarter of the poopdeck and looked moodily back upon the receding city of algiers which by now was no more than an agglomeration of white cubes piled up the hillside in the morning sunshine  asad watched him silently awhile from under his beetling brows then summoned him he came at once and stood respectfully before his prince  asad considered him a moment solemnly whilst a furtive malicious smile played over the beautiful countenance of his son  think not sakrelbahr he said at length that i bear thee resentment for what befell last night or that that happening is the sole cause of my present determination i had a dutya longneglected dutyto marzak which at last i have undertaken to perform he seemed to excuse himself almost and marzak misliked both words and tone why he wondered must this fierce old man who had made his name a terror throughout christendom be ever so soft and yielding where that stalwart and arrogant infidel was concerned  sakrelbahr bowed solemnly my lord he said it is not for me to question thy resolves or the thoughts that may have led to them it suffices me to know thy wishes they are my law  are they so said asad tartly thy deeds will scarce bear out thy protestations he sighed sorely was i wounded yesternight when thy marriage thwarted me and placed that frankish maid beyond my reach yet i respect this marriage of thine as all muslims mustfor all that in itself it was unlawful but there he ended with a shrug we sail together once again to crush the spaniard let no illwill on either side oercloud the splendour of our task  ameen to that my lord said sakrelbahr devoutly i almost feared  no more the basha interrupted him thou wert never a man to fear anything which is why i have loved thee as a son  but it suited marzak not at all that the matter should be thus dismissed that it should conclude upon a note of weakening from his father upon what indeed amounted to a speech of reconciliation before sakrelbahr could make answer he had cut in to set him a question laden with wicked intent  how will thy bride beguile the season of thine absence o sakrelbahr  i have lived too little with women to be able to give thee an answer said the corsair  marzak winced before a reply that seemed to reflect upon himself but he returned to the attack  i compassionate thee that art the slave of duty driven so soon to abandon the delight of her soft arms where hast thou bestowed her o captain  where should a muslim bestow his wife but according to the biddings of the prophetin the house  marzak sneered verily i marvel at thy fortitude in quitting her so soon  but asad caught the sneer and stared at his son what cause is there to marvel in that a true muslim should sacrifice his inclinations to the service of the faith his tone was a rebuke but it left marzak undismayed the youth sprawled gracefully upon his cushions one leg tucked under him  place no excess of faith in appearances o my father he said  no more growled the basha peace to thy tongue marzak and may allah the allknowing smile upon our expedition lending strength to our arms to smite the infidel to whom the fragrance of the garden is forbidden  to this again sakrelbahr replied ameen but an uneasiness abode in his heart summoned thither by the questions marzak had set him were they idle words calculated to do no more than plague him and to keep fresh in asads mind the memory of rosamund or were they based upon some actual knowledge  his fears were to be quickened soon on that same score he was leaning that afternoon upon the rail idly observing the doling out of the rations to the slaves when marzak came to join him  for some moments he stood silently beside sakrelbahr watching vigitello and his men as they passed from bench to bench serving out biscuits and dried dates to the rowersbut sparingly for oars move sluggishly when stomachs are too well nourishedand giving each to drink a cup of vinegar and water in which floated a few drops of added oil  then he pointed to a large palmetto bale that stood on the waistdeck near the mainmast about which the powder barrels were stacked  that pannier he said seems to me oddly in the way yonder were it not better to bestow it in the hold where it will cease to be an encumbrance in case of action  sakrelbahr experienced a slight tightening at the heart he knew that marzak had heard him command that bale to be borne into the poopcabin and that anon he had ordered it to be fetched thence when asad had announced his intention of sailing with him he realized that this in itself might be a suspicious circumstance or rather knowing what the bale contained he was too ready to fear suspicion nevertheless he turned to marzak with a smile of some disdain  i understood marzak that thou art sailing with us as apprentice  what then quoth marzak  why merely that it might become thee better to be content to observe and learn thoult soon be telling me how grapnels should be slung and how an action should be fought then he pointed ahead to what seemed to be no more than a low cloudbank towards which they were rapidly skimming before that friendly wind yonder he said are the balearics we are making good speed  although he said it without any object other than that of turning the conversation yet the fact itself was sufficiently remarkable to be worth a comment whether rowed by her two hundred and fifty slaves or sailed under her enormous spread of canvas there was no swifter vessel upon the mediterranean than the galeasse of sakrelbahr onward she leapt now with bellying tateens her wellgreased keel slipping through the windwhipped water at a rate which perhaps could not have been bettered by any ship that sailed  if this wind holds we shall be under the point of aguila before sunset which will be something to boast of hereafter he promised  marzak however seemed but indifferently interested his eyes continued awhile to stray towards that palmetto bale by the mainmast at length without another word to sakrelbahr he made his way abaft and flung himself down under the awning beside his father asad sat there in a moody abstraction already regretting that he should have lent an ear to fenzileh to the extent of coming upon this voyage and assured by now that at least there was no cause to mistrust sakrelbahr marsak came to revive that drooping mistrust but the moment was illchosen and at the first words he uttered on the subject he was growled into silence by his sire  thou dost but voice thine own malice asad rebuked him and i am proven a fool in that i have permitted the malice of others to urge me in this matter no more i say  thereupon marzak fell silent and sulking his eyes ever following sakrelbahr who had descended the three steps from the poop to the gangway and was pacing slowly down between the rowers benches  the corsair was supremely ill at ease as a man must be who has something to conceal and who begins to fear that he may have been betrayed yet who was there could have betrayed him but three men aboard that vessel knew his secretali his lieutenant jasper and the italian vigitello and sakrelbahr would have staked all his possessions that neither ali nor vigitello would have betrayed him whilst he was fairly confident that in his own interests jasper also must have kept faith yet marzaks allusion to that palmetto bale had filled him with an uneasiness that sent him now in quest of his italian boatswain whom he trusted above all others  vigitello said he is it possible that i have been betrayed to the basha  vigitello looked up sharply at the question then smiled with confidence they were standing alone by the bulwarks on the waistdeck  touching what we carry yonder quoth he his glance shifting to the bale impossible if asad had knowledge he would have betrayed it before we left algiers or else he would never have sailed without a stouter bodyguard of his own  what need of bodyguard for him returned sakrelbahr if it should come to grips between usas well it may if what i suspect be truethere is no doubt as to the side upon which the corsairs would range themselves  is there not quoth vigitello a smile upon his swarthy face be not so sure these men have most of them followed thee into a score of fights to them thou art the basha their natural leader  maybe but their allegiance belongs to asadeddin the exalted of allah did it come to a choice between us their faith would urge them to stand beside him in spite of any past bonds that may have existed between them and me  yet there were some who murmured when thou wert superseded in the command of this expedition vigitello informed him i doubt not that many would be influenced by their faith but many would stand by thee against the grand sultan himself and do not forget he added instinctively lowering his voice that many of us are renegadoes like myself and thee who would never know a moments doubt if it came to a choice of sides but i hope he ended in another tone there is no such danger here  and so do i in all faith replied sakrelbahr with fervour yet i am uneasy and i must know where i stand if the worst takes place go thou amongst the men vigitello and probe their real feelings gauge their humour and endeavour to ascertain upon what numbers i may count if i have to declare war upon asad or if he declares it upon me be cautious  vigitello closed one of his black eyes portentously depend upon it he said ill bring you word anon  on that they parted vigitello to make his way to the prow and there engage in his investigations sakrelbahr slowly to retrace his steps to the poop but at the first bench abaft the gangway he paused and looked down at the dejected whitefleshed slave who sat shackled there he smiled cruelly his own anxieties forgotten in the savour of vengeance  so you have tasted the whip already he said in english but that is nothing to what is yet to come you are in luck that there is a wind today it will not always be so soon shall you learn what it was that i endured by your contriving  lionel looked up at him with haggard bloodinjected eyes he wanted to curse his brother yet was he too overwhelmed by the sense of the fitness of this punishment  for myself i care nothing he replied  but you will sweet brother was the answer you will care for yourself most damnably and pity yourself most poignantly i speak from experience tis odds you will not live and that is my chief regret i would you had my thews to keep you alive in this floating hell  i tell you i care nothing for myself lionel insisted what have you done with rosamund  will it surprise you to learn that i have played the gentleman and married her oliver mocked him  married her his brother gasped blenching at the very thought you hound  why abuse me could i have done more and with a laugh he sauntered on leaving lionel to writhe there with the torment of his halfknowledge  an hour later when the cloudy outline of the balearic isles had acquired density and colour sakrelbahr and vigitello met again on the waistdeck and they exchanged some few words in passing  it is difficult to say exactly the boatswain murmured but from what i gather i think the odds would be very evenly balanced and it were rash in thee to precipitate a quarrel  i am not like to do so replied sakrelbahr i should not be like to do so in any case i but desired to know how i stand in case a quarrel should be forced upon me and he passed on  yet his uneasiness was no whit allayed his difficulties were very far from solved he had undertaken to carry rosamund to france or italy he had pledged her his word to land her upon one or the other shore and should he fail she might even come to conclude that such had never been his real intention yet how was he to succeed now since asad was aboard the galeasse must he be constrained to carry her back to algiers as secretly as he had brought her thence and to keep her there until another opportunity of setting her ashore upon a christian country should present itself that was clearly impracticable and fraught with too much risk of detection indeed the risk of detection was very imminent now at any moment her presence in that pannier might be betrayed he could think of no way in which to redeem his pledged word he could but wait and hope trusting to his luck and to some opportunity which it was impossible to foresee  and so for a long hour and more he paced there moodily to and fro his hands clasped behind him his turbaned head bowed in thought his heart very heavy within him he was taken in the toils of the evil web which he had spun and it seemed very clear to him now that nothing short of his life itself would be demanded as the price of it that however was the least part of his concern all things had miscarried with him and his life was wrecked if at the price of it he could ensure safety to rosamund that price he would gladly pay but his dismay and uneasiness all sprang from his inability to discover a way of achieving that most desired of objects even at such a sacrifice and so he paced on alone and very lonely waiting and praying for a miracle     chapter xvi the pannier   he was still pacing there when an hour or so before sunsetsome fifteen hours after setting outthey stood before the entrance of a long bottlenecked cove under the shadow of the cliffs of aquila point on the southern coast of the island of formentera he was rendered aware of this and roused from his abstraction by the voice of asad calling to him from the poop and commanding him to make the cove  already the wind was failing them and it became necessary to take to the oars as must in any case have happened once they were through the coves narrow neck in the becalmed lagoon beyond so sakrelbahr in his turn lifted up his voice and in answer to his shout came vigitello and larocque  a blast of vigitellos whistle brought his own men to heel and they passed rapidly along the benches ordering the rowers to make ready whilst jasper and a halfdozen muslim sailors set about furling the sails that already were beginning to flap in the shifting and intermittent gusts of the expiring wind sakrelbahr gave the word to row and vigitello blew a second and longer blast the oars dipped the slaves strained and the galeasse ploughed forward time being kept by a boatswains mate who squatted on the waistdeck and beat a tomtom rhythmically sakrelbahr standing on the poopdeck shouted his orders to the steersmen in their niches on either side of the stern and skilfully the vessel was manoeuvred through the narrow passage into the calm lagoon whose depths were crystal clear here before coming to rest sakrelbahr followed the invariable corsair practice of going about so as to be ready to leave his moorings and make for the open again at a moments notice  she came at last alongside the rocky buttresses of a gentle slope that was utterly deserted by all save a few wild goats browsing near the summit there were clumps of broom thick with golden flower about the base of the hill higher a few gnarled and aged olive trees reared their grey heads from which the rays of the westering sun struck a glint as of silver  larocque and a couple of sailors went over the bulwarks on the larboard quarter dropped lightly to the horizontal shafts of the oars which were rigidly poised and walking out upon them gained the rocks and proceeded to make fast the vessel by ropes fore and aft  sakrelbahrs next task was to set a watch and he appointed larocque sending him to take his station on the summit of the head whence a wide range of view was to be commanded  pacing the poop with marzak the basha grew reminiscent of former days when roving the seas as a simple corsair he had used this cove both for purposes of ambush and concealment there were he said few harbours in all the mediterranean so admirably suited to the corsairs purpose as this it was a haven of refuge in case of peril and an unrivalled lurkingplace in which to lie in wait for the prey he remembered once having lain there with the formidable dragutreis a fleet of six galleys their presence entirely unsuspected by the genoese admiral doria who had passed majestically along with three caravels and seven galleys  marzak pacing beside his father listened but halfheartedly to these reminiscences his mind was all upon sakrelbahr and his suspicions of that palmetto bale were quickened by the manner in which for the last two hours he had seen the corsair hovering thoughtfully in its neighbourhood  he broke in suddenly upon his fathers memories with an expression of what was in his mind  the thanks to allah he said that it is thou who command this expedition else might this coves advantages have been neglected  not so said asad sakrelbahr knows them as well as i do he has used this vantage point aforetime it was himself who suggested that this would be the very place in which to await this spanish craft  yet had he sailed alone i doubt if the spanish argosy had concerned him greatly there are other matters on his mind o my father observe him yonder all lost in thought how many hours of this voyage has he spent thus he is as a man trapped and desperate there is some fear rankling in him observe him i say  allah pardon thee said his father shaking his old head and sighing over so much impetuosity of judgment must thy imagination be for ever feeding on thy malice yet i blame not thee but thy sicilian mother who has fostered this hostility in thee did she not hoodwink me into making this unnecessary voyage  i see thou hast forgot last night and the frankish slavegirl said his son  nay then thou seest wrong i have not forgot it but neither have i forgot that since allah hath exalted me to be basha of algiers he looks to me to deal in justice come marzak set an end to all this perhaps tomorrow thou shalt see him in battle and after such a sight as that never again wilt thou dare say evil of him come make thy peace with him and let me see better relations betwixt you hereafter  and raising his voice he called sakrelbahr who immediately turned and came up the gangway marzak stood by in a sulky mood with no notion of doing his fathers will by holding out an olive branch to the man who was like to cheat him of his birthright ere all was done yet was it he who greeted sakrelbahr when the corsair set foot upon the poop  does the thought of the coming fight perturb thee dog of war he asked  am i perturbed pup of peace was the crisp answer  it seems so thine aloofness thine abstractions  are signs of perturbation dost suppose  of what else  sakrelbahr laughed thoult tell me next that i am afraid yet i should counsel thee to wait until thou hast smelt blood and powder and learnt precisely what fear is  the slight altercation drew the attention of asads officers who were idling there biskaine and some three others lounged forward to stand behind the basha looking on in some amusement which was shared by him  indeed indeed said asad laying a hand upon marzaks shoulder his counsel is sound enough wait boy until thou hast gone beside him aboard the infidel ere thou judge him easily perturbed  petulantly marzak shook off that gnarled old hand dost thou o my father join with him in taunting me upon my lack of knowledge my youth is a sufficient answer but at least he added prompted by a wicked notion suddenly conceived at least you cannot taunt me with lack of address with weapons  give him room said sakrelbahr with ironical goodhumour and he will show us prodigies  marzak looked at him with narrowing gleaming eyes give me a crossbow he retorted and ill show thee how to shoot was his amazing boast  thoult show him roared asad thoult show him and his laugh rang loud and hearty go smear the suns face with clay boy  reserve thy judgment o my father begged marzak with frosty dignity  boy thourt mad why sakrelbahrs quarrel will check a swallow in its flight  that is his boast belike replied marzak  and what may thine be quoth sakrelbahr to hit the island of formentera at this distance  dost dare to sneer at me cried marzak ruffling  what daring would that ask wondered sakrelbahr  by allah thou shalt learn  in all humility i await the lesson  and thou shalt have it was the answer viciously delivered marzak strode to the rail ho there vigitello a crossbow for me and another for sakrelbahr  vigitello sprang to obey him whilst asad shook his head and laughed again  an it were not against the prophets law to make a wager he was beginning when marzak interrupted him  already should i have proposed one  so that said sakrelbahr thy purse would come to match thine head for emptiness  marzak looked at him and sneered then he snatched from vigitellos hands one of the crossbows that he bore and set a shaft to it and then at last sakrelbahr was to learn the malice that was at the root of all this odd pretence  look now said the youth there is on that palmetto bale a speck of pitch scarce larger than the pupil of my eye thoult need to strain thy sight to see it observe how my shaft will find it canst thou better such a shot  his eyes upon sakrelbahrs face watching it closely observed the pallor by which it was suddenly overspread but the corsairs recovery was almost as swift he laughed seeming so entirely careless that marzak began to doubt whether he had paled indeed or whether his own imagination had led him to suppose it  ay thoult choose invisible marks and wherever the arrow enters thoult say twas there an old trick o marzak go cozen women with it  then said marzak we will take instead the slender cord that binds the bale and he levelled his bow but sakrelbahrs hand closed upon his arm in an easy yet paralyzing grip  wait he said thoult choose another mark for several reasons for one ill not have thy shaft blundering through my oarsmen and haply killing one of them most of them are slaves specially chosen for their brawn and i cannot spare any another reason is that the mark is a foolish one the distance is not more than ten paces a childish test which maybe is the reason why thou hast chosen it  marzak lowered his bow and sakrelbahr released his arm they looked at each other the corsair supremely master of himself and smiling easily no faintest trace of the terror that was in his soul showing upon his swarthy bearded countenance or in his hard pale eyes  he pointed up the hillside to the nearest olive tree a hundred paces distant yonder he said is a mans mark put me a shaft through the long branch of that first olive  asad and his officers voiced approval  a mans mark indeed said the basha so that he be a marksman  but marzak shrugged his shoulders with makebelieve contempt i knew he would refuse the mark i set said he as for the olivebranch it is so large a butt that a child could not miss it at this distance  if a child could not then thou shouldst not said sakrelbahr who had so placed himself that his body was now between marzak and the palmetto bale let us see thee hit it o marzak and as he spoke he raised his crossbow and scarcely seeming to take aim he loosed his shaft it flashed away to be checked quivering in the branch he had indicated  a chorus of applause and admiration greeted the shot and drew the attention of all the crew to what was toward  marzak tightened his lips realizing how completely he had been outwitted willynilly he must now shoot at that mark the choice had been taken out of his hands by sakrelbahr he never doubted that he must cover himself with ridicule in the performance and that there he would be constrained to abandon this pretended match  by the koran said biskaine thoult need all thy skill to equal such a shot marzak  twas not the mark i chose replied marzak sullenly  thou wert the challenger o marzak his father reminded him therefore the choice of mark was his he chose a mans mark and by the beard of mohammed he showed us a mans shot  marzak would have flung the bow from him in that moment abandoning the method he had chosen to investigate the contents of that suspicious palmetto bale but he realized that such a course must now cover him with scorn slowly he levelled his bow at that distant mark  have a care of the sentinel on the hilltop sakrelbahr admonished him provoking a titter  angrily the youth drew the bow the cord hummed and the shaft sped to bury itself in the hills flank a dozen yards from the mark  since he was the son of the basha none dared to laugh outright save his father and sakrelbahr but there was no suppressing a titter to express the mockery to which the proven braggart must ever be exposed  asad looked at him smiling almost sadly see now he said what comes of boasting thyself against sakrelbahr  my will was crossed in the matter of a mark was the bitter answer you angered me and made my aim untrue  sakrelbahr strode away to the starboard bulwarks deeming the matter at an end marzak observed him  yet at that small mark he said i challenge him again as he spoke he fitted a second shaft to his bow behold he cried and took aim  but swift as thought sakrelbahrheedless now of all consequenceslevelled at marzak the bow which he still held  hold he roared loose thy shaft at that bale and i loose this at thy throat i never miss he added grimly  there was a startled movement in the ranks of those who stood behind marzak in speechless amazement they stared at sakrelbahr as he stood there whitefaced his eyes aflash his bow drawn taut and ready to launch that deathladen quarrel as he threatened  slowly then smiling with unutterable malice marzak lowered his bow he was satisfied his true aim was reached he had drawn his enemy into selfbetrayal  asads was the voice that shattered that hush of consternation  kellamullah he bellowed what is this art thou mad too o sakrelbahr  ay mad indeed said marzak mad with fear and he stepped quickly aside so that the body of biskaine should shield him from any sudden consequences of his next words ask him what he keeps in that pannier o my father  ay what in allahs name demanded the basha advancing towards his captain  sakrelbahr lowered his bow master of himself again his composure was beyond all belief  i carry in it goods of price which ill not see riddled to please a pert boy he said  goods of price echoed asad with a snort theyll need to be of price indeed that are valued above the life of my son let us see these goods of price and to the men upon the waistdeck he shouted open me that pannier  sakrelbahr sprang forward and laid a hand upon the bashas arm  stay my lord he entreated almost fiercely consider that this pannier is my own that its contents are my property that none has a right to  wouldst babble of rights to me who am thy lord blazed the basha now in a towering passion open me that pannier i say  they were quick to his bidding the ropes were slashed away and the front of the pannier fell open on its palmetto hinges there was a halfrepressed chorus of amazement from the men sakrelbahr stood frozen in horror of what must follow  what is it what have you found demanded asad  in silence the men swung the bale about and disclosed to the eyes of those upon the poopdeck the face and form of rosamund godolphin then sakrelbahr rousing himself from his trance of horror reckless of all but her flung down the gangway to assist her from the pannier and thrusting aside those who stood about her took his stand at her side     chapter xvii the dupe   for a little while asad stood at gaze speechless in his incredulity then to revive the anger that for a moment had been whelmed in astonishment came the reflection that he had been duped by sakrelbahr duped by the man he trusted most he had snarled at fenzileh and scorned marzak when they had jointly warned him against his lieutenant if at times he had been in danger of heeding them yet sooner or later he had concluded that they but spoke to vent their malice and yet it was proven now that they had been right in their estimate of this traitor whilst he himself had been a poor blind dupe needing marzaks wit to tear the bandage from his eyes  slowly he went down the gangway followed by marzak biskaine and the others at the point where it joined the waistdeck he paused and his dark old eyes smouldered under his beetling brows  so he snarled these are thy goods of price thou lying dog what was thine aim in this  defiantly sakrelbahr answered him she is my wife it is my right to take her with me where i go he turned to her and bade her veil her face and she immediately obeyed him with fingers that shook a little in her agitation  none questions thy right to that said asad but being resolved to take her with thee why not take her openly why was she not housed in the poophouse as becomes the wife of sakrelbahr why smuggle her aboard in a pannier and keep her there in secret  and why added marzak didst thou lie to me when i questioned thee upon her whereaboutstelling me she was left behind in thy house in algiers  all this i did replied sakrelbahr with a loftyalmost a disdainfuldignity because i feared lest i should be prevented from bearing her away with me and his bold glance beating full upon asad drew a wave of colour into the gaunt old cheeks  what could have caused that fear he asked shall i tell thee because no man sailing upon such a voyage as this would have desired the company of his newwedded wife because no man would take a wife with him upon a raid in which there is peril of life and peril of capture  allah has watched over me his servant in the past said sakrelbahr and i put my trust in him  it was a specious answer such wordslaying stress upon the victories allah sent himhad aforetime served to disarm his enemies but they served not now instead they did but fan the flames of asads wrath  blaspheme not he croaked and his tall form quivered with rage his sallow old face grew vulturine she was brought thus aboard in secret out of fear that were her presence known thy true purpose too must stand revealed  and whatever that true purpose may have been put in marzak it was not the task entrusted thee of raiding the spanish treasuregalley  tis what i mean my son asad agreed then with a commanding gesture wilt thou tell me without further lies what thy purpose was he asked  how said sakrelbahr and he smiled never so faintly hast thou not said that this purpose was revealed by what i did rather then i think is it for me to ask thee for some such information i do assure thee my lord that it was no part of my intention to neglect the task entrusted me but just because i feared lest knowledge of her presence might lead my enemies to suppose what thou art now supposing and perhaps persuade thee to forget all that i have done for the glory of islam i determined to bring her secretly aboard  my real aim since you must know it was to land her somewhere on the coast of france whence she might return to her own land and her own people that done i should have set about intercepting the spanish galley and never fear but that by allahs favour i should have succeeded  by the horns of shaitan swore marzak thrusting himself forward he is the very father and mother of lies wilt thou explain this desire to be rid of a wife thou hadst but wed he demanded  ay growled asad canst answer that  thou shalt hear the truth said sakrelbahr  the praise to allah mocked marzak  but i warn you the corsair continued that to you it will seem less easy to believe by much than any falsehood i could invent years ago in england where i was born i loved this woman and should have taken her to wife but there were men and circumstances that defamed me to her so that she would not wed me and i went forth with hatred of her in my heart last night the love of her which i believed to be dead and turned to loathing proved to be still a living force loving her i came to see that i had used her unworthily and i was urged by a desire above all others to undo the evil i had done  on that he paused and after an instants silence asad laughed angrily and contemptuously since when has man expressed his love for a woman by putting her from him he asked in a voice of scorn that showed the precise value he set upon such a statement  i warned thee it would seem incredible said sakrelbahr  is it not plain o my father that this marriage of his was no more than a pretence cried marzak  as plain as the light of day replied asad thy marriage with that woman made an impious mock of the true faith it was no marriage it was a blasphemous pretence thine only aim to thwart me abusing my regard for the prophets holy law and to set her beyond my reach he turned to vigitello who stood a little behind sakrelbahr bid thy men put me this traitor into irons he said  heaven hath guided thee to a wise decision o my father cried marzak his voice jubilant but his was the only jubilant note that was sounded his the only voice that was raised  the decision is more like to guide you both to heaven replied sakrelbahr undaunted on the instant he had resolved upon his course stay he said raising his hand to vigitello who indeed had shown no sign of stirring he stepped close up to asad and what he said did not go beyond those who stood immediately about the basha and rosamund who strained her ears that she might lose no word of it  do not think asad he said that i will submit me like a camel to its burden consider thy position well if i but raise my voice to call my seahawks to me only allah can tell how many will be left to obey thee darest thou put this matter to the test he asked his countenance grave and solemn but entirely fearless as of a man in whom there is no doubt of the issue as it concerns himself  asads eyes glittered dully his colour faded to a deathly ashen hue thou infamous traitor he began in a thick voice his body quivering with anger  ah no sakrelbahr interrupted him were i a traitor it is what i should have done already knowing as i do that in any division of our forces numbers will be heavily on my side let then my silence prove my unswerving loyalty asad let it weigh with thee in considering my conduct nor permit thyself to be swayed by marzak there who recks nothing so that he vents his petty hatred of me  do not heed him o my father cried marzak it cannot be that  peace growled asad somewhat stricken on a sudden  and there was peace whilst the basha stood moodily combing his white beard his glittering eyes sweeping from oliver to rosamund and back again he was weighing what sakrelbahr had said he more than feared that it might be no more than true and he realized that if he were to provoke a mutiny here he would be putting all to the test setting all upon a throw in which the dice might well be cogged against him  if sakrelbahr prevailed he would prevail not merely aboard this galley but throughout algiers and asad would be cast down never to rise again on the other hand if he bared his scimitar and called upon the faithful to support him it might chance that recognizing in him the exalted of allah to whom their loyalty was due they would rally to him he even thought it might be probable yet the stake he put upon the board was too vast the game appalled him whom nothing yet had appalled and it scarce needed a muttered caution from biskaine to determine him to hold his hand  he looked at sakrelbahr again his glance now sullen i will consider thy words he announced in a voice that was unsteady i would not be unjust nor steer my course by appearances alone allah forbid     chapter xviii sheik mat   under the inquisitive gaping stare of all about them stood rosamund and sakrelbahr regarding each other in silence for a little spell after the bashas departure the very galleyslaves stirred from their habitual lethargy by happenings so curious and unusual craned their sinewy necks to peer at them with a flicker of interest in their dull weary eyes  sakrelbahrs feelings as he considered rosamundss white face in the fading light were most oddly conflicting dismay at what had befallen and some anxious dread of what must follow were leavened by a certain measure of relief  he realized that in no case could her concealment have continued long eleven mortal hours had she spent in the cramped and almost suffocating space of that pannier in which he had intended to do no more than carry her aboard the uneasiness which had been occasioned him by the impossibility to deliver her from that close confinement when asad had announced his resolve to accompany them upon that voyage had steadily been increasing as hour succeeded hour and still he found no way to release her from a situation in which sooner or later when the limits of her endurance were reached her presence must be betrayed this release which he could not have contrived had been contrived for him by the suspicions and malice of marzak that was the one grain of consolation in the present perilto himself who mattered nothing and to her who mattered all adversity had taught him to prize benefits however slight and to confront perils however overwhelming so he hugged the present slender benefit and resolutely braced himself to deal with the situation as he found it taking the fullest advantage of the hesitancy which his words had sown in the heart of the basha he hugged too the thought that as things had fallen out from being oppressor and oppressed rosamund and he were become fellows in misfortune sharing now a common peril he found it a sweet thought to dwell on therefore was it that he faintly smiled as he looked into rosamunds white strained face  that smile evoked from her the question that had been burdening her mind  what now what now she asked huskily and held out appealing hands to him  now said he coolly let us be thankful that you are delivered from quarters destructive both to comfort and to dignity let me lead you to those i had prepared for you which you would have occupied long since but for the illtimed coming of asad come and he waved an inviting hand towards the gangway leading to the poop  she shrank back at that for there on the poop sat asad under his awning with marzak biskaine and his other officers in attendance  come he repeated there is naught to fear so that you keep a bold countenance for the moment it is sheik matcheck to the king  naught to fear she echoed staring  for the moment naught he answered firmly against what the future may hold we must determine be sure that fear will not assist our judgment  she stiffened as if he had charged her unjustly  i do not fear she assured him and if her face continued white her eyes grew steady her voice was resolute  then come he repeated and she obeyed him instantly now as if to prove the absence of all fear  side by side they passed up the gangway and mounted the steps of the companion to the poop their approach watched by the group that was in possession of it with glances at once of astonishment and resentment  asads dark smouldering eyes were all for the girl they followed her every movement as she approached and never for a moment left her to turn upon her companion  outwardly she bore herself with a proud dignity and an unfaltering composure under that greedy scrutiny but inwardly she shrank and writhed in a shame and humiliation that she could hardly define in some measure oliver shared her feelings but blent with anger and urged by them he so placed himself at last that he stood between her and the bashas regard to screen her from it as he would have screened her from a lethal weapon upon the poop he paused and salaamed to asad  permit exalted lord said he that my wife may occupy the quarters i had prepared for her before i knew that thou wouldst honour this enterprise with thy presence  curtly contemptuously asad waved a consenting hand without vouchsafing to reply in words sakrelbahr bowed again stepped forward and put aside the heavy red curtain upon which the crescent was wrought in green from within the cabin the golden light of a lamp came out to merge into the bluegray twilight and to set a shimmering radiance about the whiterobed figure of rosamund  thus for a moment asads fierce devouring eyes observed her then she passed within sakrelbahr followed and the screening curtain swung back into its place  the small interior was furnished by a divan spread with silken carpets a low moorish table in coloured wood mosaics bearing the newly lighted lamp and a tiny brazier in which aromatic gums were burning and spreading a sweetly pungent perfume for the fumigation of all truebelievers  out of the shadows in the farther corners rose silently sakrelbahrs two nubian slaves abiad and zalzer to salaam low before him but for their turbans and loincloths in spotless white their dusky bodies must have remained invisible shadowy among the shadows  the captain issued an order briefly and from a hanging cupboard the slaves took meat and drink and set it upon the low tablea bowl of chicken cooked in rice and olives and prunes a dish of bread a melon and a clay amphora of water then at another word from him each took a naked scimitar and they passed out to place themselves on guard beyond the curtain this was not an act in which there was menace or defiance nor could asad so interpret it the acknowledged presence of sakrelbalirs wife in that poophouse rendered the place the equivalent of his hareem and a man defends his hareem as he defends his honour it is a spot sacred to himself which none may violate and it is fitting that he take proper precaution against any impious attempt to do so  rosamund sank down upon the divan and sat there with bowed head her hands folded in her lap sakrelbahr stood by in silence for a long moment contemplating her  eat he bade her at last you will need strength and courage and neither is possible to a fasting body  she shook her head despite her long fast food was repellent anxiety was thrusting her heart up into her throat to choke her  i cannot eat she answered him to what end strength and courage cannot avail me now  never believe that he said i have undertaken to deliver you alive from the perils into which i have brought you and i shall keep my word  so resolute was his tone that she looked up at him and found his bearing equally resolute and confident  surely she cried all chance of escape is lost to me  never count it lost whilst i am living he replied she considered him a moment and there was the faintest smile on her lips  do you think that you will live long now she asked him  just as long as god pleases he replied quite coolly what is written is written so that i live long enough to deliver you then why then faith i shall have lived long enough  her head sank she clasped and unclasped the hands in her lap she shivered slightly  i think we are both doomed she said in a dull voice for if you die i have your dagger still remember i shall not survive you  he took a sudden step forward his eyes gleaming a faint flush glowing through the tan of his cheeks then he checked fool how could he so have misread her meaning even for a moment were not its exact limits abundantly plain even without the words which she added a moment later  god will forgive me if i am driven to itif i choose the easier way of honour for honour sir she added clearly for his benefit is ever the easier way believe me  i know he replied contritely i would to god i had followed it  he paused there as if hoping that his expression of penitence might evoke some answer from her might spur her to vouchsafe him some word of forgiveness seeing that she continued mute and absorbed he sighed heavily and turned to other matters  here you will find all that you can require he said should you lack aught you have but to beat your hands together one or the other of my slaves will come to you if you address them in french they will understand you i would i could have brought a woman to minister to you but that was impossible as youll perceive he stepped to the entrance  you are leaving me she questioned him in sudden alarm  naturally but be sure that i shall be very near at hand and meanwhile be no less sure that you have no cause for immediate fear at least matters are no worse than when you were in the pannier indeed much better for some measure of ease and comfort is now possible to you so be of good heart eat and rest god guard you i shall return soon after sunrise  outside on the poopdeck he found asad alone now with marzak under the awning night had fallen the great crescent lanterns on the stern rail were alight and cast a lurid glow along the vessels length picking out the shadowy forms and gleaming faintly on the naked backs of the slaves in their serried ranks along the benches many of them bowed already in attitudes of uneasy slumber another lantern swung from the mainmast and yet another from the pooprail for the bashas convenience overhead the clustering stars glittered in a cloudless sky of deepest purple the wind had fallen entirely and the world was wrapped in stillness broken only by the faint rustling break of waves upon the beach at the coves end  sakrelbahr crossed to asads side and begged for a word alone with him  i am alone said the basha curtly  marzak is nothing then said sakrelbahr i have long suspected it  marzak showed his teeth and growled inarticulately whilst the basha taken aback by the ease reflected in the captains careless mocking words could but quote a line of the koran with which fenzileh of late had often nauseated him  a mans son is the partner of his soul i have no secrets from marzak speak then before him or else be silent and depart  he may be the partner of thy soul asad replied the corsair with his bold mockery but i give thanks to allah he is not the partner of mine and what i have to say in some sense concerns my soul  i thank thee cut in marzak for the justice of thy words to be the partner of thy soul were to be an infidel unbelieving dog  thy tongue o marzak is like thine archery said sakrelbahr  ayin that it pierces treachery was the swift retort  nayin that it aims at what it cannot hit now allah pardon me shall i grow angry at such words as thine hath not the one proven full oft that he who calls me infidel dog is a liar predestined to the pit are such victories as mine over the fleets of the unbelievers vouchsafed by allah to an infidel foolish blasphemer teach thy tongue better ways lest the allwise strike thee dumb  peace growled asad thine arrogance is out of season  haply so said sakrelbahr with a laugh and my good sense too it seems since thou wilt retain beside thee this partner of thy soul i must speak before him have i thy leave to sit  lest such leave should be denied him he dropped forthwith to the vacant place beside asad and tucked his legs under him  lord he said there is a rift dividing us who should be united for the glory of islam  it is of thy making sakrelbahr was the sullen answer and it is for thee to mend it  to that end do i desire thine ear the cause of this rift is yonder and he jerked his thumb backward over his shoulder towards the poophouse if we remove that cause of a surety the rift itself will vanish and all will be well again between us  he knew that never could all be well again between him and asad he knew that by virtue of his act of defiance he was irrevocably doomed that asad having feared him once having dreaded his power to stand successfully against his face and overbear his will would see to it that he never dreaded it again he knew that if he returned to algiers there would be a speedy end to him his only chance of safety lay indeed in stirring up mutiny upon the spot and striking swiftly venturing all upon that desperate throw and he knew that this was precisely what asad had cause to fear out of this assurance had he conceived his present plan deeming that if he offered to heal the breach asad might pretend to consent so as to weather his present danger making doubly sure of his vengeance by waiting until they should be home again  asads gleaming eyes considered him in silence for a moment  how remove that cause he asked wilt thou atone for the mockery of thy marriage pronounce her divorced and relinquish her  that were not to remove her replied sakrelbahr consider well asad what is thy duty to the faith consider that upon our unity depends the glory of islam were it not sinful then to suffer the intrusion of aught that may mar such unity nay nay what i propose is that i should be permittedassisted evento bear out the project i had formed as already i have frankly made confession let us put to sea again at dawnor this very night if thou wiltmake for the coast of france and there set her ashore that she may go back to her own people and we be rid of her disturbing presence then we will returnthere is time and to spareand here or elsewhere lurk in wait for this spanish argosy seize the booty and sail home in amity to algiers this incident this little cloud in the splendour of our comradeship behind us and forgotten as though it had never been wilt thou asadfor the glory of the prophets law  the bait was cunningly presented so cunningly that not for a moment did asad or even the malicious marzak suspect it to be just a bait and no more it was his own life become a menace to asad that sakrelbahr was offering him in exchange for the life and liberty of that frankish slavegirl but offering it as if unconscious that he did so  asad considered temptation gripping him prudence urged him to accept so that affecting to heal the dangerous breach that now existed he might carry sakrelbahr back to algiers there beyond the aid of any friendly mutineers to have him strangled it was the course to adopt in such a situation the wise and sober course by which to ensure the overthrow of one who from an obedient and submissive lieutenant had suddenly shown that it was possible for him to become a serious and dangerous rival  sakrelbahr watched the bashas averted gleaming eyes under their furrowed thoughtful brows he saw marzaks face white tense and eager in his anxiety that his father should consent and since his father continued silent marzak unable longer to contain himself broke into speech  he is wise o my father was his crafty appeal the glory of islam above all else let him have his way in this and let the infidel woman go thus shall all be well between us and sakrelbahr he laid such a stress upon these words that it was obvious he desired them to convey a second meaning  asad heard and understood that marzak too perceived what was here to do tighter upon him became temptations grip but tighter too became the grip of a temptation of another sort before his fierce eyes there arose a vision of a tall stately maiden with softly rounded bosom a vision so white and lovely that it enslaved him and so he found himself torn two ways at once on the one hand if he relinquished the woman he could make sure of his vengeance upon sakrelbahr could make sure of removing that rebel from his path on the other hand if he determined to hold fast to his desires and to be ruled by them he must be prepared to risk a mutiny aboard the galeasse prepared for battle and perhaps for defeat it was a stake such as no sane basha would have consented to set upon the board but since his eyes had again rested upon rosamund asad was no longer sane his thwarted desires of yesterday were the despots of his wits  he leaned forward now looking deep into the eyes of sakrelbahr  since for thyself thou dost not want her why dost thou thwart me he asked and his voice trembled with suppressed passion so long as i deemed thee honest in taking her to wife i respected that bond as became a good muslim but since tis manifest that it was no more than a pretence a mockery to serve some purpose hostile to myself a desecration of the prophets holy law i before whom this blasphemous marriage was performed do pronounce it to be no marriage there is no need for thee to divorce her she is no longer thine she is for any muslim who can take her  sakrelbahr laughed unpleasantly such a muslim he announced will be nearer my sword than the paradise of mahomet and on the words he stood up as if in token of his readiness  asad rose with him in a bound of a vigour such as might scarce have been looked for in a man of his years  dost threaten he cried his eyes aflash  threaten sneered sakrelbahr i prophesy and on that he turned and stalked away down the gangway to the vessels waist there was no purpose in his going other than his perceiving that here argument were worse than useless and that the wiser course were to withdraw at once avoiding it and allowing his veiled threat to work upon the bashas mind  quivering with rage asad watched his departure on the point of commanding him to return he checked fearing lest in his present mood sakrelbahr should flout his authority and under the eyes of all refuse him the obedience due he knew that it is not good to command where we are not sure of being obeyed or of being able to enforce obedience that an authority once successfully flouted is in itself halfshattered  whilst still he hesitated marzak who had also risen caught him by the arm and poured into his ear hot urgent arguments enjoining him to yield to sakrelbahrs demand  it is the sure way he cried insistently shall all be jeopardized for the sake of that wheyfaced daughter of perdition in the name of shaitan let us be rid of her set her ashore as he demands as the price of peace between us and him and in the security of that peace let him be strangled when we come again to our moorings in algiers it is the sure waythe sure way  asad turned at last to look into that handsome eager face for a moment he was at a loss then he had recourse to sophistry am i a coward that i should refuse all ways but sure ones he demanded in a withering tone or art thou a coward who can counsel none other  my anxiety is all for thee o my father marzak defended himself indignantly i doubt if it be safe to sleep lest he should stir up mutiny in the night  have no fear replied asad myself i have set the watch and the officers are all trustworthy biskaine is even now in the forecastle taking the feeling of the men soon we shall know precisely where we stand  in thy place i would make sure i would set a term to this danger of mutiny i would accede to his demands concerning the woman and settle afterwards with himself  abandon that frankish pearl quoth asad slowly he shook his head nay nay she is a garden that shall yield me roses together we shall yet taste the sweet sherbet of kansar and she shall thank me for having led her into paradise abandon that rosylimbed loveliness he laughed softly on a note of exaltation whilst in the gloom marzak frowned thinking of fenzileh  she is an infidel his son sternly reminded him so forbidden thee by the prophet wilt thou be as blind to that as to thine own peril then his voice gathering vehemence and scorn as he proceeded she has gone naked of face through the streets of algiers she has been gaped at by the rabble in the sôk this loveliness of hers has been deflowered by the greedy gaze of jew and moor and turk galleyslaves and negroes have feasted their eyes upon her unveiled beauty one of thy captains hath owned her his wife he laughed by allah i do not know thee o my father is this the woman thou wouldst take for thine own this the woman for whose possession thou wouldst jeopardize thy life and perhaps the very bashalik itself  asad clenched his hands until the nails bit into his flesh every word his son had uttered had been as a lash to his soul the truth of it was not to be contested he was humiliated and shamed yet was he not conquered of his madness nor diverted from his course before he could make answer the tall martial figure of biskaine came up the companion  well the basha greeted him eagerly thankful for this chance to turn the subject  biskaine was downcast his news was to be read in his countenance the task appointed me was difficult said he i have done my best yet i could scarce go about it in such a fashion as to draw definite conclusions but this i know my lord that he will be reckless indeed if he dares to take up arms against thee and challenge thine authority so much at least i am permitted to conclude  no more than that asked asad and if i were to take up arms against him and to seek to settle this matter out of hand  biskaine paused a moment ere replying i cannot think but that allah would vouchsafe thee victory he said but his words did not delude the basha he recognized them to be no more than those which respect for him dictated to his officer yet continued biskaine i should judge thee reckless too my lord as reckless as i should judge him in the like circumstances  i see said asad the matter stands so balanced that neither of us dare put it to the test  thou hast said it  then is thy course plain to thee cried marzak eager to renew his arguments accept his terms and  but asad broke in impatiently every thing in its own hour and each hour is written i will consider what to do  below on the waistdeck sakrelbahr was pacing with vigitello and vigitellos words to him were of a tenor identical almost with those of biskaine to the basha  i scarce can judge said the italian renegade but i do think that it were not wise for either thou or asad to take the first step against the other  are matters then so equal between us  numbers i fear replied vigitello would be in favour of asad no truly devout muslim will stand against the basha the representative of the sublime portal to whom loyalty is a question of religion yet they are accustomed to obey thee to leap at thy command and so asad himself were rash to put it to the test  aya sound argument said sakrelbahr it is as i had thought  upon that he quitted vigitello and slowly thoughtfully returned to the poopdeck it was his hopehis only hope nowthat asad might accept the proposal he had made him as the price of it he was fully prepared for the sacrifice of his own life which it must entail but it was not for him to approach asad again to do so would be to argue doubt and anxiety and so to court refusal he must possess his soul in what patience he could if asad persisted in his refusal undeterred by any fear of mutiny then sakrelbahr knew not what course remained him to accomplish rosamunds deliverance proceed to stir up mutiny he dared not it was too desperate a throw in his own view it offered him no slightest chance of success and did it fail then indeed all would be lost himself destroyed and rosamund at the mercy of asad he was as one walking along a swordedge his only chance of present immunity for himself and rosamund lay in the confidence that asad would dare no more than himself to take the initiative in aggression but that was only for the present and at any moment asad might give the word to put about and steer for barbary again in no case could that be delayed beyond the plundering of the spanish argosy he nourished the faint hope that in that coming fightif indeed the spaniards did show fightsome chance might perhaps present itself some unexpected way out of the present situation  he spent the night under the stars stretched across the threshold of the curtained entrance to the poophouse making thus a barrier of his body whilst he slept and himself watched over in his turn by his faithful nubians who remained on guard he awakened when the first violet tints of dawn were in the east and quietly dismissing the weary slaves to their rest he kept watch alone thereafter under the awning on the starboard quarter slept the basha and his son and near them biskaine was snoring     chapter xix the mutineers   later that morning some time after the galeasse had awakened to life and such languid movement as might be looked for in a waiting crew sakrelbahr went to visit rosamund  he found her brightened and refreshed by sleep and he brought her reassuring messages that all was well encouraging her with hopes which himself he was very far from entertaining if her reception of him was not expressedly friendly neither was it unfriendly she listened to the hopes he expressed of yet effecting her safe deliverance and whilst she had no thanks to offer him for the efforts he was to exert on her behalfaccepting them as her absolute due as the inadequate liquidation of the debt that lay between themyet there was now none of that aloofness amounting almost to scorn which hitherto had marked her bearing towards him  he came again some hours later in the afternoon by when his nubians were once more at their post he had no news to bring her beyond the fact that their sentinel on the heights reported a sail to westward beating up towards the island before the very gentle breeze that was blowing but the argosy they awaited was not yet in sight and he confessed that certain proposals which he had made to asad for landing her in france had been rejected still she need have no fear he added promptly seeing the sudden alarm that quickened in her eyes a way would present itself he was watching and would miss no chance  and if no chance should offer she asked him  why then i will make one he answered lightly almost i have been making them all my life and it would be odd if i should have lost the trick of it on my lifes most important occasion  this mention of his life led to a question from her  how did you contrive the chance that has made you what you are i mean she added quickly as if fearing that the purport of that question might be misunderstood that has enabled you to become a corsair captain  tis a long story that he said i should weary you in the telling of it  no she replied and shook her head her clear eyes solemnly meeting his clouded glance you would not weary me chances may be few in which to learn it  and you would learn it quoth he and added that you may judge me  perhaps she said and her eyes fell  with bowed head he paced the length of the small chamber and back again his desire was to do her will in this which is natural enoughfor if it is true that who knows all must perforce forgive all never could it have been truer than in the case of sir oliver tressilian  so he told his tale pacing there he related it at length from the days when he had toiled at an oar on one of the galleys of spain down to that hour in which aboard the spanish vessel taken under cape spartel he had determined upon that voyage to england to present his reckoning to his brother he told his story simply and without too great a wealth of detail yet he omitted nothing of all that had gone to place him where he stood and she listening was so profoundly moved that at one moment her eyes glistened with tears which she sought vainly to repress yet he pacing there absorbed with head bowed and eyes that never once strayed in her direction saw none of this  and so he said when at last that odd narrative had reached its end you know what the forces were that drove me another stronger than myself might have resisted and preferred to suffer death but i was not strong enough or perhaps it is that stronger than myself was my desire to punish to vent the bitter hatred into which my erstwhile love for lionel was turned  and for me tooas you have told me she added  not so he corrected her i hated you for your unfaith and most of all for your having burnt unread the letter that i sent you by the hand of pitt in doing that you contributed to the wrongs i was enduring you destroyed my one chance of establishing my innocence and seeking rehabilitation you doomed me for life to the ways which i was treading but i did not then know what ample cause you had to believe me what i seemed i did not know that it was believed i had fled therefore i forgive you freely a deed for which at one time i confess that i hated you and which spurred me to bear you off when i found you under my hand that night at arwenack when i went for lionel  you mean that it was no part of your intent to have done so she asked him  to carry you off together with him he asked i swear to god i had not premeditated that indeed it was done because not premeditated for had i considered it i do think i should have been proof against any such temptation it assailed me suddenly when i beheld you there with lionel and i succumbed to it knowing what i now know i am punished enough i think  i think i can understand she murmured gently as if to comfort him for quick pain had trembled in his voice  he tossed back his turbaned head to understand is something said he it is halfway at least to forgiveness but ere forgiveness can be accepted the evil done must be atoned for to the full  if possible said she  it must be made possible he answered her with heat and on that he checked abruptly arrested by a sound of shouting from without  he recognized the voice of larocque who at dawn had returned to his sentinels post on the summit of the headland relieving the man who had replaced him there during the night  my lord my lord was the cry in a voice shaken by excitement and succeeded by a shouting chorus from the crew  sakrelbahr turned swiftly to the entrance whisked aside the curtain and stepped out upon the poop larocque was in the very act of clambering over the bulwarks amidships towards the waistdeck where asad awaited him in company with marzak and the trusty biskaine the prow on which the corsairs had lounged at ease since yesterday was now a seething mob of inquisitive babbling men crowding to the rail and even down the gangway in their eagerness to learn what news it was that brought the sentinel aboard in such excited haste  from where he stood sakrelbahr heard larocques loud announcement  the ship i sighted at dawn my lord  well barked asad  she is herein the bay beneath that headland she has just dropped anchor  no need for alarm in that replied the basha at once since she has anchored there it is plain that she has no suspicion of our presence what manner of ship is she  a tall galleon of twenty guns flying the flag of england  of england cried asad in surprise shell need be a stout vessel to hazard herself in spanish waters  sakrelbahr advanced to the rail  does she display no further device he asked  larocque turned at the question ay he answered a narrow blue pennant on her mizzen is charged with a white birda stork i think  a stork echoed sakrelbahr thoughtfully he could call to mind no such english blazon nor did it seem to him that it could possibly be english he caught the sound of a quickly indrawn breath behind him he turned to find rosamund standing in the entrance not more than half concealed by the curtain her face showed white and eager her eyes were wide  what ist he asked her shortly  a stork he thinks she said as though that were answer enough  i faith an unlikely bird he commented the fellow is mistook  yet not by much sir oliver  how not by much intrigued by something in her tone and glance he stepped quickly up to her whilst below the chatter of voices increased  that which he takes to be a stork is a herona white heron and white is argent in heraldry ist not  it is what then  dye not see that ship will be the silver heron  he looked at her s life said he i reck little whether it be the silver heron or the golden grasshopper what odds  it is sir johns shipsir john killigrews she explained she was all but ready to sail when when you came to arwenack he was for the indies insteaddont you seeout of love for me he will have come after me upon a forlorn hope of overtaking you ere you could make barbary  gods light said sakrelbahr and fell to musing then he raised his head and laughed faith hes some days late for that  but the jest evoked no response from her she continued to stare at him with those eager yet timid eyes  and yet he continued he comes opportunely enough if the breeze that has fetched him is faint yet surely it blows from heaven  were it she paused faltering a moment  then were it possible to communicate with him she asked yet with hesitation  possibleay he answered though we must needs devise the means and that will prove none so easy  and you would do it she inquired an undercurrent of wonder in her question some recollection of it in her face  why readily he answered since no other way presents itself no doubt twill cost some lives he added but then and he shrugged to complete the sentence  ah no no not at that price she protested and how was he to know that all the price she was thinking of was his own life which she conceived would be forfeited if the assistance of the silver heron were invoked  before he could return her any answer his attention was diverted a sullen threatening note had crept into the babble of the crew and suddenly one or two voices were raised to demand insistently that asad should put to sea at once and remove his vessel from a neighbourhood become so dangerous now the fault of this was marzaks his was the voice that first had uttered that timid suggestion and the infection of his panic had spread instantly through the corsair ranks  asad drawn to the full of his gaunt height turned upon them the eyes that had quelled greater clamours and raised the voice which in its day had hurled a hundred men straight into the jaws of death without a protest  silence he commanded i am your lord and need no counsellors save allah when i consider the time come i will give the word to row but not before back to your quarters then and peace  he disdained to argue with them to show them what sound reasons there were for remaining in this secret cove and against putting forth into the open enough for them that such should be his will not for them to question his wisdom and his decisions  but asadeddin had lain overlong in algiers whilst his fleets under sakrelbahr and biskaine had scoured the inland sea the men were no longer accustomed to the goad of his voice their confidence in his judgment was not built upon the sound basis of past experience never yet had he led into battle the men of this crew and brought them forth again in triumph and enriched by spoil  so now they set their own judgment against his to them it seemed a recklessnessas indeed marzak had suggestedto linger here and his mere announcement of his purpose was far from sufficient to dispel their doubts  the murmurs swelled not to be overborne by his fierce presence and scowling brow and suddenly one of the renegadessecretly prompted by the wily vigitelloraised a shout for the captain whom they knew and trusted  sakrelbahr sakrelbahr thoult not leave us penned in this cove to perish like rats  it was as a spark to a train of powder a score of voices instantly took up the cry hands were flung out towards sakrelbahr where he stood above them and in full view of all leaning impassive and stern upon the pooprail whilst his agile mind weighed the opportunity thus thrust upon him and considered what profit was to be extracted from it  asad fell back a pace in his profound mortification his face was livid his eyes blared furiously his hand flew to the jewelled hilt of his scimitar yet forbore from drawing the blade instead he let loose upon marzak the venom kindled in his soul by this evidence of how shrunken was his authority  thou fool he snarled look on thy cravens work see what a devil thou hast raised with thy womans counsels thou to command a galley thou to become a fighter upon the seas i would that allah had stricken me dead ere i begat me such a son as thou  marzak recoiled before the fury of words that he feared might be followed by yet worse he dared make no answer offer no excuse in that moment he scarcely dared breathe  meanwhile rosamund in her eagerness had advanced until she stood at sakrelbahrs elbow  god is helping us she said in a voice of fervent gratitude this is your opportunity the men will obey you  he looked at her and smiled faintly upon her eagerness ay mistress they will obey me he said but in the few moments that were sped he had taken his resolve whilst undoubtedly asad was right and the wise course was to lie close in this sheltering cove where the odds of their going unperceived were very heavily in their favour yet the mens judgment was not altogether at fault if they were to put to sea they might by steering an easterly course pass similarly unperceived and even should the splash of their oars reach the galleon beyond the headland yet by the time she had weighed anchor and started in pursuit they would be well away straining every ounce of muscle at the oars whilst the breezea heavy factor in his considerationswas become so feeble that they could laugh at pursuit by a vessel that depended upon wind alone the only danger then was the danger of the galleons cannon and that danger was none so great as from experience sakrelbahr well knew  thus was he reluctantly forced to the conclusion that in the main the wiser policy was to support asad and since he was full confident of the obedience of the men he consoled himself with the reflection that a moral victory might be in store for him out of which some surer profit might presently be made  in answer then to those who still called upon him he leapt down the companion and strode along the gangway to the waistdeck to take his stand at the bashas side asad watched his approach with angry misgivings it was with him a foregone conclusion that things being as they were sakrelbahr would be ranged against him to obtain complete control of these mutineers and to cull the fullest advantage from the situation softly and slowly he unsheathed his scimitar and sakrelbahr seeing this out of the corner of his eye yet affected not to see but stood forward to address the men  how now he thundered wrathfully what shall this mean are ye all deaf that ye have not heard the commands of your basha the exalted of allah that ye dare raise your mutinous voices and say what is your will  sudden and utter silence followed that exhortation asad listened in relieved amazement rosamund caught her breath in sheer dismay  what could he mean then had he but fooled and duped her were his intentions towards her the very opposite to his protestations she leant upon the pooprail straining to catch every syllable of that speech of his in the lingua franca hoping almost that her indifferent knowledge of it had led her into error on the score of what he had said  she saw him turn with a gesture of angry command upon larocque who stood there by the bulwarks waiting  back to thy post up yonder and keep watch upon that vessels movements reporting them to us we stir not hence until such be our lord asads good pleasure away with thee  larocque without a murmur threw a leg over the bulwarks and dropped to the oars whence he clambered ashore as he had been bidden and not a single voice was raised in protest  sakrelbahrs dark glance swept the ranks of the corsairs crowding the forecastle  because this pet of the hareem he said immensely daring indicating marzak by a contemptuous gesture bleats of danger into the ears of men are ye all to grow timid and foolish as a herd of sheep by allah what are ye are ye the fearless seahawks that have flown with me and struck where the talons of my grapplinghooks were flung or are ye but scavenging crows  he was answered by an old rover whom fear had rendered greatly daring  we are trapped here as dragut was trapped at jerba  thou liest he answered dragut was not trapped for dragut found a way out and against dragut there was the whole navy of genoa whilst against us there is but one single galleon by the koran if she shows fight have we no teeth will it be the first galleon whose decks we have overrun but if ye prefer a cowards counsel ye sons of shame consider that once we take the open sea our discovery will be assured and larocque hath told you that she carries twenty guns i tell you that if we are to be attacked by her best be attacked at close quarters and i tell you that if we lie close and snug in here it is long odds that we shall never be attacked at all that she has no inkling of our presence is proven since she has cast anchor round the headland and consider that if we fly from a danger that doth not exist and in our flight are so fortunate as not to render real that danger and to court it we abandon a rich argosy that shall bring profit to us all  but i waste my breath in argument he ended abruptly you have heard the commands of your lord asadeddin and that should be argument enough no more of this then  without so much as waiting to see them disperse from the rail and return to their lounging attitudes about the forecastle he turned to asad  it might have been well to hang the dog who spoke of dragut and jerba he said but it was never in my nature to be harsh with those who follow me and that was all  asad from amazement had passed quickly to admiration and a sort of contrition into which presently there crept a poisonous tinge of jealousy to see sakrelbahr prevail where he himself alone must utterly have failed this jealousy spread allpervadingly like an oil stain if he had come to bear illwill to sakrelbahr before that illwill was turned of a sudden into positive hatred for one in whom he now beheld a usurper of the power and control that should reside in the basha alone assuredly there was no room for both of them in the bashalik of algiers  therefore the words of commendation which had been rising to his lips froze there now that sakrelbahr and he stood face to face in silence he considered his lieutenant through narrowing evil eyes whose message none but a fool could have misunderstood  sakrelbahr was not a fool and he did not misunderstand it for a moment he felt a tightening at the heart and illwill sprang to life within him responding to the call of that illwill almost he repented him that he had not availed himself of that moment of weakness and mutiny on the part of the crew to attempt the entire superseding of the basha  the conciliatory words he had in mind to speak he now suppressed to that venomous glance he opposed his ever ready mockery he turned to biskaine  withdraw he curtly bade him and take that stout seawarrior with thee and he indicated marzak  biskaine turned to the basha is it thy wish my lord he asked  asad nodded in silence and motioned him away together with the cowed marzak  my lord said sakrelbahr when they were alone yesterday i made thee a proposal for the healing of this breach between us and it was refused but now had i been the traitor and mutineer thou hast dubbed me i could have taken full advantage of the humour of my corsairs had i done that it need no longer have been mine to propose or to sue instead it would have been mine to dictate since i have given thee such crowning proof of my loyalty it is my hope and trust that i may be restored to the place i had lost in thy confidence and that this being so thou wilt accede now to that proposal of mine concerning the frankish woman yonder  it was unfortunate perhaps that she should have been standing there unveiled upon the poop within the range of asads glance for the sight of her it may have been that overcame his momentary hesitation and stifled the caution which prompted him to accede he considered her a moment and a faint colour kindled in his cheeks which anger had made livid  it is not for thee sakrelbahr he answered at length to make me proposals to dare it proves thee far removed indeed from the loyalty thy lips profess thou knowest my will concerning her once hast thou thwarted and defied me misusing to that end the prophets holy law continue a barrier in my path and it shall be at thy peril his voice was raised and it shook with anger  not so loud said sakrelbahr his eyes gleaming with a response of anger for should my men overhear these threats of thine i will not answer for what may follow i oppose thee at my peril sayest thou be it so then he smiled grimly it is war between us asad since thou hast chosen it remember hereafter when the consequences come to overwhelm thee that the choice was thine  thou mutinous treacherous son of a dog blazed asad  sakrelbahr turned on his heel pursue the path of an old mans folly he said over his shoulder and see whither it will lead thee  upon that he strode away up the gangway to the poop leaving the basha alone with his anger and some slight fear evoked by that last bold menace but notwithstanding that he menaced boldly the heart of sakrelbahr was surcharged with anxiety he had conceived a plan but between the conception and its execution he realized that much ill might lie  mistress he addressed rosamund as he stepped upon the poop you are not wise to show yourself so openly  to his amazement she met him with a hostile glance  not wise said she her countenance scornful you mean that i may see more than was intended for me what game do you play here sir that you tell me one thing and show me by your actions that you desire another  he did not need to ask her what she meant at once he perceived how she had misread the scene she had witnessed  ill but remind you he said very gravely that once before you did me a wrong by overhasty judgment as has been proven to you  it overthrew some of her confidence but then she began  i do but ask you to save your judgment for the end if i live i shall deliver you meanwhile i beg that you will keep your cabin it does not help me that you be seen  she looked at him a prayer for explanation trembling on her lips but before the calm command of his tone and glance she slowly lowered her head and withdrew beyond the curtain     chapter xx the messenger   for the rest of the day she kept the cabin chafing with anxiety to know what was toward and the more racked by it because sakrelbahr refrained through all those hours from coming to her at last towards evening unable longer to contain herself she went forth again and as it chanced she did so at an untimely moment  the sun had set and the evening prayer was being recited aboard the galeasse her crew all prostrate perceiving this she drew back again instinctively and remained screened by the curtain until the prayer was ended then putting it aside but without stepping past the nubians who were on guard she saw that on her left asadeddin with marzak biskaine and one or two other officers was again occupying the divan under the awning her eyes sought sakrelbahr and presently they beheld him coming up the gangway with his long swinging stride in the wake of the boatswains mates who were doling out the meagre evening meal to the slaves  suddenly he halted by lionel who occupied a seat at the head of his oar immediately next to the gangway he addressed him harshly in the lingua franca which lionel did not understand and his words rang clearly and were heardas he intended that they should beby all upon the poop  well dog how does galleyslave fare suit thy tender stomach  lionel looked up at him  what are you saying he asked in english  sakrelbahr bent over him and his face as all could see was evil and mocking no doubt he spoke to him in english also but no more than a murmur reached the straining ears of rosamund though from his countenance she had no doubt of the purport of his words and yet she was far indeed from a correct surmise the mockery in his countenance was but a mask  take no heed of my looks he was saying i desire them up yonder to think that i abuse you look as a man would who were being abused cringe or snarl but listen do you remember once when as lads we swam together from penarrow to trefusis point  what do you mean quoth lionel and the natural sullenness of his mien was all that sakrelbahr could have desired  i am wondering whether you could still swim as far if so you might find a more appetizing supper awaiting you at the endaboard sir john killigrews ship you had not heard the silver heron is at anchor in the bay beyond that headland if i afford you the means could you swim to her do you think  lionel stared at him in profoundest amazement do you mock me he asked at length  why should i mock you on such a matter  is it not to mock me to suggest a way for my deliverance  sakrelbahr laughed and he mocked now in earnest he set his left foot upon the rowers stretcher and leaned forward and down his elbow upon his raised knee so that his face was close to lionels  for your deliverance said he gods life lionel your mind was ever one that could take in naught but your own self tis that has made a villain of you your deliverance gods wounds is there none but yourself whose deliverance i might desire look you now i want you to swim to sir johns ship and bear him word of the presence here of this galeasse and that rosamund is aboard it tis for her that i am concerned and so little for you that should you chance to be drowned in the attempt my only regret will be that the message was not delivered will you undertake that swim it is your one sole chance short of death itself of escaping from the rowers bench will you go  but how demanded lionel still mistrusting him  will you go his brother insisted  afford me the means and i will was the answer  very well sakrelbahr leaned nearer still naturally it will be supposed by all who are watching us that i am goading you to desperation act then your part up and attempt to strike me then when i return the blowand i shall strike heavily that no makebelieve may be suspectedcollapse on your oar pretending to swoon leave the rest to me now he added sharply and on the word rose with a final laugh of derision as if to take his departure  but lionel was quick to follow the instructions he leapt up in his bonds and reaching out as far as they would permit him he struck sakrelbahr heavily upon the face on his side too there was to be no makebelieve apparent that done he sank down with a clank of shackles to the bench again whilst every one of his fellowslaves that faced his way looked on with fearful eyes  sakrelbahr was seen to reel under the blow and instantly there was a commotion on board biskaine leapt to his feet with a halfcry of astonishment even asads eyes kindled with interest at so unusual a sight as that of a galleyslave attacking a corsair then with a snarl of anger the snarl of an enraged beast almost sakrelbahrs great arm was swung aloft and his fist descended like a hammer upon lionels head  lionel sank forward under the blow his senses swimming sakrelbahrs arm swung up a second time  thou dog he roared and then checked perceiving that lionel appeared to have swooned  he turned and bellowed for vigitello and his mates in a voice that was hoarse with passion vigitello came at a run a couple of his men at his heels  unshackle me this carrion and heave it overboard was the harsh order let that serve as an example to the others let them learn thus the price of mutiny in their lousy ranks to it i say  away sped a man for hammer and chisel he returned with them at once four sharp metallic blows rang out and lionel was dragged forth from his place to the gangwaydeck here he revived and screamed for mercy as though he were to be drowned in earnest  biskaine chuckled under the awning asad looked on approvingly rosamund drew back shuddering choking and near to fainting from sheer horror  she saw lionel borne struggling in the arms of the boatswains men to the starboard quarter and flung over the side with no more compunction or care than had he been so much rubbish she heard the final scream of terror with which he vanished the splash of his fall and then in the ensuing silence the laugh of sakrelbahr  for a spell she stood there with horror and loathing of that renegade corsair in her soul her mind was bewildered and confused she sought to restore order in it that she might consider this fresh deed of his this act of wanton brutality and fratricide and all that she could gather was the firm conviction that hitherto he had cheated her he had lied when he swore that his aim was to effect her deliverance it was not in such a nature to know a gentle mood of penitence for a wrong done what might be his purpose she could not yet perceive but that it was an evil one she never doubted for no purpose of his could be aught but evil so overwrought was she now that she forgot all lionels sins and found her heart filled with compassion for him hurled in that brutal fashion to his death  and then quite suddenly a shout rang out from the forecastle  he is swimming  sakrelbahr had been prepared for the chance of this  where where he cried and sprang to the bulwarks  yonder a man was pointing others had joined him and were peering through the gathering gloom at the moving object that was lionels head and the faintly visible swirl of water about it which indicated that he swam  out to sea cried sakrelbahr hell not swim far in any case but we will shorten his road for him he snatched a crossbow from the rack about the mainmast fitted a shaft to it and took aim  on the point of loosing the bolt he paused  marzak he called here thou prince of marksmen is a butt for thee  from the poopdeck whence with his father he too was watching the swimmers head which at every moment became more faint in the failing light marzak looked with cold disdain upon his challenger making no reply a titter ran through the crew  come now cried sakrelbahr take up thy bow  if thou delay much longer put in asad he will be beyond thine aim already he is scarcely visible  the more difficult a butt then answered sakrelb ahr who was but delaying to gain time the keener test a hundred philips marzak that thoult not hit me that head in three shots and that ill sink him at the first wilt take the wager  the unbeliever is for ever peeping forth from thee was marzaks dignified reply games of chance are forbidden by the prophet  make haste man cried asad already i can scarce discern him loose thy quarrel  pooh was the disdainful answer a fair mark still for such an eye as mine i never missnot even in the dark  vain boaster said marzak  am i so sakrelbahr loosed his shaft at last into the gloom and peered after it following its flight which was wide of the direction of the swimmers head a hit he cried brazenly hes gone  i think i see him still said one  thine eyes deceive thee in this light no man was ever known to swim with an arrow through his brain  ay put in jasper who stood behind sakrelbahr he has vanished  tis too dark to see said vigitello  and then asad turned from the vessels side well wellshot or drowned hes gone he said and there the matter ended  sakrelbahr replaced the crossbow in the rack and came slowly up to the poop  in the gloom he found himself confronted by rosamunds white face between the two dusky countenances of his nubians she drew back before him as he approached and he intent upon imparting his news to her followed her within the poophouse and bade abiad bring lights  when these had been kindled they faced each other and he perceived her profound agitation and guessed the cause of it suddenly she broke into speech  you beast you devil she panted god will punish you i shall spend my every breath in praying him to punish you as you deserve you murderer you hound and i like a poor simpleton was heeding your false words i was believing you sincere in your repentance of the wrong you have done me but now you have shown me  how have i hurt you in what i have done to lionel he cut in a little amazed by so much vehemence  hurt me she cried and on the words grew cold and calm again with very scorn i thank god it is beyond your power to hurt me and i thank you for correcting my foolish misconception of you my belief in your pitiful pretence that it was your aim to save me i would not accept salvation at your murderers hands though indeed i shall not be put to it rather she pursued a little wildly now in her deep mortification are you like to sacrifice me to your own vile ends whatever they may be but i shall thwart you heaven helping me be sure i shall not want courage for that and with a shuddering moan she covered her face and stood swaying there before him  he looked on with a faint bitter smile understanding her mood just as he understood her dark threat of thwarting him  i came he said quietly to bring you the assurance that he has got safely away and to tell you upon what manner of errand i have sent him  something compelling in his voice the easy assurance with which he spoke drew her to stare at him again  i mean lionel of course he said in answer to her questioning glance that scene between usthe blow and the swoon and the rest of itwas all makebelieve so afterwards the shooting my challenge to marzak was a ruse to gain timeto avoid shooting until lionels head should have become so dimly visible in the dusk that none could say whether it was still there or not my shaft went wide of him as i intended he is swimming round the head with my message to sir john killigrew he was a strong swimmer in the old days and should easily reach his goal that is what i came to tell you  for a long spell she continued to stare at him in silence  you are speaking the truth she asked at last in a small voice  he shrugged you will have a difficulty in perceiving the object i might serve by falsehood  she sat down suddenly upon the divan it was almost as if she collapsed bereft of strength and as suddenly she fell to weeping softly  and and i believed that you that you  just so he grimly interrupted you always did believe the best of me  and on that he turned and went out abruptly     chapter xxi moriturus   he departed from her presence with bitterness in his heart leaving a profound contrition in her own the sense of this her last injustice to him so overwhelmed her that it became the gauge by which she measured that other earlier wrong he had suffered at her hands perhaps her overwrought mind falsified the perspective exaggerating it until it seemed to her that all the suffering and evil with which this chronicle has been concerned were the direct fruits of her own sin of unfaith  since all sincere contrition must of necessity bring forth an ardent desire to atone so was it now with her had he but refrained from departing so abruptly he might have had her on her knees to him suing for pardon for all the wrongs which her thoughts had done him proclaiming her own utter unworthiness and baseness but since his righteous resentment had driven him from her presence she could but sit and brood upon it all considering the words in which to frame her plea for forgiveness when next he should return  but the hours sped and there was no sign of him and then almost with a shock of dread came the thought that ere long perhaps sir john killigrews ship would be upon them in her distraught state of mind she had scarcely pondered that contingency now that it occurred to her all her concern was for the result of it to sir oliver would there be fighting and would he perhaps perish in that conflict at the hands either of the english or of the corsairs whom for her sake he had betrayed perhaps without ever hearing her confession of penitence without speaking those words of forgiveness of which her soul stood in such thirsty need  it would be towards midnight when unable longer to bear the suspense of it she rose and softly made her way to the entrance very quietly she lifted the curtain and in the act of stepping forth almost stumbled over a body that lay across the threshold she drew back with a startled gasp then stooped to look and by the faint rays of the lanterns on mainmast and pooprail she recognized sir oliver and saw that he slept she never heeded the two nubians immovable as statues who kept guard she continued to bend over him and then gradually and very softly sank down on her knees beside him there were tears in her eyestears wrung from her by a tender emotion of wonder and gratitude at so much fidelity she did not know that he had slept thus last night but it was enough for her to find him here now it moved her oddly profoundly that this man whom she had ever mistrusted and misjudged should even when he slept make of his body a barrier for her greater security and protection  a sob escaped her and at the sound so lightly and vigilantly did he take his rest he came instantly if silently to a sitting attitude and so they looked into each others eyes his swarthy bearded hawk face on a level with her white gleaming countenance  what is it he whispered  she drew back instantly taken with sudden panic at that question then recovering and seeking womanlike to evade and dissemble the thing she was come to do now that the chance of doing it was afforded herdo you think she faltered that lionel will have reached sir johns ship  he flashed a glance in the direction of the divan under the awning where the basha slept there all was still besides the question had been asked in english he rose and held out a hand to help her to her feet then he signed to her to reenter the poophouse and followed her within  anxiety keeps you wakeful he said halfquestion halfassertion  indeed she replied  there is scarce the need he assured her sir john will not be like to stir until dead of night that he may make sure of taking us unawares i have little doubt that lionel would reach him it is none so long a swim indeed once outside the cove he could take to the land until he was abreast of the ship never doubt he will have done his errand  she sat down her glance avoiding his but the light falling on her face showed him the traces there of recent tears  there will be fighting when sir john arrives she asked him presently  like enough but what can it avail we shall be caughtas was said todayin just such a trap as that in which andrea doria caught dragut at jerba saving that whilst the wily dragut found a way out for his galleys here none is possible courage then for the hour of your deliverance is surely at hand  he paused and then in a softer voice humbly almost it is my prayer he added that hereafter in a happy future these last few weeks shall come to seem no more than an evil dream to you  to that prayer she offered no response she sat bemused her brow wrinkled  i would it might be done without fighting she said presently and sighed wearily  you need have no fear he assured her i shall take all precautions for you you shall remain here until all is over and the entrance will be guarded by a few whom i can trust  you mistake me she replied and looked up at him suddenly do you suppose my fears are for myself she paused again and then abruptly asked him what will befall you  i thank you for the thought he replied gravely no doubt i shall meet with my deserts let it but come swiftly when it comes  ah no no she cried not that and rose in her sudden agitation  what else remains he asked and smiled what better fate could anyone desire me  you shall live to return to england she surprised him by exclaiming the truth must prevail and justice be done you  he looked at her with so fierce and searching a gaze that she averted her eyes then he laughed shortly  theres but one form of justice i can look for in england said he it is a justice administered in hemp believe me mistress i am grown too notorious for mercy best end it here tonight besides he added and his mockery fell from him his tone became gloomy bethink you of my present act of treachery to these men of mine who whatever they may be have followed me into a score of perils and but today have shown their love and loyalty to me to be greater than their devotion to the basha himself i shall have delivered them to the sword could i survive with honour they may be but poor heathens to you and yours but to me they are my seahawks my warriors my faithful gallant followers and i were a dog indeed did i survive the death to which i have doomed them  as she listened and gathered from his words the apprehension of a thing that had hitherto escaped her her eyes grew wide in sudden horror  is that to be the cost of my deliverance she asked him fearfully  i trust not he replied i have something in mind that will perhaps avoid it  and save your own life as well she asked him quickly  why waste a thought upon so poor a thing my life was forfeit already if i go back to algiers they will assuredly hang me asad will see to it and not all my seahawks could save me from my fate  she sank down again upon the divan and sat there rocking her arms in a gesture of hopeless distress  i see she said i see i am bringing this fate upon you when you sent lionel upon that errand you voluntarily offered up your life to restore me to my own people you had no right to do this without first consulting me you had no right to suppose i would be a party to such a thing i will not accept the sacrifice i will not sir oliver  indeed you have no choice thank god he answered her but you are astray in your conclusions it is i alone who have brought this fate upon myself it is the very proper fruit of my insensate deed it recoils upon me as all evil must upon him that does it he shrugged his shoulders as if to dismiss the matter then in a changed voice a voice singularly timid soft and gentle it were perhaps too much to ask said he that you should forgive me all the suffering i have brought you  i think she answered him that it is for me to beg forgiveness of you  of me  for my unfaith which has been the source of all for my readiness to believe evil of you five years ago for having burnt unread your letter and the proof of your innocence that accompanied it  he smiled upon her very kindly i think you said your instinct guided you even though i had not done the thing imputed to me your instinct knew me for evil and your instinct was right for evil i ami must be these are your own words but do not think that i mock you with them i have come to recognize their truth  she stretched out her hands to him if if i were to say that i have come to realize the falsehood of all that  i should understand it to be the charity which your pitiful heart extends to one in my extremity your instinct was not at fault  it was it was  but he was not to be driven out of his conviction he shook his head his countenance gloomy no man who was not evil could have done by you what i have done however deep the provocation i perceive it clearly nowas men in their last hour perceive hidden things  oh why are you so set on death she cried upon a despairing note  i am not he answered with a swift resumption of his more habitual manner tis death that is so set on me but at least i meet it without fear or regret i face it as we must all face the inevitablethe gifts from the hands of destiny and i am heartenedgladdened almostby your sweet forgiveness  she rose suddenly and came to him she caught his arm and standing very close to him looked up now into his face  we have need to forgive each other you and i oliver she said and since forgiveness effaces all let let all that has stood between us these last five years be now effaced  he caught his breath as he looked down into her white straining face  is it impossible for us to go back five years is it impossible for us to go back to where we stood in those old days at godolphin court  the light that had suddenly been kindled in his face faded slowly leaving it grey and drawn his eyes grew clouded with sorrow and despair  who has erred must abide by his errorand so must the generations that come after him there is no going back ever the gates of the past are tightbarred against us  then let us leave them so let us turn our backs upon that past you and i and let us set out afresh together and so make amends to each other for what our folly has lost to us in those years  he set his hands upon her shoulders and held her so at arms length from him considering her with very tender eyes  sweet lady he murmured and sighed heavily god how happy might we not have been but for that evil chance he checked abruptly his hands fell from her shoulders to his sides he halfturned away brusque now in tone and manner i grow maudlin your sweet pity has so softened me that i had almost spoke of love and what have i to do with that love belongs to life love is life whilst i moriturus te salutat  ah no no she was clinging to him again with shaking hands her eyes wild  it is too late he answered her there is no bridge can span the pit i have dug myself i must go down into it as cheerfully as god will let me  then she cried in sudden exaltation i will go down with you at the last at least we shall be together  now here is midsummer frenzy he protested yet there was a tenderness in the very impatience of his accents he stroked the golden head that lay against his shoulder how shall that help me he asked her would you embitter my last hourrob death of all its glory nay rosamund you can serve me better far by living return to england and publish there the truth of what you have learnt be yours the task of clearing my honour of this stain upon it proclaiming the truth of what drove me to the infamy of becoming a renegade and a corsair he started from her hark whats that  from without had come a sudden cry afoot to arms to arms holâ balâk balâk  it is the hour he said and turning from her suddenly sprang to the entrance and plucked aside the curtain     chapter xxii the surrender   up the gangway between the lines of slumbering slaves came a quick patter of feet ali who since sunset had been replacing larocque on the heights sprang suddenly upon the poop still shouting  captain captain my lord afoot up or we are taken  throughout the vessels length came the rustle and stir of waking men a voice clamoured somewhere on the forecastle then the flap of the awning was suddenly whisked aside and asad himself appeared with marzak at his elbow  from the starboard side as suddenly came biskaine and othmani and from the waist vigitello jasperthat latest renegadeand a group of alarmed corsairs  what now quoth the basha  ali delivered his message breathlessly the galleon has weighed anchor she is moving out of the bay  asad clutched his beard and scowled now what may that portend can knowledge of our presence have reached them  why else should she move from her anchorage thus in the dead of night said biskaine  why else indeed returned asad and then he swung upon oliver standing there in the entrance of the poophouse what sayest thou sakrelbahr he appealed to him  sakrelbahr stepped forward shrugging what is there to say what is there to do he asked we can but wait if our presence is known to them we are finely trapped and theres an end to all of us this night  his voice was cool as ice contemptuous almost and whilst it struck anxiety into more than one it awoke terror in marzak  may thy bones rot thou illomened prophet he screamed and would have added more but that sakrelbahr silenced him  what is written is written said he in a voice of thunder and reproof  indeed indeed asad agreed grasping at the fatalists consolation if we are ripe for the gardeners hand the gardener will pluck us  less fatalistic and more practical was the counsel of biskaine  it were well to act upon the assumption that we are indeed discovered and make for the open sea while yet there may be time  but that were to make certain what is still doubtful broke in marzak fearful ever it were to run to meet the danger  not so cried asad in a loud confident voice the praise to allah who sent us this calm night there is scarce a breath of wind we can row ten leagues while they are sailing one  a murmur of quick approval sped through the ranks of officers and men  let us but win safely from this cove and they will never overtake us announced biskaine  but their guns may sakrelbahr quietly reminded them to damp their confidence his own alert mind had already foreseen this one chance of escaping from the trap but he had hoped that it would not be quite so obvious to the others  that risk we must take replied asad we must trust to the night to linger here is to await certain destruction he swung briskly about to issue his orders ali summon the steersmen hasten vigitello set your whips about the slaves and rouse them then as the shrill whistle of the boatswain rang out and the whips of his mates went hissing and cracking about the shoulders of the already halfawakened slaves to mingle with all the rest of the stir and bustle aboard the galeasse the basha turned once more to biskaine up thou to the prow he commanded and marshal the men bid them stand to their arms lest it should come to boarding go biskaine salaamed and sprang down the companion above the rumbling din and scurrying toil of preparation rang asads voice  crossbowmen aloft gunners to the carronades kindle your linstocks put out all lights  an instant later the cressets on the pooprail were extinguished as was the lantern swinging from the rail and even the lamp in the poophouse which was invaded by one of the bashas officers for that purpose the lantern hanging from the mast alone was spared against emergencies but it was taken down placed upon the deck and muffled  thus was the galeasse plunged into a darkness that for some moments was black and impenetrable as velvet then slowly as the eyes became accustomed to it this gloom was gradually relieved once more men and objects began to take shape in the faint steely radiance of the summer night  after the excitement of that first stir the corsairs went about their tasks with amazing calm and silence none thought now of reproaching the basha or sakrelbahr with having delayed until the moment of peril to take the course which all of them had demanded should be taken when first they had heard of the neighbourhood of that hostile ship in lines three deep they stood ranged along the ample fighting platform of the prow in the foremost line were the archers behind them stood the swordsmen their weapons gleaming lividly in the darkness they crowded to the bulwarks of the waistdeck and swarmed upon the ratlines of the mainmast on the poop three gunners stood to each of the two small cannon their faces showing faintly ruddy in the glow of the ignited match  asad stood at the head of the companion issuing his sharp brief commands and sakrelbahr behind him leaning against the timbers of the poophouse with rosamund at his side observed that the basha had studiously avoided entrusting any of this work of preparation to himself  the steersmen climbed to their niches and the huge steering oars creaked as they were swung out came a short word of command from asad and a stir ran through the ranks of the slaves as they threw forward their weight to bring the oars to the level thus a moment then a second word the premonitory crack of a whip in the darkness of the gangway and the tomtom began to beat the time the slaves heaved and with a creak and splash of oars the great galeasse skimmed forward towards the mouth of the cove  up and down the gangway ran the boatswains mates cutting fiercely with their whips to urge the slaves to the very utmost effort the vessel gathered speed the looming headland slipped by the mouth of the cove appeared to widen as they approached it beyond spread the dark steely mirror of the deadcalm sea  rosamund could scarcely breathe in the intensity of her suspense she set a hand upon the arm of sakrelbahr  shall we elude them after all she asked in a trembling whisper  i pray that we may not he answered muttering but this is the handiwork i feared look he added sharply and pointed  they had shot clear to the headland they were out of the cove and suddenly they had a view of the dark bulk of the galleon studded with a score of points of light riding a cables length away on their larboard quarter  faster cried the voice of asad row for your lives you infidel swine lay me your whips upon these hides of theirs bend me these dogs to their oars and theyll never overtake us now  whips sang and thudded below them in the waist to be answered by more than one groan from the tormented panting slaves who already were spending every ounce of strength in this cruel effort to elude their own chance of salvation and release faster beat the tomtom marking the desperate time and faster in response to it came the creak and dip of oars and the panting stertorous breathing of the rowers  lay on lay on cried asad inexorable let them burst their lungsthey were but infidel lungsso that for an hour they but maintained the present pace  we are drawing away cried marzak in jubilation the praise to allah  and so indeed they were visibly the lights of the galleon were receding with every inch of canvas spread yet she appeared to be standing still so faint was the breeze that stirred and whilst she crawled the galeasse raced as never yet she had raced since sakrelbahr had commanded her for sakrelbahr had never yet turned tail upon the foe in whatever strength he found him  suddenly over the water from the galleon came a loud hail asad laughed and in the darkness shook his fist at them cursing them in the name of allah and his prophet and then in answer to that curse of his the galleons side belched fire the calm of the night was broken by a roar of thunder and something smote the water ahead of the muslim vessel with a resounding thudding splash  in fear rosamund drew closer to sakrelbahr but asad laughed again  no need to fear their marksmanship he cried they cannot see us their own lights dazzle them on on  he is right said sakrelbahr but the truth is that they will not fire to sink us because they know you to be aboard  she looked out to sea again and beheld those friendly lights falling farther and farther astern  we are drawing steadily away she groaned they will never overtake us now  so feared sakrelbahr he more than feared it he knew that save for some miraculous rising of the wind it must be as she said and then out of his despair leapt inspirationa desperate inspiration true child of that despair of which it was begotten  there is a chance he said to her but it is as a throw of the dice with life and death for stakes  then seize it she bade him instantly for though it should go against us we shall not be losers  you are prepared for anything he asked her  have i not said that i will go down with you this night ah dont waste time in words  be it so then he replied gravely and moved away a step then checked you had best come with me he said  obediently she complied and followed him and some there were who stared as these two passed down the gangway yet none attempted to hinder her movements enough and to spare was there already to engage the thoughts of all aboard that vessel  he thrust a way for her past the boatswains mates who stood over the slaves ferociously plying tongues and whips and so brought her to the waist here he took up the lantern which had been muffled and as its light once more streamed forth asad shouted an order for its extinction but sakrelbahr took no least heed of that command he stepped to the mainmast about which the powder kegs had been stacked one of these had been broached against its being needed by the gunners on the poop the unfastened lid rested loosely atop of it that lid sakrelbahr knocked over then he pulled one of the horn sides out of the lantern and held the now halfnaked flame immediately above the powder  a cry of alarm went up from some who had watched him but above that cry rang his sharp command  cease rowing  the tomtom fell instantly silent but the slaves took yet another stroke  cease rowing he commanded again asad he called bid them pause or ill blow you all straight into the arms of shaitan and he lowered the lantern until it rested on the very rim of the powder keg  at once the rowing ceased slaves corsairs officers and asad himself stood paralyzed all at gaze upon that grim figure illumined by the lantern threatening them with doom it may have crossed the minds of some to throw themselves forthwith upon him but to arrest them was the dread lest any movement towards him should precipitate the explosion that must blow them all into the next world  at last asad addressed him his voice halfchoked with rage  may allah strike thee dead art thou djinnpossessed  marzak standing at his fathers side set a quarrel to the bow which he had snatched up why do you all stand and stare he cried cut him down one of you and even as he spoke he raised his bow but his father checked him perceiving what must be the inevitable result  if any man takes a step towards me the lantern goes straight into the gunpowder said sakrelbahr serenely and if you shoot me as you intend marzak or if any other shoots the same will happen of itself be warned unless you thirst for the paradise of the prophet  sakrelbahr cried asad and from its erstwhile anger his voice had now changed to a note of intercession he stretched out his arms appealingly to the captain whose doom he had already pronounced in his heart and mind sakrelbahr i conjure thee by the bread and salt we have eaten together return to thy senses my son  i am in my sense was the answer and being so i have no mind for the fate reserved me in algiersby the memory of that same bread and salt i have no mind to go back with thee to be hanged or sent to toil at an oar again  and if i swear to thee that naught of this shall come to pass  thoult be forsworn i would not trust thee now asad for thou art proven a fool and in all my life i never found good in a fool and never trusted onesave once and he betrayed me yesterday i pleaded with thee showing thee the wise course and affording thee thine opportunity at a slight sacrifice thou mightest have had me and hanged me at thy leisure twas my own life i offered thee and for all that thou knewest it yet thou knewest not that i knew he laughed see now what manner of fool art thou thy greed hath wrought thy ruin thy hands were opened to grasp more than they could hold see now the consequence it comes yonder in that slowly but surely approaching galleon  every word of it sank into the brain of asad thus tardily to enlighten him he wrung his hands in his blended fury and despair the crew stood in appalled silence daring to make no movement that might precipitate their end  name thine own price cried the basha at length and i swear to thee by the beard of the prophet it shall be paid thee  i named it yesterday but it was refused i offered thee my liberty and my life if that were needed to gain the liberty of another  had he looked behind him he might have seen the sudden lighting of rosamunds eyes the sudden clutch at her bosom which would have announced to him that his utterances were none so cryptic but that she had understood them  i will make thee rich and honoured sakrelbahr asad continued urgently thou shalt be as mine own son the bashalik itself shall be thine when i lay it down and all men shall do thee honour in the meanwhile as to myself  i am not to be bought o mighty asad i never was already wert thou set upon my death thou canst command it now but only upon the condition that thou share the cup with me what is written is written we have sunk some tall ships together in our day asad well sink together in our turn tonight if that be thy desire  may thou burn for evermore in hell thou blackhearted traitor asad cursed him his anger bursting all the bonds he had imposed upon it  and then of a sudden upon that admission of defeat from their basha there arose a great clamour from the crew sakrelbahrs seahawks called upon him reminding him of their fidelity and love and asking could he repay it now by dooming them all thus to destruction  have faith in me he answered them i have never led you into aught but victory be sure that i shall not lead you now into defeaton this the last occasion that we stand together  but the galleon is upon us cried vigitello and so indeed it was creeping up slowly under that faint breeze her tall bulk loomed now above them her prow ploughing slowly forward at an acute angle to the prow of the galeasse another moment and she was alongside and with a swing and clank and a yell of victory from the english seamen lining her bulwarks her grappling irons swung down to seize the corsair ship at prow and stern and waist scarce had they fastened than a torrent of men in breastplates and morions poured over her side to alight upon the prow of the galeasse and not even the fear of the lantern held above the powder barrel could now restrain the corsairs from giving these hardy boarders the reception they reserved for all infidels in an instant the fighting platform on the prow was become a raging seething hell of battle luridly illumined by the ruddy glow from the lights aboard the silver heron foremost among those who had leapt down had been lionel and sir john killigrew foremost among those to receive them had been jasper leigh who had passed his sword through lionels body even as lionels feet came to rest upon the deck and before the battle was joined  a dozen others went down on either side before sakrelbahrs ringing voice could quell the fighting before his command to them to hear him was obeyed  hold there he had bellowed to his seahawks using the lingua franca back and leave this to me i will rid you of these foes then in english he had summoned his countrymen also to desist sir john killigrew he called in a loud voice hold your hand until you have heard me call your men back and let none others come aboard hold until you have heard me i say then wreak your will  sir john perceiving him by the mainmast with rosamund at his side and leaping at the most inevitable conclusion that he meant to threaten her life perhaps to destroy her if they continued their advance flung himself before his men to check them  thus almost as suddenly as it had been joined the combat paused  what have you to say you renegade dog sir john demanded  this sir john that unless you order your men back aboard your ship and make oath to desist from this encounter ill take you straight down to hell with us at once ill heave this lantern into the powder here and we sink and you come down with us held by your own grappling hooks obey me and you shall have all that you have come to seek aboard this vessel mistress rosamund shall be delivered up to you  sir john glowered upon him a moment from the poop considering then  though not prepared to make terms with you he announced yet i will accept the conditions you impose but only provided that i have all indeed that i am come to seek there is aboard this galley an infamous renegade hound whom i am bound by my knightly oath to take and hang he too must be delivered up to me his name was oliver tressilian  instantly unhesitatingly came the answerhim too will i surrender to you upon your sworn oath that you will then depart and do here no further hurt  rosamund caught her breath and clutched sakrelbahrs arm the arm that held the lantern  have a care mistress he bade her sharply or you will destroy us all  better that she answered him  and then sir john pledged him his word that upon his own surrender and that of rosamund he would withdraw nor offer hurt to any there  sakrelbahr turned to his waiting corsairs and briefly told them what the terms he had made  he called upon asad to pledge his word that these terms would be respected and no blood shed on his behalf and asad answered him voicing the anger of all against him for his betrayal  since he wants thee that he may hang thee he may have thee and so spare us the trouble for tis no less than thy treachery deserves from us  thus then i surrender he announced to sir john and flung the lantern overboard  one voice only was raised in his defence and that voice was rosamunds but even that voice failed conquered by weary nature this last blow following upon all that lately she had endured bereft her of all strength half swooning she collapsed against sakrelbahr even as sir john and a handful of his followers leapt down to deliver her and make fast their prisoner  the corsairs stood looking on in silence the loyalty to their great captain which would have made them spend their last drop of blood in his defence was quenched by his own act of treachery which had brought the english ship upon them yet when they saw him pinioned and hoisted to the deck of the silver heron there was a sudden momentary reaction in their ranks scimitars were waved aloft and cries of menace burst forth if he had betrayed them yet he had so contrived that they should not suffer by that betrayal and that was worthy of the sakrelbahr they knew and loved so worthy that their love and loyalty leapt fullarmed again upon the instant  but the voice of asad called upon them to bear in mind what in their name he had promised and since the voice of asad alone might not have sufficed to quell that sudden spark of revolt there came down to them the voice of sakrelbahr himself issuing his last command  remember and respect the terms i have made for you mektub may allah guard and prosper you  a wail was his reply and with that wail ringing in his ears to assure him that he did not pass unloved he was hurried below to prepare him for his end  the ropes of the grapnels were cut and slowly the galleon passed away into the night leaving the galley to replace what slaves had been maimed in the encounter and to head back for algiers abandoning the expedition against the argosy of spain  under the awning upon the poop asad now sat like a man who has awakened from an evil dream he covered his head and wept for one who had been as a son to him and whom through his madness he had lost he cursed all women and he cursed destiny but the bitterest curse of all was for himself  in the pale dawn they flung the dead overboard and washed the decks nor did they notice that a man was missing in token that the english captain or else his followers had not kept strictly to the letter of the bond  they returned in mourning to algiersmourning not for the spanish argosy which had been allowed to go her ways unmolested but for the stoutest captain that ever bared his scimitar in the service of islam the story of how he came to be delivered up was never clearly told none dared clearly tell it for none who had participated in the deed but took shame in it thereafter however clear it might be that sakrelbahr had brought it all upon himself but at least it was understood that he had not fallen in battle and hence it was assumed that he was still alive upon that presumption there was built up a sort of legend that he would one day come back and redeemed captives returning a halfcentury later related how in algiers to that day the coming of sakrelbahr was still confidently expected and looked for by all true muslimeen     chapter xxiii the heathen creed   sakrelbahr was shut up in a black hole in the forecastle of the silver heron to await the dawn and to spend the time in making his soul no words had passed between him and sir john since his surrender with wrists pinioned behind him he had been hoisted aboard the english ship and in the waist of her he had stood for a moment face to face with an old acquaintanceour chronicler lord henry goade i imagine the florid countenance of the queens lieutenant wearing a preternaturally grave expression his eyes forbidding as they rested upon the renegade i knowfrom lord henrys own penthat no word had passed between them during those brief moments before sakrelbahr was hurried away by his guards to be flung into those dark cramped quarters reeking of tar and bilge  for a long hour he lay where he had fallen believing himself alone and time and place would no doubt conduce to philosophical reflection upon his condition i like to think that he found that when all was considered he had little with which to reproach himself if he had done evil he had made ample amends it can scarcely be pretended that he had betrayed those loyal muslimeen followers of his or if it is at least it must be added that he himself had paid the price of that betrayal rosamund was safe lionel would meet the justice due to him and as for himself being as good as dead already he was worth little thought he must have derived some measure of content from the reflection that he was spending his life to the very best advantage ruined it had been long since true but for his illstarred expedition of vengeance he might long have continued to wage war as a corsair might even have risen to the proud muslim eminence of the bashalik of algiers and become a feudatory prince of the grand turk but for one who was born a christian gentleman that would have been an unworthy way to have ended his days the present was the better course  a faint rustle in the impenetrable blackness of his prison turned the current of his thoughts a rat he thought and drew himself to a sitting attitude and beat his slippered heels upon the ground to drive away the loathly creature instead a voice challenged him out of the gloom  whos there  it startled him for a moment in his complete assurance that he had been alone  whos there the voice repeated querulously to add what black hell be this where am i  and now he recognized the voice for jasper leighs and marvelled how that latest of his recruits to the ranks of mohammed should be sharing this prison with him  faith said he youre in the forecastle of the silver heron though how you come here is more than i can answer  who are ye the voice asked  i have been known in barbary as sakrelbahr  sir oliver  i suppose that is what they will call me now it is as well perhaps that i am to be buried at sea else it might plague these christian gentlemen what legend to inscribe upon my headstone but youhow come you hither my bargain with sir john was that none should be molested and i cannot think sir john would be forsworn  as to that i know nothing since i did not even know where i was bestowed until ye informed me i was knocked senseless in the fight after i had put my bilbo through your comely brother that is the sum of my knowledge  sir oliver caught his breath what do you say you killed lionel  i believe so was the cool answer at least i sent a couple of feet of steel through himtwas in the press of the fight when first the english dropped aboard the galley master lionel was in the vanthe last place in which i should have looked to see him  there fell a long silence at length sir oliver spoke in a small voice  not a doubt but you gave him no more than he was seeking you are right master leigh the van was the last place in which to look for him unless he came deliberately to seek steel that he might escape a rope best so no doubt best so god rest him  do you believe in god asked the sinful skipper on an anxious note  no doubt they took you because of that sir oliver pursued as if communing with himself being in ignorance perhaps of his deserts deeming him a saint and martyr they resolved to avenge him upon you and dragged you hither for that purpose he sighed well well master leigh i make no doubt that knowing yourself for a rascal you have all your life been preparing your neck for a noose so this will come as no surprise to you  the skipper stirred uneasily and groaned lord how my head aches he complained  theyve a sure remedy for that sir oliver comforted him and youll swing in better company than you deserve for i am to be hanged in the morning too youve earned it as fully as have i master leigh yet i am sorry for yousorry you should suffer where i had not so intended  master leigh sucked in a shuddering breath and was silent for a while  then he repeated an earlier question  do you believe in god sir oliver  there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet was the answer and from his tone master leigh could not be sure that he did not mock  thats a heathen creed said he in fear and loathing  nay now its a creed by which men live they perform as they preach which is more than can be said of any christians i have ever met  how can you talk so upon the eve of death cried leigh in protest  faith said sir oliver its considered the season of truth above all others  then ye dont believe in god  on the contrary i do  but not in the real god the skipper insisted  there can be no god but the real godit matters little what men call him  then if ye believe are ye not afraid  of what  of hell damnation and eternal fire roared the skipper voicing his own belated terrors  i have but fulfilled the destiny which in his omniscience he marked out for me replied sir oliver my life hath been as he designed it since naught may exist or happen save by his will shall i then fear damnation for having been as god fashioned me  tis the heathen muslim creed master leigh protested  tis a comforting one said sir oliver and it should comfort such a sinner as thou  but master leigh refused to be comforted oh he groaned miserably i would that i did not believe in god  your disbelief could no more abolish him than can your fear create him replied sir oliver but your mood being what it is were it not best you prayed  will not you pray with me quoth that rascal in his sudden fear of the hereafter  i shall do better said sir oliver at last i shall pray for youto sir john killigrew that your life be spared  sure hell never heed you said master leigh with a catch in his breath  he shall his honour is concerned in it the terms of my surrender were that none else aboard the galley should suffer any hurt  but i killed master lionel  truebut that was in the scrimmage that preceded my making terms sir john pledged me his word and sir john will keep to it when i have made it clear to him that honour demands it  a great burden was lifted from the skippers mindthat great shadow of the fear of death that had overhung him with it it is greatly to be feared that his desperate penitence also departed at least he talked no more of damnation nor took any further thought for sir olivers opinions and beliefs concerning the hereafter he may rightly have supposed that sir olivers creed was sir olivers affair and that should it happen to be wrong he was scarcely himself a qualified person to correct it as for himself the making of his soul could wait until another day when the necessity for it should be more imminent  upon that he lay down and attempted to compose himself to sleep though the pain in his head proved a difficulty finding slumber impossible after a while he would have talked again but by that time his companions regular breathing warned him that sir oliver had fallen asleep during the silence  now this surprised and shocked the skipper he was utterly at a loss to understand how one who had lived sir olivers life been a renegade and a heathen should be able to sleep tranquilly in the knowledge that at dawn he was to hang his belated christian zeal prompted him to rouse the sleeper and to urge him to spend the little time that yet remained him in making his peace with god humane compassion on the other hand suggested to him that he had best leave him in the peace of that oblivion considering matters he was profoundly touched to reflect that in such a season sir oliver could have found room in his mind to think of him and his fate and to undertake to contrive that he should be saved from the rope he was the more touched when he bethought him of the extent to which he had himself been responsible for all that happened to sir oliver out of the consideration of heroism a certain heroism came to be begotten in him and he fell to pondering how in his turn he might perhaps serve sir oliver by a frank confession of all that he knew of the influences that had gone to make sir oliver what he was this resolve uplifted him and oddly enough it uplifted him all the more when he reflected that perhaps he would be jeopardizing his own neck by the confession upon which he had determined  so through that endless night he sat nursing his aching head and enheartened by the first purpose he had ever conceived of a truly good and altruistic deed yet fate it seemed was bent upon frustrating that purpose of his for when at dawn they came to hale sir oliver to his doom they paid no heed to jasper leighs demands that he too should be taken before sir john  thee beant included in our orders said a seaman shortly  maybe not retorted master leigh because sir john little knows what it is in my power to tell him take me before him i say that he may hear from me the truth of certain matters ere it be too late  be still the seaman bade him and struck him heavily across the face so that he reeled and collapsed into a corner thee turn will come soon just now our business be with this other heathen  naught that you can say would avail sir oliver assured him quietly but i thank you for the thought that marks you for my friend my hands are bound jasper were it otherwise i would beg leave to clasp your own fare you well  sir oliver was led out into the golden sunlight which almost blinded him after his long confinement in that dark hole they were he gathered to conduct him to the cabin where a short mockery of a trial was to be held but in the waist their progress was arrested by an officer who bade them wait  sir oliver sat down upon a coil of rope his guard about him an object of curious inspection to the rude seamen they thronged the forecastle and the hatchways to stare at this formidable corsair who once had been a cornish gentleman and who had become a renegade muslim and a terror to christianity  truth to tell the sometime cornish gentleman was difficult to discern in him as he sat there still wearing the caftan of cloth of silver over his white tunic and a turban of the same material swathed about his steel headpiece that ended in a spike idly he swung his brown sinewy legs naked from knee to ankle with the inscrutable calm of the fatalist upon his swarthy hawk face with its light agate eyes and black forked beard and those callous seamen who had assembled there to jeer and mock him were stricken silent by the intrepidity and stoicism of his bearing in the face of death  if the delay chafed him he gave no outward sign of it if his hard light eyes glanced hither and thither it was upon no idle quest he was seeking rosamund hoping for a last sight of her before they launched him upon his last dread voyage  but rosamund was not to be seen she was in the cabin at the time she had been there for this hour past and it was to her that the present delay was due     chapter xxiv the judges   in the absence of any woman into whose care they might entrust her lord henry sir john and master tobias the ships surgeon had amongst them tended rosamund as best they could when numbed and halfdazed she was brought aboard the silver heron  master tobias had applied such rude restoratives as he commanded and having made her as comfortable as possible upon a couch in the spacious cabin astern he had suggested that she should be allowed the rest of which she appeared so sorely to stand in need he had ushered out the commander and the queens lieutenant and himself had gone below to a still more urgent case that was demanding his attentionthat of lionel tressilian who had been brought limp and unconscious from the galeasse together with some four other wounded members of the silver herons crew  at dawn sir john had come below seeking news of his wounded friend he found the surgeon kneeling over lionel  as he entered master tobias turned aside rinsed his hands in a metal basin placed upon the floor and rose wiping them on a napkin  i can do no more sir john he muttered in a desponding voice he is sped  dead dye mean cried sir john a catch in his voice  the surgeon tossed aside the napkin and slowly drew down the upturned sleeves of his black doublet all but dead he answered the wonder is that any spark of life should still linger in a body with that hole in it he is bleeding inwardly and his pulse is steadily weakening it must continue so until imperceptibly he passes away you may count him dead already sir john he paused a merciful painless end he added and sighed perfunctorily his pale shaven face decently grave for all that such scenes as these were commonplaces in his life of the other four he continued blair is dead the other three should all recover  but sir john gave little heed to the matter of those others his grief and dismay at this quenching of all hope for his friend precluded any other consideration at the moment  and he will not even recover consciousness he asked insisting although already he had been answered  as i have said you may count him dead already sir john my skill can do nothing for him  sir johns head drooped his countenance drawn and grave nor can my justice he added gloomily though it avenge him it cannot give me back my friend he looked at the surgeon vengeance sir is the hollowest of all the mockeries that go to make up life  your task sir john replied the surgeon is one of justice not vengeance  a quibble when all is said he stepped to lionels side and looked down at the pale handsome face over which the dark shadows of death were already creeping if he would but speak in the interests of this justice that is to do if we might but have the evidence of his own words lest i should ever be asked to justify the hanging of oliver tressilian  surely sir the surgeon ventured there can be no such question ever mistress rosamunds word alone should suffice if indeed so much as that even were required  ay his offenses against god and man are too notorious to leave grounds upon which any should ever question my right to deal with him out of hand  there was a tap at the door and sir johns own body servant entered with the announcement that mistress rosamund was asking urgently to see him  she will be impatient for news of him sir john concluded and he groaned my god how am i to tell her to crush her in the very hour of her deliverance with such news as this was ever irony so cruel he turned and stepped heavily to the door there he paused you will remain by him to the end he bade the surgeon interrogatively  master tobias bowed of course sir john and he added twill not be long  sir john looked across at lionel againa glance of valediction god rest him he said hoarsely and passed out  in the waist he paused a moment turned to a knot of lounging seamen and bade them throw a halter over the yardarm and hale the renegade oliver tressilian from his prison then with slow heavy step and heavier heart he went up the companion to the vessels castellated poop  the sun new risen in a faint golden haze shone over a sea faintly rippled by the fresh clean winds of dawn to which their every stitch of canvas was now spread away on the larboard quarter a faint cloudy outline was the coast of spain  sir johns long sallow face was preternaturally grave when he entered the cabin where rosamund awaited him he bowed to her with a grave courtesy doffing his hat and casting it upon a chair the last five years had brought some strands of white into his thick black hair and at the temples in particular it showed very grey giving him an appearance of age to which the deep lines in his brow contributed  he advanced towards her as she rose to receive him rosamund my dear he said gently and took both her hands he looked with eyes of sorrow and concern into her white agitated face  are you sufficiently rested child  rested she echoed on a note of wonder that he should suppose it  poor lamb poor lamb he murmured as a mother might have done and drew her towards him stroking that gleaming auburn head well speed us back to england with every stitch of canvas spread take heart then and  but she broke in impetuously drawing away from him as she spoke and his heart sank with foreboding of the thing she was about to inquire  i overheard a sailor just now saying to another that it is your intent to hang sir oliver tressilian out of handthis morning  he misunderstood her utterly be comforted he said my justice shall be swift my vengeance sure the yardarm is charged already with the rope on which he shall leap to his eternal punishment  she caught her breath and set a hand upon her bosom as if to repress its sudden tumult  and upon what grounds she asked him with an air of challenge squarely facing him do you intend to do this thing  upon what grounds he faltered he stared and frowned bewildered by her question and its tone upon what grounds he repeated foolishly almost in the intensity of his amazement then he considered her more closely and the wildness of her eyes bore to him slowly an explanation of words that at first had seemed beyond explaining  i see he said in a voice of infinite pity for the conviction to which he had leapt was that her poor wits were all astray after the horrors through which she had lately travelled you must rest he said gently and give no thought to such matters as these leave them to me and be very sure that i shall avenge you as is due  sir john you mistake me i think i do not desire that you avenge me i have asked you upon what grounds you intend to do this thing and you have not answered me  in increasing amazement he continued to stare he had been wrong then she was quite sane and mistress of her wits and yet instead of the fond inquiries concerning lionel which he had been dreading came this amazing questioning of his grounds to hang his prisoner  need i state to youof all living folkthe offences which that dastard has committed he asked expressing thus the very question that he was setting himself  you need to tell me she answered by what right you constitute yourself his judge and executioner by what right you send him to his death in this peremptory fashion without trial her manner was as stern as if she were invested with all the authority of a judge  but you he faltered in his evergrowing bewilderment you rosamund against whom he has offended so grievously surely you should be the last to ask me such a question why it is my intention to proceed with him as is the manner of the sea with all knaves taken as oliver tressilian was taken if your mood be merciful towards himwhich as god lives i can scarce conceiveconsider that this is the greatest mercy he can look for  you speak of mercy and vengeance in a breath sir john she was growing calm her agitation was quieting and a grim sternness was replacing it  he made a gesture of impatience what good purpose could it serve to take him to england he demanded there he must stand his trial and the issue is foregone it were unnecessarily to torture him  the issue may be none so foregone as you suppose she replied and that trial is his right  sir john took a turn in the cabin his wits all confused it was preposterous that he should stand and argue upon such a matter with rosamund of all people and yet she was compelling him to it against his every inclination against common sense itself  if he so urges it well not deny him he said at last deeming it best to humour her well take him back to england if he demands it and let him stand his trial there but oliver tressilian must realize too well what is in store for him to make any such demand he passed before her and held out his hands in entreaty come rosamund my dear you are distraught you  i am indeed distraught sir john she answered and took the hands that he extended oh have pity she cried with a sudden change to utter intercession i implore you to have pity  what pity can i show you child you have but to name  tis not pity for me but pity for him that i am beseeching of you  for him he cried frowning again  for oliver tressilian  he dropped her hands and stood away gods light he swore you sue for pity for oliver tressilian for that renegade that incarnate devil oh you are mad he stormed mad and he flung away from her whirling his arms  i love him she said simply  that answer smote him instantly still under the shock of it he just stood and stared at her again his jaw fallen  you love him he said at last below his breath you love him you love a man who is a pirate a renegade the abductor of yourself and of lionel the man who murdered your brother  he did not she was fierce in her denial of it i have learnt the truth of that matter  from his lips i suppose said sir john and he was unable to repress a sneer and you believed him  had i not believed him i should not have married him  married him sudden horror came now to temper his bewilderment was there to be no end to these astounding revelations had they reached the climax yet he wondered or was there still more to come you married that infamous villain he asked and his voice was expressionless  i didin algiers on the night we landed there he stood gaping at her whilst a man might count to a dozen and then abruptly he exploded it is enough he roared shaking a clenched fist at the low ceiling of the cabin it is enough as gods my witness if there were no other reason to hang him that would be reason and to spare you may look to me to make an end of this infamous marriage within the hour  ah if you will but listen to me she pleaded  listen to you he paused by the door to which he had stepped in his fury intent upon giving the word that there and then should make an end and summoning oliver tressilian before him announce his fate to him and see it executed on the spot listen to you he repeated scorn and anger blending in his voice i have heard more than enough already  it was the killigrew way lord henry goade assures us pausing here at long length for one of those digressions into the history of families whose members chance to impinge upon his chronicle they were he says ever an impetuous shortreasoning folk honest and upright enough so far as their judgment carried them but hampered by a lack of penetration in that judgment  sir john as much in his earlier commerce with the tressilians as in this pregnant hour certainly appears to justify his lordship of that criticism there were a score of questions a man of perspicuity would not have asked not one of which appears to have occurred to the knight of arwenack if anything arrested him upon the cabins threshold delayed him in the execution of the thing he had resolved upon no doubt it was sheer curiosity as to what further extravagances rosamund might yet have it in her mind to utter  this man has suffered she told him and was not put off by the hard laugh with which he mocked that statement god alone knows what he has suffered in body and in soul for sins which he never committed much of that suffering came to him through me i know today that he did not murder peter i know that but for a disloyal act of mine he would be in a position incontestably to prove it without the aid of any man i know that he was carried off kidnapped before ever he could clear himself of the accusation and that as a consequence no life remained him but the life of a renegade which he chose mine was the chief fault and i must make amends spare him to me if you love me  but he had heard enough his sallow face was flushed to a flaming purple  not another word he blazed at her it is because i do love youlove and pity you from my heartthat i will not listen it seems i must save you not only from that knave but from yourself i were false to my duty by you false to your dead father and murdered brother else anon you shall thank me rosamund and again he turned to depart  thank you she cried in a ringing voice i shall curse you all my life i shall loathe and hate you holding you in horror for a murderer if you do this thing you fool can you not see you fool  he recoiled being a man of position and importance quick fearless and vindictive of temperamentand also it would seem extremely fortunateit had never happened to him in all his life to be so uncompromisingly and frankly judged she was by no means the first to account him a fool but she was certainly the first to call him one to his face and whilst to the general it might have proved her extreme sanity to him it was no more than the culminating proof of her mental distemper  pish he said between anger and pity you are mad stark mad your minds unhinged your visions all distorted this fiend incarnate is become a poor victim of the evil of others and i am become a murderer in your sighta murderer and a fool gods life bah anon when you are rested when you are restored i pray that things may once again assume their proper aspect  he turned all aquiver still with indignation and was barely in time to avoid being struck by the door which opened suddenly from without  lord henry goade dressedas he tells usentirely in black and with his gold chain of officean ominous sign could they have read itupon his broad chest stood in the doorway silhouetted sharply against the flood of morning sunlight at his back his benign face would no doubt be extremely grave to match the suit he had put on but its expression will have lightened somewhat when his glance fell upon rosamund standing there by the tables edge  i was overjoyed he writes to find her so far recovered and seeming so much herself again and i expressed my satisfaction  she were better abed snapped sir john two hectic spots burning still in his sallow cheeks she is distempered quite  sir john is mistaken my lord was her calm assurance i am very far from suffering as he conceives  i rejoice therein my dear said his lordship and i imagine his questing eyes speeding from one to the other of them and marking the evidences of sir johns temper wondering what could have passed it happens he added sombrely that we may require your testimony in this grave matter that is toward he turned to sir john i have bidden them bring up the prisoner for sentence is the ordeal too much for you rosamund  indeed no my lord she replied readily i welcome it and threw back her head as one who braces herself for a trial of endurance  no no cut in sir john protesting fiercely do not heed her harry she  considering she interrupted that the chief count against the prisoner must concern his his dealings with myself surely the matter is one upon which i should be heard  surely indeed lord henry agreed a little bewildered he confesses always provided you are certain it will not overtax your endurance and distress you overmuch we could perhaps dispense with your testimony  in that my lord i assure you that you are mistaken she answered you cannot dispense with it  be it so then said sir john grimly and he strode back to the table prepared to take his place there  lord henrys twinkling blue eyes were still considering rosamund somewhat searchingly his fingers tugging thoughtfully at his short tuft of ashencoloured beard then he turned to the door come in gentlemen he said and bid them bring up the prisoner  steps clanked upon the deck and three of sir johns officers made their appearance to complete the court that was to sit in judgment upon the renegade corsair a judgment whose issue was foregone     chapter xxv the advocate   chairs were set at the long brown table of massive oak and the officers sat down facing the open door and the blaze of sunshine on the poopdeck their backs to the other door and the horn windows which opened upon the sterngallery the middle place was assumed by lord henry goade by virtue of his office of queens lieutenant and the reason for his chain of office became now apparent he was to preside over this summary court on his right sat sir john killigrew and beyond him an officer named youldon the other two whose names have not survived occupied his lordships left  a chair had been set for rosamund at the tables extreme right and across the head of it so as to detach her from the judicial bench she sat there now her elbows on the polished board her face resting in her halfclenched hands her eyes scrutinizing the five gentlemen who formed this court  steps rang on the companion and a shadow fell athwart the sunlight beyond the open door from the vessels waist came a murmur of voices and a laugh then sir oliver appeared in the doorway guarded by two fighting seamen in corselet and morion with drawn swords  he paused an instant in the doorway and his eyelids flickered as if he had received a shock when his glance alighted upon rosamund then under the suasion of his guards he entered and stood forward his wrists still pinioned behind him slightly in advance of the two soldiers  he nodded perfunctorily to the court his face entirely calm  a fine morning sirs said he  the five considered him in silence but lord henrys glance as it rested upon the corsairs muslim garb was eloquent of the scorn which he tells us filled his heart  you are no doubt aware sir said sir john after a long pause of the purpose for which you have been brought hither  scarcely said the prisoner but i have no doubt whatever of the purpose for which i shall presently be taken hence however he continued cool and critical i can guess from your judicial attitudes the superfluous mockery that you intend if it will afford you entertainment faith i do not grudge indulging you i would observe only that it might be considerate in you to spare mistress rosamund the pain and weariness of the business that is before you  mistress rosamund herself desired to be present said sir john scowling  perhaps said sir oliver she does not realize  i have made it abundantly plain to her sir john interrupted almost vindictively  the prisoner looked at her as if in surprise his brows knit then with a shrug he turned to his judges again  in that case said he theres no more to be said but before you proceed there is another matter upon which i desire an understanding  the terms of my surrender were that all others should be permitted to go free you will remember sir john that you pledged me your knightly word for that yet i find aboard here one who was lately with me upon my galeassea sometime english seaman named jasper leigh whom you hold a prisoner  he killed master lionel tressilian said sir john coldly  that may be sir john but the blow was delivered before i made my terms with you and you cannot violate these terms without hurt to your honour  dye talk of honour sir said lord henry  of sir johns honour my lord said the prisoner with mock humility  you are here sir to take your trial sir john reminded him  so i had supposed it is a privilege for which you agreed to pay a certain price and now it seems you have been guilty of filching something back it seems so i say for i cannot think but that the arrest was inadvertently effected and that it will suffice that i draw your attention to the matter of master leighs detention  sir john considered the table it was beyond question that he was in honour bound to enlarge master leigh whatever the fellow might have done and indeed his arrest had been made without sir johns knowledge until after the event  what am i do with him he growled sullenly  that is for yourself to decide sir john but i can tell you what you may not do with him you may not keep him a prisoner or carry him to england or injure him in any way since his arrest was a pure error as i gather you must repair that error as best you can i am satisfied that you will do so and need say no more your servant sirs he added to intimate that he was now entirely at their disposal and he stood waiting  there was a slight pause and then lord henry his face inscrutable his glance hostile and cold addressed the prisoner  we have had you brought hither to afford you an opportunity of urging any reasons why we should not hang you out of hand as is our right  sir oliver looked at him in almost amused surprise faith he said at length it was never my habit to waste breath  i doubt you do not rightly apprehend me sir returned his lordship and his voice was soft and silken as became his judicial position should you demand a formal trial we will convey you to england that you may have it  but lest you should build unduly upon that cut in sir john fiercely let me warn you that as the offences for which you are to suffer were chiefly committed within lord henry goades own jurisdiction your trial will take place in cornwall where lord henry has the honour to be her majestys lieutenant and dispenser of justice  her majesty is to be congratulated said sir oliver elaborately  it is for you to choose sir sir john ran on whether you will be hanged on sea or land  my only possible objection would be to being hanged in the air but youre not likely to heed that was the flippant answer  lord henry leaned forward again let me beg you sir in your own interests to be serious he admonished the prisoner  i confess the occasion my lord for if you are to sit in judgment upon my piracy i could not desire a more experienced judge of the matter on sea or land than sir john killigrew  i am glad to deserve your approval sir john replied tartly piracy he added is but the least of the counts against you  sir olivers brows went up and he stared at the row of solemn faces  as gods my life then your other counts must needs be soundor else if there be any justice in your methods you are like to be disappointed of your hopes of seeing me swing proceed sirs to the other counts i vow you become more interesting than i could have hoped  can you deny the piracy quoth lord henry  deny it no but i deny your jurisdiction in the matter or that of any english court since i have committed no piracy in english waters  lord henry admits that the answer silenced and bewildered him being utterly unexpected yet what the prisoner urged was a truth so obvious that it was difficult to apprehend how his lordship had come to overlook it i rather fear that despite his judicial office jurisprudence was not a strong point with his lordship but sir john less perspicuous or less scrupulous in the matter had his retort ready  did you not come to arwenack and forcibly carry off thence  nay now nay now the corsair interrupted goodhumouredly go back to school sir john to learn that abduction is not piracy  call it abduction if you will sir john admitted  not if i will sir john well call it what it is if you please  you are trifling sir but we shall mend that presently and sir john banged the table with his fist his face flushing slightly in anger lord henry very properly deplores this show of heat at such a time you cannot pretend to be ignorant sir john continued that abduction is punishable by death under the law of england he turned to his fellowjudges we will then sirs with your concurrence say no more of the piracy  faith said lord henry in his gentle tones in justice we cannot and he shrugged the matter aside the prisoner is right in what he claims we have no jurisdiction in that matter seeing that he committed no piracy in english waters norso far as our knowledge goesagainst any vessel sailing under the english flag  rosamund stirred slowly she took her elbows from the table and folded her arms resting them upon the edge of it thus leaning forward she listened now with an odd brightness in her eye a slight flush in her cheeks reflecting some odd excitement called into life by lord henrys admissionan admission which sensibly whittled down the charges against the prisoner  sir oliver watching her almost furtively noted this and marvelled even as he marvelled at her general composure it was in vain that he sought to guess what might be her attitude of mind towards himself now that she was safe again among friends and protectors  but sir john intent only upon the business ahead plunged angrily on  be it so he admitted impatiently we will deal with him upon the counts of abduction and murder have you anything to say  nothing that would be like to weigh with you replied sir oliver and then with a sudden change from his slightly derisive manner to one that was charged with passion let us make an end of this comedy he cried of this pretence of judicial proceedings hang me and have done or set me to walk the plank play the pirate for that is a trade you understand but a gods name dont disgrace the queens commission by playing the judge  sir john leapt to his feet his face aflame now by heaven you insolent knave  but lord henry checked him placing a restraining hand upon his sleeve and forcing him gently back into his seat himself he now addressed the prisoner  sir your words are unworthy one who whatever his crimes has earned the repute of being a sturdy valiant fighter your deeds are so notoriousparticularly that which caused you to flee from england and take to roving and that of your reappearance at arwenack and the abduction of which you were then guiltythat your sentence in an english court is a matter foregone beyond all possible doubt nevertheless it shall be yours as i have said for the asking  yet he added and his voice was lowered and very earnest were i your friend sir oliver i would advise you that you rather choose to be dealt with in the summary fashion of the sea  sirs replied sir oliver your right to hang me i have not disputed nor do i i have no more to say  but i have  thus rosamund at last startling the court with her crisp sharp utterance all turned to look at her as she rose and stood tall and compelling at the tables end  rosamund cried sir john and rose in his turn let me implore you  she waved him peremptorily almost contemptuously into silence  since in this matter of the abduction with which sir oliver is charged she said i am the person said to have been abducted it were perhaps well that before going further in this matter you should hear what i may hereafter have to say in an english court  sir john shrugged and sat down again she would have her way he realized just as he knew that its only result could be to waste their time and protract the agony of the doomed man  lord henry turned to her his manner full of deference since the prisoner has not denied the charge and since wisely he refrains from demanding to be taken to trial we need not harass you mistress rosamund nor will you be called upon to say anything in an english court  there you are at fault my lord she answered her voice very level i shall be called upon to say something when i impeach you all for murder upon the high seas as impeach you i shall if you persist in your intent  rosamund cried oliver in his sudden amazementand it was a cry of joy and exultation  she looked at him and smileda smile full of courage and friendliness and something more a smile for which he considered that his impending hanging was but a little price to pay then she turned again to that court into which her words had flung a sudden consternation  since he disdains to deny the accusation i must deny it for him she informed them he did not abduct me sirs as is alleged i love oliver tressilian i am of full age and mistress of my actions and i went willingly with him to algiers where i became his wife  had she flung a bomb amongst them she could hardly have made a greater disorder of their wits they sat back and stared at her with blank faces muttering incoherencies  his his wife babbled lord henry you became his  and then sir john cut in fiercely a lie a lie to save that foul villains neck  rosamund leaned towards him and her smile was almost a sneer your wits were ever sluggish sir john she said else you would not need reminding that i could have no object in lying to save him if he had done me the wrong that is imputed to him then she looked at the others i think sirs that in this matter my word will outweigh sir johns or any mans in any court of justice  faith thats true enough ejaculated the bewildered lord henry a moment killigrew and again he stilled the impetuous sir john he looked at sir oliver who in truth was very far from being the least bewildered in that company what do you say to that sir he asked  to that echoed the almost speechless corsair what is there left to say he evaded  tis all false cried sir john again we were witnesses of the eventyou and i harryand we saw  you saw rosamund interrupted but you did not know what had been concerted  for a moment that silenced them again they were as men who stand upon crumbling ground whose every effort to win to a safer footing but occasioned a fresh slide of soil then sir john sneered and made his riposte  no doubt she will be prepared to swear that her betrothed master lionel tressilian accompanied her willingly upon that elopement  no she answered as for lionel tressilian he was carried off that he might expiate his sinssins which he had fathered upon his brother there sins which are the subject of your other count against him  now what can you mean by that asked his lordship  that the story that sir oliver killed my brother is a calumny that the murderer was lionel tressilian who to avoid detection and to complete his work caused sir oliver to be kidnapped that he might be sold into slavery  this is too much roared sir john she is trifling with us she makes white black and black white she has been bewitched by that crafty rogue by moorish arts that  wait said lord henry raising his hand give me leave he confronted her very seriously this this is a grave statement mistress have you any proofanything that you conceive to be a proofof what you are saying  but sir john was not to be repressed tis but the lying tale this villain told her he has bewitched her i say tis plain as the sunlight yonder  sir oliver laughed outright at that his mood was growing exultant buoyant and joyous and this was the first expression of it bewitched her youre determined never to lack for a charge first twas piracy then abduction and murder and now tis witchcraft  oh a moment pray cried lord henry and he confesses to some heat at this point do you seriously tell us mistress rosamund that it was lionel tressilian who murdered peter godolphin  seriously she echoed and her lips were twisted in a little smile of scorn i not merely tell it you i swear it here in the sight of god it was lionel who murdered my brother and it was lionel who put it about that the deed was sir olivers it was said that sir oliver had run away from the consequences of something discovered against him and i to my shame believed the public voice but i have since discovered the truth  the truth do you say mistress cried the impetuous sir john in a voice of passionate contempt the truth  again his lordship was forced to intervene  have patience man he admonished the knight the truth will prevail in the end never fear killigrew  meanwhile we are wasting time grumbled sir john and on that fell moodily silent  are we further to understand you to say mistress lord henry resumed that the prisoners disappearance from penarrow was due not to flight as was supposed but to his having been trepanned by order of his brother  that is the truth as i stand here in the sight of heaven she replied in a voice that rang with sincerity and carried conviction to more than one of the officers seated at that table by that act the murderer sought not only to save himself from exposure but to complete his work by succeeding to the tressilian estates sir oliver was to have been sold into slavery to the moors of barbary instead the vessel upon which he sailed was captured by spaniards and he was sent to the galleys by the inquisition when his galley was captured by muslim corsairs he took the only way of escape that offered he became a corsair and a leader of corsairs and then  what else he did we know lord henry interrupted and i assure you it would all weigh very lightly with us or with any court if what else you say is true  it is true i swear it my lord she repeated  ay he answered nodding gravely but can you prove it  what better proof can i offer you than that i love him and have married him  bah said sir john  that mistress said lord henry his manner extremely gentle is proof that yourself you believe this amazing story but it is not proof that the story itself is true you had it i suppose he continued smoothly from oliver tressilian himself  that is so but in lionels own presence and lionel himself confirmed itadmitting its truth  you dare say that cried sir john and stared at her in incredulous anger my god you dare say that  i dare and do she answered him giving him back look for look  lord henry sat back in his chair and tugged gently at his ashen tuft of beard his florid face overcast and thoughtful there was something here he did not understand at all mistress rosamund he said quietly let me exhort you to consider the gravity of your words you are virtually accusing one who is no longer able to defend himself if your story is established infamy will rest for ever upon the memory of lionel tressilian let me ask you again and let me entreat you to answer scrupulously did lionel tressilian admit the truth of this thing with which you say that the prisoner charged him  once more i solemnly swear that what i have spoken is true that lionel tressilian did in my presence when charged by sir oliver with the murder of my brother and the kidnapping of himself admit those charges can i make it any plainer sirs  lord henry spread his hands after that killigrew i do not think we can go further in this matter sir oliver must go with us to england and there take his trial  but there was one presentthat officer named youldonwhose wits it seems were of keener temper  by your leave my lord he now interposed and he turned to question the witness what was the occasion on which sir oliver forced this admission from his brother  truthfully she answered at his house in algiers on the night he she checked suddenly perceiving then the trap that had been set for her and the others perceived it also sir john leapt into the breach which youldon had so shrewdly made in her defences  continue pray he bade her on the night he  on the night we arrived there she answered desperately the colour now receding slowly from her face  and that of course said sir john slowly mockingly almost was the first occasion on which you heard this explanation of sir olivers conduct  it was she falteredperforce  so that insisted sir john determined to leave her no loophole whatsoever so that until that night you had naturally continued to believe sir oliver to be the murderer of your brother  she hung her head in silence realizing that the truth could not prevail here since she had hampered it with a falsehood which was now being dragged into the light  answer me sir john commanded  there is no need to answer said lord henry slowly in a voice of pain his eyes lowered to the table there can of course be but one answer mistress rosamund has told us that he did not abduct her forcibly that she went with him of her own free will and married him and she has urged that circumstance as a proof of her conviction of his innocence yet now it becomes plain that at the time she left england with him she still believed him to be her brothers slayer yet she asks us to believe that he did not abduct her he spread his hands again and pursed his lips in a sort of grieved contempt  let us make an end a gods name said sir john rising  ah wait she cried i swear that all that i have told you is trueall but the matter of the abduction i admit that but i condoned it in view of what i have since learnt  she admits it mocked sir john  but she went on without heeding him knowing what he has suffered through the evil of others i gladly own him my husband hoping to make some amends to him for the part i had in his wrongs you must believe me sirs but if you will not i ask you is his action of yesterday to count for naught are you not to remember that but for him you would have had no knowledge of my whereabouts  they stared at her in fresh surprise  to what do you refer now mistress what action of his is responsible for this  do you need to ask are you so set on murdering him that you affect ignorance surely you know that it was he dispatched lionel to inform you of my whereabouts  lord henry tells us that at this he smote the table with his open palm displaying an anger he could no longer curb this is too much he cried hitherto i have believed you sincere but misguided and mistaken but so deliberate a falsehood transcends all bounds what has come to you girl why lionel himself told us the circumstances of his escape from the galeasse himself he told us how that villain had him flogged and then flung him into the sea for dead  ah said sir oliver between his teeth i recognize lionel there he would be false to the end of course i should have thought of that  rosamund at bay in a burst of regal anger leaned forward to face lord henry and the others he lied the base treacherous dog she cried  madam sir john rebuked her you are speaking of one who is all but dead  and more than damned added sir oliver sirs he cried you prove naught but your own stupidity when you accuse this gentle lady of falsehood  we have heard enough sir lord henry interrupted  have you so by god he roared stung suddenly to anger you shall hear yet a little more the truth will prevail you have said yourself and prevail the truth shall since this sweet lady so desires it  he was flushed and his light eyes played over them like points of steel and like points of steel they carried a certain measure of compulsion he had stood before them halfmocking and indifferent resigned to hang and desiring the thing might be over and ended as speedily as possible but all that was before he suspected that life could still have anything to offer him whilst he conceived that rosamund was definitely lost to him true he had the memory of a certain tenderness she had shown him yesternight aboard the galley but he had deemed that tenderness to be no more than such as the situation itself begot almost he had deemed the same to be here the case until he had witnessed her fierceness and despair in fighting for his life until he had heard and gauged the sincerity of her avowal that she loved him and desired to make some amends to him for all that he had suffered in the past that had spurred him and had a further spur been needed it was afforded him when they branded her words with falsehood mocked her to her face with what they supposed to be her lies anger had taken him at that to stiffen his resolve to make a stand against them and use the one weapon that remained himthat a merciful chance a just god had placed within his power almost despite himself  i little knew sirs he said that sir john was guided by the hand of destiny itself when last night in violation of the terms of my surrender he took a prisoner from my galeasse that man is as i have said a sometime english seaman named jasper leigh he fell into my hands some months ago and took the same road to escape from thraldom that i took myself under the like circumstances i was merciful in that i permitted him to do so for he is the very skipper who was suborned by lionel to kidnap me and carry me into barbary with me he fell into the hands of the spaniards have him brought hither and question him  in silence they all looked at him but on more than one face he saw the reflection of amazement at his impudence as they conceived it  it was lord henry who spoke at last surely sir this is most oddly most suspiciously apt he said and there could be no doubt that he was faintly sneering the very man to be here aboard and taken prisoner thus almost by chance  not quite by chance though very nearly he conceives that he has a grudge against lionel for it was through lionel that misfortune overtook him last night when lionel so rashly leapt aboard the galley jasper leigh saw his opportunity to settle an old score and took it it was as a consequence of that that he was arrested  even so the chance is still miraculous  miracles my lord must happen sometimes if the truth is to prevail sir oliver replied with a tinge of his earlier mockery fetch him hither and question him he knows naught of what has passed here it were a madness to suppose him primed for a situation which none could have foreseen fetch him hither then  steps sounded outside but went unheeded at the moment  surely said sir john we have been trifled with by liars long enough  the door was flung open and the lean black figure of the surgeon made its appearance  sir john he called urgently breaking without ceremony into the proceedings and never heeding lord henrys scowl master tressilian has recovered consciousness he is asking for you and for his brother quick sirs he is sinking fast     chapter xxvi the judgment   to that cabin below the whole company repaired in all speed in the surgeons wake sir oliver coming last between his guards they assembled about the couch where lionel lay leadenhued of face his breathing laboured his eyes dull and glazing  sir john ran to him went down upon one knee to put loving arms about that chilling clay and very gently raised him in them and held him so resting against his breast  lionel he cried in stricken accents and then as if thoughts of vengeance were to soothe and comfort his sinking friends last moments he added we have the villain fast  very slowly and with obvious effort lionel turned his head to the right and his dull eyes went beyond sir john and made quest in the ranks of those that stood about him  oliver he said in a hoarse whisper where is oliver  there is not the need to distress you sir john was beginning when lionel interrupted him  wait he commanded in a louder tone is oliver safe  i am here said sir olivers deep voice and those who stood between him and his brother drew aside that they might cease from screening him  lionel looked at him for a long moment in silence sitting up a little then he sank back again slowly against sir johns breast  god has been merciful to me a sinner he said since he accords me the means to make amends tardily though it be  then he struggled up again and held out his arms to sir oliver and his voice came in a great pleading cry noll my brother forgive  oliver advanced none hindering until with his hands still pinioned behind him he stood towering there above his brother so tall that his turban brushed the low ceiling of the cabin his countenance was stern and grim  what is it that you ask me to forgive he asked lionel struggled to answer and sank back again into sir johns arms fighting for breath there was a trace of bloodstained foam about his lips  speak oh speak in gods name rosamund exhorted him from the other side and her voice was wrung with agony  he looked at her and smiled faintly never fear he whispered i shall speak god has spared me to that end take your arms from me killigrew i am the the vilest of men it it was i who killed peter godolphin  my god groaned sir john whilst lord henry drew a sharp breath of dismay and realization  ah but that is not my sin lionel continued there was no sin in that we fought and in selfdefence i slew himfighting fair my sin came afterwards when suspicion fell on oliver i nourished itoliver knew the deed was mine and kept silent that he might screen me i feared the truth might become known for all that and and i was jealous of him and and i had him kidnapped to be sold  his fading voice trailed away into silence a cough shook him and the faint crimson foam on his lips was increased but he rallied again and lay there panting his fingers plucking at the coverlet  tell them said rosamund who in her desperate fight for sir olivers life kept her mind cool and steady and directed towards essentials tell them the name of the man you hired to kidnap him  jasper leigh the skipper of the swallow he answered whereupon she flashed upon lord henry a look that contained a gleam of triumph for all that her face was ashen and her lips trembled  then she turned again to the dying man relentlessly almost in her determination to extract all vital truth from him ere he fell silent  tell them she bade him under what circumstances sir oliver sent you last night to the silver heron  nay there is no need to harass him lord henry interposed he has said enough already may god forgive us our blindness killigrew  sir john bowed his head in silence over lionel  is it you sir john whispered the dying man what still there ha he seemed to laugh faintly then checked i am going he muttered and again his voice grew stronger obeying the last flicker of his shrinking will noll i am going ii have made reparation all that i could give me give me thy hand gropingly he put forth his right  i should have given it you ere this but that my wrists are bound cried oliver in a sudden frenzy and then exerting that colossal strength of his he suddenly snapped the cords that pinioned him as if they had been thread he caught his brothers extended hand and dropped upon his knees beside him lionelboy he cried it was as if all that had befallen in the last five years had been wiped out of existence his fierce relentless hatred of his halfbrother his burning sense of wrong his parching thirst for vengeance became on the instant all dead buried and forgotten more it was as if they had never been lionel in that moment was again the weak comely beloved brother whom he had cherished and screened and guarded and for whom when the hour arrived he had sacrificed his good name and the woman he loved and placed his life itself in jeopardy  lionel boy was all that for a moment he could say then poor lad poor lad he added temptation was too strong for thee and reaching forth he took the other white hand that lay beyond the couch and so held both tightclasped within his own  from one of the ports a ray of sunshine was creeping upwards towards the dying mans face but the radiance that now overspread it was from an inward source feebly he returned the clasp of his brothers hands  oliver oliver he whispered there is none like thee i ever knew thee as noble as i was base have i said enough to make you safe say that he will be safe now he appealed to the others that no  he will be safe said lord henry stoutly my word ont  it is well the past is past the future is in your hands oliver gods blessing ont he seemed to collapse to rally yet again he smiled pensively his mind already wandering that was a long swim last nightthe longest i ever swam from penarrow to trefusisa fine long swim but you were with me noll had my strength given outi could have depended on you i am still chill from it for it was cold cold ugh he shuddered and lay still  gently sir john lowered him to his couch beyond it rosamund fell upon her knees and covered her face whilst by sir johns side oliver continued to kneel clasping in his own his brothers chilling hands  there ensued a long spell of silence then with a heavy sigh sir oliver folded lionels hands across his breast and slowly heavily rose to his feet  the others seemed to take this for a signal it was as if they had but waited mute and still out of deference to oliver lord henry moved softly round to rosamund and touched her lightly upon the shoulder she rose and went out in the wake of the others lord henry following her and none remaining but the surgeon  outside in the sunshine they checked sir john stood with bent head and hunched shoulders his eyes upon the white deck timidly almosta thing never seen before in this bold manhe looked at sir oliver  he was my friend he said sorrowfully and as if to excuse and explain himself and and i was misled through love of him  he was my brother replied sir oliver solemnly god rest him  sir john resolved drew himself up into an attitude preparatory to receiving with dignity a rebuff should it be administered him  can you find it in your generosity sir to forgive me he asked and his air was almost one of challenge  silently sir oliver held out his hand sir john fell upon it almost in eagerness  we are like to be neighbours again he said and i give you my word i shall strive to be a more neighbourly one than in the past  then sirs said sir oliver looking from sir john to lord henry i am to understand that i am no longer a prisoner  you need not hesitate to return with us to england sir oliver replied his lordship the queen shall hear your story and we have jasper leigh to confirm it if need be and i will go warranty for your complete reinstatement count me your friend sir oliver i beg and he too held out his hand then turning to the others come sirs he said we have duties elsewhere i think  they tramped away leaving oliver and rosamund alone the twain looked long each at the other there was so much to say so much to ask so much to explain that neither knew with what words to begin then rosamund suddenly came up to him holding out her hands oh my dear she said and that after all summed up a deal  one or two overinquisitive seamen lounging on the forecastle and peeping through the shrouds were disgusted to see the lady of godolphin court in the arms of a beturbaned barelegged follower of mahound
