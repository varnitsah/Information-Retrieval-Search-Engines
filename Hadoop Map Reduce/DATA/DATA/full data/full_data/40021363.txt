country places tell to their grandchildren  nobody knows how old they are or who told them first  the children of ham shem and japhet may have listened to them in the ark on wet days  hectors little boy may have heard them in troy town for it is certain that homer knew them and that some of them were written down in egypt about the time of moses  people in different countries tell them differently but they are always the same stories really whether among little zulus at the cape or little eskimo near the north pole  the changes are only in matters of manners and customs such as wearing clothes or not meeting lions who talk in the warm countries or talking bears in the cold countries  there are plenty of kings and queens in the fairy tales just because long ago there were plenty of kings in the country  a gentleman who would be a squire now was a kind of king in scotland in very old times and the same in other places  these old stories never forgotten were taken down in writing in different ages but mostly in this century in all sorts of languages  these ancient stories are the contents of the fairy books  now the arabian nights some of which but not nearly all are given in this volume are only fairy tales of the east  the people of asia arabia and persia told them in their own way not for children but for grownup people  there were no novels then nor any printed books of course but there were people whose profession it was to amuse men and women by telling tales  they dressed the fairy stories up and made the characters good mahommedans living in bagdad or india  the events were often supposed to happen in the reign of the great caliph or ruler of the faithful haroun al raschid who lived in bagdad in 786808 ad the vizir who accompanies the caliph was also a real person of the great family of the barmecides  he was put to death by the caliph in a very cruel way nobody ever knew why  the stories must have been told in their present shape a good long while after the caliph died when nobody knew very exactly what had really happened at last some storyteller thought of writing down the tales and fixing them into a kind of framework as if they had all been narrated to a cruel sultan by his wife  probably the tales were written down about the time when edward i was fighting robert bruce  but changes were made in them at different times and a great deal that is very dull and stupid was put in and plenty of verses  neither the verses nor the dull pieces are given in this book  people in france and england knew almost nothing about the arabian nights till the reigns of queen anne and george i when they were translated into french by monsieur galland  grownup people were then very fond of fairy tales and they thought these arab stories the best that they had ever read  they were delighted with ghouls who lived among the tombs and geni who seemed to be a kind of ogres and with princesses who work magic spells and with peris who are arab fairies sindbad had adventures which perhaps came out of the odyssey of homer in fact all the east had contributed its wonders and sent them to europe in one parcel  young men once made a noise at monsieur gallands windows in the dead of night and asked him to tell them one of his marvellous tales  nobody talked of anything but dervishes and vizirs rocs and peris  the stories were translated from french into all languages and only bishop atterbury complained that the tales were not likely to be true and had no moral  the bishop was presently banished for being on the side of prince charlies father and had leisure to repent of being so solemn  in this book the arabian nights are translated from the french version of monsieur galland who dropped out the poetry and a great deal of what the arabian authors thought funny though it seems wearisome to us  in this book the stories are shortened here and there and omissions are made of pieces only suitable for arabs and old gentlemen  the translations are by the writers of the tales in the fairy books and the pictures are by mr ford  i can remember reading the arabian nights when i was six years old in dirty yellow old volumes of small type with no pictures and i hope children who read them with mr fords pictures will be as happy as i was then in the company of aladdin and sindbad the sailor    the arabian nights   in the chronicles of the ancient dynasty of the sassanidae who reigned for about four hundred years from persia to the borders of china beyond the great river ganges itself we read the praises of one of the kings of this race who was said to be the best monarch of his time his subjects loved him and his neighbors feared him and when he died he left his kingdom in a more prosperous and powerful condition than any king had done before him  the two sons who survived him loved each other tenderly and it was a real grief to the elder schahriar that the laws of the empire forbade him to share his dominions with his brother schahzeman  indeed after ten years during which this state of things had not ceased to trouble him schahriar cut off the country of great tartary from the persian empire and made his brother king  now the sultan schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the world and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful jewels  it was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he accidentally discovered after several years that she had deceived him completely and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad that he felt himself obliged to carry out the law of the land and order the grandvizir to put her to death  the blow was so heavy that his mind almost gave way and he declared that he was quite sure that at bottom all women were as wicked as the sultana if you could only find them out and that the fewer the world contained the better  so every evening he married a fresh wife and had her strangled the following morning before the grandvizir whose duty it was to provide these unhappy brides for the sultan  the poor man fulfilled his task with reluctance but there was no escape and every day saw a girl married and a wife dead  this behaviour caused the greatest horror in the town where nothing was heard but cries and lamentations  in one house was a father weeping for the loss of his daughter in another perhaps a mother trembling for the fate of her child and instead of the blessings that had formerly been heaped on the sultans head the air was now full of curses  the grandvizir himself was the father of two daughters of whom the elder was called scheherazade and the younger dinarzade  dinarzade had no particular gifts to distinguish her from other girls but her sister was clever and courageous in the highest degree  her father had given her the best masters in philosophy medicine history and the fine arts and besides all this her beauty excelled that of any girl in the kingdom of persia  one day when the grandvizir was talking to his eldest daughter who was his delight and pride scheherazade said to him father i have a favour to ask of you  will you grant it to me  i can refuse you nothing replied he that is just and reasonable  then listen said scheherazade  i am determined to stop this barbarous practice of the sultans and to deliver the girls and mothers from the awful fate that hangs over them  it would be an excellent thing to do returned the grandvizir but how do you propose to accomplish it  my father answered scheherazade it is you who have to provide the sultan daily with a fresh wife and i implore you by all the affection you bear me to allow the honour to fall upon me  have you lost your senses cried the grandvizir starting back in horror  what has put such a thing into your head  you ought to know by this time what it means to be the sultans bride  yes my father i know it well replied she and i am not afraid to think of it  if i fail my death will be a glorious one and if i succeed i shall have done a great service to my country  it is of no use said the grandvizir i shall never consent  if the sultan was to order me to plunge a dagger in your heart i should have to obey  what a task for a father  ah if you do not fear death fear at any rate the anguish you would cause me  once again my father said scheherazade will you grant me what i ask  what are you still so obstinate exclaimed the grandvizir why are you so resolved upon your own ruin  but the maiden absolutely refused to attend to her fathers words and at length in despair the grandvizir was obliged to give way and went sadly to the palace to tell the sultan that the following evening he would bring him scheherazade  the sultan received this news with the greatest astonishment  how have you made up your mind he asked to sacrifice your own daughter to me  sire answered the grandvizir it is her own wish  even the sad fate that awaits her could not hold her back  let there be no mistake vizir said the sultan  remember you will have to take her life yourself  if you refuse i swear that your head shall pay forfeit  sire returned the vizir  whatever the cost i will obey you though a father i am also your subject  so the sultan told the grandvizir he might bring his daughter as soon as he liked  the vizir took back this news to scheherazade who received it as if it had been the most pleasant thing in the world  she thanked her father warmly for yielding to her wishes and seeing him still bowed down with grief told him that she hoped he would never repent having allowed her to marry the sultan  then she went to prepare herself for the marriage and begged that her sister dinarzade should be sent for to speak to her  when they were alone scheherazade addressed her thus  my dear sister i want your help in a very important affair  my father is going to take me to the palace to celebrate my marriage with the sultan  when his highness receives me i shall beg him as a last favour to let you sleep in our chamber so that i may have your company during the last night i am alive  if as i hope he grants me my wish be sure that you wake me an hour before the dawn and speak to me in these words  my sister if you are not asleep i beg you before the sun rises to tell me one of your charming stories  then i shall begin and i hope by this means to deliver the people from the terror that reigns over them dinarzade replied that she would do with pleasure what her sister wished  when the usual hour arrived the grandvizir conducted scheherazade to the palace and left her alone with the sultan who bade her raise her veil and was amazed at her beauty  but seeing her eyes full of tears he asked what was the matter  sire replied scheherazade i have a sister who loves me as tenderly as i love her  grant me the favour of allowing her to sleep this night in the same room as it is the last we shall be together  schahriar consented to scheherazades petition and dinarzade was sent for  an hour before daybreak dinarzade awoke and exclaimed as she had promised my dear sister if you are not asleep tell me i pray you before the sun rises one of your charming stories  it is the last time that i shall have the pleasure of hearing you  scheherazade did not answer her sister but turned to the sultan will your highness permit me to do as my sister asks said she  willingly he answered  so scheherazade began    the story of the merchant and the genius   sire there was once upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth in land and merchandise as well as in ready money  he was obliged from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs  one day having to go a long way from home he mounted his horse taking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits and dates because he had to pass through the desert where no food was to be got he arrived without any mishap and having finished his business set out on his return  on the fourth day of his journey the heat of the sun being very great he turned out of his road to rest under some trees  he found at the foot of a large walnuttree a fountain of clear and running water  he dismounted fastened his horse to a branch of the tree and sat by the fountain after having taken from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits  when he had finished this frugal meal he washed his face and hands in the fountain  when he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius white with rage coming towards him with a scimitar in his hand  arise he cried in a terrible voice and let me kill you as you have killed my son  as he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell  the merchant quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster as at his words answered him tremblingly alas good sir what can i have done to you to deserve death  i shall kill you repeated the genius as you have killed my son  but said the merchant how can i have killed your son  i do not know him and i have never even seen him  when you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground asked the genius and did you not take some dates from your wallet and whilst eating them did not you throw the stones about  yes said the merchant i certainly did so  then said the genius i tell you you have killed my son for whilst you were throwing about the stones my son passed by and one of them struck him in the eye and killed him  so i shall kill you  ah sir forgive me cried the merchant  i will have no mercy on you answered the genius  but i killed your son quite unintentionally so i implore you to spare my life  no said the genius i shall kill you as you killed my son and so saying he seized the merchant by the arm threw him on the ground and lifted his sabre to cut off his head  the merchant protesting his innocence bewailed his wife and children and tried pitifully to avert his fate  the genius with his raised scimitar waited till he had finished but was not in the least touched  scheherazade at this point seeing that it was day and knowing that the sultan always rose very early to attend the council stopped speaking  indeed sister said dinarzade this is a wonderful story  the rest is still more wonderful replied scheherazade and you would say so if the sultan would allow me to live another day and would give me leave to tell it to you the next night  schahriar who had been listening to scheherazade with pleasure said to himself i will wait till tomorrow i can always have her killed when i have heard the end of her story  all this time the grandvizir was in a terrible state of anxiety  but he was much delighted when he saw the sultan enter the councilchamber without giving the terrible command that he was expecting  the next morning before the day broke dinarzade said to her sister dear sister if you are awake i pray you to go on with your story  the sultan did not wait for scheherazade to ask his leave  finish said he the story of the genius and the merchant  i am curious to hear the end  so scheherazade went on with the story  this happened every morning the sultana told a story and the sultan let her live to finish it  when the merchant saw that the genius was determined to cut off his head he said  one word more i entreat you  grant me a little delay just a short time to go home and bid my wife and children farewell and to make my will  when i have done this i will come back here and you shall kill me  but said the genius if i grant you the delay you ask i am afraid that you will not come back  i give you my word of honour answered the merchant that i will come back without fail  how long do you require asked the genius  i ask you for a years grace replied the merchant  i promise you that tomorrow twelvemonth i shall be waiting under these trees to give myself up to you  on this the genius left him near the fountain and disappeared  the merchant having recovered from his fright mounted his horse and went on his road  when he arrived home his wife and children received him with the greatest joy  but instead of embracing them he began to weep so bitterly that they soon guessed that something terrible was the matter  tell us i pray you said his wife what has happened  alas answered her husband i have only a year to live  then he told them what had passed between him and the genius and how he had given his word to return at the end of a year to be killed when they heard this sad news they were in despair and wept much  the next day the merchant began to settle his affairs and first of all to pay his debts  he gave presents to his friends and large alms to the poor  he set his slaves at liberty and provided for his wife and children  the year soon passed away and he was obliged to depart when he tried to say goodbye he was quite overcome with grief and with difficulty tore himself away  at length he reached the place where he had first seen the genius on the very day that he had appointed  he dismounted and sat down at the edge of the fountain where he awaited the genius in terrible suspense  whilst he was thus waiting an old man leading a hind came towards him they greeted one another and then the old man said to him may i ask brother what brought you to this desert place where there are so many evil genii about  to see these beautiful trees one would imagine it was inhabited but it is a dangerous place to stop long in  the merchant told the old man why he was obliged to come there  he listened in astonishment  this is a most marvellous affair  i should like to be a witness of your interview with the genius  so saying he sat down by the merchant  while they were talking another old man came up followed by two black dogs  he greeted them and asked what they were doing in this place the old man who was leading the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and the genius  the second old man had not sooner heard the story than he too decided to stay there to see what would happen  he sat down by the others and was talking when a third old man arrived he asked why the merchant who was with them looked so sad  they told him the story and he also resolved to see what would pass between the genius and the merchant so waited with the rest  they soon saw in the distance a thick smoke like a cloud of dust this smoke came nearer and nearer and then all at once it vanished and they saw the genius who without speaking to them approached the merchant sword in hand and taking him by the arm said get up and let me kill you as you killed my son  the merchant and the three old men began to weep and groan  then the old man leading the hind threw himself at the monsters feet and said o prince of the genii i beg of you to stay your fury and to listen to me  i am going to tell you my story and that of the hind i have with me and if you find it more marvellous than that of the merchant whom you are about to kill i hope that you will do away with a third part of his punishment  the genius considered some time and then he said very well i agree to this    the story of the first old man and of the hind   i am now going to begin my story said the old man so please attend  this hind that you see with me is my wife  we have no children of our own therefore i adopted the son of a favorite slave and determined to make him my heir  my wife however took a great dislike to both mother and child which she concealed from me till too late  when my adopted son was about ten years old i was obliged to go on a journey  before i went i entrusted to my wifes keeping both the mother and child and begged her to take care of them during my absence which lasted a whole year  during this time she studied magic in order to carry out her wicked scheme  when she had learnt enough she took my son into a distant place and changed him into a calf  then she gave him to my steward and told him to look after a calf she had bought  she also changed the slave into a cow which she sent to my steward  when i returned i inquired after my slave and the child  your slave is dead she said and as for your son i have not seen him for two months and i do not know where he is  i was grieved to hear of my slaves death but as my son had only disappeared i thought i should soon find him  eight months however passed and still no tidings of him then the feast of bairam came  to celebrate it i ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow to sacrifice  he did so  the cow that he brought was my unfortunate slave  i bound her but just as i was about to kill her she began to low most piteously and i saw that her eyes were streaming with tears it seemed to me most extraordinary and feeling a movement of pity i ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another  my wife who was present scoffed at my compassion which made her malice of no avail  what are you doing she cried  kill this cow  it is the best we have to sacrifice  to please her i tried again but again the animals lows and tears disarmed me  take her away i said to the steward and kill her i cannot  the steward killed her but on skinning her found that she was nothing but bones although she appeared so fat  i was vexed  keep her for yourself i said to the steward and if you have a fat calf bring that in her stead  in a short time he brought a very fat calf which although i did not know it was my son  it tried hard to break its cord and come to me it threw itself at my feet with its head on the ground as if it wished to excite my pity and to beg me not to take away its life  i was even more surprised and touched at this action than i had been at the tears of the cow  go i said to the steward take back this calf take great care of it and bring me another in its place instantly  as soon as my wife heard me speak this she at once cried out what are you doing husband  do not sacrifice any calf but this  wife i answered i will not sacrifice this calf and in spite of all her remonstrances i remained firm  i had another calf killed this one was led away  the next day the steward asked to speak to me in private  i have come he said to tell you some news which i think you will like to hear  i have a daughter who knows magic  yesterday when i was leading back the calf which you refused to sacrifice i noticed that she smiled and then directly afterwards began to cry  i asked her why she did so  father she answered this calf is the son of our master  i smile with joy at seeing him still alive and i weep to think of his mother who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow  these changes have been wrought by our masters wife who hated the mother and son  at these words of genius continued the old man i leave you to imagine my astonishment  i went immediately with the steward to speak with his daughter myself  first of all i went to the stable to see my son and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses  when the stewards daughter came i asked her if she could change my son back to his proper shape  yes i can she replied on two conditions  one is that you will give him to me for a husband and the other is that you will let me punish the woman who changed him into a calf  to the first condition i answered i agree with all my heart and i will give you an ample dowry  to the second i also agree i only beg you to spare her life  that i will do she replied i will treat her as she treated your son  then she took a vessel of water and pronounced over it some words i did not understand then on throwing the water over him he became immediately a young man once more  my son my dear son i exclaimed kissing him in a transport of joy this kind maiden has rescued you from a terrible enchantment and i am sure that out of gratitude you will marry her  he consented joyfully but before they were married the young girl changed my wife into a hind and it is she whom you see before you  i wished her to have this form rather than a stranger one so that we could see her in the family without repugnance  since then my son has become a widower and has gone travelling  i am now going in search of him and not wishing to confide my wife to the care of other people i am taking her with me  is this not a most marvellous tale  it is indeed said the genius and because of it i grant to you the third part of the punishment of this merchant  when the first old man had finished his story the second who was leading the two black dogs said to the genius i am going to tell you what happened to me and i am sure that you will find my story even more astonishing than the one to which you have just been listening but when i have related it will you grant me also the third part of the merchants punishment  yes replied the genius provided that your story surpasses that of the hind  with this agreement the second old man began in this way    the story of the second old man and of the two black dogs   great prince of the genii you must know that we are three brothersthese two black dogs and myself  our father died leaving us each a thousand sequins  with this sum we all three took up the same profession and became merchants  a short time after we had opened our shops my eldest brother one of these two dogs resolved to travel in foreign countries for the sake of merchandise  with this intention he sold all he had and bought merchandise suitable to the voyages he was about to make  he set out and was away a whole year  at the end of this time a beggar came to my shop  goodday i said  goodday he answered is it possible that you do not recognise me  then i looked at him closely and saw he was my brother  i made him come into my house and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise  do not question me he replied see me you see all i have  it would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that have befallen me in a year and have brought me to this state  i shut up my shop paid him every attention taking him to the bath giving him my most beautiful robes  i examined my accounts and found that i had doubled my capitalthat is that i now possessed two thousand sequins  i gave my brother half saying  now brother you can forget your losses  he accepted them with joy and we lived together as we had before  some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his business and travel  my eldest brother and i did all we could to dissuade him but it was of no use  he joined a caravan and set out  he came back at the end of a year in the same state as his elder brother  i took care of him and as i had a thousand sequins to spare i gave them to him and he reopened his shop  one day my two brothers came to me to propose that we should make a journey and trade  at first i refused to go  you travelled i said and what did you gain  but they came to me repeatedly and after having held out for five years i at last gave way  but when they had made their preparation and they began to buy the merchandise we needed they found they had spent every piece of the thousand sequins i had given them  i did not reproach them  i divided my six thousand sequins with them giving a thousand to each and keeping one for myself and the other three i buried in a corner of my house  we bought merchandise loaded a vessel with it and set forth with a favorable wind  after two months sailing we arrived at a seaport where we disembarked and did a great trade  then we bought the merchandise of the country and were just going to sail once more when i was stopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman  she came up to me kissed my hand and implored me to marry her and take her on board  at first i refused but she begged so hard and promised to be such a good wife to me that at last i consented  i got her some beautiful dresses and after having married her we embarked and set sail  during the voyage i discovered so many good qualities in my wife that i began to love her more and more  but my brothers began to be jealous of my prosperity and set to work to plot against my life  one night when we were sleeping they threw my wife and myself into the sea  my wife however was a fairy and so she did not let me drown but transported me to an island  when the day dawned she said to me  when i saw you on the seashore i took a great fancy to you and wished to try your good nature so i presented myself in the disguise you saw  now i have rewarded you by saving your life  but i am very angry with your brothers and i shall not rest till i have taken their lives  i thanked the fairy for all that she had done for me but i begged her not to kill my brothers  i appeased her wrath and in a moment she transported me from the island where we were to the roof of my house and she disappeared a moment afterwards  i went down and opened the doors and dug up the three thousand sequins which i had buried  i went to the place where my shop was opened it and received from my fellowmerchants congratulations on my return  when i went home i saw two black dogs who came to meet me with sorrowful faces  i was much astonished but the fairy who reappeared said to me  do not be surprised to see these dogs they are your two brothers  i have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes then having told me where i could hear news of her she vanished  the ten years are nearly passed and i am on the road to find her  as in passing i met this merchant and the old man with the hind i stayed with them  this is my history o prince of genii  do you not think it is a most marvellous one  yes indeed replied the genius and i will give up to you the third of the merchants punishment  then the third old man made the genius the same request as the other two had done and the genius promised him the last third of the merchants punishment if his story surpassed both the others  so he told his story to the genius but i cannot tell you what it was as i do not know  but i do know that it was even more marvellous than either of the others so that the genius was astonished and said to the third old man i will give up to you the third part of the merchants punishment  he ought to thank all three of you for having interested yourselves in his favour  but for you he would be here no longer  so saying he disappeared to the great joy of the company  the merchant did not fail to thank his friends and then each went on his way  the merchant returned to his wife and children and passed the rest of his days happily with them  but sire added scheherazade however beautiful are the stories i have just told you they cannot compare with the story of the fisherman    the story of the fisherman   sire there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children  he went every day to fish very early and each day he made a rule not to throw his nets more than four times  he started out one morning by moonlight and came to the seashore he undressed and threw his nets and as he was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight  he though he had caught a large fish and he felt very pleased  but a moment afterwards seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the carcase of an ass he was much disappointed  vexed with having such a bad haul when he had mended his nets which the carcase of the ass had broken in several places he threw them a second time  in drawing them in he again felt a great weight so that he thought they were full of fish  but he only found a large basket full of rubbish  he was much annoyed  o fortune he cried do not trifle thus with me a poor fisherman who can hardly support his family  so saying he threw away the rubbish and after having washed his nets clean of the dirt he threw them for the third time  but he only drew in stones shells and mud  he was almost in despair  then he threw his nets for the fourth time  when he thought he had a fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble  there was no fish however but he found a yellow pot which by its weight seemed full of something and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed with lead with the impression of a seal  he was delighted  i will sell it to the founder he said with the money i shall get for it i shall buy a measure of wheat  he examined the jar on all sides he shook it to see if it would rattle  but he heard nothing and so judging from the impression of the seal and the lid he thought there must be something precious inside  to find out he took his knife and with a little trouble he opened it  he turned it upside down but nothing came out which surprised him very much  he set it in front of him and whilst he was looking at it attentively such a thick smoke came out that he had to step back a pace or two  this smoke rose up to the clouds and stretching over the sea and the shore formed a thick mist which caused the fisherman much astonishment  when all the smoke was out of the jar it gathered itself together and became a thick mass in which appeared a genius twice as large as the largest giant  when he saw such a terriblelooking monster the fisherman would like to have run away but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step  great king of the genii cried the monster i will never again disobey you  at these words the fisherman took courage  what is this you are saying great genius  tell me your history and how you came to be shut up in that vase  at this the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily  speak to me more civilly he said before i kill you  alas why should you kill me cried the fisherman  i have just freed you have you already forgotten that  no answered the genius but that will not prevent me from killing you and i am only going to grant you one favour and that is to choose the manner of your death  but what have i done to you asked the fisherman  i cannot treat you in any other way said the genius and if you would know why listen to my story  i rebelled against the king of the genii  to punish me he shut me up in this vase of copper and he put on the leaden cover his seal which is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out  then he had the vase thrown into the sea  during the first period of my captivity i vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundred years were passed i would make him rich even after his death  but that century passed and no one freed me  in the second century i vowed that i would give all the treasures in the world to my deliverer but he never came  in the third i promised to make him a king to be always near him and to grant him three wishes every day but that century passed away as the other two had done and i remained in the same plight  at last i grew angry at being captive for so long and i vowed that if anyone would release me i would kill him at once and would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die  so you see as you have freed me today choose in what way you will die  the fisherman was very unhappy  what an unlucky man i am to have freed you  i implore you to spare my life  i have told you said the genius that it is impossible  choose quickly you are wasting time  the fisherman began to devise a plot  since i must die he said before i choose the manner of my death i conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were in that vase  yes i was answered the genius  i really cannot believe it said the fisherman  that vase could not contain one of your feet even and how could your whole body go in  i cannot believe it unless i see you do the thing  then the genius began to change himself into smoke which as before spread over the sea and the shore and which then collecting itself together began to go back into the vase slowly and evenly till there was nothing left outside  then a voice came from the vase which said to the fisherman well unbelieving fisherman here i am in the vase do you believe me now  the fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shut it down quickly on the vase  now o genius he cried ask pardon of me and choose by what death you will die  but no it will be better if i throw you into the sea whence i drew you out and i will build a house on the shore to warn fishermen who come to cast their nets here against fishing up such a wicked genius as you are who vows to kill the man who frees you  at these words the genius did all he could to get out but he could not because of the enchantment of the lid  then he tried to get out by cunning  if you will take off the cover he said i will repay you  no answered the fisherman if i trust myself to you i am afraid you will treat me as a certain greek king treated the physician douban listen and i will tell you    the story of the greek king and the physician douban   in the country of zouman in persia there lived a greek king  this king was a leper and all his doctors had been unable to cure him when a very clever physician came to his court  he was very learned in all languages and knew a great deal about herbs and medicines  as soon as he was told of the kings illness he put on his best robe and presented himself before the king  sire said he i know that no physician has been able to cure your majesty but if you will follow my instructions i will promise to cure you without any medicines or outward application  the king listened to this proposal  if you are clever enough to do this he said i promise to make you and your descendants rich for ever  the physician went to his house and made a polo club the handle of which he hollowed out and put in it the drug he wished to use  then he made a ball and with these things he went the next day to the king  he told him that he wished him to play at polo  accordingly the king mounted his horse and went into the place where he played  there the physician approached him with the bat he had made saying take this sire and strike the ball till you feel your hand and whole body in a glow  when the remedy that is in the handle of the club is warmed by your hand it will penetrate throughout your body  the you must return to your palace bathe and go to sleep and when you awake tomorrow morning you will be cured  the king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which he had thrown  he struck it and then it was hit back by the courtiers who were playing with him  when he felt very hot he stopped playing and went back to the palace went into the bath and did all that the physician had said  the next day when he arose he found to his great joy and astonishment that he was completely cured  when he entered his audiencechamber all his courtiers who were eager to see if the wonderful cure had been effected were overwhelmed with joy  the physician douban entered the hall and bowed low to the ground  the king seeing him called him made him sit by his side and showed him every mark of honour  that evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state and presented him with two thousand sequins  the following day he continued to load him with favours  now the king had a grandvizir who was avaricious and envious and a very bad man  he grew extremely jealous of the physician and determined to bring about his ruin  in order to do this he asked to speak in private with the king saying that he had a most important communication to make  what is it asked the king  sire answered the grandvizir it is most dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose faithfulness is not proved you do not know that this physician is not a traitor come here to assassinate you  i am sure said the king that this man is the most faithful and virtuous of men  if he wished to take my life why did he cure me cease to speak against him  i see what it is you are jealous of him but do not think that i can be turned against him  i remember well what a vizir said to king sindbad his master to prevent him from putting the prince his son to death  what the greek king said excited the vizirs curiosity and he said to him sire i beg your majesty to have the condescension to tell me what the vizir said to king sindbad  this vizir he replied told king sindbad that one ought not believe everything that a motherinlaw says and told him this story    the story of the husband and the parrot   a good man had a beautiful wife whom he loved passionately and never left if possible  one day when he was obliged by important business to go away from her he went to a place where all kinds of birds are sold and bought a parrot  this parrot not only spoke well but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before it  he brought it home in a cage and asked his wife to put it in her room and take great care of it while he was away  then he departed  on his return he asked the parrot what had happened during his absence and the parrot told him some things which made him scold his wife  she thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales of her but they told her it was the parrot and she resolved to revenge herself on him  when her husband next went away for one day she told on slave to turn under the birds cage a handmill another to throw water down from above the cage and a third to take a mirror and turn it in front of its eyes from left to right by the light of a candle  the slaves did this for part of the night and did it very well  the next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot what he had seen  the bird replied my good master the lightning thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long that i cannot tell you what i have suffered  the husband who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered in the night was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the truth so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on the ground that he killed him  nevertheless he was sorry afterwards for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth  when the greek king said the fisherman to the genius had finished the story of the parrot he added to the vizir and so vizir i shall not listen to you and i shall take care of the physician in case i repent as the husband did when he had killed the parrot  but the vizir was determined  sire he replied the death of the parrot was nothing  but when it is a question of the life of a king it is better to sacrifice the innocent than save the guilty  it is no uncertain thing however  the physician douban wishes to assassinate you  my zeal prompts me to disclose this to your majesty  if i am wrong i deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished  what had the vizir done said the greek king to merit the punishment i will tell your majesty if you will do me the honour to listen answered the vizir    the story of the vizir who was punished   there was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond of hunting  he often allowed him to indulge in this pastime but he had ordered his grandvizir always to go with him and never to lose sight of him  one day the huntsman roused a stag and the prince thinking that the vizir was behind gave chase and rode so hard that he found himself alone  he stopped and having lost sight of it he turned to rejoin the vizir who had not been careful enough to follow him  but he lost his way  whilst he was trying to find it he saw on the side of the road a beautiful lady who was crying bitterly  he drew his horses rein and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place and if she needed help  i am the daughter of an indian king she answered and whilst riding in the country i fell asleep and tumbled off  my horse has run away and i do not know what has become of him  the young prince had pity on her and offered to take her behind him which he did  as they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted and went in  the prince also dismounted and followed her  to his great surprise he heard her saying to some one inside rejoice my children i am bringing you a nice fat youth  and other voices replied where is he mamma that we may eat him at once as we are very hungry  the prince at once saw the danger he was in  he now knew that the lady who said she was the daughter of an indian king was an ogress who lived in desolate places and who by a thousand wiles surprised and devoured passersby he was terrified and threw himself on his horse the pretended princess appeared at this moment and seeing that she had lost her prey she said to him do not be afraid  what do you want  i am lost he answered and i am looking for the road  keep straight on said the ogress and you will find it  the prince could hardly believe his ears and rode off as hard as he could  he found his way and arrived safe and sound at his fathers house where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grandvizirs carelessness  the king was very angry and had him strangled immediately  sire went on the vizir to the greek king to return to the physician douban  if you do not take care you will repent of having trusted him  who knows what this remedy with which he has cured you may not in time have a bad effect on you  the greek king was naturally very weak and did not perceive the wicked intention of his vizir nor was he firm enough to keep to his first resolution  well vizir he said you are right  perhaps he did come to take my life  he might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs  i must see what can be done  the best means sire to put your life in security is to send for him at once and to cut off his head directly he comes said the vizir  i really think replied the king that will be the best way  he then ordered one of his ministers to fetch the physician who came at once  i have had you sent for said the king in order to free myself from you by taking your life  the physician was beyond measure astonished when he heard he was to die  what crimes have i committed your majesty  i have learnt replied the king that you are a spy and intend to kill me  but i will be first and kill you  strike he added to an executioner who was by and rid me of this assassin  at this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees  spare my life he cried and yours will be spared  the fisherman stopped here to say to the genius  you see what passed between the greek king and the physician has just passed between us two  the greek king he went on had no mercy on him and the executioner bound his eyes  all those present begged for his life but in vain  the physician on his knees and bound said to the king at least let me put my affairs in order and leave my books to persons who will make good use of them  there is one which i should like to present to your majesty  it is very precious and ought to be kept carefully in your treasury  it contains many curious things the chief being that when you cut off my head if your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf and read the third line of the lefthand page my head will answer all the questions you like to ask it  the king eager to see such a wonderful thing put off his execution to the next day and sent him under a strong guard to his house  there the physician put his affairs in order and the next day there was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death and the doings after it  the physician went up to the foot of the throne with a large book in his hand  he carried a basin on which he spread the covering of the book and presenting it to the king said  sire take this book and when my head is cut off let it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book as soon as it is there the blood will cease to flow  then open the book and my head will answer your questions but sire i implore your mercy for i am innocent  your prayers are useless and if it were only to hear your head speak when you are dead you should die  so saying he took the book from the physicians hands and ordered the executioner to do his duty  the head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin and directly the blood ceased to flow  then to the great astonishment of the king the eyes opened and the head said your majesty open the book  the king did so and finding that the first leaf stuck against the second he put his finger in his mouth to turn it more easily  he did the same thing till he reached the sixth page and not seeing any writing on it physician he said there is no writing  turn over a few more pages answered the head  the king went on turning still putting his finger in his mouth till the poison in which each page was dipped took effect  his sight failed him and he fell at the foot of his throne  when the physicians head saw that the poison had taken effect and that the king had only a few more minutes to live tyrant it cried see how cruelty and injustice are punished  scarcely had it uttered these words than the king died and the head lost also the little life that had remained in it  that is the end of the story of the greek king and now let us return to the fisherman and the genius  if the greek king said the fisherman had spared the physician he would not have thus died  the same thing applies to you  now i am going to throw you into the sea  my friend said the genius do not do such a cruel thing  do not treat me as imma treated ateca  what did imma do to ateca asked the fisherman  do you think i can tell you while i am shut up in here replied the genius  let me out and i will make you rich  the hope of being no longer poor made the fisherman give way  if you will give me your promise to do this i will open the lid  i do not think you will dare to break your word  the genius promised and the fisherman lifted the lid  he came out at once in smoke and then having resumed his proper form the first thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea  this frightened the fisherman but the genius laughed and said do not be afraid i only did it to frighten you and to show you that i intend to keep my word take your nets and follow me  he began to walk in front of the fisherman who followed him with some misgivings  they passed in front of the town and went up a mountain and then down into a great plain where there was a large lake lying between four hills  when they reached the lake the genius said to the fisherman throw your nets and catch fish  the fisherman did as he was told hoping for a good catch as he saw plenty of fish  what was his astonishment at seeing that there were four quite different kinds some white some red some blue and some yellow  he caught four one of each colour  as he had never seen any like them he admired them very much and he was very pleased to think how much money he would get for them  take these fish and carry them to the sultan who will give you more money for them than you have ever had in your life  you can come every day to fish in this lake but be careful not to throw your nets more than once every day otherwise some harm will happen to you  if you follow my advice carefully you will find it good  saying these words he struck his foot against the ground which opened and when he had disappeared it closed immediately  the fisherman resolved to obey the genius exactly so he did not cast his nets a second time but walked into the town to sell his fish at the palace  when the sultan saw the fish he was much astonished  he looked at them one after the other and when he had admired them long enough take these fish he said to his first vizir and given them to the clever cook the emperor of the greeks sent me  i think they must be as good as they are beautiful  the vizir took them himself to the cook saying here are four fish that have been brought to the sultan  he wants you to cook them  then he went back to the sultan who told him to give the fisherman four hundred gold pieces  the fisherman who had never before possessed such a large sum of money at once could hardly believe his good fortune  he at once relieved the needs of his family and made good use of it  but now we must return to the kitchen which we shall find in great confusion  the cook when she had cleaned the fish put them in a pan with some oil to fry them  when she thought them cooked enough on one side she turned them on the other  but scarcely had she done so when the walls of the kitchen opened and there came out a young and beautiful damsel  she was dressed in an egyptian dress of flowered satin and she wore earrings and a necklace of white pearls and bracelets of gold set with rubies and she held a wand of myrtle in her hand  she went up to the pan to the great astonishment of the cook who stood motionless at the sight of her  she struck one of the fish with her rod fish fish said she are you doing your duty the fish answered nothing and then she repeated her question whereupon they all raised their heads together and answered very distinctly yes yes  if you reckon we reckon  if you pay your debts we pay ours if you fly we conquer and we are content  when they had spoken the girl upset the pan and entered the opening in the wall which at once closed and appeared the same as before  when the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted up the fish which had fallen into the ashes but she found them as black as cinders and not fit to serve up to the sultan  she began to cry  alas what shall i say to the sultan  he will be so angry with me and i know he will not believe me  whilst she was crying the grandvizir came in and asked if the fish were ready  she told him all that had happened and he was much surprised  he sent at once for the fisherman and when he came said to him fisherman bring me four more fish like you have brought already for an accident has happened to them so that they cannot be served up to the sultan  the fisherman did not say what the genius had told him but he excused himself from bringing them that day on account of the length of the way and he promised to bring them next day  in the night he went to the lake cast his nets and on drawing them in found four fish which were like the others each of a different colour  he went back at once and carried them to the grandvizir as he had promised  he then took them to the kitchen and shut himself up with the cook who began to cook them as she had done the four others on the previous day when she was about to turn them on the other side the wall opened the damsel appeared addressed the same words to the fish received the same answer and then overturned the pan and disappeared  the grandvizir was filled with astonishment  i shall tell the sultan all that has happened said he  and he did so  the sultan was very much astounded and wished to see this marvel for himself  so he sent for the fisherman and asked him to procure four more fish  the fisherman asked for three days which were granted and he then cast his nets in the lake and again caught four different coloured fish  the sultan was delighted to see he had got them and gave him again four hundred gold pieces  as soon as the sultan had the fish he had them carried to his room with all that was needed to cook them  then he shut himself up with the grandvizir who began to prepare them and cook them  when they were done on one side he turned them over on the other  then the wall of the room opened but instead of the maiden a black slave came out  he was enormously tall and carried a large green stick with which he touched the fish saying in a terrible voice fish fish are you doing your duty to these words the fish lifting up their heads replied yes yes  if you reckon we reckon  if you pay your debts we pay ours  if you fly we conquer and are content  the black slave overturned the pan in the middle of the room and the fish were turned to cinders  then he stepped proudly back into the wall which closed round him  after having seen this said the sultan i cannot rest  these fish signify some mystery i must clear up  he sent for the fisherman  fisherman he said the fish you have brought us have caused me some anxiety  where did you get them from  sire he answered i got them from a lake which lies in the middle of four hills beyond yonder mountains  do you know this lake asked the sultan of the grandvizir  no though i have hunted many times round that mountain i have never heard of it said the vizir  as the fisherman said it was only three hours journey away the sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither and the fisherman led them  they climbed the mountain and then on the other side saw the lake as the fisherman had described  the water was so clear that they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it  they looked at them for some time and then the sultan ordered them to make a camp by the edge of the water  when night came the sultan called his vizir and said to him i have resolved to clear up this mystery  i am going out alone and do you stay here in my tent and when my ministers come tomorrow say i am not well and cannot see them  do this each day till i return  the grandvizir tried to persuade the sultan not to go but in vain the sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword and when he saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone  he climbed one of the hills and then crossed the great plain till just as the sun rose he beheld far in front of him a large building when he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of beautiful black polished marble covered with steel as smooth as a mirror  he went to the gate which stood half open and went in as nobody came when he knocked  he passed through a magnificent courtyard and still saw no one though he called aloud several times  he entered large halls where the carpets were of silk the lounges and sofas covered with tapestry from mecca and the hangings of the most beautiful indian stuffs of gold and silver  then he found himself in a splendid room with a fountain supported by golden lions  the water out of the lions mouths turned into diamonds and pearls and the leaping water almost touched a most beautifullypainted dome  the palace was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens little lakes and woods  birds sang in the trees which were netted over to keep them always there  still the sultan saw no one till he heard a plaintive cry and a voice which said oh that i could die for i am too unhappy to wish to live any longer  the sultan looked round to discover who it was who thus bemoaned his fate and at last saw a handsome young man richly clothed who was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground  his face was very sad  the sultan approached him and bowed to him  the young man bent his head very low but did not rise  sire he said to the sultan i cannot rise and do you the reverence that i am sure should be paid to your rank  sir answered the sultan i am sure you have a good reason for not doing so and having heard your cry of distress i am come to offer you my help  whose is this palace and why is it thus empty  instead of answering the young man lifted up his robe and showed the sultan that from the waist downwards he was a block of black marble  the sultan was horrified and begged the young man to tell him his story  willingly i will tell you my sad history said the young man    the story of the young king of the black isles   you must know sire that my father was mahmoud the king of this country the black isles so called from the four little mountains which were once islands while the capital was the place where now the great lake lies  my story will tell you how these changes came about  my father died when he was sixtysix and i succeeded him  i married my cousin whom i loved tenderly and i thought she loved me too  but one afternoon when i was half asleep and was being fanned by two of her maids i heard one say to the other what a pity it is that our mistress no longer loves our master  i believe she would like to kill him if she could for she is an enchantress  i soon found by watching that they were right and when i mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime she begged that she might build a palace in the garden where she wept and bewailed him for two years  at last i begged her to cease grieving for him for although he could not speak or move by her enchantments she just kept him alive  she turned upon me in a rage and said over me some magic words and i instantly became as you see me now half man and half marble  then this wicked enchantress changed the capital which was a very populous and flourishing city into the lake and desert plain you saw the fish of four colours which are in it are the different races who lived in the town the four hills are the four islands which give the name to my kingdom  all this the enchantress told me to add to my troubles  and this is not all  every day she comes and beats me with a whip of buffalo hide  when the young king had finished his sad story he burst once more into tears and the sultan was much moved  tell me he cried where is this wicked woman and where is the miserable object of her affection whom she just manages to keep alive  where she lives i do not know answered the unhappy prince but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak to her after she has beaten me  unfortunate king said the sultan i will do what i can to avenge you  so he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring this about and they agreed their plan should be put in effect the next day the sultan then rested and the young king gave himself up to happy hopes of release  the next day the sultan arose and then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was  he drew his sword and destroyed the little life that remained in him and then threw the body down a well  he then lay down on the couch where the slave had been and waited for the enchantress  she went first to the young king whom she beat with a hundred blows  then she came to the room where she thought her wounded slave was but where the sultan really lay  she came near his couch and said are you better today my dear slave  speak but one word to me  how can i be better answered the sultan imitating the language of the ethiopians when i can never sleep for the cries and groans of your husband  what joy to hear you speak answered the queen  do you wish him to regain his proper shape  yes said the sultan hasten to set him at liberty so that i may no longer hear his cries  the queen at once went out and took a cup of water and said over it some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire  then she threw it over the prince who at once regained his own form  he was filled with joy but the enchantress said hasten away from this place and never come back lest i kill you  so he hid himself to see the end of the sultans plan  the enchantress went back to the palace of tears and said now i have done what you wished  what you have done said the sultan is not enough to cure me every day at midnight all the people whom you have changed into fish lift their heads out of the lake and cry for vengeance  go quickly and give them their proper shape  the enchantress hurried away and said some words over the lake  the fish then became men women and children and the houses and shops were once more filled  the sultans suite who had encamped by the lake were not a little astonished to see themselves in the middle of a large and beautiful town  as soon as she had disenchanted it the queen went back to the palace  are you quite well now she said  come near said the sultan  nearer still  she obeyed  then he sprang up and with one blow of his sword he cut her in two  then he went and found the prince  rejoice he said your cruel enemy is dead  the prince thanked him again and again  and now said the sultan  i will go back to my capital which i am glad to find is so near yours  so near mine said the king of the black isles  do you know it is a whole years journey from here  you came here in a few hours because it was enchanted  but i will accompany you on your journey  it will give me much pleasure if you will escort me said the sultan and as i have no children i will make you my heir  the sultan and the prince set out together the sultan laden with rich presents from the king of the black isles  the day after he reached his capital the sultan assembled his court and told them all that had befallen him and told them how he intended to adopt the young king as his heir  then he gave each man presents in proportion to his rank  as for the fisherman as he was the first cause of the deliverance of the young prince the sultan gave him much money and made him and his family happy for the rest of their days    the story of the three calenders sons of kings   and of five ladies of bagdad   in the reign of the caliph harounalraschid there lived at bagdad a porter who in spite of his humble calling was an intelligent and sensible man  one morning he was sitting in his usual place with his basket before him waiting to be hired when a tall young lady covered with a long muslin veil came up to him and said pick up your basket and follow me  the porter who was greatly pleased by her appearance and voice jumped up at once poised his basket on his head and accompanied the lady saying to himself as he went oh happy day oh lucky meeting  the lady soon stopped before a closed door at which she knocked  it was opened by an old man with a long white beard to whom the lady held out money without speaking  the old man who seemed to understand what she wanted vanished into the house and returned bringing a large jar of wine which the porter placed in his basket  then the lady signed to him to follow and they went their way  the next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop and here she bought a large quantity of apples apricots peaches and other things with lilies jasmine and all sorts of sweetsmelling plants  from this shop she went to a butchers a grocers and a poulterers till at last the porter exclaimed in despair my good lady if you had only told me you were going to buy enough provisions to stock a town i would have brought a horse or rather a camel the lady laughed and told him she had not finished yet but after choosing various kinds of scents and spices from a druggists store she halted before a magnificent palace at the door of which she knocked gently  the porteress who opened it was of such beauty that the eyes of the man were quite dazzled and he was the more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no slave  the lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement till the porteress exclaimed why dont you come in my sister  this poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to drop  when they were both inside the door was fastened and they all three entered a large court surrounded by an openwork gallery  at one end of the court was a platform and on the platform stood an amber throne supported by four ebony columns garnished with pearls and diamonds in the middle of the court stood a marble basin filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion  the porter looked about him noticing and admiring everything but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne who was even more beautiful than the other two  by the respect shown to her by the others he judged that she must be the eldest and in this he was right  this ladys name was zobeida the porteress was sadie and the housekeeper was amina  at a word from zobeida sadie and amina took the basket from the porter who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight and when it was emptied paid him handsomely for its use  but instead of taking up his basket and going away the man still lingered till zobeida inquired what he was waiting for and if he expected more money  oh madam returned he you have already given me too much and i fear i may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my departure at once  but if you will pardon my saying so i was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves a company of women without men is however as dull as a company of men without women  and after telling some stories to prove his point he ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a fourth at their dinner  the ladies were rather amused at the mans assurances and after some discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay as his society might prove entertaining  but listen friend said zobeida if we grant your request it is only on condition that you behave with the utmost politeness and that you keep the secret of our way of living which chance has revealed to you then they all sat down to table which had been covered by amina with the dishes she had bought  after the first few mouthfuls amina poured some wine into a golden cup she first drank herself according to the arab custom and then filled it for her sisters  when it came to the porters turn he kissed aminas hand and sang a song which he composed at the moment in praise of the wine  the three ladies were pleased with the song and then sang themselves so that the repast was a merry one and lasted much longer than usual  at length seeing that the sun was about to set sadia said to the porter rise and go it is now time for us to separate  oh madam replied he how can you desire me to quit you in the state in which i am  between the wine i have drunk and the pleasure of seeing you i should never find the way to my house  let me remain here till morning and when i have recovered my senses i will go when you like  let him stay said amina who had before proved herself his friend it is only just as he has given us so much amusement  if you wish it my sister replied zobeida but if he does i must make a new condition  porter she continued turning to him if you remain you must promise to ask no questions about anything you may see  if you do you may perhaps hear what you dont like  this being settled amina brought in supper and lit up the hall with a number of sweet smelling tapers  they then sat down again at the table and began with fresh appetites to eat drink sing and recite verses  in fact they were all enjoying themselves mightily when they heard a knock at the outer door which sadie rose to open  she soon returned saying that three calenders all blind in the right eye and all with their heads faces and eyebrows clean shaved begged for admittance as they were newly arrived in bagdad and night had already fallen  they seem to have pleasant manners she added but you have no idea how funny they look  i am sure we should find their company diverting  zobeida and amina made some difficulty about admitting the new comers and sadie knew the reason of their hesitation  but she urged the matter so strongly that zobeida was at last forced to consent  bring them in then said she but make them understand that they are not to make remarks about what does not concern them and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door for on the door was written in letters of gold whoso meddles in affairs that are no business of his will hear truths that will not please him  the three calenders bowed low on entering and thanked the ladies for their kindness and hospitality  the ladies replied with words of welcome and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyes of the calenders fell on the porter whose dress was not so very unlike their own though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him this said one of them is apparently one of our arab brothers who has rebelled against our ruler  the porter although half asleep from the wine he had drunk heard the words and without moving cried angrily to the calender sit down and mind your own business  did you not read the inscription over the door  everybody is not obliged to live in the same way  do not be so angry my good man replied the calender we should be very sorry to displease you so the quarrel was smoothed over and supper began in good earnest  when the calenders had satisfied their hunger they offered to play to their hostesses if there were any instruments in the house  the ladies were delighted at the idea and sadie went to see what she could find returning in a few moments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine  each calender took the one he preferred and began to play a wellknown air while the ladies sang the words of the song  these words were the gayest and liveliest possible and every now and then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which almost choked them  in the midst of all their noise a knock was heard at the door  now early that evening the caliph secretly left the palace accompanied by his grandvizir giafar and mesrour chief of the eunuchs all three wearing the dresses of merchants  passing down the street the caliph had been attracted by the music of instruments and the sound of laughter and had ordered his vizir to go and knock at the door of the house as he wished to enter  the vizir replied that the ladies who lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends and he thought his master would do well not to intrude on them but the caliph had taken it into his head to see for himself and insisted on being obeyed  the knock was answered by sadie with a taper in her hand and the vizir who was surprised at her beauty bowed low before her and said respectfully madam we are three merchants who have lately arrived from moussoul and owing to a misadventure which befel us this very night only reached our inn to find that the doors were closed to us till tomorrow morning  not knowing what to do we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass your house when seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn  if you will grant us this favour we will with your permission do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly  sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters and after having talked over the matter with them she returned to tell him that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company they entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests  then zobeida as the mistress came forward and said gravely you are welcome here but i hope you will allow me to beg one thing of youhave as many eyes as you like but no tongues and ask no questions about anything you see however strange it may appear to you  madam returned the vizir you shall be obeyed  we have quite enough to please and interest us without troubling ourselves about that with which we have no concern  then they all sat down and drank to the health of the new comers  while the vizir giafar was talking to the ladies the caliph was occupied in wondering who they could be and why the three calenders had each lost his right eye  he was burning to inquire the reason of it all but was silenced by zobeidas request so he tried to rouse himself and to take his part in the conversation which was very lively the subject of discussion being the many different sorts of pleasures that there were in the world  after some time the calenders got up and performed some curious dances which delighted the rest of the company  when they had finished zobeida rose from her seat and taking amina by the hand she said to her my sister our friends will excuse us if we seem to forget their presence and fulfil our nightly task amina understood her sisters meaning and collecting the dishes glasses and musical instruments she carried them away while sadie swept the hall and put everything in order  having done this she begged the calenders to sit on a sofa on one side of the room and the caliph and his friends to place themselves opposite  as to the porter she requested him to come and help her and her sister  shortly after amina entered carrying a seat which she put down in the middle of the empty space  she next went over to the door of a closet and signed to the porter to follow her  he did so and soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain which he brought into the centre of the hall  zobeida then got up from her seat between the calenders and the caliph and walked slowly across to where the porter stood with the dogs  we must do our duty she said with a deep sigh pushing back her sleeves and taking a whip from sadie she said to the man take one of those dogs to my sister amina and give me the other  the porter did as he was bid but as he led the dog to zobeida it uttered piercing howls and gazed up at her with looks of entreaty but zobeida took no notice and whipped the dog till she was out of breath  she then took the chain from the porter and raising the dog on its hind legs they looked into each others eyes sorrowfully till tears began to fall from both  then zobeida took her handkerchief and wiped the dogs eyes tenderly after which she kissed it then putting the chain into the porters hand she said take it back to the closet and bring me the other  the same ceremony was gone through with the second dog and all the while the whole company looked on with astonishment  the caliph in particular could hardly contain himself and made signs to the vizir to ask what it all meant  but the vizir pretended not to see and turned his head away  zobeida remained for some time in the middle of the room till at last sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down as she also had her part to play  at these words amina fetched a lute from a case of yellow satin and gave it to sadie who sang several songs to its accompaniment  when she was tired she said to amina my sister i can do no more come i pray you and take my place  amina struck a few chords and then broke into a song which she sang with so much ardour that she was quite overcome and sank gasping on a pile of cushions tearing open her dress as she did so to give herself some air  to the amazement of all present her neck instead of being as smooth and white as her face was a mass of scars  the calenders and the caliph looked at each other and whispered together unheard by zobeida and sadie who were tending their fainting sister  what does it all mean asked the caliph  we know no more than you said the calender to whom he had spoken  what  you do not belong to the house  my lord answered all the calenders together we came here for the first time an hour before you  they then turned to the porter to see if he could explain the mystery but the porter was no wiser than they were themselves  at length the caliph could contain his curiosity no longer and declared that he would compel the ladies to tell them the meaning of their strange conduct  the vizir foreseeing what would happen implored him to remember the condition their hostesses had imposed and added in a whisper that if his highness would only wait till morning he could as caliph summon the ladies to appear before him  but the caliph who was not accustomed to be contradicted rejected this advice and it was resolved after a little more talking that the question should be put by the porter  suddenly zobeida turned round and seeing their excitement she said what is the matterwhat are you all discussing so earnestly  madam answered the porter these gentlemen entreat you to explain to them why you should first whip the dogs and then cry over them and also how it happens that the fainting lady is covered with scars  they have requested me madam to be their mouthpiece   is it true gentlemen asked zobeida drawing herself up that you have charged this man to put me that question  it is they all replied except giafar who was silent  is this continued zobeida growing more angry every moment is this the return you make for the hospitality i have shown you  have you forgotten the one condition on which you were allowed to enter the house  come quickly she added clapping her hands three times and the words were hardly uttered when seven black slaves each armed with a sabre burst in and stood over the seven men throwing them on the ground and preparing themselves on a sign from their mistress to cut off their heads  the seven culprits all thought their last hour had come and the caliph repented bitterly that he had not taken the vizirs advice  but they made up their minds to die bravely all except the porter who loudly inquired of zobeida why he was to suffer for other peoples faults and declared that these misfortunes would never have happened if it had not been for the calenders who always brought illluck he ended by imploring zobeida not to confound the innocent with the guilty and to spare his life  in spite of her anger there was something so comic in the groans of the porter that zobeida could not refrain from laughing  but putting him aside she addressed the others a second time saying answer me who are you  unless you tell me truly you have not another moment to live  i can hardly think you are men of any position whatever country you belong to  if you were you would have had more consideration for us  the caliph who was naturally very impatient suffered far more than either of the others at feeling that his life was at the mercy of a justly offended lady but when he heard her question he began to breathe more freely for he was convinced that she had only to learn his name and rank for all danger to be over  so he whispered hastily to the vizir who was next to him to reveal their secret  but the vizir wiser than his master wished to conceal from the public the affront they had received and merely answered after all we have only got what we deserved  meanwhile zobeida had turned to the three calenders and inquired if as they were all blind they were brothers  no madam replied one we are no blood relations at all only brothers by our mode of life  and you she asked addressing another were you born blind of one eye  no madam returned he i became blind through a most surprising adventure such as probably has never happened to anybody  after that i shaved my head and eyebrows and put on the dress in which you see me now  zobeida put the same question to the other two calenders and received the same answer  but added the third it may interest you madam to know that we are not men of low birth but are all three sons of kings and of kings too whom the world holds in high esteem  at these words zobeidas anger cooled down and she turned to her slaves and said you can give them a little more liberty but do not leave the hall  those that will tell us their histories and their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt those who refuse and she paused but in a moment the porter who understood that he had only to relate his story to set himself free from this terrible danger immediately broke in  madam you know already how i came here and what i have to say will soon be told  your sister found me this morning in the place where i always stand waiting to be hired  she bade me follow her to various shops and when my basket was quite full we returned to this house when you had the goodness to permit me to remain for which i shall be eternally grateful  that is my story  he looked anxiously to zobeida who nodded her head and said you can go and take care we never meet again  oh madam cried the porter let me stay yet a little while  it is not just that the others should have heard my story and that i should not hear theirs and without waiting for permission he seated himself on the end of the sofa occupied by the ladies whilst the rest crouched on the carpet and the slaves stood against the wall  then one of the calenders addressing himself to zobeida as the principal lady began his story    the story of the first calender son of a king   in order madam to explain how i came to lose my right eye and to wear the dress of a calender you must first know that i am the son of a king  my fathers only brother reigned over the neighbouring country and had two children a daughter and a son who were of the same age as myself  as i grew up and was allowed more liberty i went every year to pay a visit to my uncles court and usually stayed there about two months in this way my cousin and i became very intimate and were much attached to each other  the very last time i saw him he seemed more delighted to see me than ever and gave a great feast in my honour when we had finished eating he said to me my cousin you would never guess what i have been doing since your last visit to us  directly after your departure i set a number of men to work on a building after my own design  it is now completed and ready to be lived in  i should like to show it to you but you must first swear two things to be faithful to me and to keep my secret  of course i did not dream of refusing him anything he asked and gave the promise without the least hesitation  he then bade me wait an instant and vanished returning in a few moments with a richly dressed lady of great beauty but as he did not tell me her name i thought it was better not to inquire  we all three sat down to table and amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things and with drinking each others health  suddenly the prince said to me cousin we have no time to lose be so kind as to conduct this lady to a certain spot where you will find a domelike tomb newly built  you cannot mistake it  go in both of you and wait till i come  i shall not be long  as i had promised i prepared to do as i was told and giving my hand to the lady i escorted her by the light of the moon to the place of which the prince had spoken  we had barely reached it when he joined us himself carrying a small vessel of water a pickaxe and a little bag containing plaster  with the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre in the middle of the tomb  one by one he took the stones and piled them up in a corner  when he had knocked down the whole sepulchre he proceeded to dig at the earth and beneath where the sepulchre had been i saw a trapdoor he raised the door and i caught sight of the top of a spiral staircase then he said turning to the lady madam this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which i told you of  the lady did not answer but silently descended the staircase the prince following her  at the top however he looked at me  my cousin he exclaimed i do not know how to thank you for your kindness  farewell  what do you mean  i cried  i dont understand  no matter he replied go back by the path that you came  he would say no more and greatly puzzled i returned to my room in the palace and went to bed  when i woke and considered my adventure i thought that i must have been dreaming and sent a servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me  but on hearing that he had not slept at home i was much alarmed and hastened to the cemetery where unluckily the tombs were all so alike that i could not discover which was the one i was in search of though i spent four days in looking for it  you must know that all this time the king my uncle was absent on a hunting expedition and as no one knew when he would be back i at last decided to return home leaving the ministers to make my excuses  i longed to tell them what had become of the prince about whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety but the oath i had sworn kept me silent  on my arrival at my fathers capital i was astonished to find a large detachment of guards drawn up before the gate of the palace they surrounded me directly i entered  i asked the officers in command the reason of this strange behaviour and was horrified to learn that the army had mutinied and put to death the king my father and had placed the grandvizir on the throne  further that by his orders i was placed under arrest  now this rebel vizir had hated me from my boyhood because once when shooting at a bird with a bow i had shot out his eye by accident  of course i not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regrets and apologies but i made them in person  it was all of no use  he cherished an undying hatred towards me and lost no occasion of showing it  having once got me in his power i felt he could show no mercy and i was right  mad with triumph and fury he came to me in my prison and tore out my right eye  that is how i lost it  my persecutor however did not stop here  he shut me up in a large case and ordered his executioner to carry me into a desert place to cut off my head and then to abandon my body to the birds of prey  the case with me inside it was accordingly placed on a horse and the executioner accompanied by another man rode into the country until they found a spot suitable for the purpose  but their hearts were not so hard as they seemed and my tears and prayers made them waver  forsake the kingdom instantly said the executioner at last and take care never to come back for you will not only lose your head but make us lose ours  i thanked him gratefully and tried to console myself for the loss of my eye by thinking of the other misfortunes i had escaped   after all i had gone through and my fear of being recognised by some enemy i could only travel very slowly and cautiously generally resting in some outoftheway place by day and walking as far as i was able by night but at length i arrived in the kingdom of my uncle of whose protection i was sure  i found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son who had he said vanished without leaving a trace but his own grief did not prevent him sharing mine  we mingled our tears for the loss of one was the loss of the other and then i made up my mind that it was my duty to break the solemn oath i had sworn to the prince  i therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything i knew and i observed that even before i had ended his sorrow appeared to be lightened a little  my dear nephew he said your story gives me some hope  i was aware that my son was building a tomb and i think i can find the spot  but as he wished to keep the matter secret let us go alone and seek the place ourselves  he then bade me disguise myself and we both slipped out of a garden door which opened on to the cemetery  it did not take long for us to arrive at the scene of the princes disappearance or to discover the tomb i had sought so vainly before  we entered it and found the trapdoor which led to the staircase but we had great difficulty in raising it because the prince had fastened it down underneath with the plaster he had brought with him  my uncle went first and i followed him  when we reached the bottom of the stairs we stepped into a sort of anteroom filled with such a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see anything  however we passed through the smoke into a large chamber which at first seemed quite empty  the room was brilliantly lighted and in another moment we perceived a sort of platform at one end on which were the bodies of the prince and a lady both halfburned as if they had been dragged out of a fire before it had quite consumed them  this horrible sight turned me faint but to my surprise my uncle did not show so much surprise as anger  i knew he said that my son was tenderly attached to this lady whom it was impossible he should ever marry  i tried to turn his thoughts and presented to him the most beautiful princesses but he cared for none of them and as you see they have now been united by a horrible death in an underground tomb  but as he spoke his anger melted into tears and again i wept with him  when he recovered himself he drew me to him  my dear nephew he said embracing me you have come to me to take his place and i will do my best to forget that i ever had a son who could act in so wicked a manner  then he turned and went up the stairs  we reached the palace without anyone having noticed our absence when shortly after a clashing of drums and cymbals and the blare of trumpets burst upon our astonished ears  at the same time a thick cloud of dust on the horizon told of the approach of a great army  my heart sank when i perceived that the commander was the vizir who had dethroned my father and was come to seize the kingdom of my uncle  the capital was utterly unprepared to stand a siege and seeing that resistance was useless at once opened its gates  my uncle fought hard for his life but was soon overpowered and when he fell i managed to escape through a secret passage and took refuge with an officer whom i knew i could trust  persecuted by illfortune and stricken with grief there seemed to be only one means of safety left to me  i shaved my beard and my eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender in which it was easy for me to travel without being known  i avoided the towns till i reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful caliph harounalraschid when i had no further reason to fear my enemies  it was my intention to come to bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his highness who would i felt certain be touched by my sad story and would grant me besides his help and protection  after a journey which lasted some months i arrived at length at the gates of this city  it was sunset and i paused for a little to look about me and to decide which way to turn my steps  i was still debating on this subject when i was joined by this other calender who stopped to greet me  you like me appear to be a stranger i said he replied that i was right and before he could say more the third calender came up  he also was newly arrived in bagdad and being brothers in misfortune we resolved to cast in our lots together and to share whatever fate might have in store  by this time it had grown late and we did not know where to spend the night  but our lucky star having guided us to this door we took the liberty of knocking and of asking for shelter which was given to us at once with the best grace in the world  this madam is my story  i am satisfied replied zobeida you can go when you like  the calender however begged leave to stay and to hear the histories of his two friends and of the three other persons of the company which he was allowed to do    the story of the second calendar son of a king   madam said the young man addressing zobeida if you wish to know how i lost my right eye i shall have to tell you the story of my whole life  i was scarcely more than a baby when the king my father finding me unusually quick and clever for my age turned his thoughts to my education  i was taught first to read and write and then to learn the koran which is the basis of our holy religion and the better to understand it i read with my tutors the ablest commentators on its teaching and committed to memory all the traditions respecting the prophet which have been gathered from the mouth of those who were his friends  i also learnt history and was instructed in poetry versification geography chronology and in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel  but what i liked best of all was writing arabic characters and in this i soon surpassed my masters and gained a reputation in this branch of knowledge that reached as far as india itself  now the sultan of the indies curious to see a young prince with such strange tastes sent an ambassador to my father laden with rich presents and a warm invitation to visit his court  my father who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so powerful a monarch and held besides that a little travel would greatly improve my manners and open my mind accepted gladly and in a short time i had set out for india with the ambassador attended only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey and the badness of the roads  however as was my duty i took with me ten camels laden with rich presents for the sultan  we had been travelling for about a month when one day we saw a cloud of dust moving swiftly towards us and as soon as it came near we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers  our men barely numbered half and as we were also hampered by the camels there was no use in fighting so we tried to overawe them by informing them who we were and whither we were going  the robbers however only laughed and declared that was none of their business and without more words attacked us brutally  i defended myself to the last wounded though i was but at length seeing that resistance was hopeless and that the ambassador and all our followers were made prisoners i put spurs to my horse and rode away as fast as i could till the poor beast fell dead from a wound in his side  i managed to jump off without any injury and looked about to see if i was pursued  but for the moment i was safe for as i imagined the robbers were all engaged in quarrelling over their booty  i found myself in a country that was quite new to me and dared not return to the main road lest i should again fall into the hands of the robbers  luckily my wound was only a slight one and after binding it up as well as i could i walked on for the rest of the day till i reached a cave at the foot of a mountain where i passed the night in peace making my supper off some fruits i had gathered on the way  i wandered about for a whole month without knowing where i was going till at length i found myself on the outskirts of a beautiful city watered by winding streams which enjoyed an eternal spring  my delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human beings was somewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object i must seem  my face and hands had been burned nearly black my clothes were all in rags and my shoes were in such a state that i had been forced to abandon them altogether  i entered the town and stopped at a tailors shop to inquire where i was  the man saw i was better than my condition and begged me to sit down and in return i told him my whole story  the tailor listened with attention but his reply instead of giving me consolation only increased my trouble  beware he said of telling any one what you have told me for the prince who governs the kingdom is your fathers greatest enemy and he will be rejoiced to find you in his power  i thanked the tailor for his counsel and said i would do whatever he advised then being very hungry i gladly ate of the food he put before me and accepted his offer of a lodging in his house  in a few days i had quite recovered from the hardships i had undergone and then the tailor knowing that it was the custom for the princes of our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to provide for themselves in times of illfortune inquired if there was anything i could do for my living  i replied that i had been educated as a grammarian and a poet but that my great gift was writing  all that is of no use here said the tailor  take my advice put on a short coat and as you seem hardy and strong go into the woods and cut firewood which you will sell in the streets  by this means you will earn your living and be able to wait till better times come  the hatchet and the cord shall be my present  this counsel was very distasteful to me but i thought i could not do otherwise than adopt it  so the next morning i set out with a company of poor woodcutters to whom the tailor had introduced me  even on the first day i cut enough wood to sell for a tolerable sum and very soon i became more expert and had made enough money to repay the tailor all he had lent me  i had been a woodcutter for more than a year when one day i wandered further into the forest than i had ever done before and reached a delicious green glade where i began to cut wood  i was hacking at the root of a tree when i beheld an iron ring fastened to a trapdoor of the same metal  i soon cleared away the earth and pulling up the door found a staircase which i hastily made up my mind to go down carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection  when i reached the bottom i discovered that i was in a huge palace as brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that i had ever seen with a long gallery supported by pillars of jasper ornamented with capitals of gold  down this gallery a lady came to meet me of such beauty that i forgot everything else and thought only of her  to save her all the trouble possible i hastened towards her and bowed low  who are you  who are you she said  a man or a genius  a man madam i replied i have nothing to do with genii  by what accident do you come here she asked again with a sigh  i have been in this place now for five and twenty years and you are the first man who has visited me  emboldened by her beauty and gentleness i ventured to reply before madam i answer your question allow me to say how grateful i am for this meeting which is not only a consolation to me in my own heavy sorrow but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier and then i told her who i was and how i had come there  alas prince she said with a deeper sigh than before you have guessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this gorgeous place  i am the daughter of the king of the ebony isle of whose fame you surely must have heard  at my fathers desire i was married to a prince who was my own cousin but on my very wedding day i was snatched up by a genius and brought here in a faint  for a long while i did nothing but weep and would not suffer the genius to come near me but time teaches us submission and i have now got accustomed to his presence and if clothes and jewels could content me i have them in plenty  every tenth day for five and twenty years i have received a visit from him but in case i should need his help at any other time i have only to touch a talisman that stands at the entrance of my chamber  it wants still five days to his next visit and i hope that during that time you will do me the honour to be my guest  i was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer and accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath and a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for me  then a feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a room hung with embroidered indian fabrics  next day when we were at dinner i could maintain my patience no longer and implored the princess to break her bonds and return with me to the world which was lighted by the sun  what you ask is impossible she answered but stay here with me instead and we can be happy and all you will have to do is to betake yourself to the forest every tenth day when i am expecting my master the genius  he is very jealous as you know and will not suffer a man to come near me  princess i replied i see it is only fear of the genius that makes you act like this  for myself i dread him so little that i mean to break his talisman in pieces  awful though you think him he shall feel the weight of my arm and i herewith take a solemn vow to stamp out the whole race  the princess who realized the consequences of such audacity entreated me not to touch the talisman  if you do it will be the ruin of both of us said she i know genii much better than you but the wine i had drunk had confused my brain i gave one kick to the talisman and it fell into a thousand pieces  hardly had my foot touched the talisman when the air became as dark as night a fearful noise was heard and the palace shook to its very foundations  in an instant i was sobered and understood what i had done  princess  i cried what is happening  alas she exclaimed forgetting all her own terrors in anxiety for me fly or you are lost  i followed her advice and dashed up the staircase leaving my hatchet behind me  but i was too late  the palace opened and the genius appeared who turning angrily to the princess asked indignantly  what is the matter that you have sent for me like this  a pain in my heart she replied hastily obliged me to seek the aid of this little bottle  feeling faint i slipped and fell against the talisman which broke  that is really all  you are an impudent liar cried the genius  how did this hatchet and those shoes get here  i never saw them before she answered and you came in such a hurry that you may have picked them up on the road without knowing it  to this the genius only replied by insults and blows  i could hear the shrieks and groans of the princess and having by this time taken off my rich garments and put on those in which i had arrived the previous day i lifted the trap found myself once more in the forest and returned to my friend the tailor with a light load of wood and a heart full of shame and sorrow  the tailor who had been uneasy at my long absence was delighted to see me but i kept silence about my adventure and as soon as possible retired to my room to lament in secret over my folly  while i was thus indulging my grief my host entered and said there is an old man downstairs who has brought your hatchet and slippers which he picked up on the road and now restores to you as he found out from one of your comrades where you lived  you had better come down and speak to him yourself  at this speech i changed colour and my legs trembled under me  the tailor noticed my confusion and was just going to inquire the reason when the door of the room opened and the old man appeared carrying with him my hatchet and shoes  i am a genius he said the son of the daughter of eblis prince of the genii  is not this hatchet yours and these shoes without waiting for an answerwhich indeed i could hardly have given him so great was my frighthe seized hold of me and darted up into the air with the quickness of lightning and then with equal swiftness dropped down towards the earth  when he touched the ground he rapped it with his foot it opened and we found ourselves in the enchanted palace in the presence of the beautiful princess of the ebony isle but how different she looked from what she was when i had last seen her for she was lying stretched on the ground covered with blood and weeping bitterly  traitress cried the genius is not this man your lover  she lifted up her eyes slowly and looked sadly at me  i never saw him before she answered slowly  i do not know who he is  what exclaimed the genius you owe all your sufferings to him and yet you dare to say he is a stranger to you  but if he really is a stranger to me she replied why should i tell a lie and cause his death  very well said the genius drawing his sword take this and cut off his head  alas answered the princess i am too weak even to hold the sabre and supposing that i had the strength why should i put an innocent man to death  you condemn yourself by your refusal said the genius then turning to me he added and you do you not know her  how should i  i replied resolved to imitate the princess in her fidelity  how should i when i never saw her before  cut her head off then if she is a stranger to you and i shall believe you are speaking the truth and will set you at liberty  certainly i answered taking the sabre in my hands and making a sign to the princess to fear nothing as it was my own life that i was about to sacrifice and not hers  but the look of gratitude she gave me shook my courage and i flung the sabre to the earth  i should not deserve to live i said to the genius if i were such a coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me but who is at this moment half dead herself  do with me as you willi am in your powerbut i refuse to obey your cruel command  i see said the genius that you have both made up your minds to brave me but i will give you a sample of what you may expect so saying with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess who was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal farewell then i lost consciousness for several minutes  when i came to myself i implored the genius to keep me no longer in this state of suspense but to lose no time in putting an end to my sufferings  the genius however paid no attention to my prayers but said sternly that is the way in which a genius treats the woman who has betrayed him  if i chose i could kill you also but i will be merciful and content myself with changing you into a dog an ass a lion or a birdwhichever you prefer  i caught eagerly at these words as giving me a faint hope of softening his wrath  o genius  i cried as you wish to spare my life be generous and spare it altogether  grant my prayer and pardon my crime as the best man in the whole world forgave his neighbour who was eaten up with envy of him contrary to my hopes the genius seemed interested in my words and said he would like to hear the story of the two neighbours and as i think madam it may please you i will tell it to you also    the story of the envious man and of him who was envied   in a town of moderate size two men lived in neighbouring houses but they had not been there very long before one man took such a hatred of the other and envied him so bitterly that the poor man determined to find another home hoping that when they no longer met every day his enemy would forget all about him  so he sold his house and the little furniture it contained and moved into the capital of the country which was luckily at no great distance  about half a mile from this city he bought a nice little place with a large garden and a fairsized court in the centre of which stood an old well  in order to live a quieter life the good man put on the robe of a dervish and divided his house into a quantity of small cells where he soon established a number of other dervishes  the fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad and many people including several of the highest quality came to visit him and ask his prayers  of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears of the man who envied him and this wicked wretch resolved never to rest till he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he hated  so he left his house and his business to look after themselves and betook himself to the new dervish monastery where he was welcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable  the excuse he gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult the chief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance  what i have to say must not be overheard he whispered command i beg of you that your dervishes retire into their cells as night is approaching and meet me in the court  the dervish did as he was asked without delay and directly they were alone together the envious man began to tell a long story edging as they walked to and fro always nearer to the well and when they were quite close he seized the dervish and dropped him in  he then ran off triumphantly without having been seen by anyone and congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead and would trouble him no more  but in this he was mistaken  the old well had long been inhabited unknown to mere human beings by a set of fairies and genii who caught the dervish as he fell so that he received no hurt  the dervish himself could see nothing but he took for granted that something strange had happened or he must certainly have been dashed against the side of the well and been killed  he lay quite still and in a moment he heard a voice saying can you guess whom this man is that we have saved from death  no replied several other voices  and the first speaker answered i will tell you  this man from pure goodness of heart forsook the town where he lived and came to dwell here in the hope of curing one of his neighbours of the envy he felt towards him  but his character soon won him the esteem of all and the envious mans hatred grew till he came here with the deliberate intention of causing his death  and this he would have done without our help the very day before the sultan has arranged to visit this holy dervish and to entreat his prayers for the princess his daughter  but what is the matter with the princess that she needs the dervishs prayers asked another voice  she has fallen into the power of the genius maimoum the son of dimdim replied the first voice  but it would be quite simple for this holy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew  in his convent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of these white hairs burn three and with their smoke perfume the head of the princess  this will deliver her so completely that maimoum the son of dimdim will never dare to approach her again  the fairies and genii ceased talking but the dervish did not forget a word of all they had said and when morning came he perceived a place in the side of the well which was broken and where he could easily climb out  the dervishes who could not imagine what had become of him were enchanted at his reappearance  he told them of the attempt on his life made by his guest of the previous day and then retired into his cell he was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice had spoken who came as usual to say goodmorning to his master  he took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven white hairs out of his tail and put them on one side till they were needed  the sun had not long risen before the sultan who was anxious to leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess arrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery and was received by the dervishes with profound respect  the sultan lost no time in declaring the object of his visit and leading the chief of the dervishes aside he said to him noble scheik you have guessed perhaps what i have come to ask you  yes sire answered the dervish if i am not mistaken it is the illness of the princess which has procured me this honour  you are right returned the sultan and you will give me fresh life if you can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the strange malady that has taken possession of her  let your highness command her to come here and i will see what i can do  the sultan full of hope sent orders at once that the princess was to set out as soon as possible accompanied by her usual staff of attendants  when she arrived she was so thickly veiled that the dervish could not see her face but he desired a brazier to be held over her head and laid the seven hairs on the burning coals  the instant they were consumed terrific cries were heard but no one could tell from whom they proceeded  only the dervish guessed that they were uttered by maimoum the son of dimdim who felt the princess escaping him  all this time she had seemed unconscious of what she was doing but now she raised her hand to her veil and uncovered her face  where am i she said in a bewildered manner and how did i get here  the sultan was so delighted to hear these words that he not only embraced his daughter but kissed the hand of the dervish  then turning to his attendants who stood round he said to them what reward shall i give to the man who has restored me my daughter  they all replied with one accord that he deserved the hand of the princess  that is my own opinion said he and from this moment i declare him to be my soninlaw  shortly after these events the grandvizir died and his post was given to the dervish  but he did not hold it for long for the sultan fell a victim to an attack of illness and as he had no sons the soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the throne to the great joy of all the people  one day when the dervish who had now become sultan was making a royal progress with his court he perceived the envious man standing in the crowd  he made a sign to one of his vizirs and whispered in his ear fetch me that man who is standing out there but take great care not to frighten him  the vizir obeyed and when the envious man was brought before the sultan the monarch said to him my friend i am delighted to see you again  then turning to an officer he added give him a thousand pieces of gold out of my treasury and twenty waggonloads of merchandise out of my private stores and let an escort of soldiers accompany him home  he then took leave of the envious man and went on his way  now when i had ended my story i proceeded to show the genius how to apply it to himself  o genius i said you see that this sultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious man for the attempt on his life he heaped rewards and riches upon him  but the genius had made up his mind and could not be softened  do not imagine that you are going to escape so easily he said  all i can do is to give you bare life you will have to learn what happens to people who interfere with me  as he spoke he seized me violently by the arm the roof of the palace opened to make way for us and we mounted up so high into the air that the earth looked like a little cloud  then as before he came down with the swiftness of lightning and we touched the ground on a mountain top  then he stooped and gathered a handful of earth and murmured some words over it after which he threw the earth in my face saying as he did so quit the form of a man and assume that of a monkey this done he vanished and i was in the likeness of an ape and in a country i had never seen before  however there was no use in stopping where i was so i came down the mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was bounded by the sea i travelled towards it and was pleased to see a vessel moored about half a mile from shore  there were no waves so i broke off the branch of a tree and dragging it down to the waters edge sat across it while using two sticks for oars i rowed myself towards the ship  the deck was full of people who watched my progress with interest but when i seized a rope and swung myself on board i found that i had only escaped death at the hands of the genius to perish by those of the sailors lest i should bring illluck to the vessel and the merchants throw him into the sea cried one  knock him on the head with a hammer exclaimed another  let me shoot him with an arrow said a third and certainly somebody would have had his way if i had not flung myself at the captains feet and grasped tight hold of his dress  he appeared touched by my action and patted my head and declared that he would take me under his protection and that no one should do me any harm  at the end of about fifty days we cast anchor before a large town and the ship was immediately surrounded by a multitude of small boats filled with people who had come either to meet their friends or from simple curiosity  among others one boat contained several officials who asked to see the merchants on board and informed them that they had been sent by the sultan in token of welcome and to beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of paper  in order to explain this strange request continued the officers it is necessary that you should know that the grandvizir lately dead was celebrated for his beautiful handwriting and the sultan is anxious to find a similar talent in his successor  hitherto the search has been a failure but his highness has not yet given up hope  one after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll and when they had all finished i came forward and snatched the paper from the man who held it  at first they all thought i was going to throw it into the sea but they were quieted when they saw i held it with great care and great was their surprise when i made signs that i too wished to write something  let him do it if he wants to said the captain  if he only makes a mess of the paper you may be sure i will punish him for it  but if as i hope he really can write for he is the cleverest monkey i ever saw i will adopt him as my son  the one i lost had not nearly so much sense  no more was said and i took the pen and wrote the six sorts of writing in use among the arabs and each sort contained an original verse or couplet in praise of the sultan  and not only did my handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants but it is hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had ever before been seen in that country when i had ended the officials took the roll and returned to the sultan  as soon as the monarch saw my writing he did not so much as look at the samples of the merchants but desired his officials to take the finest and most richly caparisoned horse in his stables together with the most magnificent dress they could procure and to put it on the person who had written those lines and bring him to court  the officials began to laugh when they heard the sultans command but as soon as they could speak they said deign your highness to excuse our mirth but those lines were not written by a man but by a monkey  a monkey exclaimed the sultan  yes sire answered the officials  they were written by a monkey in our presence  then bring me the monkey he replied as fast as you can  the sultans officials returned to the ship and showed the royal order to the captain  he is the master said the good man and desired that i should be sent for  then they put on me the gorgeous robe and rowed me to land where i was placed on the horse and led to the palace  here the sultan was awaiting me in great state surrounded by his court  all the way along the streets i had been the object of curiosity to a vast crowd which had filled every doorway and every window and it was amidst their shouts and cheers that i was ushered into the presence of the sultan  i approached the throne on which he was seated and made him three low bows then prostrated myself at his feet to the surprise of everyone who could not understand how it was possible that a monkey should be able to distinguish a sultan from other people and to pay him the respect due to his rank  however excepting the usual speech i omitted none of the common forms attending a royal audience  when it was over the sultan dismissed all the court keeping with him only the chief of the eunuchs and a little slave  he then passed into another room and ordered food to be brought making signs to me to sit at table with him and eat  i rose from my seat kissed the ground and took my place at the table eating as you may suppose with care and in moderation  before the dishes were removed i made signs that writing materials which stood in one corner of the room should be laid in front of me i then took a peach and wrote on it some verses in praise of the sultan who was speechless with astonishment but when i did the same thing on a glass from which i had drunk he murmured to himself why a man who could do as much would be cleverer than any other man and this is only a monkey  supper being over chessmen were brought and the sultan signed to me to know if i would play with him  i kissed the ground and laid my hand on my head to show that i was ready to show myself worthy of the honour he beat me the first game but i won the second and third and seeing that this did not quite please i dashed off a verse by way of consolation  the sultan was so enchanted with all the talents of which i had given proof that he wished me to exhibit some of them to other people  so turning to the chief of the eunuchs he said go and beg my daughter queen of beauty to come here  i will show her something she has never seen before  the chief of the eunuchs bowed and left the room ushering in a few moments later the princess queen of beauty  her face was uncovered but the moment she set foot in the room she threw her veil over her head  sire she said to her father what can you be thinking of to summon me like this into the presence of a man  i do not understand you replied the sultan  there is nobody here but the eunuch who is your own servant the little slave and myself yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach me for having sent for you as if i had committed a crime  sire answered the princess i am right and you are wrong  this monkey is really no monkey at all but a young prince who has been turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius son of the daughter of eblis  as will be imagined these words took the sultan by surprise and he looked at me to see how i should take the statement of the princess as i was unable to speak i placed my hand on my head to show that it was true  but how do you know this my daughter asked he  sire replied queen of beauty the old lady who took care of me in my childhood was an accomplished magician and she taught me seventy rules of her art by means of which i could in the twinkling of an eye transplant your capital into the middle of the ocean  her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all persons who are enchanted and tells me by whom the spell was wrought  my daughter said the sultan i really had no idea you were so clever  sire replied the princess there are many outoftheway things it is as well to know but one should never boast of them  well asked the sultan can you tell me what must be done to disenchant the young prince  certainly and i can do it  then restore him to his former shape cried the sultan  you could give me no greater pleasure for i wish to make him my grandvizir and to give him to you for your husband  as your highness pleases replied the princess  queen of beauty rose and went to her chamber from which she fetched a knife with some hebrew words engraven on the blade  she then desired the sultan the chief of the eunuchs the little slave and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace and placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round she herself standing in the centre of the court  here she traced a large circle and in it wrote several words in arab characters  when the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the middle of it and repeated some verses from the koran  slowly the air grew dark and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble away and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the genius son of the daughter of eblis suddenly appear under the form of a colossal lion  dog cried the princess when she first caught sight of him you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourself before me in this hideous shape  and you retorted the lion have not feared to break our treaty that engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each other  accursed genius exclaimed the princess it is you by whom that treaty was first broken  i will teach you how to give me so much trouble said the lion and opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her  but the princess expected something of the sort and was on her guard  she bounded on one side and seizing one of the hairs of his mane repeated two or three words over it  in an instant it became a sword and with a sharp blow she cut the lions body into two pieces  these pieces vanished no one knew where and only the lions head remained which was at once changed into a scorpion  quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpent and gave battle to the scorpion who finding he was getting the worst of it turned himself into an eagle and took flight but in a moment the serpent had become an eagle more powerful still who soared up in the air and after him and then we lost sight of them both  we all remained where we were quaking with anxiety when the ground opened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out its hair standing on end and miauing frightfully  at its heels was a wolf who had almost seized it when the cat changed itself into a worm and piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a tree hid itself in the fruit  the pomegranate swelled till it grew as large as a pumpkin and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery from which it fell into the court and was broken into bits  while this was taking place the wolf who had transformed himself into a cock began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate as fast as he could  when all were gone he flew towards us flapping his wings as if to ask if we saw any more when suddenly his eye fell on one which lay on the bank of the little canal that flowed through the court he hastened towards it but before he could touch it the seed rolled into the canal and became a fish  the cock flung himself in after the fish and took the shape of a pike and for two hours they chased each other up and down under the water uttering horrible cries but we could see nothing  at length they rose from the water in their proper forms but darting such flames of fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the palace should catch fire  soon however we had much greater cause for alarm as the genius having shaken off the princess flew towards us  our fate would have been sealed if the princess seeing our danger had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself  as it was the sultans beard was singed and his face scorched the chief of the eunuchs was burned to a cinder while a spark deprived me of the sight of one eye  both i and the sultan had given up all hope of a rescue when there was a shout of victory victory from the princess and the genius lay at her feet a great heap of ashes  exhausted though she was the princess at once ordered the little slave who alone was uninjured to bring her a cup of water which she took in her hand  first repeating some magic words over it she dashed it into my face saying if you are only a monkey by enchantment resume the form of the man you were before in an instant i stood before her the same man i had formerly been though having lost the sight of one eye  i was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she did not give me time  turning to the sultan her father she said sire i have gained the battle but it has cost me dear  the fire has penetrated to my heart and i have only a few moments to live  this would not have happened if i had only noticed the last pomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest  it was the last struggle of the genius and up to that time i was quite safe  but having let this chance slip i was forced to resort to fire and in spite of all his experience i showed the genius that i knew more than he did  he is dead and in ashes but my own death is approaching fast  my daughter cried the sultan how sad is my condition  i am only surprised i am alive at all  the eunuch is consumed by the flames and the prince whom you have delivered has lost the sight of one eye  he could say no more for sobs choked his voice and we all wept together  suddenly the princess shrieked i burn i burn and death came to free her from her torments  i have no words madam to tell you of my feelings at this terrible sight  i would rather have remained a monkey all my life than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner  as for the sultan he was quite inconsolable and his subjects who had dearly loved the princess shared his grief  for seven days the whole nation mourned and then the ashes of the princess were buried with great pomp and a superb tomb was raised over her  as soon as the sultan recovered from the severe illness which had seized him after the death of the princess he sent for me and plainly though politely informed me that my presence would always remind him of his loss and he begged that i would instantly quit his kingdom and on pain of death never return to it  i was of course bound to obey and not knowing what was to become of me i shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender  after wandering aimlessly through several countries i resolved to come to bagdad and request an audience of the commander of the faithful  and that madam is my story  the other calender then told his story    the story of the third calendar son of a king   my story said the third calender is quite different from those of my two friends  it was fate that deprived them of the sight of their right eyes but mine was lost by my own folly  my name is agib and i am the son of a king called cassib who reigned over a large kingdom which had for its capital one of the finest seaport towns in the world  when i succeeded to my fathers throne my first care was to visit the provinces on the mainland and then to sail to the numerous islands which lay off the shore in order to gain the hearts of my subjects these voyages gave me such a taste for sailing that i soon determined to explore more distant seas and commanded a fleet of large ships to be got ready without delay  when they were properly fitted out i embarked on my expedition  for forty days wind and weather were all in our favour but the next night a terrific storm arose which blew us hither and thither for ten days till the pilot confessed that he had quite lost his bearings accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to try to catch a sight of land and reported that nothing was to be seen but the sea and sky except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern  on hearing this the pilot grew white and beating his breast he cried oh sir we are lost lost till the ships crew trembled at they knew not what  when he had recovered himself a little and was able to explain the cause of his terror he replied in answer to my question that we had drifted far out of our course and that the following day about noon we should come near that mass of darkness which said he is nothing but the famous black mountain  this mountain is composed of adamant which attracts to itself all the iron and nails in your ship and as we are helplessly drawn nearer the force of attraction will become so great that the iron and nails will fall out of the ships and cling to the mountain and the ships will sink to the bottom with all that are in them  this it is that causes the side of the mountain towards the sea to appear of such a dense blackness  as may be supposedcontinued the pilotthe mountain sides are very rugged but on the summit stands a brass dome supported on pillars and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse with a rider on his back this rider wears a breastplate of lead on which strange signs and figures are engraved and it is said that as long as this statue remains on the dome vessels will never cease to perish at the foot of the mountain  so saying the pilot began to weep afresh and the crew fearing their last hour had come made their wills each one in favour of his fellow  at noon next day as the pilot had foretold we were so near to the black mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of the ships and dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible noise  a moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank the crews with them  i alone managed to grasp a floating plank and was driven ashore by the wind without even a scratch  what was my joy on finding myself at the bottom of some steps which led straight up the mountain for there was not another inch to the right or the left where a man could set his foot  and indeed even the steps themselves were so narrow and so steep that if the lightest breeze had arisen i should certainly have been blown into the sea  when i reached the top i found the brass dome and the statue exactly as the pilot had described but was too wearied with all i had gone through to do more than glance at them and flinging myself under the dome was asleep in an instant  in my dreams an old man appeared to me and said hearken agib  as soon as thou art awake dig up the ground underfoot and thou shalt find a bow of brass and three arrows of lead shoot the arrows at the statue and the rider shall tumble into the sea but the horse will fall down by thy side and thou shalt bury him in the place from which thou tookest the bow and arrows  this being done the sea will rise and cover the mountain and on it thou wilt perceive the figure of a metal man seated in a boat having an oar in each hand  step on board and let him conduct thee but if thou wouldest behold thy kingdom again see that thou takest not the name of allah into thy mouth  having uttered these words the vision left me and i woke much comforted  i sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out of the ground and with the third shot the horseman fell with a great crash into the sea which instantly began to rise so rapidly that i had hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me  i stepped silently in and sat down and the metal man pushed off and rowed without stopping for nine days after which land appeared on the horizon  i was so overcome with joy at this sight that i forgot all the old man had told me and cried out allah be praised  allah be praised  the words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man sank from beneath me and left me floating on the surface  all that day and the next night i swam and floated alternately making as well as i could for the land which was nearest to me  at last my strength began to fail and i gave myself up for lost when the wind suddenly rose and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore  then placing myself in safety i hastily spread my clothes out to dry in the sun and flung myself on the warm ground to rest  next morning i dressed myself and began to look about me  there seemed to be no one but myself on the island which was covered with fruit trees and watered with streams but seemed a long distance from the mainland which i hoped to reach  before however i had time to feel cast down i saw a ship making directly for the island and not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes i hid myself in the thick branches of a tree  the sailors ran the ship into a creek where ten slaves landed carrying spades and pickaxes  in the middle of the island they stopped and after digging some time lifted up what seemed to be a trapdoor  they then returned to the vessel two or three times for furniture and provisions and finally were accompanied by an old man leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age  they all disappeared down the trapdoor and after remaining below for a few minutes came up again but without the boy and let down the trapdoor covering it with earth as before  this done they entered the ship and set sail  as soon as they were out of sight i came down from my tree and went to the place where the boy had been buried  i dug up the earth till i reached a large stone with a ring in the centre  this when removed disclosed a flight of stone steps which led to a large room richly furnished and lighted by tapers  on a pile of cushions covered with tapestry sat the boy  he looked up startled and frightened at the sight of a stranger in such a place and to soothe his fears i at once spoke  be not alarmed sir whoever you may be  i am a king and the son of a king and will do you no hurt  on the contrary perhaps i have been sent here to deliver you out of this tomb where you have been buried alive  hearing my words the young man recovered himself and when i had ended he said the reasons prince that have caused me to be buried in this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise you  my father is a rich merchant owning much land and many ships and has great dealings in precious stones but he never ceased mourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth  at length one day he dreamed that the following year a son would be born to him and when this actually happened he consulted all the wise men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant  one and all they said the same thing  i was to live happily till i was fifteen when a terrible danger awaited me which i should hardly escape  if however i should succeed in doing so i should live to a great old age  and they added when the statue of the brass horse on the top of the mountain of adamant is thrown into the sea by agib the son of cassib then beware for fifty days later your son shall fall by his hand  this prophecy struck the heart of my father with such woe that he never got over it but that did not prevent him from attending carefully to my education till i attained a short time ago my fifteenth birthday  it was only yesterday that the news reached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had been thrown into the sea and he at once set about hiding me in this underground chamber which was built for the purpose promising to fetch me out when the forty days have passed  for myself i have no fears as prince agib is not likely to come here to look for me  i listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of my ever wishing to cause the death of this harmless boy whom i hastened to assure of my friendship and even of my protection begging him in return to convey me in his fathers ship to my own country  i need hardly say that i took special care not to inform him that i was the agib whom he dreaded  the day passed in conversation on various subjects and i found him a youth of ready wit and of some learning  i took on myself the duties of a servant held the basin and water for him when he washed prepared the dinner and set it on the table  he soon grew to love me and for thirtynine days we spent as pleasant an existence as could be expected underground  the morning of the fortieth dawned and the young man when he woke gave thanks in an outburst of joy that the danger was passed  my father may be here at any moment said he so make me i pray you a bath of hot water that i may bathe and change my clothes and be ready to receive him  so i fetched the water as he asked and washed and rubbed him after which he lay down again and slept a little  when he opened his eyes for the second time he begged me to bring him a melon and some sugar that he might eat and refresh himself  i soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained but could find no knife to cut it with  look in the cornice over my head said he and i think you will see one  it was so high above me that i had some difficulty in reaching it and catching my foot in the covering of the bed i slipped and fell right upon the young man the knife going straight into his heart  at this awful sight i shrieked aloud in my grief and pain  i threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow then fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father i raised the great stone which blocked the staircase and quitting the underground chamber made everything fast as before  scarcely had i finished when looking out to sea i saw the vessel heading for the island and feeling that it would be useless for me to protest my innocence i again concealed myself among the branches of a tree that grew near by  the old man and his slaves pushed off in a boat directly the ship touched land and walked quickly towards the entrance to the underground chamber but when they were near enough to see that the earth had been disturbed they paused and changed colour  in silence they all went down and called to the youth by name then for a moment i heard no more  suddenly a fearful scream rent the air and the next instant the slaves came up the steps carrying with them the body of the old man who had fainted from sorrow  laying him down at the foot of the tree in which i had taken shelter they did their best to recover him but it took a long while  when at last he revived they left him to dig a grave and then laying the young mans body in it they threw in the earth  this ended the slaves brought up all the furniture that remained below and put it on the vessel and breaking some boughs to weave a litter they laid the old man on it and carried him to the ship which spread its sails and stood out to sea  so once more i was quite alone and for a whole month i walked daily over the island seeking for some chance of escape  at length one day it struck me that my prison had grown much larger and that the mainland seemed to be nearer  my heart beat at this thought which was almost too good to be true  i watched a little longer there was no doubt about it and soon there was only a tiny stream for me to cross  even when i was safe on the other side i had a long distance to go on the mud and sand before i reached dry ground and very tired i was when far in front of me i caught sight of a castle of red copper which at first sight i took to be a fire  i made all the haste i could and after some miles of hard walking stood before it and gazed at it in astonishment for it seemed to me the most wonderful building i had ever beheld  while i was still staring at it there came towards me a tall old man accompanied by ten young men all handsome and all blind of the right eye  now in its way the spectacle of ten men walking together all blind of the right eye is as uncommon as that of a copper castle and i was turning over in my mind what could be the meaning of this strange fact when they greeted me warmly and inquired what had brought me there  i replied that my story was somewhat long but that if they would take the trouble to sit down i should be happy to tell it them  when i had finished the young men begged that i would go with them to the castle and i joyfully accepted their offer  we passed through what seemed to me an endless number of rooms and came at length into a large hall furnished with ten small blue sofas for the ten young men which served as beds as well as chairs and with another sofa in the middle for the old man  as none of the sofas could hold more than one person they bade me place myself on the carpet and to ask no questions about anything i should see  after a little while the old man rose and brought in supper which i ate heartily for i was very hungry  then one of the young men begged me to repeat my story which had struck them all with astonishment and when i had ended the old man was bidden to do his duty as it was late and they wished to go to bed  at these words he rose and went to a closet from which he brought out ten basins all covered with blue stuff  he set one before each of the young men together with a lighted taper  when the covers were taken off the basins i saw they were filled with ashes coaldust and lampblack the young men mixed these all together and smeared the whole over their heads and faces  they then wept and beat their breasts crying this is the fruit of idleness and of our wicked lives  this ceremony lasted nearly the whole night and when it stopped they washed themselves carefully and put on fresh clothes and lay down to sleep  all this while i had refrained from questions though my curiosity almost seemed to burn a hole in me but the following day when we went out to walk i said to them gentlemen i must disobey your wishes for i can keep silence no more  you do not appear to lack wit yet you do such actions as none but madmen could be capable of  whatever befalls me i cannot forbear asking why you daub your faces with black and how it is you are all blind of one eye but they only answered that such questions were none of my business and that i should do well to hold my peace  during that day we spoke of other things but when night came and the same ceremony was repeated i implored them most earnestly to let me know the meaning of it all  it is for your own sake replied one of the young men that we have not granted your request and to preserve you from our unfortunate fate  if however you wish to share our destiny we will delay no longer  i answered that whatever might be the consequence i wished to have my curiosity satisfied and that i would take the result on my own head he then assured me that even when i had lost my eye i should be unable to remain with them as their number was complete and could not be added to  but to this i replied that though i should be grieved to part company with such honest gentlemen i would not be turned from my resolution on that account  on hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and killed it and handed me a knife which they said i should byandby find useful  we must sew you into this sheepskin said they and then leave you  a fowl of monstrous size called a roc will appear in the air taking you to be a sheep  he will snatch you up and carry you into the sky but be not alarmed for he will bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain  when you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw it off  as soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear but you must walk on till you come to a castle covered with plates of gold studded with jewels  enter boldly at the gate which always stands open but do not ask us to tell you what we saw or what befel us there for that you will learn for yourself  this only we may say that it cost us each our right eye and has imposed upon us our nightly penance  after the young gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewing the sheepskin on me they left me and retired to the hall  in a few minutes the roc appeared and bore me off to the top of the mountain in his huge claws as lightly as if i had been a feather for this great white bird is so strong that he has been known to carry even an elephant to his nest in the hills  the moment my feet touched the ground i took out my knife and cut the threads that bound me and the sight of me in my proper clothes so alarmed the roc that he spread his wings and flew away  then i set out to seek the castle  i found it after wandering about for half a day and never could i have imagined anything so glorious  the gate led into a square court into which opened a hundred doors ninetynine of them being of rare woods and one of gold  through each of these doors i caught glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses  entering one of the doors which was standing open i found myself in a vast hall where forty young ladies magnificently dressed and of perfect beauty were reclining  as soon as they saw me they rose and uttered words of welcome and even forced me to take possession of a seat that was higher than their own though my proper place was at their feet  not content with this one brought me splendid garments while another filled a basin with scented water and poured it over my hands and the rest busied themselves with preparing refreshments after i had eaten and drunk of the most delicate food and rarest wines the ladies crowded round me and begged me to tell them all my adventures  by the time i had finished night had fallen and the ladies lighted up the castle with such a prodigious quantity of tapers that even day could hardly have been brighter  we then sat down to a supper of dried fruits and sweetmeats after which some sang and others danced  i was so well amused that i did not notice how the time was passing but at length one of the ladies approached and informed me it was midnight and that as i must be tired she would conduct me to the room that had been prepared for me  then bidding me goodnight i was left to sleep  i spent the next thirtynine days in much the same way as the first but at the close of that time the ladies appeared as was their custom in my room one morning to inquire how i had slept and instead of looking cheerful and smiling they were in floods of tears  prince said they we must leave you and never was it so hard to part from any of our friends  most likely we shall never see you again but if you have sufficient selfcommand perhaps we may yet look forward to a meeting  ladies i replied what is the meaning of these strange wordsi pray you to tell me  know then answered one of them that we are all princesseseach a kings daughter  we live in this castle together in the way that you have seen but at the end of every year secret duties call us away for the space of forty days  the time has now come but before we depart we will leave you our keys so that you may not lack entertainment during our absence  but one thing we would ask of you  the golden door alone forbear to open as you value your own peace and the happiness of your life  that door once unlocked we must bid you farewell for ever  weeping i assured them of my prudence and after embracing me tenderly they went their ways  every day i opened two or three fresh doors each of which contained behind it so many curious things that i had no chance of feeling dull much as i regretted the absence of the ladies  sometimes it was an orchard whose fruit far exceeded in bigness any that grew in my fathers garden  sometimes it was a court planted with roses jessamine dafeodils hyacinths and anemones and a thousand other flowers of which i did not know the names  or again it would be an aviary fitted with all kinds of singing birds or a treasury heaped up with precious stones but whatever i might see all was perfect of its own sort  thirtynine days passed away more rapidly than i could have conceived possible and the following morning the princesses were to return to the castle  but alas  i had explored every corner save only the room that was shut in by the golden door and i had no longer anything to amuse myself with  i stood before the forbidden place for some time gazing at its beauty then a happy inspiration struck me that because i unlocked the door it was not necessary that i should enter the chamber  it would be enough for me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be therein  thus arguing against my own conscience i turned the key when a smell rushed out that pleasant though it was overcame me completely and i fell fainting across the threshold  instead of being warned by this accident directly i came to myself i went for a few moments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume and then entered boldly  i found myself in a large vaulted room lighted by tapers scented with aloes and ambergris standing in golden candlesticks whilst gold and silver lamps hung from the ceiling  though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me i paid them scant attention so much was i struck by a great black horse which stood in one corner the handsomest and bestshaped animal i had ever seen  his saddle and bridle were of massive gold curiously wrought one side of his trough was filled with clean barley and sesame and the other with rose water  i led the animal into the open air and then jumped on his back shaking the reins as i did so but as he never stirred i touched him lightly with a switch i had picked up in his stable  no sooner did he feel the stroke than he spread his wings which i had not perceived before and flew up with me straight into the sky  when he had reached a prodigious height he next darted back to earth and alighted on the terrace belonging to a castle shaking me violently out of the saddle as he did so and giving me such a blow with his tail that he knocked out my right eye  halfstunned as i was with all that had happened to me i rose to my feet thinking as i did so of what had befallen the ten young men and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds  i left the terrace and wandered on till i came to a hall which i knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me by the ten blue sofas against the wall  the ten young men were not present when i first entered but came in soon after accompanied by the old man  they greeted me kindly and bewailed my misfortune though indeed they had expected nothing less all that has happened to you they said we also have undergone and we should be enjoying the same happiness still had we not opened the golden door while the princesses were absent  you have been no wiser than we and have suffered the same punishment  we would gladly receive you among us to perform such penance as we do but we have already told you that this is impossible  depart therefore from hence and go to the court of bagdad where you shall meet with him that can decide your destiny they told me the way i was to travel and i left them  on the road i caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved and put on a calenders habit  i have had a long journey but arrived this evening in the city where i met my brother calenders at the gate being strangers like myself  we wondered much at one another to see we were all blind of the same eye but we had no leisure to discourse at length of our common calamities  we had only so much time as to come hither to implore those favours which you have been generously pleased to grant us  he finished and it was zobeidas turn to speak  go wherever you please she said addressing all three  i pardon you all but you must depart immediately out of this house    the seven voyages of sindbad the sailor   in the times of the caliph harounalraschid there lived in bagdad a poor porter named hindbad who on a very hot day was sent to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other  before he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water and a cool breeze was blowing he set his burden upon the ground and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house  very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the open windows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed up from the hot pavement within the palace he heard some music as of many instruments cunningly played and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds and by this and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware he judged that feasting and merry making were going on  he wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had never seen before the street in which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass  to satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servants who stood at the door and asked one of them the name of the master of the mansion  what replied he do you live in bagdad and not know that here lives the noble sindbad the sailor that famous traveller who sailed over every sea upon which the sun shines  the porter who had often heard people speak of the immense wealth of sindbad could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemed to be as happy as his own was miserable  casting his eyes up to the sky he exclaimed aloud  consider mighty creator of all things the differences between sindbads life and mine  every day i suffer a thousand hardships and misfortunes and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to keep myself and my family alive while the lucky sindbad spends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land  what has he done that you should give him this pleasant lifewhat have i done to deserve so hard a fate  so saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with misery and despair  just at this moment a servant came out of the palace and taking him by the arm said come with me the noble sindbad my master wishes to speak to you  hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of sindbad so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street  however the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield  he followed the servant into a vast room where a great company was seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies  in the place of honour sat a tall grave man whose long white beard gave him a venerable air  behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to minister to his wants  this was the famous sindbad himself  the porter more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence tremblingly saluted the noble company  sindbad making a sign to him to approach caused him to be seated at his right hand and himself heaped choice morsels upon his plate and poured out for him a draught of excellent wine and presently when the banquet drew to a close spoke to him familiarly asking his name and occupation  my lord replied the porter i am called hindbad  i am glad to see you here continued sindbad  and i will answer for the rest of the company that they are equally pleased but i wish you to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street for sindbad passing by the open window before the feast began had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him  at this question hindbad was covered with confusion and hanging down his head replied my lord i confess that overcome by weariness and illhumour i uttered indiscreet words which i pray you to pardon me  oh replied sindbad do not imagine that i am so unjust as to blame you  on the contrary i understand your situation and can pity you only you appear to be mistaken about me and i wish to set you right you doubtless imagine that i have acquired all the wealth and luxury that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger but this is far indeed from being the case  i have only reached this happy state after having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger  yes my noble friends he continued addressing the company i assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even the most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas since you have perhaps heard but confused accounts of my seven voyages and the dangers and wonders that i have met with by sea and land i will now give you a full and true account of them which i think you will be well pleased to hear  as sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account of the porter he ordered before beginning his tale that the burden which had been left in the street should be carried by some of his own servants to the place for which hindbad had set out at first while he remained to listen to the story    first voyage   i had inherited considerable wealth from my parents and being young and foolish i at first squandered it recklessly upon every kind of pleasure but presently finding that riches speedily take to themselves wings if managed as badly as i was managing mine and remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed i began to bethink me of how i could make the best of what still remained to me i sold all my household goods by public auction and joined a company of merchants who traded by sea embarking with them at balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us  we set sail and took our course towards the east indies by the persian gulf having the coast of persia upon our left hand and upon our right the shores of arabia felix  i was at first much troubled by the uneasy motion of the vessel but speedily recovered my health and since that hour have been no more plagued by seasickness  from time to time we landed at various islands where we sold or exchanged our merchandise and one day when the wind dropped suddenly we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow which only rose slightly above the surface of the water  our sails were furled and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves  i was among the number but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale  those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it others sprang into the sea but before i could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire  meanwhile a breeze had sprung up and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides no one missed me and i was left at the mercy of the waves  all that day i floated up and down now beaten this way now that and when night fell i despaired for my life but weary and spent as i was i clung to my frail support and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that i had drifted against an island  the cliffs were high and steep but luckily for me some treeroots protruded in places and by their aid i climbed up at last and stretched myself upon the turf at the top where i lay more dead than alive till the sun was high in the heavens  by that time i was very hungry but after some searching i came upon some eatable herbs and a spring of clear water and much refreshed i set out to explore the island  presently i reached a great plain where a grazing horse was tethered and as i stood looking at it i heard voices talking apparently underground and in a moment a man appeared who asked me how i came upon the island  i told him my adventures and heard in return that he was one of the grooms of mihrage the king of the island and that each year they came to feed their masters horses in this plain he took me to a cave where his companions were assembled and when i had eaten of the food they set before me they bade me think myself fortunate to have come upon them when i did since they were going back to their master on the morrow and without their aid i could certainly never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island  early the next morning we accordingly set out and when we reached the capital i was graciously received by the king to whom i related my adventures upon which he ordered that i should be well cared for and provided with such things as i needed  being a merchant i sought out men of my own profession and particularly those who came from foreign countries as i hoped in this way to hear news from bagdad and find out some means of returning thither for the capital was situated upon the seashore and visited by vessels from all parts of the world  in the meantime i heard many curious things and answered many questions concerning my own country for i talked willingly with all who came to me  also to while away the time of waiting i explored a little island named cassel which belonged to king mihrage and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named deggial  indeed the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it however i saw nothing strange upon my voyage saving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long but were fortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them and fled from us if we did but strike upon a board to frighten them  other fishes there were only a cubit long which had heads like owls  one day after my return as i went down to the quay i saw a ship which had just cast anchor and was discharging her cargo while the merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing the removal of it to their warehouses  drawing nearer i presently noticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages and after having carefully examined them i felt sure that they were indeed those which i had put on board our ship at balsora  i then recognised the captain of the vessel but as i was certain that he believed me to be dead i went up to him and asked who owned the packages that i was looking at  there was on board my ship he replied a merchant of bagdad named sindbad  one day he and several of my other passengers landed upon what we supposed to be an island but which was really an enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves  no sooner did it feel upon its back the heat of the fire which had been kindled than it plunged into the depths of the sea  several of the people who were upon it perished in the waters and among others this unlucky sindbad  this merchandise is his but i have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his family if i should ever chance to meet with them  captain said i i am that sindbad whom you believe to be dead and these are my possessions  when the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement lackaday and what is the world coming to  in these days there is not an honest man to be met with  did i not with my own eyes see sindbad drown and now you have the audacity to tell me that you are he  i should have taken you to be a just man and yet for the sake of obtaining that which does not belong to you you are ready to invent this horrible falsehood  have patience and do me the favour to hear my story said i  speak then replied the captain im all attention  so i told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the kings grooms and how kindly i had been received at the palace  very soon i began to see that i had made some impression upon him and after the arrival of some of the other merchants who showed great joy at once more seeing me alive he declared that he also recognised me  throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed heaven be praised that you have escaped from so great a danger  as to your goods i pray you take them and dispose of them as you please i thanked him and praised his honesty begging him to accept several bales of merchandise in token of my gratitude but he would take nothing  of the choicest of my goods i prepared a present for king mihrage who was at first amazed having known that i had lost my all  however when i had explained to him how my bales had been miraculously restored to me he graciously accepted my gifts and in return gave me many valuable things  i then took leave of him and exchanging my merchandise for sandal and aloes wood camphor nutmegs cloves pepper and ginger i embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully upon our homeward voyage that i arrived in balsora with about one hundred thousand sequins  my family received me with as much joy as i felt upon seeing them once more  i bought land and slaves and built a great house in which i resolved to live happily and in the enjoyment of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings  here sindbad paused and commanded the musicians to play again while the feasting continued until evening  when the time came for the porter to depart sindbad gave him a purse containing one hundred sequins saying take this hindbad and go home but tomorrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventures  the porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity and you may imagine that he was well received at home where his wife and children thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a benefactor  the next day hindbad dressed in his best returned to the voyagers house and was received with open arms  as soon as all the guests had arrived the banquet began as before and when they had feasted long and merrily sindbad addressed them thus  my friends i beg that you will give me your attention while i relate the adventures of my second voyage which you will find even more astonishing than the first    second voyage   i had resolved as you know on my return from my first voyage to spend the rest of my days quietly in bagdad but very soon i grew tired of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself upon the sea  i procured therefore such goods as were suitable for the places i intended to visit and embarked for the second time in a good ship with other merchants whom i knew to be honourable men  we went from island to island often making excellent bargains until one day we landed at a spot which though covered with fruit trees and abounding in springs of excellent water appeared to possess neither houses nor people while my companions wandered here and there gathering flowers and fruit i sat down in a shady place and having heartily enjoyed the provisions and the wine i had brought with me i fell asleep lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by  how long i slept i know not but when i opened my eyes and started to my feet i perceived with horror that i was alone and that the ship was gone  i rushed to and fro like one distracted uttering cries of despair and when from the shore i saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon i wished bitterly enough that i had been content to stay at home in safety  but since wishes could do me no good i presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape  when i had climbed a tall tree i first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea but finding nothing hopeful there i turned landward and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object so far off that i could not make out what it might be  descending from the tree i hastily collected what remained of my provisions and set off as fast as i could go towards it  as i drew near it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height and when i could touch it i found it marvellously smooth and soft  as it was impossible to climb itfor it presented no footholdi walked round about it seeking some opening but there was none  i counted however that it was at least fifty paces round  by this time the sun was near setting but quite suddenly it fell dark something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me and i saw with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary size which was hovering near  then i remembered that i had often heard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc and it occurred to me that the white object which had so puzzled me must be its egg  sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it covering it with its wings to keep it warm and i cowered close beside the egg in such a position that one of the birds feet which was as large as the trunk of a tree was just in front of me  taking off my turban i bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc when it took flight next morning would bear me away with it from the desolate island  and this was precisely what did happen  as soon as the dawn appeared the bird rose into the air carrying me up and up till i could no longer see the earth and then suddenly it descended so swiftly that i almost lost consciousness  when i became aware that the roc had settled and that i was once again upon solid ground i hastily unbound my turban from its foot and freed myself and that not a moment too soon for the bird pouncing upon a huge snake killed it with a few blows from its powerful beak and seizing it up rose into the air once more and soon disappeared from my view  when i had looked about me i began to doubt if i had gained anything by quitting the desolate island  the valley in which i found myself was deep and narrow and surrounded by mountains which towered into the clouds and were so steep and rocky that there was no way of climbing up their sides  as i wandered about seeking anxiously for some means of escaping from this trap i observed that the ground was strewed with diamonds some of them of an astonishing size  this sight gave me great pleasure but my delight was speedily damped when i saw also numbers of horrible snakes so long and so large that the smallest of them could have swallowed an elephant with ease  fortunately for me they seemed to hide in caverns of the rocks by day and only came out by night probably because of their enemy the roc  all day long i wandered up and down the valley and when it grew dusk i crept into a little cave and having blocked up the entrance to it with a stone i ate part of my little store of food and lay down to sleep but all through the night the serpents crawled to and fro hissing horribly so that i could scarcely close my eyes for terror  i was thankful when the morning light appeared and when i judged by the silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens i came tremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and down the valley once more kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path for i felt that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation  at last overcome with weariness i sat down upon a rock but i had hardly closed my eyes when i was startled by something which fell to the ground with a thud close beside me  it was a huge piece of fresh meat and as i stared at it several more pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places  i had always thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous valley of diamonds and of the cunning way which some merchants had devised for getting at the precious stones were mere travellers tales invented to give pleasure to the hearers but now i perceived that they were surely true  these merchants came to the valley at the time when the eagles which keep their eyries in the rocks had hatched their young  the merchants then threw great lumps of meat into the valley  these falling with so much force upon the diamonds were sure to take up some of the precious stones with them when the eagles pounced upon the meat and carried it off to their nests to feed their hungry broods  then the merchants scaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries would secure their treasures  until this moment i had looked upon the valley as my grave for i had seen no possibility of getting out of it alive but now i took courage and began to devise a means of escape  i began by picking up all the largest diamonds i could find and storing them carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions this i tied securely to my belt  i then chose the piece of meat which seemed most suited to my purpose and with the aid of my turban bound it firmly to my back this done i laid down upon my face and awaited the coming of the eagles  i soon heard the flapping of their mighty wings above me and had the satisfaction of feeling one of them seize upon my piece of meat and me with it and rise slowly towards his nest into which he presently dropped me  luckily for me the merchants were on the watch and setting up their usual outcries they rushed to the nest scaring away the eagle  their amazement was great when they discovered me and also their disappointment and with one accord they fell to abusing me for having robbed them of their usual profit addressing myself to the one who seemed most aggrieved i said  i am sure if you knew all that i have suffered you would show more kindness towards me and as for diamonds i have enough here of the very best for you and me and all your company  so saying i showed them to him  the others all crowded round me wondering at my adventures and admiring the device by which i had escaped from the valley and when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds they assured me that in all the years that they had carried on their trade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for size and beauty  i found that each merchant chose a particular nest and took his chance of what he might find in it  so i begged the one who owned the nest to which i had been carried to take as much as he would of my treasure but he contented himself with one stone and that by no means the largest assuring me that with such a gem his fortune was made and he need toil no more  i stayed with the merchants several days and then as they were journeying homewards i gladly accompanied them  our way lay across high mountains infested with frightful serpents but we had the good luck to escape them and came at last to the seashore  thence we sailed to the isle of rohat where the camphor trees grow to such a size that a hundred men could shelter under one of them with ease  the sap flows from an incision made high up in the tree into a vessel hung there to receive it and soon hardens into the substance called camphor but the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so treated  in this same island we saw the rhinoceros an animal which is smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo  it has one horn about a cubit long which is solid but has a furrow from the base to the tip upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man  the rhinoceros fights with the elephant and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy he falls helpless to the ground and then comes the roc and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young  this doubtless astonishes you but if you do not believe my tale go to rohat and see for yourself  for fear of wearying you i pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island  before we left i exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which i profited greatly on our homeward way  at last we reached balsora whence i hastened to bagdad where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor after which i settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches i had gained with so much toil and pain  having thus related the adventures of his second voyage sindbad again bestowed a hundred sequins upon hindbad inviting him to come again on the following day and hear how he fared upon his third voyage  the other guests also departed to their homes but all returned at the same hour next day including the porter whose former life of hard work and poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream  again after the feast was over did sindbad claim the attention of his guests and began the account of his third voyage    third voyage   after a very short time the pleasant easy life i led made me quite forget the perils of my two voyages  moreover as i was still in the prime of life it pleased me better to be up and doing  so once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest merchandise of bagdad i conveyed it to balsora and set sail with other merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands  we had touched at many ports and made much profit when one day upon the open sea we were caught by a terrible wind which blew us completely out of our reckoning and lasting for several days finally drove us into harbour on a strange island  i would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here quoth our captain  this island and all adjoining it are inhabited by hairy savages who are certain to attack us and whatever these dwarfs may do we dare not resist since they swarm like locusts and if one of them is killed the rest will fall upon us and speedily make an end of us  these words caused great consternation among all the ships company and only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly there appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages not more than two feet high and covered with reddish fur  throwing themselves into the waves they surrounded our vessel  chattering meanwhile in a language we could not understand and clutching at ropes and gangways they swarmed up the ships side with such speed and agility that they almost seemed to fly  you may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched them neither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to deter them from their purpose whatever it might be  of this we were not left long in doubt  hoisting the sails and cutting the cable of the anchor they sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further off where they drove us ashore then taking possession of her they made off to the place from which they had come leaving us helpless upon a shore avoided with horror by all mariners for a reason which you will soon learn  turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland finding as we went various herbs and fruits which we ate feeling that we might as well live as long as possible though we had no hope of escape presently we saw in the far distance what seemed to us to be a splendid palace towards which we turned our weary steps but when we reached it we saw that it was a castle lofty and strongly built  pushing back the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard but upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we paused frozen with horror at the sight which greeted us  on one side lay a huge pile of boneshuman bones and on the other numberless spits for roasting  overcome with despair we sank trembling to the ground and lay there without speech or motion  the sun was setting when a loud noise aroused us the door of the hall was violently burst open and a horrible giant entered  he was as tall as a palm tree and perfectly black and had one eye which flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead  his teeth were long and sharp and grinned horribly while his lower lip hung down upon his chest and he had ears like elephants ears which covered his shoulders and nails like the claws of some fierce bird  at this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men when at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us attentively with his fearful eye  presently when he had looked at us enough he came towards us and stretching out his hand took me by the back of the neck turning me this way and that but feeling that i was mere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next whom he treated in the same fashion at last he came to the captain and finding him the fattest of us all he took him up in one hand and stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fire at which he presently roasted him  after the giant had supped he lay down to sleep snoring like the loudest thunder while we lay shivering with horror the whole night through and when day broke he awoke and went out leaving us in the castle  when we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning our horrible fate until the hall echoed with our despairing cries  though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us to kill him and indeed we should have found that a hard task even if we had thought of it and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves  so at last submitting to our sad fate we spent the day in wandering up and down the island eating such fruits as we could find and when night came we returned to the castle having sought in vain for any other place of shelter  at sunset the giant returned supped upon one of our unhappy comrades slept and snored till dawn and then left us as before  our condition seemed to us so frightful that several of my companions thought it would be better to leap from the cliffs and perish in the waves at once rather than await so miserable an end but i had a plan of escape which i now unfolded to them and which they at once agreed to attempt  listen my brothers i added  you know that plenty of driftwood lies along the shore  let us make several rafts and carry them to a suitable place  if our plot succeeds we can wait patiently for the chance of some passing ship which would rescue us from this fatal island  if it fails we must quickly take to our rafts frail as they are we have more chance of saving our lives with them than we have if we remain here  all agreed with me and we spent the day in building rafts each capable of carrying three persons  at nightfall we returned to the castle and very soon in came the giant and one more of our number was sacrificed  but the time of our vengeance was at hand  as soon as he had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleep as before and when we heard him begin to snore i and nine of the boldest of my comrades rose softly and took each a spit which we made redhot in the fire and then at a given signal we plunged it with one accord into the giants eye completely blinding him  uttering a terrible cry he sprang to his feet clutching in all directions to try to seize one of us but we had all fled different ways as soon as the deed was done and thrown ourselves flat upon the ground in corners where he was not likely to touch us with his feet  after a vain search he fumbled about till he found the door and fled out of it howling frightfully  as for us when he was gone we made haste to leave the fatal castle and stationing ourselves beside our rafts we waited to see what would happen  our idea was that if when the sun rose we saw nothing of the giant and no longer heard his howls which still came faintly through the darkness growing more and more distant we should conclude that he was dead and that we might safely stay upon the island and need not risk our lives upon the frail rafts  but alas morning light showed us our enemy approaching us supported on either hand by two giants nearly as large and fearful as himself while a crowd of others followed close upon their heels hesitating no longer we clambered upon our rafts and rowed with all our might out to sea  the giants seeing their prey escaping them seized up huge pieces of rock and wading into the water hurled them after us with such good aim that all the rafts except the one i was upon were swamped and their luckless crews drowned without our being able to do anything to help them  indeed i and my two companions had all we could do to keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants but by dint of hard rowing we at last gained the open sea  here we were at the mercy of the winds and waves which tossed us to and fro all that day and night but the next morning we found ourselves near an island upon which we gladly landed  there we found delicious fruits and having satisfied our hunger we presently lay down to rest upon the shore  suddenly we were aroused by a loud rustling noise and starting up saw that it was caused by an immense snake which was gliding towards us over the sand  so swiftly it came that it had seized one of my comrades before he had time to fly and in spite of his cries and struggles speedily crushed the life out of him in its mighty coils and proceeded to swallow him  by this time my other companion and i were running for our lives to some place where we might hope to be safe from this new horror and seeing a tall tree we climbed up into it having first provided ourselves with a store of fruit off the surrounding bushes  when night came i fell asleep but only to be awakened once more by the terrible snake which after hissing horribly round the tree at last reared itself up against it and finding my sleeping comrade who was perched just below me it swallowed him also and crawled away leaving me half dead with terror  when the sun rose i crept down from the tree with hardly a hope of escaping the dreadful fate which had overtaken my comrades but life is sweet and i determined to do all i could to save myself  all day long i toiled with frantic haste and collected quantities of dry brushwood reeds and thorns which i bound with faggots and making a circle of them under my tree i piled them firmly one upon another until i had a kind of tent in which i crouched like a mouse in a hole when she sees the cat coming  you may imagine what a fearful night i passed for the snake returned eager to devour me and glided round and round my frail shelter seeking an entrance  every moment i feared that it would succeed in pushing aside some of the faggots but happily for me they held together and when it grew light my enemy retired baffled and hungry to his den  as for me i was more dead than alive  shaking with fright and half suffocated by the poisonous breath of the monster i came out of my tent and crawled down to the sea feeling that it would be better to plunge from the cliffs and end my life at once than pass such another night of horror  but to my joy and relief i saw a ship sailing by and by shouting wildly and waving my turban i managed to attract the attention of her crew  a boat was sent to rescue me and very soon i found myself on board surrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants eager to know by what chance i found myself in that desolate island  after i had told my story they regaled me with the choicest food the ship afforded and the captain seeing that i was in rags generously bestowed upon me one of his own coats  after sailing about for some time and touching at many ports we came at last to the island of salahat where sandal wood grows in great abundance  here we anchored and as i stood watching the merchants disembarking their goods and preparing to sell or exchange them the captain came up to me and said  i have here brother some merchandise belonging to a passenger of mine who is dead  will you do me the favour to trade with it and when i meet with his heirs i shall be able to give them the money though it will be only just that you shall have a portion for your trouble  i consented gladly for i did not like standing by idle  whereupon he pointed the bales out to me and sent for the person whose duty it was to keep a list of the goods that were upon the ship  when this man came he asked in what name the merchandise was to be registered  in the name of sindbad the sailor replied the captain  at this i was greatly surprised but looking carefully at him i recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which i had made my second voyage though he had altered much since that time  as for him believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me  so captain said i the merchant who owned those bales was called sindbad  yes he replied  he was so named  he belonged to bagdad and joined my ship at balsora but by mischance he was left behind upon a desert island where we had landed to fill up our watercasks and it was not until four hours later that he was missed  by that time the wind had freshened and it was impossible to put back for him  you suppose him to have perished then said i  alas yes he answered  why captain  i cried look well at me  i am that sindbad who fell asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself abandoned  the captain stared at me in amazement but was presently convinced that i was indeed speaking the truth and rejoiced greatly at my escape  i am glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscience at any rate said he  now take your goods and the profit i have made for you upon them and may you prosper in future  i took them gratefully and as we went from one island to another i laid in stores of cloves cinnamon and other spices  in one place i saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long and as many broad also a fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that it was used to make shields  another i saw that was like a camel in shape and colour  so by degrees we came back to balsora and i returned to bagdad with so much money that i could not myself count it besides treasures without end  i gave largely to the poor and bought much land to add to what i already possessed and thus ended my third voyage  when sindbad had finished his story he gave another hundred sequins to hindbad who then departed with the other guests but next day when they had all reassembled and the banquet was ended their host continued his adventures    fourth voyage   rich and happy as i was after my third voyage i could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether  my love of trading and the pleasure i took in anything that was new and strange made me set my affairs in order and begin my journey through some of the persian provinces having first sent off stores of goods to await my coming in the different places i intended to visit  i took ship at a distant seaport and for some time all went well but at last being caught in a violent hurricane our vessel became a total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her and many of our company perished in the waves  i with a few others had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck for the storm had driven us near an island and scrambling up beyond the reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted to wait for morning  at daylight we wandered inland and soon saw some huts to which we directed our steps  as we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us and we were led to their houses and as it were divided among our captors  i with five others was taken into a hut where we were made to sit upon the ground and certain herbs were given to us which the blacks made signs to us to eat  observing that they themselves did not touch them i was careful only to pretend to taste my portion but my companions being very hungry rashly ate up all that was set before them and very soon i had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad  though they chattered incessantly i could not understand a word they said nor did they heed when i spoke to them  the savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly but i only tasted a few grains understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating and this was exactly what happened  my unlucky companions having lost their reason felt neither anxiety nor fear and ate greedily all that was offered them  so they were soon fat and there was an end of them but i grew leaner day by day for i ate but little and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me however as i was so far from being a tempting morsel i was allowed to wander about freely and one day when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me i managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest running faster the more he cried to me to come back until i had completely distanced him  for seven days i hurried on resting only when the darkness stopped me and living chiefly upon cocoanuts which afforded me both meat and drink and on the eighth day i reached the seashore and saw a party of white men gathering pepper which grew abundantly all about  reassured by the nature of their occupation i advanced towards them and they greeted me in arabic asking who i was and whence i came  my delight was great on hearing this familiar speech and i willingly satisfied their curiosity telling them how i had been shipwrecked and captured by the blacks  but these savages devour men said they  how did you escape  i repeated to them what i have just told you at which they were mightily astonished  i stayed with them until they had collected as much pepper as they wished and then they took me back to their own country and presented me to their king by whom i was hospitably received  to him also i had to relate my adventures which surprised him much and when i had finished he ordered that i should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration  the island on which i found myself was full of people and abounded in all sorts of desirable things and a great deal of traffic went on in the capital where i soon began to feel at home and contented moreover the king treated me with special favour and in consequence of this everyone whether at the court or in the town sought to make life pleasant to me  one thing i remarked which i thought very strange this was that from the greatest to the least all men rode their horses without bridle or stirrups  i one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them to which he replied you speak to me of things of which i have never before heard  this gave me an idea i found a clever workman and made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle which i wadded and covered with choice leather adorning it with rich gold embroidery  i then got a locksmith to make me a bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that i drew for him and when all these things were completed i presented them to the king and showed him how to use them  when i had saddled one of his horses he mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty and to show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts  after this i had to make saddles for all the principal officers of the kings household and as they all gave me rich presents i soon became very wealthy and quite an important person in the city  one day the king sent for me and said sindbad i am going to ask a favour of you  both i and my subjects esteem you and wish you to end your days amongst us  therefore i desire that you will marry a rich and beautiful lady whom i will find for you and think no more of your own country  as the kings will was law i accepted the charming bride he presented to me and lived happily with her  nevertheless i had every intention of escaping at the first opportunity and going back to bagdad  things were thus going prosperously with me when it happened that the wife of one of my neighbours with whom i had struck up quite a friendship fell ill and presently died  i went to his house to offer my consolations and found him in the depths of woe  heaven preserve you said i and send you a long life  alas he replied what is the good of saying that when i have but an hour left to live  come come said i surely it is not so bad as all that  i trust that you may be spared to me for many years  i hope answered he that your life may be long but as for me all is finished  i have set my house in order and today i shall be buried with my wife  this has been the law upon our island from the earliest agesthe living husband goes to the grave with his dead wife the living wife with her dead husband  so did our fathers and so must we do  the law changes not and all must submit to it  as he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began to assemble  the body decked in rich robes and sparkling with jewels was laid upon an open bier and the procession started taking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city the wretched husband clothed from head to foot in a black mantle following mournfully  when the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered just as it was into a deep pit  then the husband bidding farewell to all his friends stretched himself upon another bier upon which were laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water and he also was let downdowndown to the depths of the horrible cavern and then a stone was laid over the opening and the melancholy company wended its way back to the city  you may imagine that i was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings to all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomed from their youth up but i was so horrified that i could not help telling the king how it struck me  sire i said i am more astonished than i can express to you at the strange custom which exists in your dominions of burying the living with the dead  in all my travels i have never before met with so cruel and horrible a law  what would you have sindbad he replied  it is the law for everybody  i myself should be buried with the queen if she were the first to die  but your majesty said i dare i ask if this law applies to foreigners also  why yes replied the king smiling in what i could but consider a very heartless manner they are no exception to the rule if they have married in the country  when i heard this i went home much cast down and from that time forward my mind was never easy  if only my wifes little finger ached i fancied she was going to die and sure enough before very long she fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last  my dismay was great for it seemed to me that to be buried alive was even a worse fate than to be devoured by cannibals nevertheless there was no escape  the body of my wife arrayed in her richest robes and decked with all her jewels was laid upon the bier  i followed it and after me came a great procession headed by the king and all his nobles and in this order we reached the fatal mountain which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea  here i made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the king and those who stood by hoping to save myself even at this last moment but it was of no avail  no one spoke to me they even appeared to hasten over their dreadful task and i speedily found myself descending into the gloomy pit with my seven loaves and pitcher of water beside me almost before i reached the bottom the stone was rolled into its place above my head and i was left to my fate  a feeble ray of light shone into the cavern through some chink and when i had the courage to look about me i could see that i was in a vast vault bestrewn with bones and bodies of the dead  i even fancied that i heard the expiring sighs of those who like myself had come into this dismal place alive  all in vain did i shriek aloud with rage and despair reproaching myself for the love of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass but at length growing calmer i took up my bread and water and wrapping my face in my mantle i groped my way towards the end of the cavern where the air was fresher  here i lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were exhausted but just as i was nearly dead from starvation the rock was rolled away overhead and i saw that a bier was being lowered into the cavern and that the corpse upon it was a man  in a moment my mind was made up the woman who followed had nothing to expect but a lingering death i should be doing her a service if i shortened her misery  therefore when she descended already insensible from terror i was ready armed with a huge bone one blow from which left her dead and i secured the bread and water which gave me a hope of life  several times did i have recourse to this desperate expedient and i know not how long i had been a prisoner when one day i fancied that i heard something near me which breathed loudly  turning to the place from which the sound came i dimly saw a shadowy form which fled at my movement squeezing itself through a cranny in the wall  i pursued it as fast as i could and found myself in a narrow crack among the rocks along which i was just able to force my way  i followed it for what seemed to me many miles and at last saw before me a glimmer of light which grew clearer every moment until i emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which i cannot describe  when i was sure that i was not dreaming i realised that it was doubtless some little animal which had found its way into the cavern from the sea and when disturbed had fled showing me a means of escape which i could never have discovered for myself  i hastily surveyed my surroundings and saw that i was safe from all pursuit from the town  the mountains sloped sheer down to the sea and there was no road across them  being assured of this i returned to the cavern and amassed a rich treasure of diamonds rubies emeralds and jewels of all kinds which strewed the ground  these i made up into bales and stored them into a safe place upon the beach and then waited hopefully for the passing of a ship  i had looked out for two days however before a single sail appeared so it was with much delight that i at last saw a vessel not very far from the shore and by waving my arms and uttering loud cries succeeded in attracting the attention of her crew  a boat was sent off to me and in answer to the questions of the sailors as to how i came to be in such a plight i replied that i had been shipwrecked two days before but had managed to scramble ashore with the bales which i pointed out to them  luckily for me they believed my story and without even looking at the place where they found me took up my bundles and rowed me back to the ship  once on board i soon saw that the captain was too much occupied with the difficulties of navigation to pay much heed to me though he generously made me welcome and would not even accept the jewels with which i offered to pay my passage  our voyage was prosperous and after visiting many lands and collecting in each place great store of goodly merchandise i found myself at last in bagdad once more with unheard of riches of every description  again i gave large sums of money to the poor and enriched all the mosques in the city after which i gave myself up to my friends and relations with whom i passed my time in feasting and merriment  here sindbad paused and all his hearers declared that the adventures of his fourth voyage had pleased them better than anything they had heard before  they then took their leave followed by hindbad who had once more received a hundred sequins and with the rest had been bidden to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage  when the time came all were in their places and when they had eaten and drunk of all that was set before them sindbad began his tale    fifth voyage   not even all that i had gone through could make me contented with a quiet life  i soon wearied of its pleasures and longed for change and adventure  therefore i set out once more but this time in a ship of my own which i built and fitted out at the nearest seaport  i wished to be able to call at whatever port i chose taking my own time but as i did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo i invited several merchants of different nations to join me  we set sail with the first favourable wind and after a long voyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown island which proved to be uninhabited  we determined however to explore it but had not gone far when we found a rocs egg as large as the one i had seen before and evidently very nearly hatched for the beak of the young bird had already pierced the shell  in spite of all i could say to deter them the merchants who were with me fell upon it with their hatchets breaking the shell and killing the young roc  then lighting a fire upon the ground they hacked morsels from the bird and proceeded to roast them while i stood by aghast  scarcely had they finished their illomened repast when the air above us was darkened by two mighty shadows  the captain of my ship knowing by experience what this meant cried out to us that the parent birds were coming and urged us to get on board with all speed  this we did and the sails were hoisted but before we had made any way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it uttering frightful cries when they discovered the mangled remains of their young one  for a moment we lost sight of them and were flattering ourselves that we had escaped when they reappeared and soared into the air directly over our vessel and we saw that each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us  there was a moment of breathless suspense then one bird loosed its hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the air but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman who turned our ship violently in another direction it fell into the sea close beside us cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom  we had hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fell with a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel smashing it into a thousand fragments and crushing or hurling into the sea passengers and crew  i myself went down with the rest but had the good fortune to rise unhurt and by holding on to a piece of driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other i kept myself afloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an island  its shores were steep and rocky but i scrambled up safely and threw myself down to rest upon the green turf  when i had somewhat recovered i began to examine the spot in which i found myself and truly it seemed to me that i had reached a garden of delights  there were trees everywhere and they were laden with flowers and fruit while a crystal stream wandered in and out under their shadow  when night came i slept sweetly in a cosy nook though the remembrance that i was alone in a strange land made me sometimes start up and look around me in alarm and then i wished heartily that i had stayed at home at ease  however the morning sunlight restored my courage and i once more wandered among the trees but always with some anxiety as to what i might see next  i had penetrated some distance into the island when i saw an old man bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank and at first i took him to be some shipwrecked mariner like myself  going up to him i greeted him in a friendly way but he only nodded his head at me in reply  i then asked what he did there and he made signs to me that he wished to get across the river to gather some fruit and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back pitying his age and feebleness i took him up and wading across the stream i bent down that he might more easily reach the bank and bade him get down  but instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet even now it makes me laugh to think of it this creature who had seemed to me so decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders and hooking his legs round my neck gripped me so tightly that i was wellnigh choked and so overcome with terror that i fell insensible to the ground  when i recovered my enemy was still in his place though he had released his hold enough to allow me breathing space and seeing me revive he prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other until i was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees while he gathered and ate the choicest fruits  this went on all day and even at night when i threw myself down half dead with weariness the terrible old man held on tight to my neck nor did he fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me with his heels until i perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march with rage and bitterness in my heart  it happened one day that i passed a tree under which lay several dry gourds and catching one up i amused myself with scooping out its contents and pressing into it the juice of several bunches of grapes which hung from every bush  when it was full i left it propped in the fork of a tree and a few days later carrying the hateful old man that way i snatched at my gourd as i passed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that i even forgot my detestable burden and began to sing and caper  the old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught had produced and that i carried him more lightly than usual so he stretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted its contents cautiously then drained them to the very last drop  the wine was strong and the gourd capacious so he also began to sing after a fashion and soon i had the delight of feeling the iron grip of his goblin legs unclasp and with one vigorous effort i threw him to the ground from which he never moved again  i was so rejoiced to have at last got rid of this uncanny old man that i ran leaping and bounding down to the sea shore where by the greatest good luck i met with some mariners who had anchored off the island to enjoy the delicious fruits and to renew their supply of water  they heard the story of my escape with amazement saying you fell into the hands of the old man of the sea and it is a mercy that he did not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose shoulders he has managed to perch himself  this island is well known as the scene of his evil deeds and no merchant or sailor who lands upon it cares to stray far away from his comrades  after we had talked for a while they took me back with them on board their ship where the captain received me kindly and we soon set sail and after several days reached a large and prosperouslooking town where all the houses were built of stone  here we anchored and one of the merchants who had been very friendly to me on the way took me ashore with him and showed me a lodging set apart for strange merchants  he then provided me with a large sack and pointed out to me a party of others equipped in like manner  go with them said he and do as they do but beware of losing sight of them for if you strayed your life would be in danger  with that he supplied me with provisions and bade me farewell and i set out with my new companions  i soon learnt that the object of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts but when at length i saw the trees and noted their immense height and the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks i did not at all understand how we were to do it  the crowns of the cocoapalms were all alive with monkeys big and little which skipped from one to the other with surprising agility seeming to be curious about us and disturbed at our appearance and i was at first surprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw them at the lively creatures which seemed to me quite harmless  but very soon i saw the reason of it and joined them heartily for the monkeys annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry and spiteful gestures so that after very little labour our sacks were filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained  as soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the same occupation until i had earned money enough to carry me to my own country  this i did and before long had amassed a considerable sum just then i heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail and taking leave of my friend i went on board carrying with me a goodly store of cocoanuts and we sailed first to the islands where pepper grows then to comari where the best aloes wood is found and where men drink no wine by an unalterable law  here i exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood and went afishing for pearls with some of the other merchants and my divers were so lucky that very soon i had an immense number and those very large and perfect  with all these treasures i came joyfully back to bagdad where i disposed of them for large sums of money of which i did not fail as before to give the tenth part to the poor and after that i rested from my labours and comforted myself with all the pleasures that my riches could give me  having thus ended his story sindbad ordered that one hundred sequins should be given to hindbad and the guests then withdrew but after the next days feast he began the account of his sixth voyage as follows    sixth voyage   it must be a marvel to you how after having five times met with shipwreck and unheard of perils i could again tempt fortune and risk fresh trouble  i am even surprised myself when i look back but evidently it was my fate to rove and after a year of repose i prepared to make a sixth voyage regardless of the entreaties of my friends and relations who did all they could to keep me at home  instead of going by the persian gulf i travelled a considerable way overland and finally embarked from a distant indian port with a captain who meant to make a long voyage  and truly he did so for we fell in with stormy weather which drove us completely out of our course so that for many days neither captain nor pilot knew where we were nor where we were going  when they did at last discover our position we had small ground for rejoicing for the captain casting his turban upon the deck and tearing his beard declared that we were in the most dangerous spot upon the whole wide sea and had been caught by a current which was at that minute sweeping us to destruction  it was too true  in spite of all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful rapidity towards the foot of a mountain which rose sheer out of the sea and our vessel was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at its base not however until we had managed to scramble on shore carrying with us the most precious of our possessions  when we had done this the captain said to us  now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once since from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned  this speech discouraged us much and we began to lament over our sad fate  the mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships while the bones of the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine and we shuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap  all around too lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise and treasures were heaped in every cranny of the rocks but all these things only added to the desolation of the scene  it struck me as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water which gushed out from the mountain not far from where we stood instead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do turned off sharply and flowed out of sight under a natural archway of rock and when i went to examine it more closely i found that inside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds and rubies and masses of crystal and the floor was strewn with ambergris here then upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to our fate for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain and if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom  the first thing our captain did was to divide equally amongst us all the food we possessed and then the length of each mans life depended on the time he could make his portion last  i myself could live upon very little  nevertheless by the time i had buried the last of my companions my stock of provisions was so small that i hardly thought i should live long enough to dig my own grave which i set about doing while i regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always bringing me into such straits and thought longingly of all the comfort and luxury that i had left  but luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of the cavern and as i did so an idea struck me  this river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot  why should i not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing waters  if i perished before i could reach the light of day once more i should be no worse off than i was now for death stared me in the face while there was always the possibility that as i was born under a lucky star i might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land  i decided at any rate to risk it and speedily built myself a stout raft of driftwood with strong cords of which enough and to spare lay strewn upon the beach  i then made up many packages of rubies emeralds rock crystal ambergris and precious stuffs and bound them upon my raft being careful to preserve the balance and then i seated myself upon it having two small oars that i had fashioned laid ready to my hand and loosed the cord which held it to the bank  once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy archway and i found myself in total darkness carried smoothly forward by the rapid river  on i went as it seemed to me for many nights and days  once the channel became so small that i had a narrow escape of being crushed against the rocky roof and after that i took the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales  though i only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive the inevitable moment came when after swallowing my last morsel of food i began to wonder if i must after all die of hunger  then worn out with anxiety and fatigue i fell into a deep sleep and when i again opened my eyes i was once more in the light of day a beautiful country lay before me and my raft which was tied to the river bank was surrounded by friendly looking black men  i rose and saluted them and they spoke to me in return but i could not understand a word of their language feeling perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light i murmured to myself in arabic close thine eyes and while thou sleepest heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good  one of the natives who understood this tongue then came forward saying  my brother be not surprised to see us this is our land and as we came to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating down it and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore  we have waited for your awakening tell us now whence you come and where you were going by that dangerous way  i replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them but that i was starving and would fain eat something first  i was soon supplied with all i needed and having satisfied my hunger i told them faithfully all that had befallen me  they were lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them and said that adventures so surprising must be related to their king only by the man to whom they had happened  so procuring a horse they mounted me upon it and we set out followed by several strong men carrying my raft just as it was upon their shoulders  in this order we marched into the city of serendib where the natives presented me to their king whom i saluted in the indian fashion prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the ground but the monarch bade me rise and sit beside him asking first what was my name  i am sindbad i replied whom men call the sailor for i have voyaged much upon many seas  and how come you here asked the king  i told my story concealing nothing and his surprise and delight were so great that he ordered my adventures to be written in letters of gold and laid up in the archives of his kingdom  presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his presence and the king declared that in all his treasury there were no such rubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps before him seeing that he looked at them with interest i ventured to say that i myself and all that i had were at his disposal but he answered me smiling  nay sindbad  heaven forbid that i should covet your riches i will rather add to them for i desire that you shall not leave my kingdom without some tokens of my good will  he then commanded his officers to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense and sent slaves to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to my new dwelling place  you may imagine that i praised his generosity and gave him grateful thanks nor did i fail to present myself daily in his audience chamber and for the rest of my time i amused myself in seeing all that was most worthy of attention in the city  the island of serendib being situated on the equinoctial line the days and nights there are of equal length  the chief city is placed at the end of a beautiful valley formed by the highest mountain in the world which is in the middle of the island  i had the curiosity to ascend to its very summit for this was the place to which adam was banished out of paradise  here are found rubies and many precious things and rare plants grow abundantly with cedar trees and cocoa palms  on the seashore and at the mouths of the rivers the divers seek for pearls and in some valleys diamonds are plentiful  after many days i petitioned the king that i might return to my own country to which he graciously consented  moreover he loaded me with rich gifts and when i went to take leave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a letter to the commander of the faithful our sovereign lord saying i pray you give these to the caliph haroun al raschid and assure him of my friendship  i accepted the charge respectfully and soon embarked upon the vessel which the king himself had chosen for me  the kings letter was written in blue characters upon a rare and precious skin of yellowish colour and these were the words of it the king of the indies before whom walk a thousand elephants who lives in a palace of which the roof blazes with a hundred thousand rubies and whose treasure house contains twenty thousand diamond crowns to the caliph haroun al raschid sends greeting  though the offering we present to you is unworthy of your notice we pray you to accept it as a mark of the esteem and friendship which we cherish for you and of which we gladly send you this token and we ask of you a like regard if you deem us worthy of it  adieu brother  the present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby six inches high and as thick as my finger this was filled with the choicest pearls large and of perfect shape and lustre secondly a huge snake skin with scales as large as a sequin which would preserve from sickness those who slept upon it  then quantities of aloes wood camphor and pistachionuts and lastly a beautiful slave girl whose robes glittered with precious stones  after a long and prosperous voyage we landed at balsora and i made haste to reach bagdad and taking the kings letter i presented myself at the palace gate followed by the beautiful slave and various members of my own family bearing the treasure  as soon as i had declared my errand i was conducted into the presence of the caliph to whom after i had made my obeisance i gave the letter and the kings gift and when he had examined them he demanded of me whether the prince of serendib was really as rich and powerful as he claimed to be  commander of the faithful i replied again bowing humbly before him i can assure your majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealth and grandeur  nothing can equal the magnificence of his palace  when he goes abroad his throne is prepared upon the back of an elephant and on either side of him ride his ministers his favourites and courtiers  on his elephants neck sits an officer his golden lance in his hand and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold at the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand  a thousand men in cloth of gold mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants go before him and as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his elephant cries aloud behold the mighty monarch the powerful and valiant sultan of the indies whose palace is covered with a hundred thousand rubies who possesses twenty thousand diamond crowns  behold a monarch greater than solomon and mihrage in all their glory  then the one who stands behind the throne answers  this king so great and powerful must die must die must die  and the first takes up the chant again all praise to him who lives for evermore  further my lord in serendib no judge is needed for to the king himself his people come for justice  the caliph was well satisfied with my report  from the kings letter said he i judged that he was a wise man it seems that he is worthy of his people and his people of him  so saying he dismissed me with rich presents and i returned in peace to my own house  when sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew hindbad having first received a hundred sequins but all returned next day to hear the story of the seventh voyage sindbad thus began    seventh and last voyage   after my sixth voyage i was quite determined that i would go to sea no more  i was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life and i had run risks enough  i only wished to end my days in peace  one day however when i was entertaining a number of my friends i was told that an officer of the caliph wished to speak to me and when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of haroun al raschid which i accordingly did  after i had saluted him the caliph said  i have sent for you sindbad because i need your services  i have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the king of serendib in return for his message of friendship  the caliphs commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt  commander of the faithful i answered i am ready to do all that your majesty commands but i humbly pray you to remember that i am utterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings i have undergone indeed i have made a vow never again to leave bagdad  with this i gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures to which he listened patiently  i admit said he that you have indeed had some extraordinary experiences but i do not see why they should hinder you from doing as i wish  you have only to go straight to serendib and give my message then you are free to come back and do as you will  but go you must my honour and dignity demand it  seeing that there was no help for it i declared myself willing to obey and the caliph delighted at having got his own way gave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage  i was soon ready to start and taking the letter and the present i embarked at balsora and sailed quickly and safely to serendib  here when i had disclosed my errand i was well received and brought into the presence of the king who greeted me with joy  welcome sindbad he cried  i have thought of you often and rejoice to see you once more  after thanking him for the honour that he did me i displayed the caliphs gifts  first a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold which cost a thousand sequins and another like to it of crimson stuff fifty robes of rich embroidery a hundred of the finest white linen from cairo suez cufa and alexandria  then more beds of different fashion and an agate vase carved with the figure of a man aiming an arrow at a lion and finally a costly table which had once belonged to king solomon  the king of serendib received with satisfaction the assurance of the caliphs friendliness toward him and now my task being accomplished i was anxious to depart but it was some time before the king would think of letting me go  at last however he dismissed me with many presents and i lost no time in going on board a ship which sailed at once and for four days all went well  on the fifth day we had the misfortune to fall in with pirates who seized our vessel killing all who resisted and making prisoners of those who were prudent enough to submit at once of whom i was one  when they had despoiled us of all we possessed they forced us to put on vile raiment and sailing to a distant island there sold us for slaves  i fell into the hands of a rich merchant who took me home with him and clothed and fed me well and after some days sent for me and questioned me as to what i could do  i answered that i was a rich merchant who had been captured by pirates and therefore i knew no trade  tell me said he can you shoot with a bow  i replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me  upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows and mounting me with him upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay far from the town  when we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped and my master said to me  this forest swarms with elephants  hide yourself in this great tree and shoot at all that pass you  when you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me  so saying he gave me a supply of food and returned to the town and i perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch  that night i saw nothing but just after sunrise the next morning a large herd of elephants came crashing and trampling by  i lost no time in letting fly several arrows and at last one of the great animals fell to the ground dead and the others retreated leaving me free to come down from my hiding place and run back to tell my master of my success for which i was praised and regaled with good things  then we went back to the forest together and dug a mighty trench in which we buried the elephant i had killed in order that when it became a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusks  for two months i hunted thus and no day passed without my securing an elephant  of course i did not always station myself in the same tree but sometimes in one place sometimes in another  one morning as i watched the coming of the elephants i was surprised to see that instead of passing the tree i was in as they usually did they paused and completely surrounded it trumpeting horribly and shaking the very ground with their heavy tread and when i saw that their eyes were fixed upon me i was terrified and my arrows dropped from my trembling hand  i had indeed good reason for my terror when an instant later the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches  i thought now that my last hour was surely come but the huge creature picking me up gently enough set me upon its back where i clung more dead than alive and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest  it seemed to me a long time before i was once more set upon my feet by the elephant and i stood as if in a dream watching the herd which turned and trampled off in another direction and were soon hidden in the dense underwood  then recovering myself i looked about me and found that i was standing upon the side of a great hill strewn as far as i could see on either hand with bones and tusks of elephants  this then must be the elephants burying place i said to myself and they must have brought me here that i might cease to persecute them seeing that i want nothing but their tusks and here lie more than i could carry away in a lifetime  whereupon i turned and made for the city as fast as i could go not seeing a single elephant by the way which convinced me that they had retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open to the ivory hill and i did not know how sufficiently to admire their sagacity  after a day and a night i reached my masters house and was received by him with joyful surprise  ah poor sindbad he cried i was wondering what could have become of you  when i went to the forest i found the tree newly uprooted and the arrows lying beside it and i feared i should never see you again pray tell me how you escaped death  i soon satisfied his curiosity and the next day we went together to the ivory hill and he was overjoyed to find that i had told him nothing but the truth  when we had loaded our elephant with as many tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city he said  my brothersince i can no longer treat as a slave one who has enriched me thustake your liberty and may heaven prosper you  i will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have killed numbers of our slaves every year  no matter what good advice we gave them they were caught sooner or later  you alone have escaped the wiles of these animals therefore you must be under the special protection of heaven  now through you the whole town will be enriched without further loss of life therefore you shall not only receive your liberty but i will also bestow a fortune upon you  to which i replied master i thank you and wish you all prosperity for myself i only ask liberty to return to my own country  it is well he answered the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships hither then i will send you on your way with somewhat to pay your passage  so i stayed with him till the time of the monsoon and every day we added to our store of ivory till all his warehouses were overflowing with it  by this time the other merchants knew the secret but there was enough and to spare for all  when the ships at last arrived my master himself chose the one in which i was to sail and put on board for me a great store of choice provisions also ivory in abundance and all the costliest curiosities of the country for which i could not thank him enough and so we parted  i left the ship at the first port we came to not feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had happened to me by reason of it and having disposed of my ivory for much gold and bought many rare and costly presents i loaded my pack animals and joined a caravan of merchants  our journey was long and tedious but i bore it patiently reflecting that at least i had not to fear tempests nor pirates nor serpents nor any of the other perils from which i had suffered before and at length we reached bagdad  my first care was to present myself before the caliph and give him an account of my embassy  he assured me that my long absence had disquieted him much but he had nevertheless hoped for the best  as to my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement declaring that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness been well known to him  by his orders this story and the others i had told him were written by his scribes in letters of gold and laid up among his treasures  i took my leave of him well satisfied with the honours and rewards he bestowed upon me and since that time i have rested from my labours and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends  thus sindbad ended the story of his seventh and last voyage and turning to hindbad he added  well my friend and what do you think now  have you ever heard of anyone who has suffered more or had more narrow escapes than i have is it not just that i should now enjoy a life of ease and tranquillity  hindbad drew near and kissing his hand respectfully replied sir you have indeed known fearful perils my troubles have been nothing compared to yours  moreover the generous use you make of your wealth proves that you deserve it  may you live long and happily in the enjoyment in it  sindbad then gave him a hundred sequins and henceforward counted him among his friends also he caused him to give up his profession as a porter and to eat daily at his table that he might all his life remember sindbad the sailor    the little hunchback   in the kingdom of kashgar which is as everybody knows situated on the frontiers of great tartary there lived long ago a tailor and his wife who loved each other very much  one day when the tailor was hard at work a little hunchback came and sat at the entrance of the shop and began to sing and play his tambourine  the tailor was amused with the antics of the fellow and thought he would take him home to divert his wife  the hunchback having agreed to his proposal the tailor closed his shop and they set off together  when they reached the house they found the table ready laid for supper and in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a beautiful fish which the tailors wife had cooked with her own hands  but unluckily the hunchback happened to swallow a large bone and in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him died of suffocation in an instant  besides being very sorry for the poor man the tailor and his wife were very much frightened on their own account for if the police came to hear of it the worthy couple ran the risk of being thrown into prison for wilful murder  in order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both set about inventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one else and at last they made up their minds that they could do no better than select a jewish doctor who lived close by as the author of the crime  so the tailor picked up the hunchback by his head while his wife took his feet and carried him to the doctors house  then they knocked at the door which opened straight on to a steep staircase  a servant soon appeared feeling her way down the dark staircase and inquired what they wanted  tell your master said the tailor that we have brought a very sick man for him to cure and he added holding out some money give him this in advance so that he may not feel he is wasting his time the servant remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor and the moment she was out of sight the tailor and his wife carried the body swiftly after her propped it up at the top of the staircase and ran home as fast as their legs could carry them  now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient for he was young and had not many of them that he was transported with joy  get a light he called to the servant and follow me as fast as you can and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase  there he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback and without knowing what it was gave it such a kick that it rolled right to the bottom and very nearly dragged the doctor after it  a light a light he cried again and when it was brought and he saw what he had done he was almost beside himself with terror  holy moses he exclaimed why did i not wait for the light  i have killed the sick man whom they brought me and if the sacred ass of esdras does not come to my aid i am lost  it will not be long before i am led to jail as a murderer  agitated though he was and with reason the doctor did not forget to shut the house door lest some passersby might chance to see what had happened  he then took up the corpse and carried it into his wifes room nearly driving her crazy with fright  it is all over with us she wailed if we cannot find some means of getting the body out of the house  once let the sun rise and we can hide it no longer  how were you driven to commit such a terrible crime  never mind that returned the doctor the thing is to find a way out of it  for a long while the doctor and his wife continued to turn over in their minds a way of escape but could not find any that seemed good enough  at last the doctor gave it up altogether and resigned himself to bear the penalty of his misfortune  but his wife who had twice his brains suddenly exclaimed i have thought of something  let us carry the body on the roof of the house and lower it down the chimney of our neighbour the mussulman now this mussulman was employed by the sultan and furnished his table with oil and butter  part of his house was occupied by a great storeroom where rats and mice held high revel  the doctor jumped at his wifes plan and they took up the hunchback and passing cords under his armpits they let him down into the purveyors bedroom so gently that he really seemed to be leaning against the wall  when they felt he was touching the ground they drew up the cords and left him  scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyor entered his room  he had spent the evening at a wedding feast and had a lantern in his hand  in the dim light it cast he was astonished to see a man standing in his chimney but being naturally courageous he seized a stick and made straight for the supposed thief  ah he cried so it is you and not the rats and mice who steal my butter  ill take care that you dont want to come back  so saying he struck him several hard blows  the corpse fell on the floor but the man only redoubled his blows till at length it occurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and make no resistance  then finding he was quite dead a cold fear took possession of him  wretch that i am said he i have murdered a man  ah my revenge has gone too far  without the help of allah i am undone  cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin and already he felt the rope round his neck  but when he had got over the first shock he began to think of some way out of the difficulty and seizing the hunchback in his arms he carried him out into the street and leaning him against the wall of a shop he stole back to his own house without once looking behind him  a few minutes before the sun rose a rich christian merchant who supplied the palace with all sorts of necessaries left his house after a night of feasting to go to the bath  though he was very drunk he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at hand and that all good mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer  so he hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his way to the mosque who seeing his condition would send him to prison as a drunkard  in his haste he jostled against the hunchback who fell heavily upon him and the merchant thinking he was being attacked by a thief knocked him down with one blow of his fist  he then called loudly for help beating the fallen man all the while  the chief policeman of the quarter came running up and found a christian illtreating a mussulman  what are you doing he asked indignantly  he tried to rob me replied the merchant and very nearly choked me  well you have had your revenge said the man catching hold of his arm  come be off with you  as he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him up but the hunchback never moved  oho he went on looking closer so this is the way a christian has the impudence to treat a mussulman and seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he took him to the inspector of police who threw him into prison till the judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his case  all this brought the merchant to his senses but the more he thought of it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have died merely from the blows he had received  the merchant was still pondering on this subject when he was summoned before the chief of police and questioned about his crime which he could not deny  as the hunchback was one of the sultans private jesters the chief of police resolved to defer sentence of death until he had consulted his master  he went to the palace to demand an audience and told his story to the sultan who only answered  there is no pardon for a christian who kills a mussulman  do your duty  so the chief of police ordered a gallows to be erected and sent criers to proclaim in every street in the city that a christian was to be hanged that day for having killed a mussulman  when all was ready the merchant was brought from prison and led to the foot of the gallows  the executioner knotted the cord firmly round the unfortunate mans neck and was just about to swing him into the air when the sultans purveyor dashed through the crowd and cried panting to the hangman  stop stop dont be in such a hurry  it was not he who did the murder it was i  the chief of police who was present to see that everything was in order put several questions to the purveyor who told him the whole story of the death of the hunchback and how he had carried the body to the place where it had been found by the christian merchant  you are going he said to the chief of police to kill an innocent man for it is impossible that he should have murdered a creature who was dead already  it is bad enough for me to have slain a mussulman without having it on my conscience that a christian who is guiltless should suffer through my fault  now the purveyors speech had been made in a loud voice and was heard by all the crowd and even if he had wished it the chief of police could not have escaped setting the merchant free  loose the cords from the christians neck he commanded turning to the executioner and hang this man in his place seeing that by his own confession he is the murderer  the hangman did as he was bid and was tying the cord firmly when he was stopped by the voice of the jewish doctor beseeching him to pause for he had something very important to say  when he had fought his way through the crowd and reached the chief of police  worshipful sir he began this mussulman whom you desire to hang is unworthy of death i alone am guilty  last night a man and a woman who were strangers to me knocked at my door bringing with them a patient for me to cure  the servant opened it but having no light was hardly able to make out their faces though she readily agreed to wake me and to hand me the fee for my services  while she was telling me her story they seem to have carried the sick man to the top of the staircase and then left him there  i jumped up in a hurry without waiting for a lantern and in the darkness i fell against something which tumbled headlong down the stairs and never stopped till it reached the bottom when i examined the body i found it was quite dead and the corpse was that of a hunchback mussulman  terrified at what we had done my wife and i took the body on the roof and let it down the chimney of our neighbour the purveyor whom you were just about to hang  the purveyor finding him in his room naturally thought he was a thief and struck him such a blow that the man fell down and lay motionless on the floor  stooping to examine him and finding him stone dead the purveyor supposed that the man had died from the blow he had received but of course this was a mistake as you will see from my account and i only am the murderer and although i am innocent of any wish to commit a crime i must suffer for it all the same or else have the blood of two musselmans on my conscience  therefore send away this man i pray you and let me take his place as it is i who am guilty  on hearing the declaration of the jewish doctor the chief of police commanded that he should be led to the gallows and the sultans purveyor go free  the cord was placed round the jews neck and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the voice of the tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause one moment and to listen to what he had to say  oh my lord he cried turning to the chief of police how nearly have you caused the death of three innocent people  but if you will only have the patience to listen to my tale you shall know who is the real culprit  if some one has to suffer it must be me  yesterday at dusk i was working in my shop with a light heart when the little hunchback who was more than half drunk came and sat in the doorway he sang me several songs and then i invited him to finish the evening at my house  he accepted my invitation and we went away together  at supper i helped him to a slice of fish but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes  we felt deeply sorry for his death but fearing lest we should be held responsible we carried the corpse to the house of the jewish doctor  i knocked and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fast as possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure and in order to hasten his movements i placed a piece of money in her hand as the doctors fee  directly she had disappeared i dragged the body to the top of the stairs and then hurried away with my wife back to our house  in descending the stairs the doctor accidentally knocked over the corpse and finding him dead believed that he himself was the murderer  but now you know the truth set him free and let me die in his stead  the chief of police and the crowd of spectators were lost in astonishment at the strange events to which the death of the hunchback had given rise  loosen the jewish doctor said he to the hangman and string up the tailor instead since he has made confession of his crime  really one cannot deny that this is a very singular story and it deserves to be written in letters of gold  the executioner speedily untied the knots which confined the doctor and was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor when the sultan of kashgar who had missed his jester happened to make inquiry of his officers as to what had become of him  sire replied they the hunchback having drunk more than was good for him escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about the town where this morning he was found dead  a man was arrested for having caused his death and held in custody till a gallows was erected  at the moment that he was about to suffer punishment first one man arrived and then another each accusing themselves of the murder and this went on for a long time and at the present instant the chief of police is engaged in questioning a man who declares that he alone is the true assassin  the sultan of kashgar no sooner heard these words than he ordered an usher to go to the chief of police and to bring all the persons concerned in the hunchbacks death together with the corpse that he wished to see once again  the usher hastened on his errand but was only just in time for the tailor was positively swinging in the air when his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd commanding the hangman to cut down the body  the hangman recognising the usher as one of the kings servants cut down the tailor and the usher seeing the man was safe sought the chief of police and gave him the sultans message  accordingly the chief of police at once set out for the palace taking with him the tailor the doctor the purveyor and the merchant who bore the dead hunchback on their shoulders  when the procession reached the palace the chief of police prostrated himself at the feet of the sultan and related all that he knew of the matter  the sultan was so much struck by the circumstances that he ordered his private historian to write down an exact account of what had passed so that in the years to come the miraculous escape of the four men who had thought themselves murderers might never be forgotten  the sultan asked everybody concerned in the hunchbacks affair to tell him their stories  among others was a prating barber whose tale of one of his brothers follows    the story of the barbers fifth brother   as long as our father lived alnaschar was very idle  instead of working for his bread he was not ashamed to ask for it every evening and to support himself next day on what he had received the night before  when our father died worn out by age he only left seven hundred silver drachmas to be divided amongst us which made one hundred for each son  alnaschar who had never possessed so much money in his life was quite puzzled to know what to do with it  after reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided to lay it out on glasses bottles and things of that sort which he would buy from a wholesale merchant  having bought his stock he next proceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position where he sat down at the open door his wares being piled up in an uncovered basket in front of him waiting for a customer among the passersby  in this attitude he remained seated his eyes fixed on the basket but his thoughts far away  unknown to himself he began to talk out loud and a tailor whose shop was next door to his heard quite plainly what he was saying  this basket said alnaschar to himself has cost me a hundred drachmasall that i possess in the world  now in selling the contents piece by piece i shall turn two hundred and these hundreds i shall again lay out in glass which will produce four hundred  by this means i shall in course of time make four thousand drachmas which will easily double themselves  when i have got ten thousand i will give up the glass trade and become a jeweller and devote all my time to trading in pearls diamonds and other precious stones  at last having all the wealth that heart can desire i will buy a beautiful country house with horses and slaves and then i will lead a merry life and entertain my friends  at my feasts i will send for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to amuse my guests  in spite of my riches i shall not however give up trade till i have amassed a capital of a hundred thousand drachmas when having become a man of much consideration i shall request the hand of the grandvizirs daughter taking care to inform the worthy father that i have heard favourable reports of her beauty and wit and that i will pay down on our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces  should the vizir refuse my proposal which after all is hardly to be expected i will seize him by the beard and drag him to my house  when i shall have married his daughter i will give her ten of the best eunuchs that can be found for her service  then i shall put on my most gorgeous robes and mounted on a horse with a saddle of fine gold and its trappings blazing with diamonds followed by a train of slaves i shall present myself at the house of the grandvizir the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as i pass along  at the foot of the grandvizirs staircase i shall dismount and while my servants stand in a row to right and left i shall ascend the stairs at the head of which the grandvizir will be waiting to receive me  he will then embrace me as his soninlaw and giving me his seat will place himself below me  this being done as i have every reason to expect two of my servants will enter each bearing a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold  one of these i shall present to him saying here are the thousand gold pieces that i offered for your daughters hand and here i shall continue holding out the second purse are another thousand to show you that i am a man who is better than his word after hearing of such generosity the world will talk of nothing else  i shall return home with the same pomp as i set out and my wife will send an officer to compliment me on my visit to her father and i shall confer on the officer the honour of a rich dress and a handsome gift should she send one to me i shall refuse it and dismiss the bearer  i shall never allow my wife to leave her rooms on any pretext whatever without my permission and my visits to her will be marked by all the ceremony calculated to inspire respect  no establishment will be better ordered than mine and i shall take care always to be dressed in a manner suitable to my position  in the evening when we retire to our apartments i shall sit in the place of honour where i shall assume a grand demeanour and speak little gazing straight before me and when my wife lovely as the full moon stands humbly in front of my chair i shall pretend not to see her  then her women will say to me respected lord and master your wife and slave is before you waiting to be noticed  she is mortified that you never deign to look her way she is tired of standing so long  beg her we pray you to be seated of course i shall give no signs of even hearing this speech which will vex them mightily  they will throw themselves at my feet with lamentations and at length i will raise my head and throw a careless glance at her then i shall go back to my former attitude  the women will think that i am displeased at my wifes dress and will lead her away to put on a finer one and i on my side shall replace the one i am wearing with another yet more splendid  they will then return to the charge but this time it will take much longer before they persuade me even to look at my wife  it is as well to begin on my weddingday as i mean to go on for the rest of our lives  the next day she will complain to her mother of the way she has been treated which will fill my heart with joy  her mother will come to seek me and kissing my hands with respect will say my lord for she could not dare to risk my anger by using the familiar title of soninlaw my lord do not i implore you refuse to look upon my daughter or to approach her  she only lives to please you and loves you with all her soul but i shall pay no more heed to my motherinlaws words than i did to those of the women  again she will beseech me to listen to her entreaties throwing herself this time at my feet but all to no purpose  then putting a glass of wine into my wifes hand she will say to her there present that to him yourself he cannot have the cruelty to reject anything offered by so beautiful a hand and my wife will take it and offer it to me tremblingly with tears in her eyes but i shall look in the other direction  this will cause her to weep still more and she will hold out the glass crying adorable husband never shall i cease my prayers till you have done me the favour to drink  sick of her importunities these words will goad me to fury  i shall dart an angry look at her and give her a sharp blow on the cheek at the same time giving her a kick so violent that she will stagger across the room and fall on to the sofa  my brother pursued the barber was so much absorbed in his dreams that he actually did give a kick with his foot which unluckily hit the basket of glass  it fell into the street and was instantly broken into a thousand pieces  his neighbour the tailor who had been listening to his visions broke into a loud fit of laughter as he saw this sight  wretched man he cried you ought to die of shame at behaving so to a young wife who has done nothing to you  you must be a brute for her tears and prayers not to touch your heart  if i were the grandvizir i would order you a hundred blows from a bullock whip and would have you led round the town accompanied by a herald who should proclaim your crimes  the accident so fatal to all his profits had restored my brother to his senses and seeing that the mischief had been caused by his own insufferable pride he rent his clothes and tore his hair and lamented himself so loudly that the passersby stopped to listen  it was a friday so these were more numerous than usual  some pitied alnaschar others only laughed at him but the vanity which had gone to his head had disappeared with his basket of glass and he was loudly bewailing his folly when a lady evidently a person of consideration rode by on a mule  she stopped and inquired what was the matter and why the man wept  they told her that he was a poor man who had laid out all his money on this basket of glass which was now broken  on hearing the cause of these loud wails the lady turned to her attendant and said to him give him whatever you have got with you  the man obeyed and placed in my brothers hands a purse containing five hundred pieces of gold  alnaschar almost died of joy on receiving it  he blessed the lady a thousand times and shutting up his shop where he had no longer anything to do he returned home  he was still absorbed in contemplating his good fortune when a knock came to his door and on opening it he found an old woman standing outside  my son she said i have a favour to ask of you  it is the hour of prayer and i have not yet washed myself  let me i beg you enter your house and give me water  my brother although the old woman was a stranger to him did not hesitate to do as she wished  he gave her a vessel of water and then went back to his place and his thoughts and with his mind busy over his last adventure he put his gold into a long and narrow purse which he could easily carry in his belt  during this time the old woman was busy over her prayers and when she had finished she came and prostrated herself twice before my brother and then rising called down endless blessings on his head  observing her shabby clothes my brother thought that her gratitude was in reality a hint that he should give her some money to buy some new ones so he held out two pieces of gold  the old woman started back in surprise as if she had received an insult  good heavens she exclaimed what is the meaning of this is it possible that you take me my lord for one of those miserable creatures who force their way into houses to beg for alms  take back your money  i am thankful to say i do not need it for i belong to a beautiful lady who is very rich and gives me everything i want  my brother was not clever enough to detect that the old woman had merely refused the two pieces of money he had offered her in order to get more but he inquired if she could procure him the pleasure of seeing this lady  willingly she replied and she will be charmed to marry you and to make you the master of all her wealth  so pick up your money and follow me  delighted at the thought that he had found so easily both a fortune and a beautiful wife my brother asked no more questions but concealing his purse with the money the lady had given him in the folds of his dress he set out joyfully with his guide  they walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at a large house where she knocked  the door was opened by a young greek slave and the old woman led my brother across a wellpaved court into a wellfurnished hall  here she left him to inform her mistress of his presence and as the day was hot he flung himself on a pile of cushions and took off his heavy turban  in a few minutes there entered a lady and my brother perceived at the first glance that she was even more beautiful and more richly dressed than he had expected  he rose from his seat but the lady signed to him to sit down again and placed herself beside him  after the usual compliments had passed between them she said we are not comfortable here let us go into another room and passing into a smaller chamber apparently communicating with no other she continued to talk to him for some time  then rising hastily she left him saying stay where you are i will come back in a moment  he waited as he was told but instead of the lady there entered a huge black slave with a sword in his hand  approaching my brother with an angry countenance he exclaimed what business have you here his voice and manner were so terrific that alnaschar had not strength to reply and allowed his gold to be taken from him and even sabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any resistance  as soon as he was let go he sank on the ground powerless to move though he still had possession of his senses  thinking he was dead the black ordered the greek slave to bring him some salt and between them they rubbed it into his wounds thus giving him acute agony though he had the presence of mind to give no sign of life  they then left him and their place was taken by the old woman who dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down into a vault filled with the bodies of murdered men  at first the violence of his fall caused him to lose consciousness but luckily the salt which had been rubbed into his wounds had by its smarting preserved his life and little by little he regained his strength  at the end of two days he lifted the trapdoor during the night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak when he saw the old woman leave the house in search of more prey  luckily she did not observe him and when she was out of sight he stole from this nest of assassins and took refuge in my house  i dressed his wounds and tended him carefully and when a month had passed he was as well as ever  his one thought was how to be revenged on that wicked old hag and for this purpose he had a purse made large enough to contain five hundred gold pieces but filled it instead with bits of glass  this he tied round him with his sash and disguising himself as an old woman he took a sabre which he hid under his dress  one morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met his old enemy prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy  he went up to her and imitating the voice of a woman he said do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me  i have just come from persia and have brought with me five hundred gold pieces and i am anxious to see if they are the proper weight  good woman replied the old hag you could not have asked anyone better  my son is a moneychanger and if you will follow me he will weigh them for you himself  only we must be quick or he will have gone to his shop  so saying she led the way to the same house as before and the door was opened by the same greek slave  again my brother was left in the hall and the pretended son appeared under the form of the black slave  miserable crone he said to my brother get up and come with me and turned to lead the way to the place of murder  alnaschar rose too and drawing the sabre from under his dress dealt the black such a blow on his neck that his head was severed from his body  my brother picked up the head with one hand and seizing the body with the other dragged it to the vault when he threw it in and sent the head after it  the greek slave supposing that all had passed as usual shortly arrived with the basin of salt but when she beheld alnaschar with the sabre in his hand she let the basin fall and turned to fly  my brother however was too quick for her and in another instant her head was rolling from her shoulders the noise brought the old woman running to see what was the matter and he seized her before she had time to escape  wretch he cried do you know me  who are you my lord she replied trembling all over  i have never seen you before  i am he whose house you entered to offer your hypocritical prayers dont you remember now  she flung herself on her knees to implore mercy but he cut her in four pieces  there remained only the lady who was quite ignorant of all that was taking place around her  he sought her through the house and when at last he found her she nearly fainted with terror at the sight of him she begged hard for life which he was generous enough to give her but he bade her to tell him how she had got into partnership with the abominable creatures he had just put to death  i was once replied she the wife of an honest merchant and that old woman whose wickedness i did not know used occasionally to visit me  madam she said to me one day we have a grand wedding at our house today if you would do us the honour to be present i am sure you would enjoy yourself  i allowed myself to be persuaded put on my richest dress and took a purse with a hundred pieces of gold  once inside the doors i was kept by force by that dreadful black and it is now three years that i have been here to my great grief  that horrible black must have amassed great wealth remarked my brother  such wealth returned she that if you succeed in carrying it all away it will make you rich for ever  come and let us see how much there is  she led alnaschar into a chamber filled with coffers packed with gold which he gazed at with an admiration he was powerless to conceal go she said and bring men to carry them away  my brother did not wait to be told twice and hurried out into the streets where he soon collected ten men  they all came back to the house but what was his surprise to find the door open and the room with the chests of gold quite empty  the lady had been cleverer than himself and had made the best use of her time  however he tried to console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture which more than made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost  unluckily on leaving the house he forgot to lock the door and the neighbours finding the place empty informed the police who next morning arrested alnaschar as a thief  my brother tried to bribe them to let him off but far from listening to him they tied his hands and forced him to walk between them to the presence of the judge  when they had explained to the official the cause of complaint he asked alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that he had taken to his house the day before  sir replied alnaschar i am ready to tell you the whole story but give i pray you your word that i shall run no risk of punishment  that i promise said the judge  so my brother began at the beginning and related all his adventures and how he had avenged himself on those who had betrayed him  as to the furniture he entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep part to make up for the five hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from him  the judge however would say nothing about this and lost no time in sending men to fetch away all that alnaschar had taken from the house when everything had been moved and placed under his roof he ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to enter it on peril of his life fearing that if he returned he might seek justice from the caliph  alnaschar obeyed and was on his way to a neighbouring city when he fell in with a band of robbers who stripped him of his clothes and left him naked by the roadside  hearing of his plight i hurried after him to console him for his misfortunes and to dress him in my best robe  i then brought him back disguised under cover of night to my house where i have since given him all the care i bestow on my other brothers    the story of the barbers sixth brother   there now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth brother whose name was schacabac  like the rest of us he inherited a hundred silver drachmas from our father which he thought was a large fortune but through illluck he soon lost it all and was driven to beg  as he had a smooth tongue and good manners he really did very well in his new profession and he devoted himself specially to making friends with the servants in big houses so as to gain access to their masters  one day he was passing a splendid mansion with a crowd of servants lounging in the courtyard  he thought that from the appearance of the house it might yield him a rich harvest so he entered and inquired to whom it belonged  my good man where do you come from replied the servant  cant you see for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a barmecide for the barmecides were famed for their liberality and generosity  my brother hearing this asked the porters of whom there were several if they would give him alms  they did not refuse but told him politely to go in and speak to the master himself  my brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building which was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartments of the barmecide  at last in a room richly decorated with paintings he saw an old man with a long white beard sitting on a sofa who received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened to make his petition  my lord he said you behold in me a poor man who only lives by the help of persons as rich and as generous as you  before he could proceed further he was stopped by the astonishment shown by the barmecide  is it possible he cried that while i am in bagdad a man like you should be starving  that is a state of things that must at once be put an end to  never shall it be said that i have abandoned you and i am sure that you on your part will never abandon me  my lord answered my brother i swear that i have not broken my fast this whole day  what you are dying of hunger exclaimed the barmecide  here slave bring water that we may wash our hands before meat no slave appeared but my brother remarked that the barmecide did not fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them  then he said to my brother why dont you wash your hands too and schacabac supposing that it was a joke on the part of the barmecide though he could see none himself drew near and imitated his motion  when the barmecide had done rubbing his hands he raised his voice and cried set food before us at once we are very hungry no food was brought but the barmecide pretended to help himself from a dish and carry a morsel to his mouth saying as he did so eat my friend eat i entreat  help yourself as freely as if you were at home  for a starving man you seem to have a very small appetite  excuse me my lord replied schacabac imitating his gestures as before i really am not losing time and i do full justice to the repast  how do you like this bread asked the barmecide  i find it particularly good myself  oh my lord answered my brother who beheld neither meat nor bread never have i tasted anything so delicious  eat as much as you want said the barmecide  i bought the woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold so that i might never be without it  after ordering a variety of dishes which never came to be placed on the table and discussing the merits of each one the barmecide declared that having dined so well they would now proceed to take their wine  to this my brother at first objected declaring that it was forbidden but on the barmecide insisting that it was out of the question that he should drink by himself he consented to take a little  the barmecide however pretended to fill their glasses so often that my brother feigned that the wine had gone into his head and struck the barmecide such a blow on the head that he fell to the ground  indeed he raised his hand to strike him a second time when the barmecide cried out that he was mad upon which my brother controlled himself and apologised and protested that it was all the fault of the wine he had drunk  at this the barmecide instead of being angry began to laugh and embraced him heartily  i have long been seeking he exclaimed a man of your description and henceforth my house shall be yours  you have had the good grace to fall in with my humour and to pretend to eat and to drink when nothing was there now you shall be rewarded by a really good supper  then he clapped his hands and all the dishes were brought that they had tasted in imagination before and during the repast slaves sang and played on various instruments  all the while schacabac was treated by the barmecide as a familiar friend and dressed in a garment out of his own wardrobe  twenty years passed by and my brother was still living with the barmecide looking after his house and managing his affairs  at the end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs so all his possessions went to the prince  they even despoiled my brother of those that rightly belonged to him and he now as poor as he had ever been in his life decided to cast in his lot with a caravan of pilgrims who were on their way to mecca  unluckily the caravan was attacked and pillaged by the bedouins and the pilgrims were taken prisoners my brother became the slave of a man who beat him daily hoping to drive him to offer a ransom although as schacabac pointed out it was quite useless trouble as his relations were as poor as himself  at length the bedouin grew tired of tormenting and sent him on a camel to the top of a high barren mountain where he left him to take his chance  a passing caravan on its way to bagdad told me where he was to be found and i hurried to his rescue and brought him in a deplorable condition back to the town  thiscontinued the barberis the tale i related to the caliph who when i had finished burst into fits of laughter  well were you called the silent said he no name was ever better deserved  but for reasons of my own which it is not necessary to mention i desire you to leave the town and never to come back  i had of course no choice but to obey and travelled about for several years until i heard of the death of the caliph when i hastily returned to bagdad only to find that all my brothers were dead  it was at this time that i rendered to the young cripple the important service of which you have heard and for which as you know he showed such profound ingratitude that he preferred rather to leave bagdad than to run the risk of seeing me  i sought him long from place to place but it was only today when i expected it least that i came across him as much irritated with me as ever  so saying the tailor went on to relate the story of the lame man and the barber which has already been told  when the barber he continued had finished his tale we came to the conclusion that the young man had been right when he had accused him of being a great chatterbox however we wished to keep him with us and share our feast and we remained at table till the hour of afternoon prayer  then the company broke up and i went back to work in my shop  it was during this interval that the little hunchback half drunk already presented himself before me singing and playing on his drum i took him home to amuse my wife and she invited him to supper while eating some fish a bone got into his throat and in spite of all we could do he died shortly  it was all so sudden that we lost our heads and in order to divert suspicion from ourselves we carried the body to the house of a jewish physician  he placed it in the chamber of the purveyor and the purveyor propped it up in the street where it was thought to have been killed by the merchant  this sire is the story which i was obliged to tell to satisfy your highness  it is now for you to say if we deserve mercy or punishment life or death  the sultan of kashgar listened with an air of pleasure which filled the tailor and his friends with hope  i must confess he exclaimed that i am much more interested in the stories of the barber and his brothers and of the lame man than in that of my own jester  but before i allow you all four to return to your own homes and have the corpse of the hunchback properly buried i should like to see this barber who has earned your pardon  and as he is in this town let an usher go with you at once in search of him  the usher and the tailor soon returned bringing with them an old man who must have been at least ninety years of age  o silent one said the sultan i am told that you know many strange stories  will you tell some of them to me  never mind my stories for the present replied the barber but will your highness graciously be pleased to explain why this jew this christian and this mussulman as well as this dead body are all here  what business is that of yours asked the sultan with a smile but seeing that the barber had some reasons for his question he commanded that the tale of the hunchback should be told him  it is certainly most surprising cried he when he had heard it all but i should like to examine the body  he then knelt down and took the head on his knees looking at it attentively  suddenly he burst into such loud laughter that he fell right backwards and when he had recovered himself enough to speak he turned to the sultan  the man is no more dead than i am he said watch me  as he spoke he drew a small case of medicines from his pocket and rubbed the neck of the hunchback with some ointment made of balsam  next he opened the dead mans mouth and by the help of a pair of pincers drew the bone from his throat  at this the hunchback sneezed stretched himself and opened his eyes  the sultan and all those who saw this operation did not know which to admire most the constitution of the hunchback who had apparently been dead for a whole night and most of one day or the skill of the barber whom everyone now began to look upon as a great man  his highness desired that the history of the hunchback should be written down and placed in the archives beside that of the barber so that they might be associated in peoples minds to the end of time  and he did not stop there for in order to wipe out the memory of what they had undergone he commanded that the tailor the doctor the purveyor and the merchant should each be clothed in his presence with a robe from his own wardrobe before they returned home  as for the barber he bestowed on him a large pension and kept him near his own person    the adventures of prince camaralzaman and the princess badoura   some twenty days sail from the coast of persia lies the isle of the children of khaledan  the island is divided into several provinces in each of which are large flourishing towns and the whole forms an important kingdom  it was governed in former days by a king named schahzaman who with good right considered himself one of the most peaceful prosperous and fortunate monarchs on the earth  in fact he had but one grievance which was that none of his four wives had given him an heir  this distressed him so greatly that one day he confided his grief to the grandvizir who being a wise counsellor said  such matters are indeed beyond human aid  allah alone can grant your desire and i should advise you sire to send large gifts to those holy men who spend their lives in prayer and to beg for their intercessions  who knows whether their petitions may not be answered  the king took his vizirs advice and the result of so many prayers for an heir to the throne was that a son was born to him the following year  schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings to all the mosques and religious houses and great rejoicings were celebrated in honour of the birth of the little prince who was so beautiful that he was named camaralzaman or moon of the century  prince camaralzaman was brought up with extreme care by an excellent governor and all the cleverest teachers and he did such credit to them that when he was grown up a more charming and accomplished young man was not to be found  whilst he was still a youth the king his father who loved him dearly had some thoughts of abdicating in his favour as usual he talked over his plans with his grandvizir who though he did not approve the idea would not state all his objections  sire he replied the prince is still very young for the cares of state  your majesty fears his growing idle and careless and doubtless you are right  but how would it be if he were first to marry  this would attach him to his home and your majesty might give him a share in your counsels so that he might gradually learn how to wear a crown which you can give up to him whenever you find him capable of wearing it  the vizirs advice once more struck the king as being good and he sent for his son who lost no time in obeying the summons and standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked for his commands  i have sent for you said the king to say that i wish you to marry what do you think about it  the prince was so much overcome by these words that he remained silent for some time  at length he said  sire i beg you to pardon me if i am unable to reply as you might wish  i certainly did not expect such a proposal as i am still so young and i confess that the idea of marrying is very distasteful to me  possibly i may not always be in this mind but i certainly feel that it will require some time to induce me to take the step which your majesty desires  this answer greatly distressed the king who was sincerely grieved by his objection to marriage  however he would not have recourse to extreme measures so he said  i do not wish to force you i will give you time to reflect but remember that such a step is necessary for a prince such as you who will some day be called to rule over a great kingdom  from this time prince camaralzaman was admitted to the royal council and the king showed him every mark of favour  at the end of a year the king took his son aside and said well my son have you changed your mind on the subject of marriage or do you still refuse to obey my wish  the prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the former occasion and begged his father not to press the subject adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer  this answer much distressed the king who again confided his trouble to his vizir  i have followed your advice he said but camaralzaman declines to marry and is more obstinate than ever  sire replied the vizir much is gained by patience and your majesty might regret any violence  why not wait another year and then inform the prince in the midst of the assembled council that the good of the state demands his marriage  he cannot possibly refuse again before so distinguished an assemblage and in our immediate presence  the sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once but he yielded to the vizirs arguments and decided to wait  he then visited the princes mother and after telling her of his disappointment and of the further respite he had given his son he added i know that camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me  pray speak very seriously to him on this subject and make him realize that he will most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate and that he will certainly regret the measures i shall be obliged to take to enforce my will  so the first time the sultana fatima saw her son she told him she had heard of his refusal to marry adding how distressed she felt that he should have vexed his father so much  she asked what reasons he could have for his objections to obey  madam replied the prince i make no doubt that there are as many good virtuous sweet and amiable women as there are others very much the reverse  would that all were like you  but what revolts me is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all about her  my father will ask the hand of the daughter of some neighbouring sovereign who will give his consent to our union  be she fair or frightful clever or stupid good or bad i must marry her and am left no choice in the matter  how am i to know that she will not be proud passionate contemptuous and recklessly extravagant or that her disposition will in any way suit mine  but my son urged fatima you surely do not wish to be the last of a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom  madam said the prince i have no wish to survive the king my father but should i do so i will try to reign in such a manner as may be considered worthy of my predecessors  these and similar conversations proved to the sultan how useless it was to argue with his son and the year elapsed without bringing any change in the princes ideas  at length a day came when the sultan summoned him before the council and there informed him that not only his own wishes but the good of the empire demanded his marriage and desired him to give his answer before the assembled ministers  at this camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat that the king naturally irritated at being opposed by his son in full council ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up in an old tower where he had nothing but a very little furniture a few books and a single slave to wait on him  camaralzaman pleased to be free to enjoy his books showed himself very indifferent to his sentence  when night came he washed himself performed his devotions and having read some pages of the koran lay down on a couch without putting out the light near him and was soon asleep  now there was a deep well in the tower in which prince camaralzaman was imprisoned and this well was a favourite resort of the fairy maimoune daughter of damriat chief of a legion of genii  towards midnight maimoune floated lightly up from the well intending according to her usual habit to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might prompt  the light in the princes room surprised her and without disturbing the slave who slept across the threshold she entered the room and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied  the prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet  maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth she had ever seen  what a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open she thought  what can he have done to deserve to be treated like this  she could not weary gazing at camaralzaman but at length having softly kissed his brow and each cheek she replaced the coverlet and resumed her flight through the air  as she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great wings coming towards her and shortly met one of the race of bad genii  this genie whose name was danhasch recognised maimoune with terror for he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him  he would gladly have avoided her altogether but they were so near that he must either be prepared to fight or yield to her so he at once addressed her in a conciliatory tone  good maimoune swear to me by allah to do me no harm and on my side i will promise not to injure you  accursed genie replied maimoune what harm can you do me  but i will grant your power and give the promise you ask  and now tell me what you have seen and done tonight  fair lady said danhasch you meet me at the right moment to hear something really interesting  i must tell you that i come from the furthest end of china which is one of the largest and most powerful kingdoms in the world  the present king has one only daughter who is so perfectly lovely that neither you nor i nor any other creature could find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms you must therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features joined to a brilliant and delicate complexion and an enchanting expression and even then imagination will fall short of the reality  the king her father has carefully shielded this treasure from the vulgar gaze and has taken every precaution to keep her from the sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be her husband but in order to give her variety in her confinement he has built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before  the first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal the second of bronze the third of fine steel the fourth of another and more precious species of bronze the fifth of touchstone the sixth of silver and the seventh of solid gold  they are all most sumptuously furnished whilst the gardens surrounding them are laid out with exquisite taste  in fact neither trouble nor cost has been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess  the report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide and many powerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage  the king has always received these embassies graciously but says that he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal the envoys have had to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they were gratified by their magnificent receptions  sire said the princess to her father you wish me to marry and i know you desire to please me for which i am very grateful  but indeed i have no inclination to change my state for where could i find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful and delightful surroundings  i feel that i could never be as happy with any husband as i am here and i beg you not to press one on me  at last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that the king of china felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter  he told her how important such an alliance would be and pressed her to consent  in fact he pressed her so persistingly that the princess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due to her father sire cried she angrily do not speak further of this or any other marriage or i will plunge this dagger in my breast and so escape from all these importunities  the king of china was extremely indignant with his daughter and replied you have lost your senses and you must be treated accordingly so he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her palaces and only allowed her ten old women of whom her nurse was the head to wait on her and keep her company  he next sent letters to all the kings who had sued for the princesss hand begging they would think of her no longer as she was quite insane and he desired his various envoys to make it known that anyone who could cure her should have her to wife  fair maimoune continued danhasch this is the present state of affairs  i never pass a day without going to gaze on this incomparable beauty and i am sure that if you would only accompany me you would think the sight well worth the trouble and own that you never saw such loveliness before  the fairy only answered with a peal of laughter and when at length she had control of her voice she cried oh come you are making game of me  i thought you had something really interesting to tell me instead of raving about some unknown damsel  what would you say if you could see the prince i have just been looking at and whose beauty is really transcendent  that is something worth talking about you would certainly quite lose your head  charming maimoune asked danhasch may i inquire who and what is the prince of whom you speak  know replied maimoune that he is in much the same case as your princess  the king his father wanted to force him to marry and on the princes refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an old tower where i have just seen him  i dont like to contradict a lady said danhasch but you must really permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my princess  hold your tongue cried maimoune  i repeat that is impossible  well i dont wish to seem obstinate replied danhasch the best plan to test the truth of what i say will be for you to let me take you to see the princess for yourself  there is no need for that retorted maimoune we can satisfy ourselves in another way  bring your princess here and lay her down beside my prince  we can then compare them at leisure and decide which is in the right  danhasch readily consented and after having the tower where the prince was confined pointed out to him and making a wager with maimoune as to the result of the comparison he flew off to china to fetch the princess  in an incredibly short time danhasch returned bearing the sleeping princess  maimoune led him to the princes room and the rival beauty was placed beside him  when the prince and princess lay thus side by side an animated dispute as to their respective charms arose between the fairy and the genius danhasch began by saying  now you see that my princess is more beautiful than your prince  can you doubt any longer  doubt  of course i do exclaimed maimoune  why you must be blind not to see how much my prince excels your princess  i do not deny that your princess is very handsome but only look and you must own that i am in the right  there is no need for me to look longer said danhasch my first impression will remain the same but of course charming maimoune i am ready to yield to you if you insist on it  by no means replied maimoune  i have no idea of being under any obligation to an accursed genius like you  i refer the matter to an umpire and shall expect you to submit to his verdict  danhasch readily agreed and on maimoune striking the floor with her foot it opened and a hideous humpbacked lame squinting genius with six horns on his head hands like claws emerged  as soon as he beheld maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked her commands  rise caschcasch said she  i summoned you to judge between me and danhasch  glance at that couch and say without any partiality whether you think the youth or the maiden lying there the more beautiful  caschcasch looked at the prince and princess with every token of surprise and admiration  at length having gazed long without being able to come to a decision he said  madam i must confess that i should deceive you were i to declare one to be handsomer than the other  there seems to me only one way in which to decide the matter and that is to wake one after the other and judge which of them expresses the greater admiration for the other  this advice pleased maimoune and danhasch and the fairy at once transformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling on camaralzamans throat stung him so sharply that he awoke  as he did so his eyes fell on the princess of china  surprised at finding a lady so near him he raised himself on one arm to look at her  the youth and beauty of the princess at once awoke a feeling to which his heart had as yet been a stranger and he could not restrain his delight  what loveliness  what charms  oh my heart my soul he exclaimed as he kissed her forehead her eyes and mouth in a way which would certainly have roused her had not the genies enchantments kept her asleep  how fair lady he cried you do not wake at the signs of camaralzamans love  be you who you may he is not unworthy of you  it then suddenly occurred to him that perhaps this was the bride his father had destined for him and that the king had probably had her placed in this room in order to see how far camaralzamans aversion to marriage would withstand her charms  at all events he thought i will take this ring as a remembrance of her  so saying he drew off a fine ring which the princess wore on her finger and replaced it by one of his own  after which he lay down again and was soon fast asleep  then danhasch in his turn took the form of a gnat and bit the princess on her lip  she started up and was not a little amazed at seeing a young man beside her  from surprise she soon passed to admiration and then to delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he was  why cried she was it you my father wished me to marry  how unlucky that i did not know sooner  i should not have made him so angry  but wake up wake up for i know i shall love you with all my heart  so saying she shook camaralzaman so violently that nothing but the spells of maimoune could have prevented his waking  oh cried the princess  why are you so drowsy  so saying she took his hand and noticed her own ring on his finger which made her wonder still more  but as he still remained in a profound slumber she pressed a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep too  then maimoune turning to the genie said  well are you satisfied that my prince surpasses your princess  another time pray believe me when i assert anything  then turning to caschcasch  my thanks to you and now do you and danhasch bear the princess back to her own home  the two genii hastened to obey and maimoune returned to her well  on waking next morning the first thing prince camaralzaman did was to look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night and the next to question the slave who waited on him about her  but the slave persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady and still less of how she got into the tower that the prince lost all patience and after giving him a good beating tied a rope round him and ducked him in the well till the unfortunate man cried out that he would tell everything  then the prince drew him up all dripping wet but the slave begged leave to change his clothes first and as soon as the prince consented hurried off just as he was to the palace  here he found the king talking to the grandvizir of all the anxiety his son had caused him  the slave was admitted at once and cried  alas sire  i bring sad news to your majesty  there can be no doubt that the prince has completely lost his senses  he declares that he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night and the state you see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him he then gave a minute account of all the prince had said and done  the king much moved begged the vizir to examine into this new misfortune and the latter at once went to the tower where he found the prince quietly reading a book  after the first exchange of greetings the vizir said  i feel really very angry with your slave for alarming his majesty by the news he brought him  what news asked the prince  ah replied the vizir something absurd i feel sure seeing how i find you  most likely said the prince but now that you are here i am glad of the opportunity to ask you where is the lady who slept in this room last night  the grandvizir felt beside himself at this question  prince he exclaimed how would it be possible for any man much less a woman to enter this room at night without walking over your slave on the threshold  pray consider the matter and you will realise that you have been deeply impressed by some dream  but the prince angrily insisted on knowing who and where the lady was and was not to be persuaded by all the vizirs protestations to the contrary that the plot had not been one of his making  at last losing patience he seized the vizir by the beard and loaded him with blows  stop prince cried the unhappy vizir stay and hear what i have to say  the prince whose arm was getting tired paused  i confess prince said the vizir that there is some foundation for what you say  but you know well that a minister has to carry out his masters orders  allow me to go and to take to the king any message you may choose to send  very well said the prince then go and tell him that i consent to marry the lady whom he sent or brought here last night  be quick and bring me back his answer  the vizir bowed to the ground and hastened to leave the room and tower  well asked the king as soon as he appeared and how did you find my son  alas sire was the reply the slaves report is only too true  he then gave an exact account of his interview with camaralzaman and of the princes fury when told that it was not possible for any lady to have entered his room and of the treatment he himself had received the king much distressed determined to clear up the matter himself and ordering the vizir to follow him set out to visit his son  the prince received his father with profound respect and the king making him sit beside him asked him several questions to which camaralzaman replied with much good sense  at last the king said my son pray tell me about the lady who it is said was in your room last night  sire replied the prince pray do not increase my distress in this matter but rather make me happy by giving her to me in marriage however much i may have objected to matrimony formerly the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices and i will gratefully receive her from your hands  the king was almost speechless on hearing his son but after a time assured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever about the lady in question and had not connived at her appearance  he then desired the prince to relate the whole story to him  camaralzaman did so at great length showed the ring and implored his father to help to find the bride he so ardently desired  after all you tell me remarked the king i can no longer doubt your word but how and whence the lady came or why she should have stayed so short a time i cannot imagine  the whole affair is indeed mysterious  come my dear son let us wait together for happier days  so saying the king took camaralzaman by the hand and led him back to the palace where the prince took to his bed and gave himself up to despair and the king shutting himself up with his son entirely neglected the affairs of state  the prime minister who was the only person admitted felt it his duty at last to tell the king how much the court and all the people complained of his seclusion and how bad it was for the nation  he urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely little island close by whence he could easily attend public audiences and where the charming scenery and fine air would do the invalid so much good as to enable him to bear his fathers occasional absence  the king approved the plan and as soon as the castle on the island could be prepared for their reception he and the prince arrived there schahzaman never leaving his son except for the prescribed public audiences twice a week  whilst all this was happening in the capital of schahzaman the two genii had carefully borne the princess of china back to her own palace and replaced her in bed  on waking next morning she first turned from one side to another and then finding herself alone called loudly for her women  tell me she cried where is the young man i love so dearly and who slept near me last night  princess exclaimed the nurse we cannot tell what you allude to without more explanation  why continued the princess the most charming and beautiful young man lay sleeping beside me last night  i did my utmost to wake him but in vain  your royal highness wishes to make game of us said the nurse  is it your pleasure to rise  i am quite in earnest persisted the princess and i want to know where he is  but princess expostulated the nurse we left you quite alone last night and we have seen no one enter your room since then  at this the princess lost all patience and taking the nurse by her hair she boxed her ears soundly crying out  you shall tell me you old witch or ill kill you  the nurse had no little trouble in escaping and hurried off to the queen to whom she related the whole story with tears in her eyes  you see madam she concluded that the princess must be out of her mind  if only you will come and see her you will be able to judge for yourself  the queen hurried to her daughters apartments and after tenderly embracing her asked her why she had treated her nurse so badly  madam said the princess i perceive that your majesty wishes to make game of me but i can assure you that i will never marry anyone except the charming young man whom i saw last night  you must know where he is so pray send for him  the queen was much surprised by these words but when she declared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the princess lost all respect and answered that if she were not allowed to marry as she wished she should kill herself and it was in vain that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason  the king himself came to hear the rights of the matter but the princess only persisted in her story and as a proof showed the ring on her finger  the king hardly knew what to make of it all but ended by thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever and without further argument he had her placed in still closer confinement with only her nurse to wait on her and a powerful guard to keep the door  then he assembled his council and having told them the sad state of things added  if any of you can succeed in curing the princess i will give her to him in marriage and he shall be my heir  an elderly emir present fired with the desire to possess a young and lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom offered to try the magic arts with which he was acquainted  you are welcome to try said the king but i make one condition which is that should you fail you will lose your life  the emir accepted the condition and the king led him to the princess who veiling her face remarked i am surprised sire that you should bring an unknown man into my presence  you need not be shocked said the king this is one of my emirs who asks your hand in marriage  sire replied the princess this is not the one you gave me before and whose ring i wear  permit me to say that i can accept no other  the emir who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense finding how calm and reasonable she was assured the king that he could not venture to undertake a cure but placed his head at his majestys disposal on which the justly irritated monarch promptly had it cut off  this was the first of many suitors for the princess whose inability to cure her cost them their lives  now it happened that after things had been going on in this way for some time the nurses son marzavan returned from his travels  he had been in many countries and learnt many things including astrology needless to say that one of the first things his mother told him was the sad condition of the princess his fostersister marzavan asked if she could not manage to let him see the princess without the kings knowledge  after some consideration his mother consented and even persuaded the eunuch on guard to make no objection to marzavans entering the royal apartment  the princess was delighted to see her fosterbrother again and after some conversation she confided to him all her history and the cause of her imprisonment  marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the utmost attention  when she had finished speaking he said  if what you tell me princess is indeed the case i do not despair of finding comfort for you  take patience yet a little longer  i will set out at once to explore other countries and when you hear of my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off so saying he took his leave and started next morning on his travels  marzavan journeyed from city to city and from one island and province to another and wherever he went he heard people talk of the strange story of the princess badoura as the princess of china was named  after four months he reached a large populous seaport town named torf and here he heard no more of the princess badoura but a great deal of prince camaralzaman who was reported ill and whose story sounded very similar to that of the princess badoura  marzavan was rejoiced and set out at once for prince camaralzamans residence  the ship on which he embarked had a prosperous voyage till she got within sight of the capital of king schahzaman but when just about to enter the harbour she suddenly struck on a rock and foundered within sight of the palace where the prince was living with his father and the grandvizir  marzavan who swam well threw himself into the sea and managed to land close to the palace where he was kindly received and after having a change of clothing given him was brought before the grandvizir the vizir was at once attracted by the young mans superior air and intelligent conversation and perceiving that he had gained much experience in the course of his travels he said ah how i wish you had learnt some secret which might enable you to cure a malady which has plunged this court into affliction for some time past  marzavan replied that if he knew what the illness was he might possibly be able to suggest a remedy on which the vizir related to him the whole history of prince camaralzaman  on hearing this marzavan rejoiced inwardly for he felt sure that he had at last discovered the object of the princess badouras infatuation  however he said nothing but begged to be allowed to see the prince  on entering the royal apartment the first thing which struck him was the prince himself who lay stretched out on his bed with his eyes closed  the king sat near him but without paying any regard to his presence marzavan exclaimed heavens what a striking likeness and indeed there was a good deal of resemblance between the features of camaralzaman and those of the princess of china  these words caused the prince to open his eyes with languid curiosity and marzavan seized this moment to pay him his compliments contriving at the same time to express the condition of the princess of china in terms unintelligible indeed to the sultan and his vizir but which left the prince in no doubt that his visitor could give him some welcome information  the prince begged his father to allow him the favour of a private interview with marzavan and the king was only too pleased to find his son taking an interest in anyone or anything  as soon as they were left alone marzavan told the prince the story of the princess badoura and her sufferings adding i am convinced that you alone can cure her but before starting on so long a journey you must be well and strong so do your best to recover as quickly as may be  these words produced a great effect on the prince who was so much cheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt able to get up and be dressed  the king was overjoyed at the result of marzavans interview and ordered public rejoicings in honour of the princes recovery  before long the prince was quite restored to his original state of health and as soon as he felt himself really strong he took marzavan aside and said  now is the time to perform your promise  i am so impatient to see my beloved princess once more that i am sure i shall fall ill again if we do not start soon  the one obstacle is my fathers tender care of me for as you may have noticed he cannot bear me out of his sight  prince replied marzavan i have already thought over the matter and this is what seems to me the best plan  you have not been out of doors since my arrival  ask the kings permission to go with me for two or three days hunting and when he has given leave order two good horses to be held ready for each of us  leave all the rest to me  next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making his request and the king gladly granted it on condition that only one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue after such a long illness  next morning prince camaralzaman and marzavan were off betimes attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses  they hunted a little by the way but took care to get as far from the towns as possible  at nightfall they reached an inn where they supped and slept till midnight  then marzavan awoke and roused the prince without disturbing anyone else  he begged the prince to give him the coat he had been wearing and to put on another which they had brought with them  they mounted their second horses and marzavan led one of the grooms horses by the bridle  by daybreak our travellers found themselves where four cross roads met in the middle of the forest  here marzavan begged the prince to wait for him and leading the grooms horse into a dense part of the wood he cut its throat dipped the princes coat in its blood and having rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground where the roads parted  in answer to camaralzamans inquiries as to the reason for this marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their journey was to divert attention by creating the idea of the princes death  your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief he went on but his joy at your return will be all the greater  the prince and his companion now continued their journey by land and sea and as they had brought plenty of money to defray their expenses they met with no needless delays  at length they reached the capital of china where they spent three days in a suitable lodging to recover from their fatigues  during this time marzavan had an astrologers dress prepared for the prince  they then went to the baths after which the prince put on the astrologers robe and was conducted within sight of the kings palace by marzavan who left him there and went to consult his mother the princesss nurse  meantime the prince according to marzavans instructions advanced close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud  i am an astrologer and i come to restore health to the princess badoura daughter of the high and mighty king of china on the conditions laid down by his majesty of marrying her should i succeed or of losing my life if i fail  it was some little time since anyone had presented himself to run the terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the princess and a crowd soon gathered round the prince  on perceiving his youth good looks and distinguished bearing everyone felt pity for him  what are you thinking of sir exclaimed some why expose yourself to certain death  are not the heads you see exposed on the town wall sufficient warning  for mercys sake give up this mad idea and retire whilst you can  but the prince remained firm and only repeated his cry with greater assurance to the horror of the crowd  he is resolved to die they cried may heaven have pity on him  camaralzaman now called out for the third time and at last the grandvizir himself came out and fetched him in  the prime minister led the prince to the king who was much struck by the noble air of this new adventurer and felt such pity for the fate so evidently in store for him that he tried to persuade the young man to renounce his project  but camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted in his intentions and at length the king desired the eunuch who had the guard of the princesss apartments to conduct the astrologer to her presence  the eunuch led the way through long passages and camaralzaman followed rapidly in haste to reach the object of his desires  at last they came to a large hall which was the anteroom to the princesss chamber and here camaralzaman said to the eunuch  now you shall choose  shall i cure the princess in her own presence or shall i do it from here without seeing her  the eunuch who had expressed many contemptuous doubts as they came along of the newcomers powers was much surprised and said  if you really can cure it is immaterial when you do it  your fame will be equally great  very well replied the prince  then impatient though i am to see the princess i will effect the cure where i stand the better to convince you of my power  he accordingly drew out his writing case and wrote as followsadorable princess  the enamoured camaralzaman has never forgotten the moment when contemplating your sleeping beauty he gave you his heart  as he was at that time deprived of the happiness of conversing with you he ventured to give you his ring as a token of his love and to take yours in exchange which he now encloses in this letter  should you deign to return it to him he will be the happiest of mortals if not he will cheerfully resign himself to death seeing he does so for love of you  he awaits your reply in your anteroom  having finished this note the prince carefully enclosed the ring in it without letting the eunuch see it and gave him the letter saying  take this to your mistress my friend and if on reading it and seeing its contents she is not instantly cured you may call me an impudent impostor  the eunuch at once passed into the princesss room and handing her the letter said  madam a new astrologer has arrived who declares that you will be cured as soon as you have read this letter and seen what it contains  the princess took the note and opened it with languid indifference but no sooner did she see her ring than barely glancing at the writing she rose hastily and with one bound reached the doorway and pushed back the hangings  here she and the prince recognised each other and in a moment they were locked in each others arms where they tenderly embraced wondering how they came to meet at last after so long a separation  the nurse who had hastened after her charge drew them back to the inner room where the princess restored her ring to camaralzaman  take it back she said i could not keep it without returning yours to you and i am resolved to wear that as long as i live  meantime the eunuch had hastened back to the king  sire he cried all the former doctors and astrologers were mere quacks  this man has cured the princess without even seeing her he then told all to the king who overjoyed hastened to his daughters apartments where after embracing her he placed her hand in that of the prince saying  happy stranger i keep my promise and give you my daughter to wife be you who you may  but if i am not much mistaken your condition is above what you appear to be  the prince thanked the king in the warmest and most respectful terms and added  as regards my person your majesty has rightly guessed that i am not an astrologer  it is but a disguise which i assumed in order to merit your illustrious alliance  i am myself a prince my name is camaralzaman and my father is schahzaman king of the isles of the children of khaledan  he then told his whole history including the extraordinary manner of his first seeing and loving the princess badoura  when he had finished the king exclaimed  so remarkable a story must not be lost to posterity  it shall be inscribed in the archives of my kingdom and published everywhere abroad  the wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and rejoicings marzavan was not forgotten but was given a lucrative post at court with a promise of further advancement  the prince and princess were now entirely happy and months slipped by unconsciously in the enjoyment of each others society  one night however prince camaralzaman dreamt that he saw his father lying at the point of death and saying  alas my son whom i loved so tenderly has deserted me and is now causing my death  the prince woke with such a groan as to startle the princess who asked what was the matter  ah cried the prince at this very moment my father is perhaps no more and he told his dream  the princess said but little at the time but next morning she went to the king and kissing his hand said  i have a favour to ask of your majesty and i beg you to believe that it is in no way prompted by my husband  it is that you will allow us both to visit my fatherinlaw king schahzaman  sorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his daughter he felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not refuse it and made but one condition which was that she should only spend one year at the court of king schahzaman suggesting that in future the young couple should visit their respective parents alternately  the princess brought this good news to her husband who thanked her tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection  all preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards and when all was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some days after which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter and charging the prince to take every care of her returned to his capital  the prince and princess journeyed on and at the end of a month reached a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which cast a most pleasant shade  as the heat was great camaralzaman thought it well to encamp in this cool spot  accordingly the tents were pitched and the princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving his further orders removed her girdle which she placed beside her and desiring her women to leave her lay down and was soon asleep  when the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and seeing the princess asleep he sat down near her without speaking  his eyes fell on the girdle which he took up and whilst inspecting the precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewn to the girdle and fastened by a loop  he touched it and felt something hard within curious as to what this might be he opened the pouch and found a cornelian engraved with various figures and strange characters  this cornelian must be something very precious thought he or my wife would not wear it on her person with so much care  in truth it was a talisman which the queen of china had given her daughter telling her it would ensure her happiness as long as she carried it about her  the better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the open doorway of the tent  as he stood there holding it in the open palm of his hand a bird suddenly swooped down picked the stone up in its beak and flew away with it  imagine the princes dismay at losing a thing by which his wife evidently set such store  the bird having secured its prey flew off some yards and alighted on the ground holding the talisman it its beak  prince camaralzaman advanced hoping the bird would drop it but as soon as he approached the thief fluttered on a little further still  he continued his pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone and took a longer flight than before  the prince then hoped to kill it with a stone but the more hotly he pursued the further flew the bird  in this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the entire day and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on the top of a very high tree where it could rest in safety  the prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think whether he had better return to the camp  but thought he how shall i find my way back  must i go up hill or down  i should certainly lose my way in the dark even if my strength held out  overwhelmed by hunger thirst fatigue and sleep he ended by spending the night at the foot of the tree  next morning camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again with as little success as the previous day only stopping to eat some herbs and fruit he found by the way  in this fashion he spent ten days following the bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree whilst it roosted on the topmost bough  on the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town and as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden and higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight whilst camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of the princess badoura  much cast down he entered the town which was built near the sea and had a fine harbour  he walked about the streets for a long time not knowing where to go but at length as he walked near the seashore he found a garden door open and walked in  the gardener a good old man who was at work happened to look up and seeing a stranger whom he recognised by his dress as a mussulman he told him to come in at once and to shut the door  camaralzaman did as he was bid and inquired why this precaution was taken  because said the gardener i see that you are a stranger and a mussulman and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters who hate and persecute all of our faith  it seems almost a miracle that has led you to this house and i am indeed glad that you have found a place of safety  camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter and was about to say more but the gardener interrupted him with  leave compliments alone  you are weary and must be hungry  come in eat and rest  so saying he led the prince into his cottage and after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of his arrival  camaralzaman told him all without disguise and ended by inquiring the shortest way to his fathers capital  for added he if i tried to rejoin the princess how should i find her after eleven days separation  perhaps indeed she may be no longer alive at this terrible thought he burst into tears  the gardener informed camaralzaman that they were quite a years land journey to any mahomedan country but that there was a much shorter route by sea to the ebony island from whence the isles of the children of khaledan could be easily reached and that a ship sailed once a year for the ebony island by which he might get so far as his very home  if only you had arrived a few days sooner he said you might have embarked at once  as it is you must now wait till next year but if you care to stay with me i offer you my house such as it is with all my heart  prince camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of refuge and gladly accepted the gardeners offer  he spent his days working in the garden and his nights thinking of and sighing for his beloved wife  let us now see what had become during this time of the princess badoura  on first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince near her she called her women and asked if they knew where he was and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent but had not noticed his leaving it she took up her belt and perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone  she at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back  she waited for him till evening rather impatiently and wondering what could have kept him from her so long  when night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly  in spite of her grief and anxiety however she did not lose her presence of mind but decided on a courageous though very unusual step  only the princess and her women knew of camaralzamans disappearance for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting in their tents fearing some treason should the truth be known she ordered her women not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion and proceeded to change her dress for one of her husbands to whom as has been already said she bore a strong likeness  in this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she gave orders next morning to break up the camp and continue the journey no one suspected the change  she made one of her women enter her litter whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began  after a protracted journey by land and sea the princess still under the name and disguise of prince camaralzaman arrived at the capital of the ebony island whose king was named armanos  no sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in port had on board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurried to meet the supposed prince and had him and his retinue brought to the palace where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously  after three days finding that his guest to whom he had taken a great fancy talked of continuing his journey king armanos said to him  prince i am now an old man and unfortunately i have no son to whom to leave my kingdom  it has pleased heaven to give me only one daughter who possesses such great beauty and charm that i could only give her to a prince as highly born and as accomplished as yourself instead therefore of returning to your own country take my daughter and my crown and stay with us  i shall feel that i have a worthy successor and shall cheerfully retire from the fatigues of government  the kings offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the princess badoura  she felt that it was equally impossible to confess that she had deceived him or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his heart a refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and persecution  all things considered she decided to accept and after a few moments silence said with a blush which the king attributed to modesty  sire i feel so great an obligation for the good opinion your majesty has expressed for my person and of the honour you do me that though i am quite unworthy of it i dare not refuse  but sire i can only accept such an alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with your counsels  the marriage being thus arranged the ceremony was fixed for the following day and the princess employed the intervening time in informing the officers of her suite of what had happened assuring them that the princess badoura had given her full consent to the marriage she also told her women and bade them keep her secret well  king armanos delighted with the success of his plans lost no time in assembling his court and council to whom he presented his successor and placing his future soninlaw on the throne made everyone do homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new king  at night the whole town was filled with rejoicings and with much pomp the princess haiatelnefous this was the name of the kings daughter was conducted to the palace of the princess badoura  now badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first interview with king armanos daughter and she felt the only thing to do was at once to take her into her confidence  accordingly as soon as they were alone she took haiatelnefous by the hand and said  princess i have a secret to tell you and must throw myself on your mercy  i am not prince camaralzaman but a princess like yourself and his wife and i beg you to listen to my story then i am sure you will forgive my imposture in consideration of my sufferings  she then related her whole history and at its close haiatelnefous embraced her warmly and assured her of her entire sympathy and affection  the two princesses now planned out their future action and agreed to combine to keep up the deception and to let badoura continue to play a mans part until such time as there might be news of the real camaralzaman  whilst these things were passing in the ebony island prince camaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage in the town of the idolaters  early one morning the gardener said to the prince  today is a public holiday and the people of the town not only do not work themselves but forbid others to do so  you had better therefore take a good rest whilst i go to see some friends and as the time is near for the arrival of the ship of which i told you i will make inquiries about it and try to bespeak a passage for you he then put on his best clothes and went out leaving the prince who strolled into the garden and was soon lost in thoughts of his dear wife and their sad separation  as he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his reverie by the noise two large birds were making in a tree  camaralzaman stood still and looked up and saw that the birds were fighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one fell dead to the ground whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew away  almost immediately two other larger birds who had been watching the duel flew up and alighted one at the head and the other at the feet of the dead bird  they stood there some time sadly shaking their heads and then dug up a grave with their claws in which they buried him  as soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off and ere long returned bringing with them the murderer whom they held one by a wing and the other by a leg with their beaks screaming and struggling with rage and terror  but they held tight and having brought him to his victims grave they proceeded to kill him after which they tore open his body scattered the inside and once more flew away  the prince who had watched the whole scene with much interest now drew near the spot where it happened and glancing at the dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its inside  he picked it up and what was his surprise when he recognised the princess badouras talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes  it would be impossible to describe his joy he kissed the talisman repeatedly wrapped it up and carefully tied it round his arm  for the first time since his separation from the princess he had a good night and next morning he was up at daybreak and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do  the gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had quite died away and camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously  as he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard  on pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze under which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps  he went down them and found himself in a roomy kind of cave in which stood fifty large bronze jars each with a cover on it  the prince uncovered one after another and found them all filled with gold dust  delighted with his discovery he left the cave replaced the slab and having finished cutting down the tree waited for the gardeners return  the gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which he was inquiring would start ere long but the exact date not being yet known he had been told to return next day for further information  he had gone therefore to inquire and came back with good news beaming in his face  my son said he rejoice and hold yourself ready to start in three days time  the ship is to set sail and i have arranged all about your passage with the captain  you could not bring me better news replied camaralzaman and in return i have something pleasant to tell you  follow me and see the good fortune which has befallen you  he then led the gardener to the cave and having shown him the treasure stored up there said how happy it made him that heaven should in this way reward his kind hosts many virtues and compensate him for the privations of many years  what do you mean asked the gardener  do you imagine that i should appropriate this treasure  it is yours and i have no right whatever to it  for the last eighty years i have dug up the ground here without discovering anything  it is clear that these riches are intended for you and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself than by an old man like me who am near my end and require nothing  this treasure comes just at the right time when you are about to return to your own country where you will make good use of it  but the prince would not hear of this suggestion and finally after much discussion they agreed to divide the gold  when this was done the gardener said  my son the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it  there are no olives in the ebony island and those imported from here fetch a high price  as you know i have a good stock of the olives which grew in this garden  now you must take fifty jars fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives  we will then have them taken on board ship when you embark  the prince took this advice and spent the rest of the day filling the fifty jars and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip from his arm and be lost again he took the precaution of putting it in one of the jars on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it when night came the jars were all ready and the prince and his host went to bed  whether in consequence of his great age or of the fatigues and excitement of the previous day i do not know but the gardener passed a very bad night  he was worse next day and by the morning of the third day was dangerously ill  at daybreak the ships captain and some of his sailors knocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger who was to embark  i am he said camaralzaman who had opened the door  the gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see you but please come in and take these jars of olives and my bag and i will follow as soon as i have taken leave of him  the sailors did as he asked and the captain before leaving charged camaralzaman to lose no time as the wind was fair and he wished to set sail at once  as soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage to bid farewell to his old friend and to thank him once more for all his kindness  but the old man was at his last gasp and had barely murmured his confession of faith when he expired  camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices so having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man up and buried him  he then locked the door gave up the key to the owner of the garden and hurried to the quay only to hear that the ship had sailed long ago after waiting three hours for him  it may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country  moreover he had once more lost the princess badouras talisman which he feared he might never see again  there was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done and to live on in the cottage  as he could not well cultivate the garden by himself he engaged a lad to help him and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport  whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toil and privation the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safely at the ebony island  as the palace of the new king or rather of the princess badoura overlooked the harbour she saw the ship entering it and asked what vessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags and was told that it was a ship from the island of the idolaters which yearly brought rich merchandise  the princess ever on the look out for any chance of news of her beloved husband went down to the harbour attended by some officers of the court and arrived just as the captain was landing  she sent for him and asked many questions as to his country voyage what passengers he had and what his vessel was laden with  the captain answered all her questions and said that his passengers consisted entirely of traders who brought rich stuffs from various countries fine muslins precious stones musk amber spices drugs olives and many other things  as soon as he mentioned olives the princess who was very partial to them exclaimed  i will take all you have on board  have them unloaded and we will make our bargain at once and tell the other merchants to let me see all their best wares before showing them to other people  sire replied the captain i have on board fifty very large pots of olives  they belong to a merchant who was left behind as in spite of waiting for him he delayed so long that i was obliged to set sail without him  never mind said the princess unload them all the same and we will arrange the price  the captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it soon returned laden with the fifty pots of olives  the princess asked what they might be worth  sire replied the captain the merchant is very poor  your majesty will not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of silver  in order to satisfy him and as he is so poor said the princess i will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you which you will be sure to remit to him  so saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the palace having the jars carried before her  when evening came the princess badoura retired to the inner part of the palace and going to the apartments of the princess haiatelnefous she had the fifty jars of olives brought to her  she opened one to let her friend taste the olives and to taste them herself but great was her surprise when on pouring some into a dish she found them all powdered with gold dust what an adventure how extraordinary she cried  then she had the other jars opened and was more and more surprised to find the olives in each jar mixed with gold dust  but when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the jars her emotion was so great that she fainted away  the princess haiatelnefous and her women hastened to restore her and as soon as she recovered consciousness she covered the precious talisman with kisses  then dismissing the attendants she said to her friend  you will have guessed my dear that it was the sight of this talisman which has moved me so deeply  this was the cause of my separation from my dear husband and now i am convinced it will be the means of our reunion  as soon as it was light next day the princess badoura sent for the captain and made further inquiries about the merchant who owned the olive jars she had bought  in reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where the young man lived and how after engaging his passage he came to be left behind  if that is the case said the princess you must set sail at once and go back for him  he is a debtor of mine and must be brought here at once or i will confiscate all your merchandise  i shall now give orders to have all the warehouses where your cargo is placed under the royal seal and they will only be opened when you have brought me the man i ask for  go at once and obey my orders  the captain had no choice but to do as he was bid so hastily provisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage  when after a rapid passage he gained sight of the island of idolaters he judged it better not to enter the harbour but casting anchor at some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with six active sailors and landed near camaralzamans cottage  the prince was not asleep and as he lay awake moaning over all the sad events which had separated him from his wife he thought he heard a knock at the garden door  he went to open it and was immediately seized by the captain and sailors who without a word of explanation forcibly bore him off to the boat which took them back to the ship without loss of time  no sooner were they on board than they weighed anchor and set sail  camaralzaman who had kept silence till then now asked the captain whom he had recognised the reason for this abduction  are you not a debtor of the king of the ebony island asked the captain  i  why i never even heard of him before and never set foot in his kingdom was the answer  well you must know better than i said the captain  you will soon see him now and meantime be content where you are and have patience  the return voyage was as prosperous as the former one and though it was night when the ship entered the harbour the captain lost no time in landing with his passenger whom he conducted to the palace where he begged an audience with the king  directly the princess badoura saw the prince she recognised him in spite of his shabby clothes  she longed to throw herself on his neck but restrained herself feeling it was better for them both that she should play her part a little longer  she therefore desired one of her officers to take care of him and to treat him well  next she ordered another officer to remove the seals from the warehouse whilst she presented the captain with a costly diamond and told him to keep the thousand pieces of gold paid for the olives as she would arrange matters with the merchant himself  she then returned to her private apartments where she told the princess haiatelnefous all that had happened as well as her plans for the future and begged her assistance which her friend readily promised  next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath and clothed in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province  he was then introduced to the council where his good looks and grand air drew the attention of all on him  princess badoura delighted to see him looking himself once more turned to the other emirs saying  my lords i introduce to you a new colleague camaralzaman whom i have known on my travels and who i can assure you you will find well deserves your regard and admiration  camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the kingwhom he never suspected of being a woman in disguiseasserting their acquaintance for he felt sure he had never seen her before  however he received all the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty and prostrating himself said  sire i cannot find words in which to thank your majesty for the great honour conferred on me  i can but assure you that i will do all in my power to prove myself worthy of it  on leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid house which had been prepared for him where he found a full establishment and wellfilled stables at his orders  on entering his study his steward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for his current expenses  he felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune and little guessed that the princess of china was the cause of it  after a few days the princess badoura promoted camaralzaman to the post of grand treasurer an office which he filled with so much integrity and benevolence as to win universal esteem  he would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it not been for that separation which he never ceased to bewail  he had no clue to the mystery of his present position for the princess out of compliment to the old king had taken his name and was generally known as king armanos the younger few people remembering that on her first arrival she went by another name  at length the princess felt that the time had come to put an end to her own and the princes suspense and having arranged all her plans with the princess haiatelnefous she informed camaralzaman that she wished his advice on some important business and to avoid being disturbed desired him to come to the palace that evening  the prince was punctual and was received in the private apartment when having ordered her attendants to withdraw the princess took from a small box the talisman and handing it to camaralzaman said  not long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman  as you are universally well informed you can perhaps tell me what is its use  camaralzaman took the talisman and holding it to the light cried with surprise sire you ask me the use of this talisman  alas hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me being the cause of my separation from the one i love best on earth  the story is so sad and strange that i am sure your majesty will be touched by it if you will permit me to tell it you  i will hear it some other time replied the princess  meanwhile i fancy it is not quite unknown to me  wait here for me  i will return shortly  so saying she retired to another room where she hastily changed her masculine attire for that of a woman and after putting on the girdle she wore the day they parted returned to camaralzaman  the prince recognised her at once and embracing her with the utmost tenderness cried ah how can i thank the king for this delightful surprise  do not expect ever to see the king again said the princess as she wiped the tears of joy from her eyes in me you see the king  let us sit down and i will tell you all about it  she then gave a full account of all her adventures since their parting and dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of the princess haiatelnefous to whose friendly assistance she owed so much  when she had done she asked to hear the princes story and in this manner they spent most of the night  next morning the princess resumed her womans clothes and as soon as she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg king armanos to come to her apartments  when the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a strange lady in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual right to enter the private apartment  seating himself he asked for the king  sire said the princess yesterday i was the king today i am only the princess of china and wife to the real prince camaralzaman son of king schahzaman and i trust that when your majesty shall have heard our story you will not condemn the innocent deception i have been obliged to practise  the king consented to listen and did so with marked surprise  at the close of her narrative the princess said sire as our religion allows a man to have more than one wife i would beg your majesty to give your daughter the princess haiatelnefous in marriage to prince camaralzaman  i gladly yield to her the precedence and title of queen in recognition of the debt of gratitude which i owe her  king armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration then turning to camaralzaman he said my son as your wife the princess badoura whom i have hitherto looked on as my soninlaw consents to share your hand and affections with my daughter i have only to ask if this marriage is agreeable to you and if you will consent to accept the crown which the princess badoura deserves to wear all her life but which she prefers to resign for love of you  sire replied camaralzaman i can refuse your majesty nothing  accordingly camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king and as duly married with all pomp to the princess haiatelnefous with whose beauty talents and affections he had every reason to be pleased  the two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together and after a time each presented king camaralzaman with a son whose births were celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing    noureddin and the fair persian   balsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph during the time of the caliph harounalraschid the king of balsora who was his cousin was called zinebi  not thinking one vizir enough for the administration of his estates he had two named khacan and saouy  khacan was kind generous and liberal and took pleasure in obliging as far as in him lay those who had business with him  throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem and praise him as he deserved  saouy was quite a different character and repelled everyone with whom he came in contact he was always gloomy and in spite of his great riches so miserly that he denied himself even the necessaries of life what made him particularly detested was the great aversion he had to khacan of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king  one day while the king amused himself talking with his two vizirs and other members of the council the conversation turned on female slaves while some declared that it sufficed for a slave to be beautiful others and khacan was among the number maintained that beauty alone was not enough but that it must be accompanied by wit wisdom modesty and if possible knowledge  the king not only declared himself to be of this opinion but charged khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions saouy who had been of the opposite side and was jealous of the honour done to khacan said sire it will be very difficult to find a slave as accomplished as your majesty desires and if she is to be found she will be cheap if she cost less than 10000 gold pieces  saouy answered the king you seem to find that a very great sum for you it may be so but not for me  and forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer who was present to send 10000 gold pieces to khacan for the purchase of the slave  as soon then as khacan returned home he sent for the dealers in female slaves and charged them directly they had found such a one as he described to inform him  they promised to do their utmost and no day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection but none was found without some defect  at length early one morning while khacan was on his way to the kings palace a dealer throwing himself in his way announced eagerly that a persian merchant arrived late the previous evening had a slave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty  khacan overjoyed at this news gave orders that the slave should be brought for his inspection on his return from the palace  the dealer appearing at the appointed hour khacan found the slave beautiful beyond his expectations and immediately gave her the name of the fair persian  being a man of great wisdom and learning he perceived in the short conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain another slave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king and therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her  sir was the answer for less than 10000 gold pieces he will not let her go he declares that what with masters for her instruction and for bodily exercises not to speak of clothing and nourishment he has already spent that sum upon her  she is in every way fit to be the slave of a king she plays every musical instrument she sings she dances she makes verses in fact there is no accomplishment in which she does not excel  khacan who was better able to judge of her merits than the dealer wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion sent for the merchant and said to him it is not for myself that i wish to buy your slave but for the king  her price however is too high  sir replied the merchant i should esteem it an honour to present her to his majesty did it become a merchant to do such a thing  i ask no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such as she is  khacan not wishing to bargain immediately had the sum counted out and given to the merchant who before withdrawing said  sir as she is destined for the king i would have you observe that she is extremely tired with the long journey and before presenting her to his majesty you would do well to keep her a fortnight in your own house and to see that a little care is bestowed upon her  the sun has tanned her complexion but when she has been two or three times to the bath and is fittingly dressed you will see how much her beauty will be increased  khacan thanked the merchant for his advice and determined to follow it  he gave the beautiful persian an apartment near to that of his wife whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for the king and to order for her the most magnificent garments  before bidding adieu to the fair persian he said to her no happiness can be greater than what i have procured for you judge for yourself you now belong to the king  i have however to warn you of one thing i have a son who though not wanting in sense is young foolish and headstrong and i charge you to keep him at a distance  the persian thanked him for his advice and promised to profit by it  noureddinfor so the vizirs son was namedwent freely in and out of his mothers apartments  he was young wellmade and agreeable and had the gift of charming all with whom he came in contact  as soon as he saw the beautiful persian though aware that she was destined for the king he let himself be carried away by her charms and determined at once to use every means in his power to retain her for himself  the persian was equally captivated by noureddin and said to herself  the vizir does me too great honour in buying me for the king  i should esteem myself very happy if he would give me to his son  noureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her beauty to talk and laugh with her and never would have left her side if his mother had not forced him  some time having elapsed on account of the long journey since the beautiful persian had been to the bath five or six days after her purchase the vizirs wife gave orders that the bath should be heated for her and that her own female slaves should attend her there and afterwards should array her in a magnificent dress that had been prepared for her  her toilet completed the beautiful persian came to present herself to the vizirs wife who hardly recognised her so greatly was her beauty increased  kissing her hand the beautiful slave said madam i do not know how you find me in this dress that you have had prepared for me your women assure me that it suits me so well that they hardly knew me  if it is the truth they tell me and not flattery it is to you i owe the transformation  my daughter answered the vizirs wife they do not flatter you  i myself hardly recognised you  the improvement is not due to the dress alone but largely to the beautifying effects of the bath  i am so struck by its results that i would try it on myself  acting forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slaves during her absence to watch over the beautiful persian and not to allow noureddin to enter should he come  she had no sooner gone than he arrived and not finding his mother in her apartment would have sought her in that of the persian  the two little slaves barred the entrance saying that his mother had given orders that he was not to be admitted  taking each by an arm he put them out of the anteroom and shut the door  then they rushed to the bath informing their mistress with shrieks and tears that noureddin had driven them away by force and gone in  this news caused great consternation to the lady who dressing herself as quickly as possible hastened to the apartment of the fair persian to find that noureddin had already gone out  much astonished to see the vizirs wife enter in tears the persian asked what misfortune had happened  what exclaimed the lady you ask me that knowing that my son noureddin has been alone with you  but madam inquired the persian what harm is there in that  how  has my husband not told you that you are destined for the king  certainly but noureddin has just been to tell me that his father has changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him  i believed him and so great is my affection for noureddin that i would willingly pass my life with him  would to heaven exclaimed the wife of the vizir that what you say were true but noureddin has deceived you and his father will sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done  so saying she wept bitterly and all her slaves wept with her  khacan entering shortly after this was much astonished to find his wife and her slaves in tears and the beautiful persian greatly perturbed  he inquired the cause but for some time no answer was forthcoming  when his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform him of what had happened his rage and mortification knew no bounds wringing his hands and rending his beard he exclaimed  wretched son thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father  the king will shed not only thy blood but mine  his wife tried to console him saying  do not torment thyself  with the sale of my jewels i will obtain 10000 gold pieces and with this sum you will buy another slave  do not suppose replied her husband that it is the loss of the money that affects me  my honour is at stake and that is more precious to me than all my wealth  you know that saouy is my mortal enemy  he will relate all this to the king and you will see the consequences that will ensue  my lord said his wife i am quite aware of saouys baseness and that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick  but how can he or any one else know what takes place in this house  even if you are suspected and the king accuses you you have only to say that after examining the slave you did not find her worthy of his majesty reassure yourself and send to the dealers saying that you are not satisfied and wish them to find you another slave  this advice appearing reasonable khacan decided to follow it but his wrath against his son did not abate  noureddin dared not appear all that day and fearing to take refuge with his usual associates in case his father should seek him there he spent the day in a secluded garden where he was not known  he did not return home till after his father had gone to bed and went out early next morning before the vizir awoke and these precautions he kept up during an entire month  his mother though knowing very well that he returned to the house every evening dare not ask her husband to pardon him  at length she took courage and said  my lord i know that a son could not act more basely towards his father than noureddin has done towards you but after all will you now pardon him  do you not consider the harm you may be doing yourself and fear that malicious people seeking the cause of your estrangement may guess the real one  madam replied the vizir what you say is very just but i cannot pardon noureddin before i have mortified him as he deserves  he will be sufficiently punished answered the lady if you do as i suggest  in the evening when he returns home lie in wait for him and pretend that you will slay him  i will come to his aid and while pointing out that you only yield his life at my supplications you can force him to take the beautiful persian on any conditions you please khacan agreed to follow this plan and everything took place as arranged  on noureddins return khacan pretended to be about to slay him but yielding to his wifes intercession said to his son  you owe your life to your mother  i pardon you on her intercession and on the conditions that you take the beautiful persian for your wife and not your slave that you never sell her nor put her away  noureddin not hoping for so great indulgence thanked his father and vowed to do as he desired  khacan was at great pains frequently to speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission he had given him but some whispers of what had actually taken place did reach saouys ears  more than a year after these events the minister took a chill leaving the bath while still heated to go out on important business  this resulted in inflammation of the lungs which rapidly increased  the vizir feeling that his end was at hand sent for noureddin and charged him with his dying breath never to part with the beautiful persian  shortly afterwards he expired leaving universal regret throughout the kingdom rich and poor alike followed him to the grave  noureddin showed every mark of the deepest grief at his fathers death and for long refused to see any one  at length a day came when one of his friends being admitted urged him strongly to be consoled and to resume his former place in society  this advice noureddin was not slow to follow and soon he formed little society of ten young men all about his own age with whom he spent all his time in continual feasting and merrymaking  sometimes the fair persian consented to appear at these festivities but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure and did not scruple to warn noureddin of the probable consequences  he however only laughed at her advice saying that his father had always kept him in too great constraint and that now he rejoiced at his newfound liberty  what added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refused to look into his accounts with his steward sending him away every time he appeared with his book  see only that i live well he said and do not disturb me about anything else  not only did noureddins friends constantly partake of his hospitality but in every way they took advantage of his generosity everything of his that they admired whether land houses baths or any other source of his revenue he immediately bestowed on them  in vain the persian protested against the wrong he did himself he continued to scatter with the same lavish hand  throughout one entire year noureddin did nothing but amuse himself and dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire  the year had barely elapsed when one day as they sat at table there came a knock at the door  the slaves having been sent away noureddin went to open it himself  one of his friends had risen at the same time but noureddin was before him and finding the intruder to be the steward he went out and closed the door  the friend curious to hear what passed between them hid himself behind the hangings and heard the following words  my lord said the steward i beg a thousand pardons for interrupting you but what i have long foreseen has taken place  nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses and all other sources of income are also at end having been transferred by you to others  if you wish me to remain in your service furnish me with the necessary funds else i must withdraw  so great was noureddins consternation that he had not a word to say in reply  the friend who had been listening behind the curtain immediately hastened to communicate the news to the rest of the company  if this is so they said we must cease to come here  noureddin reentering at that moment they plainly saw in spite of his efforts to dissemble that what they had heard was the truth  one by one they rose and each with a different excuse left the room till presently he found himself alone though little suspecting the resolution his friends had taken  then seeing the beautiful persian he confided to her the statement of the steward with many expressions of regret for his own carelessness  had i but followed your advice beautiful persian he said all this would not have happened but at least i have this consolation that i have spent my fortune in the company of friends who will not desert me in an hour of need  tomorrow i will go to them and amongst them they will lend me a sum sufficient to start in some business  accordingly next morning early noureddin went to seek his ten friends who all lived in the same street  knocking at the door of the first and chief the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall while he announced his visit to his master  noureddin he heard him exclaim quite audibly  tell him every time he calls that i am not at home the same thing happened at the second door and also at the third and so on with all the ten  noureddin much mortified recognised too late that he had confided in false friends who abandoned him in his hour of need  overwhelmed with grief he sought consolation from the beautiful persian  alas my lord she said at last you are convinced of the truth of what i foretold  there is now no other resource left but to sell your slaves and your furniture  first then he sold the slaves and subsisted for a time on the proceeds after that the furniture was sold and as much of it was valuable it sufficed for some time  finally this resource also came to an end and again he sought counsel from the beautiful persian  my lord she said i know that the late vizir your father bought me for 10000 gold pieces and though i have diminished in value since i should still fetch a large sum  do not therefore hesitate to sell me and with the money you obtain go and establish yourself in business in some distant town  charming persian answered noureddin how could i be guilty of such baseness  i would die rather than part from you whom i love better than my life  my lord she replied i am well aware of your love for me which is only equalled by mine for you but a cruel necessity obliges us to seek the only remedy  noureddin convinced at length of the truth of her words yielded and reluctantly led her to the slave market where showing her to a dealer named hagi hassan he inquired her value  taking them into a room apart hagi hassan exclaimed as soon as she had unveiled my lord is not this the slave your father bought for 10000 pieces  on learning that it was so he promised to obtain the highest possible price for her  leaving the beautiful persian shut up in the room alone he went out to seek the slave merchants announcing to them that he had found the pearl among slaves and asking them to come and put a value upon her  as soon as they saw her they agreed that less than 4000 gold pieces could not be asked  hagi hassan then closing the door upon her began to offer her for salecalling out who will bid 4000 gold pieces for the persian slave  before any of the merchants had bid saouy happened to pass that way and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty rode up to hagi hassan and desired to see her  now it was not the custom to show a slave to a private bidder but as no one dared to disobey the vizir his request was granted  as soon as saouy saw the persian he was so struck by her beauty that he immediately wished to possess her and not knowing that she belonged to noureddin he desired hagi hassan to send for the owner and to conclude the bargain at once  hagi hassan then sought noureddin and told him that his slave was going far below her value and that if saouy bought her he was capable of not paying the money  what you must do he said is to pretend that you had no real intention of selling your slave and only swore you would in a fit of anger against her  when i present her to saouy as if with your consent you must step in and with blows begin to lead her away  noureddin did as hagi hassan advised to the great wrath of saouy who riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful persian from him by force  noureddin letting her go seized saouys horse by the bridle and encouraged by the applause of the bystanders dragged him to the ground beat him severely and left him in the gutter streaming with blood  then taking the beautiful persian he returned home amidst the acclamations of the people who detested saouy so much that they would neither interfere in his behalf nor allow his slaves to protect him  covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he rose and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace where he demanded an audience of the king to whom he related what had taken place in these words  may it please your majesty i had gone to the slave market to buy myself a cook  while there i heard a slave being offered for 4000 pieces  asking to see her i found she was of incomparable beauty and was being sold by noureddin the son of your late vizir to whom your majesty will remember giving a sum of 10000 gold pieces for the purchase of a slave  this is the identical slave whom instead of bringing to your majesty he gave to his own son  since the death of his father this noureddin has run through his entire fortune has sold all his possessions and is now reduced to selling the slave  calling him to me i said  noureddin i will give you 10000 gold pieces for your slave whom i will present to the king  i will interest him at the same time in your behalf and this will be worth much more to you than what extra money you might obtain from the merchants  bad old man he exclaimed rather than sell my slave to you i would give her to a jew but noureddin i remonstrated you do not consider that in speaking thus you wrong the king to whom your father owed everything this remonstrance only irritated him the more  throwing himself on me like a madman he tore me from my horse beat me to his hearts content and left me in the state your majesty sees  so saying saouy turned aside his head and wept bitterly  the kings wrath was kindled against noureddin  he ordered the captain of the guard to take with him forty men to pillage noureddins house to rase it to the ground and to bring noureddin and the slave to him a doorkeeper named sangiar who had been a slave of khacans hearing this order given slipped out of the kings apartment and hastened to warn noureddin to take flight instantly with the beautiful persian then presenting him with forty gold pieces he disappeared before noureddin had time to thank him  as soon then as the fair persian had put on her veil they fled together and had the good fortune to get out of the town without being observed  at the mouth of the euphrates they found a ship just about to start for bagdad  they embarked and immediately the anchor was raised and they set sail  when the captain of the guard reached noureddins house he caused his soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force but no trace was to be found of noureddin and his slave nor could the neighbours give any information about them  when the king heard that they had escaped he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1000 gold pieces would be given to whoever would bring him noureddin and the slave but that on the contrary whoever hid them would be severely punished  meanwhile noureddin and the fair persian had safely reached bagdad  when the vessel had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces for their passage and went ashore  never having been in bagdad before they did not know where to seek a lodging  wandering along the banks of the tigris they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall  the gate was shut but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa on either side  here said noureddin let us pass the night and reclining on the sofas they soon fell asleep  now this garden belonged to the caliph  in the middle of it was a vast pavilion whose superb saloon had eighty windows each window having a lustre lit solely when the caliph spent the evening there  only the doorkeeper lived there an old soldier named scheih ibrahim who had strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted and never to allow any one to sit on the sofas by the door  it happened that evening that he had gone out on an errand  when he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he was about to drive them out with blows but drawing nearer he perceived that they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman and decided to awake them by gentler means noureddin on being awoke told the old man that they were strangers and merely wished to pass the night there  come with me said scheih ibrahim i will lodge you better and will show you a magnificent garden belonging to me so saying the doorkeeper led the way into the caliphs garden the beauties of which filled them with wonder and amazement  noureddin took out two gold pieces and giving them to scheih ibrahim said  i beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together being very avaricious scheih ibrahim determined to spend only the tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself  while he was gone noureddin and the persian wandered through the gardens and went up the white marble staircase of the pavilion as far as the locked door of the saloon  on the return of scheih ibrahim they begged him to open it and to allow them to enter and admire the magnificence within consenting he brought not only the key but a light and immediately unlocked the door  noureddin and the persian entering were dazzled with the magnificence they beheld  the paintings and furniture were of astonishing beauty and between each window was a silver arm holding a candle  scheih ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa and all three ate together  when they had finished eating noureddin asked the old man to bring them a bottle of wine  heaven forbid said scheih ibrahim that i should come in contact with wine  i who have four times made the pilgrimage to mecca and have renounced wine for ever  you would however do us a great service in procuring us some said noureddin  you need not touch it yourself  take the ass which is tied to the gate lead it to the nearest wineshop and ask some passerby to order two jars of wine have them put in the asss panniers and drive him before you  here are two pieces of gold for the expenses  at sight of the gold scheih ibrahim set off at once to execute the commission  on his return noureddin said  we have still need of cups to drink from and of fruit if you can procure us some scheih ibrahim disappeared again and soon returned with a table spread with cups of gold and silver and every sort of beautiful fruit  then he withdrew in spite of repeated invitations to remain  noureddin and the beautiful persian finding the wine excellent drank of it freely and while drinking they sang  both had fine voices and scheih ibrahim listened to them with great pleasurefirst from a distance then he drew nearer and finally put his head in at the door noureddin seeing him called to him to come in and keep them company at first the old man declined but was persuaded to enter the room to sit down on the edge of the sofa nearest the door and at last to draw closer and to seat himself by the beautiful persian who urged him so persistently to drink her health that at length he yielded and took the cup she offered  now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine he frequented wineshops like other people and had taken none of the precautions noureddin had proposed  having once yielded he was easily persuaded to take a second cup and a third and so on till he no longer knew what he was doing  till near midnight they continued drinking laughing and singing together  about that time the persian perceiving that the room was lit by only one miserable tallow candle asked scheih ibrahim to light some of the beautiful candles in the silver arms  light them yourself answered the old man you are younger than i but let five or six be enough  she did not stop however till she had lit all the eighty but scheih ibrahim was not conscious of this and when soon after that noureddin proposed to have some of the lustres lit he answered  you are more capable of lighting them than i but not more than three  noureddin far from contenting himself with three lit all and opened all the eighty windows  the caliph harounalraschid chancing at that moment to open a window in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden was surprised to see the pavilion brilliantly illuminated  calling the grandvizir giafar he said to him  negligent vizir look at the pavilion and tell me why it is lit up when i am not there  when the vizir saw that it was as the caliph said he trembled with fear and immediately invented an excuse  commander of the faithful he said i must tell you that four or five days ago scheih ibrahim told me that he wished to have an assembly of the ministers of his mosque and asked permission to hold it in the pavilion  i granted his request but forgot since to mention it to your majesty  giafar replied the caliph you have committed three faultsfirst in giving the permission second in not mentioning it to me and third in not investigating the matter more closely  for punishment i condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me in company of these worthy people  while i dress myself as a citizen go and disguise yourself and then come with me  when they reached the garden gate they found it open to the great indignation of the caliph  the door of the pavilion being also open he went softly upstairs and looked in at the halfclosed door of the saloon  great was his surprise to see scheih ibrahim whose sobriety he had never doubted drinking and singing with a young man and a beautiful lady  the caliph before giving way to his anger determined to watch and see who the people were and what they did  presently scheih ibrahim asked the beautiful persian if anything were wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening  if only she said i had an instrument upon which i might play  scheih ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cupboard and gave it to the persian who began to play on it singing the while with such skill and taste that the caliph was enchanted  when she ceased he went softly downstairs and said to the vizir  never have i heard a finer voice nor the lute better played  i am determined to go in and make her play to me  commander of the faithful said the vizir if scheih ibrahim recognises you he will die of fright  i should be sorry for that answered the caliph and i am going to take steps to prevent it  wait here till i return  now the caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake in his garden  there the finest fish in the tigris were to be found but fishing was strictly forbidden  it happened that night however that a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being open to go in and cast his nets  he was just about to draw them when he saw the caliph approaching  recognising him at once in spite of his disguise he threw himself at his feet imploring forgiveness  fear nothing said the caliph only rise up and draw thy nets  the fisherman did as he was told and produced five or six fine fish of which the caliph took the two largest  then he desired the fisherman to change clothes with him and in a few minutes the caliph was transformed into a fisherman even to the shoes and the turban taking the two fish in his hand he returned to the vizir who not recognising him would have sent him about his business  leaving the vizir at the foot of the stairs the caliph went up and knocked at the door of the saloon  noureddin opened it and the caliph standing on the threshold said  scheih ibrahim i am the fisher kerim  seeing that you are feasting with your friends i bring you these fish  noureddin and the persian said that when the fishes were properly cooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them  the caliph then returned to the vizir and they set to work in scheih ibrahims house to cook the fish of which they made so tempting a dish that noureddin and the fair persian ate of it with great relish  when they had finished noureddin took thirty gold pieces all that remained of what sangiar had given him and presented them to the caliph who thanking him asked as a further favour if the lady would play him one piece on the lute  the persian gladly consented and sang and played so as to delight the caliph  noureddin in the habit of giving to others whatever they admired said fisherman as she pleases you so much take her she is yours  the fair persian astounded that he should wish to part from her took her lute and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches to its music  the caliph still in the character of fisherman said to him sir i perceive that this fair lady is your slave  oblige me i beg you by relating your history  noureddin willingly granted this request and recounted everything from the purchase of the slave down to the present moment  and where do you go now asked the caliph  wherever the hand of allah leads me said noureddin  then if you will listen to me said the caliph you will immediately return to balsora  i will give you a letter to the king which will ensure you a good reception from him  it is an unheardof thing said noureddin that a fisherman should be in correspondence with a king  let not that astonish you answered the caliph we studied together and have always remained the best of friends though fortune while making him a king left me a humble fisherman  the caliph then took a sheet of paper and wrote the following letter at the top of which he put in very small characters this formula to show that he must be implicitly obeyedin the name of the most merciful god  letter of the caliph harounalraschid to the king of balsora  harounalraschid son of mahdi sends this letter to mohammed zinebi his cousin  as soon as noureddin son of the vizir khacan bearer of this letter has given it to thee and thou hast read it take off thy royal mantle put it on his shoulders and seat him in thy place without fail  farewell  the caliph then gave this letter to noureddin who immediately set off with only what little money he possessed when sangiar came to his assistance  the beautiful persian inconsolable at his departure sank on a sofa bathed in tears  when noureddin had left the room scheih ibrahim who had hitherto kept silence said  kerim for two miserable fish thou hast received a purse and a slave  i tell thee i will take the slave and as to the purse if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece if gold then i will take all and give thee what copper pieces i have in my purse  now here it must be related that when the caliph went upstairs with the plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palace and bring back four slaves bearing a change of raiment who should wait outside the pavilion till the caliph should clap his hands  still personating the fisherman the caliph answered scheih ibrahim whatever is in the purse i will share equally with you but as to the slave i will keep her for myself  if you do not agree to these conditions you shall have nothing  the old man furious at this insolence as he considered it took a cup and threw it at the caliph who easily avoided a missile from the hand of a drunken man  it hit against the wall and broke into a thousand pieces  scheih ibrahim still more enraged then went out to fetch a stick  the caliph at that moment clapped his hands and the vizir and the four slaves entering took off the fishermans dress and put on him that which they had brought  when scheih ibrahim returned a thick stick in his hand the caliph was seated on his throne and nothing remained of the fisherman but his clothes in the middle of the room  throwing himself on the ground at the caliphs feet he said  commander of the faithful your miserable slave has offended you and craves forgiveness  the caliph came down from his throne and said  rise i forgive thee then turning to the persian he said  fair lady now you know who i am learn also that i have sent noureddin to balsora to be king and as soon as all necessary preparations are made i will send you there to be queen  meanwhile i will give you an apartment in my palace where you will be treated with all honour  at this the beautiful persian took courage and the caliph was as good as his word recommending her to the care of his wife zobeida  noureddin made all haste on his journey to balsora and on his arrival there went straight to the palace of the king of whom he demanded an audience  it was immediately granted and holding the letter high above his head he forced his way through the crowd  while the king read the letter he changed colour  he would instantly have executed the caliphs order but first he showed the letter to saouy whose interests were equally at stake with his own  pretending that he wished to read it a second time saouy turned aside as if to seek a better light unperceived by anyone he tore off the formula from the top of the letter put it to his mouth and swallowed it  then turning to the king he said  your majesty has no need to obey this letter  the writing is indeed that of the caliph but the formula is absent  besides he has not sent an express with the patent without which the letter is useless leave all to me and i will take the consequences  the king not only listened to the persuasions of saouy but gave noureddin into his hands  such a severe bastinado was first administered to him that he was left more dead than alive then saouy threw him into the darkest and deepest dungeon and fed him only on bread and water  after ten days saouy determined to put an end to noureddins life but dared not without the kings authority  to gain this end he loaded several of his own slaves with rich gifts and presented himself at their head to the king saying that they were from the new king on his coronation  what said the king is that wretch still alive  go and behead him at once  i authorise you  sire said saouy i thank your majesty for the justice you do me  i would further beg as noureddin publicly affronted me that the execution might be in front of the palace and that it might be proclaimed throughout the city so that no one may be ignorant of it  the king granted these requests and the announcement caused universal grief for the memory of noureddins father was still fresh in the hearts of his people  saouy accompanied by twenty of his own slaves went to the prison to fetch noureddin whom he mounted on a wretched horse without a saddle  arrived at the palace saouy went in to the king leaving noureddin in the square hemmed in not only by saouys slaves but by the royal guard who had great difficulty in preventing the people from rushing in and rescuing noureddin  so great was the indignation against saouy that if anyone had set the example he would have been stoned on his way through the streets  saouy who witnessed the agitation of the people from the windows of the kings privy chambers called to the executioner to strike at once  the king however ordered him to delay not only was he jealous of saouys interference but he had another reason  a troop of horsemen was seen at that moment riding at full gallop towards the square  saouy suspected who they might be and urged the king to give the signal for the execution without delay but this the king refused to do till he knew who the horsemen were  now they were the vizir giafar and his suite arriving at full speed from bagdad  for several days after noureddins departure with the letter the caliph had forgotten to send the express with the patent without which the letter was useless  hearing a beautiful voice one day in the womens part of the palace uttering lamentations he was informed that it was the voice of the fair persian and suddenly calling to mind the patent he sent for giafar and ordered him to make for balsora with the utmost speedif noureddin were dead to hang saouy if he were still alive to bring him at once to bagdad along with the king and saouy  giafar rode at full speed through the square and alighted at the steps of the palace where the king came to greet him  the vizirs first question was whether noureddin were still alive  the king replied that he was and he was immediately led forth though bound hand and foot by the vizirs orders his bonds were immediately undone and saouy was tied with the same cords  next day giafar returned to bagdad bearing with him the king saouy and noureddin  when the caliph heard what treatment noureddin had received he authorised him to behead saouy with his own hands but he declined to shed the blood of his enemy who was forthwith handed over to the executioner  the caliph also desired noureddin to reign over balsora but this too he declined saying that after what had passed there he preferred never to return but to enter the service of the caliph  he became one of his most intimate courtiers and lived long in great happiness with the fair persian  as to the king the caliph contented himself with sending him back to balsora with the recommendation to be more careful in future in the choice of his vizir    aladdin and the wonderful lamp   there once lived a poor tailor who had a son called aladdin a careless idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself  this so grieved the father that he died yet in spite of his mothers tears and prayers aladdin did not mend his ways  one day when he was playing in the streets as usual a stranger asked him his age and if he were not the son of mustapha the tailor  i am sir replied aladdin but he died a long while ago  on this the stranger who was a famous african magician fell on his neck and kissed him saying  i am your uncle and knew you from your likeness to my brother  go to your mother and tell her i am coming  aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle  indeed child she said your father had a brother but i always thought he was dead  however she prepared supper and bade aladdin seek his uncle who came laden with wine and fruit  he presently fell down and kissed the place where mustapha used to sit bidding aladdins mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before as he had been forty years out of the country  he then turned to aladdin and asked him his trade at which the boy hung his head while his mother burst into tears  on learning that aladdin was idle and would learn no trade he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise  next day he bought aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took him all over the city showing him the sights and brought him home at nightfall to his mother who was overjoyed to see her son so fine  next day the magician led aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates  they sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle which he divided between them they then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories and led him on in spite of himself  at last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley  we will go no farther said the false uncle  i will show you something wonderful only do you gather up sticks while i kindle a fire  when it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him at the same time saying some magical words  the earth trembled a little and opened in front of them disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by  aladdin tried to run away but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down  what have i done uncle he said piteously whereupon the magician said more kindly  fear nothing but obey me  beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours and no one else may touch it so you must do exactly as i tell you  at the word treasure aladdin forgot his fears and grasped the ring as he was told saying the names of his father and grandfather  the stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared  go down said the magician at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls  tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything or you will die instantly these halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees  walk on till you come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp  pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me  he drew a ring from his finger and gave it to aladdin bidding him prosper  aladdin found everything as the magician had said gathered some fruit off the trees and having got the lamp arrived at the mouth of the cave  the magician cried out in a great hurry  make haste and give me the lamp  this aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave  the magician flew into a terrible passion and throwing some more powder on the fire he said something and the stone rolled back into its place  the magician left persia for ever which plainly showed that he was no uncle of aladdins but a cunning magician who had read in his magic books of a wonderful lamp which would make him the most powerful man in the world  though he alone knew where to find it he could only receive it from the hand of another  he had picked out the foolish aladdin for this purpose intending to get the lamp and kill him afterwards  for two days aladdin remained in the dark crying and lamenting  at last he clasped his hands in prayer and in so doing rubbed the ring which the magician had forgotten to take from him  immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth saying  what wouldst thou with me  i am the slave of the ring and will obey thee in all things  aladdin fearlessly replied  deliver me from this place whereupon the earth opened and he found himself outside  as soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home but fainted on the threshold  when he came to himself he told his mother what had passed and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden which were in reality precious stones  he then asked for some food  alas child she said i have nothing in the house but i have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it  aladdin bade her keep her cotton for he would sell the lamp instead as it was very dirty she began to rub it that it might fetch a higher price  instantly a hideous genie appeared and asked what she would have  she fainted away but aladdin snatching the lamp said boldly  fetch me something to eat  the genie returned with a silver bowl twelve silver plates containing rich meats two silver cups and two bottles of wine  aladdins mother when she came to herself said  whence comes this splendid feast  ask not but eat replied aladdin  so they sat at breakfast till it was dinnertime and aladdin told his mother about the lamp  she begged him to sell it and have nothing to do with devils  no said aladdin since chance has made us aware of its virtues we will use it and the ring likewise which i shall always wear on my finger  when they had eaten all the genie had brought aladdin sold one of the silver plates and so on till none were left  he then had recourse to the genie who gave him another set of plates and thus they lived for many years  one day aladdin heard an order from the sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess his daughter went to and from the bath  aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face which was very difficult as she always went veiled  he hid himself behind the door of the bath and peeped through a chink the princess lifted her veil as she went in and looked so beautiful that aladdin fell in love with her at first sight  he went home so changed that his mother was frightened  he told her he loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her and meant to ask her in marriage of her father  his mother on hearing this burst out laughing but aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the sultan and carry his request  she fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels  she took these with her to please the sultan and set out trusting in the lamp  the grandvizir and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the sultan  he however took no notice of her she went every day for a week and stood in the same place  when the council broke up on the sixth day the sultan said to his vizir  i see a certain woman in the audiencechamber every day carrying something in a napkin  call her next time that i may find out what she wants  next day at a sign from the vizir she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till the sultan said to her rise good woman and tell me what you want  she hesitated so the sultan sent away all but the vizir and bade her speak freely promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she might say  she then told him of her sons violent love for the princess  i prayed him to forget her she said but in vain he threatened to do some desperate deed if i refused to go and ask your majesty for the hand of the princess  now i pray you to forgive not me alone but my son aladdin  the sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them  he was thunderstruck and turning to the vizir said  what sayest thou  ought i not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such a price  the vizir who wanted her for his own son begged the sultan to withhold her for three months in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present  the sultan granted this and told aladdins mother that though he consented to the marriage she must not appear before him again for three months  aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months but after two had elapsed his mother going into the city to buy oil found everyone rejoicing and asked what was going on  do you not know was the answer that the son of the grandvizir is to marry the sultans daughter tonight  breathless she ran and told aladdin who was overwhelmed at first but presently bethought him of the lamp  he rubbed it and the genie appeared saying  what is thy will  aladdin replied  the sultan as thou knowest has broken his promise to me and the vizirs son is to have the princess  my command is that tonight you bring hither the bride and bridegroom  master i obey said the genie  aladdin then went to his chamber where sure enough at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the vizirs son and the princess  take this newmarried man he said and put him outside in the cold and return at daybreak  whereupon the genie took the vizirs son out of bed leaving aladdin with the princess  fear nothing aladdin said to her you are my wife promised to me by your unjust father and no harm shall come to you  the princess was too frightened to speak and passed the most miserable night of her life while aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly at the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom laid him in his place and transported the bed back to the palace  presently the sultan came to wish his daughter goodmorning  the unhappy vizirs son jumped up and hid himself while the princess would not say a word and was very sorrowful  the sultan sent her mother to her who said  how comes it child that you will not speak to your father  what has happened  the princess sighed deeply and at last told her mother how during the night the bed had been carried into some strange house and what had passed there  her mother did not believe her in the least but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream  the following night exactly the same thing happened and next morning on the princesss refusing to speak the sultan threatened to cut off her head  she then confessed all bidding him ask the vizirs son if it were not so  the sultan told the vizir to ask his son who owned the truth adding that dearly as he loved the princess he had rather die than go through another such fearful night and wished to be separated from her  his wish was granted and there was an end of feasting and rejoicing  when the three months were over aladdin sent his mother to remind the sultan of his promise  she stood in the same place as before and the sultan who had forgotten aladdin at once remembered him and sent for her  on seeing her poverty the sultan felt less inclined than ever to keep his word and asked the vizirs advice who counselled him to set so high a value on the princess that no man living could come up to it  the sultan then turned to aladdins mother saying  good woman a sultan must remember his promises and i will remember mine but your son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels carried by forty black slaves led by as many white ones splendidly dressed tell him that i await his answer  the mother of aladdin bowed low and went home thinking all was lost  she gave aladdin the message adding  he may wait long enough for your answer  not so long mother as you think her son replied i would do a great deal more than that for the princess  he summoned the genie and in a few moments the eighty slaves arrived and filled up the small house and garden  aladdin made them set out to the palace two and two followed by his mother  they were so richly dressed with such splendid jewels in their girdles that everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on their heads  they entered the palace and after kneeling before the sultan stood in a halfcircle round the throne with their arms crossed while aladdins mother presented them to the sultan  he hesitated no longer but said  good woman return and tell your son that i wait for him with open arms  she lost no time in telling aladdin bidding him make haste  but aladdin first called the genie  i want a scented bath he said a richly embroidered habit a horse surpassing the sultans and twenty slaves to attend me  besides this six slaves beautifully dressed to wait on my mother and lastly ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses  no sooner said than done  aladdin mounted his horse and passed through the streets the slaves strewing gold as they went  those who had played with him in his childhood knew him not he had grown so handsome  when the sultan saw him he came down from his throne embraced him and led him into a hall where a feast was spread intending to marry him to the princess that very day  but aladdin refused saying i must build a palace fit for her and took his leave  once home he said to the genie  build me a palace of the finest marble set with jasper agate and other precious stones  in the middle you shall build me a large hall with a dome its four walls of massy gold and silver each side having six windows whose lattices all except one which is to be left unfinished must be set with diamonds and rubies  there must be stables and horses and grooms and slaves go and see about it  the palace was finished by next day and the genie carried him there and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out even to the laying of a velvet carpet from aladdins palace to the sultans aladdins mother then dressed herself carefully and walked to the palace with her slaves while he followed her on horseback  the sultan sent musicians with trumpets and cymbals to meet them so that the air resounded with music and cheers  she was taken to the princess who saluted her and treated her with great honour  at night the princess said goodbye to her father and set out on the carpet for aladdins palace with his mother at her side and followed by the hundred slaves  she was charmed at the sight of aladdin who ran to receive her  princess he said blame your beauty for my boldness if i have displeased you  she told him that having seen him she willingly obeyed her father in this matter  after the wedding had taken place aladdin led her into the hall where a feast was spread and she supped with him after which they danced till midnight  next day aladdin invited the sultan to see the palace  on entering the hall with the fourandtwenty windows with their rubies diamonds and emeralds he cried  it is a worlds wonder  there is only one thing that surprises me was it by accident that one window was left unfinished  no sir by design returned aladdin  i wished your majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace  the sultan was pleased and sent for the best jewelers in the city  he showed them the unfinished window and bade them fit it up like the others  sir replied their spokesman we cannot find jewels enough  the sultan had his own fetched which they soon used but to no purpose for in a months time the work was not half done  aladdin knowing that their task was vain bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back and the genie finished the window at his command  the sultan was surprised to receive his jewels again and visited aladdin who showed him the window finished  the sultan embraced him the envious vizir meanwhile hinting that it was the work of enchantment  aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing  he was made captain of the sultans armies and won several battles for him but remained modest and courteous as before and lived thus in peace and content for several years  but far away in africa the magician remembered aladdin and by his magic arts discovered that aladdin instead of perishing miserably in the cave had escaped and had married a princess with whom he was living in great honour and wealth  he knew that the poor tailors son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp and travelled night and day till he reached the capital of china bent on aladdins ruin  as he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace  forgive my ignorance he asked what is this palace you speak of  have you not heard of prince aladdins palace was the reply the greatest wonder of the world  i will direct you if you have a mind to see it  the magician thanked him who spoke and having seen the palace knew that it had been raised by the genie of the lamp and became half mad with rage  he determined to get hold of the lamp and again plunge aladdin into the deepest poverty  unluckily aladdin had gone ahunting for eight days which gave the magician plenty of time  he bought a dozen copper lamps put them into a basket and went to the palace crying  new lamps for old followed by a jeering crowd  the princess sitting in the hall of fourandtwenty windows sent a slave to find out what the noise was about who came back laughing so that the princess scolded her  madam replied the slave who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange fine new lamps for old ones  another slave hearing this said  there is an old one on the cornice there which he can have  now this was the magic lamp which aladdin had left there as he could not take it out hunting with him  the princess not knowing its value laughingly bade the slave take it and make the exchange  she went and said to the magician  give me a new lamp for this  he snatched it and bade the slave take her choice amid the jeers of the crowd  little he cared but left off crying his lamps and went out of the city gates to a lonely place where he remained till nightfall when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed it  the genie appeared and at the magicians command carried him together with the palace and the princess in it to a lonely place in africa  next morning the sultan looked out of the window towards aladdins palace and rubbed his eyes for it was gone  he sent for the vizir and asked what had become of the palace  the vizir looked out too and was lost in astonishment  he again put it down to enchantment and this time the sultan believed him and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch aladdin in chains  they met him riding home bound him and forced him to go with them on foot  the people however who loved him followed armed to see that he came to no harm  he was carried before the sultan who ordered the executioner to cut off his head the executioner made aladdin kneel down bandaged his eyes and raised his scimitar to strike  at that instant the vizir who saw that the crowd had forced their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue aladdin called to the executioner to stay his hand  the people indeed looked so threatening that the sultan gave way and ordered aladdin to be unbound and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd  aladdin now begged to know what he had done  false wretch said the sultan come hither and showed him from the window the place where his palace had stood  aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word  where is my palace and my daughter demanded the sultan  for the first i am not so deeply concerned but my daughter i must have and you must find her or lose your head  aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her promising if he failed to return and suffer death at the sultans pleasure  his prayer was granted and he went forth sadly from the sultans presence  for three days he wandered about like a madman asking everyone what had become of his palace but they only laughed and pitied him  he came to the banks of a river and knelt down to say his prayers before throwing himself in  in so doing he rubbed the magic ring he still wore  the genie he had seen in the cave appeared and asked his will  save my life genie said aladdin and bring my palace back  that is not in my power said the genie i am only the slave of the ring you must ask the slave of the lamp  even so said aladdin but thou canst take me to the palace and set me down under my dear wifes window  he at once found himself in africa under the window of the princess and fell asleep out of sheer weariness  he was awakened by the singing of the birds and his heart was lighter he saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it  that morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into africa by the magician whose company she was forced to endure once a day  she however treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether  as she was dressing one of her women looked out and saw aladdin  the princess ran and opened the window and at the noise she made aladdin looked up  she called to him to come to her and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again  after he had kissed her aladdin said  i beg of you princess in gods name before we speak of anything else for your own sake and mine tell me what has become of an old lamp i left on the cornice in the hall of fourandtwenty windows when i went ahunting  alas she said i am the innocent cause of our sorrows and told him of the exchange of the lamp  now i know cried aladdin that we have to thank the african magician for this  where is the lamp  he carries it about with him said the princess i know for he pulled it out of his breast to show me  he wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him saying that you were beheaded by my fathers command  he is forever speaking ill of you but i only reply by my tears  if i persist i doubt not that he will use violence  aladdin comforted her and left her for a while  he changed clothes with the first person he met in the town and having bought a certain powder returned to the princess who let him in by a little side door  put on your most beautiful dress he said to her and receive the magician with smiles leading him to believe that you have forgotten me  invite him to sup with you and say you wish to taste the wine of his country  he will go for some and while he is gone i will tell you what to do  she listened carefully to aladdin and when he left her arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left china  she put on a girdle and headdress of diamonds and seeing in a glass that she looked more beautiful than ever received the magician saying to his great amazement  i have made up my mind that aladdin is dead and that all my tears will not bring him back to me so i am resolved to mourn no more and have therefore invited you to sup with me but i am tired of the wines of china and would fain taste those of africa  the magician flew to his cellar and the princess put the powder aladdin had given her in her cup  when he returned she asked him to drink her health in the wine of africa handing him her cup in exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him  before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty but the princess cut him short saying  let me drink first and you shall say what you will afterwards she set her cup to her lips and kept it there while the magician drained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless  the princess then opened the door to aladdin and flung her arms round his neck but aladdin put her away bidding her to leave him as he had more to do  he then went to the dead magician took the lamp out of his vest and bade the genie carry the palace and all in it back to china  this was done and the princess in her chamber only felt two little shocks and little thought she was at home again  the sultan who was sitting in his closet mourning for his lost daughter happened to look up and rubbed his eyes for there stood the palace as before  he hastened thither and aladdin received him in the hall of the fourandtwenty windows with the princess at his side aladdin told him what had happened and showed him the dead body of the magician that he might believe  a ten days feast was proclaimed and it seemed as if aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace but it was not to be  the african magician had a younger brother who was if possible more wicked and more cunning than himself  he travelled to china to avenge his brothers death and went to visit a pious woman called fatima thinking she might be of use to him  he entered her cell and clapped a dagger to her breast telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death  he changed clothes with her coloured his face like hers put on her veil and murdered her that she might tell no tales  then he went towards the palace of aladdin and all the people thinking he was the holy woman gathered round him kissing his hands and begging his blessing  when he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the matter  the slave said it was the holy woman curing people by her touch of their ailments whereupon the princess who had long desired to see fatima sent for her  on coming to the princess the magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity  when he had done the princess made him sit by her and begged him to stay with her always  the false fatima who wished for nothing better consented but kept his veil down for fear of discovery  the princess showed him the hall and asked him what he thought of it  it is truly beautiful said the false fatima  in my mind it wants but one thing  and what is that said the princess  if only a rocs egg replied he were hung up from the middle of this dome it would be the wonder of the world  after this the princess could think of nothing but a rocs egg and when aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humour he begged to know what was amiss and she told him that all her pleasure in the hall was spoilt for the want of a rocs egg hanging from the dome  it that is all replied aladdin you shall soon be happy  he left her and rubbed the lamp and when the genie appeared commanded him to bring a rocs egg  the genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that the hall shook  wretch he cried is it not enough that i have done everything for you but you must command me to bring my master and hang him up in the midst of this dome  you and your wife and your palace deserve to be burnt to ashes but this request does not come from you but from the brother of the african magician whom you destroyed  he is now in your palace disguised as the holy womanwhom he murdered  he it was who put that wish into your wifes head  take care of yourself for he means to kill you  so saying the genie disappeared  aladdin went back to the princess saying his head ached and requesting that the holy fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it  but when the magician came near aladdin seizing his dagger pierced him to the heart  what have you done cried the princess  you have killed the holy woman  not so replied aladdin but a wicked magician and told her of how she had been deceived  after this aladdin and his wife lived in peace  he succeeded the sultan when he died and reigned for many years leaving behind him a long line of kings    the adventures of harounalraschid caliph of bagdad   the caliph harounalraschid sat in his palace wondering if there was anything left in the world that could possibly give him a few hours amusement when giafar the grandvizir his old and tried friend suddenly appeared before him  bowing low he waited as was his duty till his master spoke but harounalraschid merely turned his head and looked at him and sank back into his former weary posture  now giafar had something of importance to say to the caliph and had no intention of being put off by mere silence so with another low bow in front of the throne he began to speak  commander of the faithful said he i have taken on myself to remind your highness that you have undertaken secretly to observe for yourself the manner in which justice is done and order is kept throughout the city  this is the day you have set apart to devote to this object and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may find some distraction from the melancholy to which as i see to my sorrow you are a prey  you are right returned the caliph i had forgotten all about it go and change your coat and i will change mine  a few moments later they both reentered the hall disguised as foreign merchants and passed through a secret door out into the open country here they turned towards the euphrates and crossing the river in a small boat walked through that part of the town which lay along the further bank without seeing anything to call for their interference much pleased with the peace and good order of the city the caliph and his vizir made their way to a bridge which led straight back to the palace and had already crossed it when they were stopped by an old and blind man who begged for alms  the caliph gave him a piece of money and was passing on but the blind man seized his hand and held him fast  charitable person he said whoever you may be grant me yet another prayer  strike me i beg of you one blow  i have deserved it richly and even a more severe penalty  the caliph much surprised at this request replied gently my good man that which you ask is impossible  of what use would my alms be if i treated you so ill  and as he spoke he tried to loosen the grasp of the blind beggar  my lord answered the man pardon my boldness and my persistence take back your money or give me the blow which i crave  i have sworn a solemn oath that i will receive nothing without receiving chastisement and if you knew all you would feel that the punishment is not a tenth part of what i deserve  moved by these words and perhaps still more by the fact that he had other business to attend to the caliph yielded and struck him lightly on the shoulder  then he continued his road followed by the blessing of the blind man  when they were out of earshot he said to the vizir there must be something very odd to make that man act soi should like to find out what is the reason  go back to him tell him who i am and order him to come without fail to the palace tomorrow after the hour of evening prayer  so the grandvizir went back to the bridge gave the blind beggar first a piece of money and then a blow delivered the caliphs message and rejoined his master  they passed on towards the palace but walking through a square they came upon a crowd watching a young and welldressed man who was urging a horse at full speed round the open space using at the same time his spurs and whip so unmercifully that the animal was all covered with foam and blood  the caliph astonished at this proceeding inquired of a passerby what it all meant but no one could tell him anything except that every day at the same hour the same thing took place  still wondering he passed on and for the moment had to content himself with telling the vizir to command the horseman also to appear before him at the same time as the blind man  the next day after evening prayer the caliph entered the hall and was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men of whom we have spoken and a third with whom we have nothing to do  they all bowed themselves low before the throne and then the caliph bade them rise and ask the blind man his name  babaabdalla your highness said he  babaabdalla returned the caliph your way of asking alms yesterday seemed to me so strange that i almost commanded you then and there to cease from causing such a public scandal  but i have sent for you to inquire what was your motive in making such a curious vow  when i know the reason i shall be able to judge whether you can be permitted to continue to practise it for i cannot help thinking that it sets a very bad example to others  tell me therefore the whole truth and conceal nothing  these words troubled the heart of babaabdalla who prostrated himself at the feet of the caliph  then rising he answered commander of the faithful i crave your pardon humbly for my persistence in beseeching your highness to do an action which appears on the face of it to be without any meaning  no doubt in the eyes of men it has none but i look on it as a slight expiation for a fearful sin of which i have been guilty and if your highness will deign to listen to my tale you will see that no punishment could atone for the crime    the story of the blind babaabdalla   i was born commander of the faithful in bagdad and was left an orphan while i was yet a very young man for my parents died within a few days of each other  i had inherited from them a small fortune which i worked hard night and day to increase till at last i found myself the owner of eighty camels  these i hired out to travelling merchants whom i frequently accompanied on their various journeys and always returned with large profits  one day i was coming back from balsora whither i had taken a supply of goods intended for india and halted at noon in a lonely place which promised rich pasture for my camels  i was resting in the shade under a tree when a dervish going on foot towards balsora sat down by my side and i inquired whence he had come and to what place he was going we soon made friends and after we had asked each other the usual questions we produced the food we had with us and satisfied our hunger  while we were eating the dervish happened to mention that in a spot only a little way off from where we were sitting there was hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they could carry no more the hiding place would seem as full as if it had never been touched  at this news i became almost beside myself with joy and greed and i flung my arms round the neck of the dervish exclaiming  good dervish i see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you alone and on foot you could carry away a mere handful  but tell me where it is and i will load my eighty camels with it and give you one of them as a token of my gratitude  certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent but it was great to me for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over my heart and i almost felt as if the seventynine camels that were left were nothing in comparison  the dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind but he did not show what he thought of my proposal  my brother he answered quietly you know as well as i do that you are behaving unjustly  it was open to me to keep my secret and to reserve the treasure for myself  but the fact that i have told you of its existence shows that i had confidence in you and that i hoped to earn your gratitude for ever by making your fortune as well as mine but before i reveal to you the secret of the treasure you must swear that after we have loaded the camels with as much as they can carry you will give half to me and let us go our own ways  i think you will see that this is fair for if you present me with forty camels i on my side will give you the means of buying a thousand more  i could not of course deny that what the dervish said was perfectly reasonable but in spite of that the thought that the dervish would be as rich as i was unbearable to me  still there was no use in discussing the matter and i had to accept his conditions or bewail to the end of my life the loss of immense wealth  so i collected my camels and we set out together under the guidance of the dervish after walking some time we reached what looked like a valley but with such a narrow entrance that my camels could only pass one by one  the little valley or open space was shut up by two mountains whose sides were formed of straight cliffs which no human being could climb  when we were exactly between these mountains the dervish stopped  make your camels lie down in this open space he said so that we can easily load them then we will go to the treasure  i did what i was bid and rejoined the dervish whom i found trying to kindle a fire out of some dry wood  as soon as it was alight he threw on it a handful of perfumes and pronounced a few words that i did not understand and immediately a thick column of smoke rose high into the air  he separated the smoke into two columns and then i saw a rock which stood like a pillar between the two mountains slowly open and a splendid palace appear within  but commander of the faithful the love of gold had taken such possession of my heart that i could not even stop to examine the riches but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach and began to heap it into a sack that i had brought with me  the dervish likewise set to work but i soon noticed that he confined himself to collecting precious stones and i felt i should be wise to follow his example  at length the camels were loaded with as much as they could carry and nothing remained but to seal up the treasure and go our ways  before however this was done the dervish went up to a great golden vase beautifully chased and took from it a small wooden box which he hid in the bosom of his dress merely saying that it contained a special kind of ointment  then he once more kindled the fire threw on the perfume and murmured the unknown spell and the rock closed and stood whole as before  the next thing was to divide the camels and to charge them with the treasure after which we each took command of our own and marched out of the valley till we reached the place in the high road where the routes diverge and then we parted the dervish going towards balsora and i to bagdad  we embraced each other tenderly and i poured out my gratitude for the honour he had done me in singling me out for this great wealth and having said a hearty farewell we turned our backs and hastened after our camels  i had hardly come up with mine when the demon of envy filled my soul what does a dervish want with riches like that  i said to myself he alone has the secret of the treasure and can always get as much as he wants and i halted my camels by the roadside and ran back after him  i was a quick runner and it did not take me very long to come up with him  my brother i exclaimed as soon as i could speak almost at the moment of our leavetaking a reflection occurred to me which is perhaps new to you  you are a dervish by profession and live a very quiet life only caring to do good and careless of the things of this world  you do not realise the burden that you lay upon yourself when you gather into your hands such great wealth besides the fact that no one who is not accustomed to camels from his birth can ever manage the stubborn beasts  if you are wise you will not encumber yourself with more than thirty and you will find those trouble enough  you are right replied the dervish who understood me quite well but did not wish to fight the matter  i confess i had not thought about it  choose any ten you like and drive them before you  i selected ten of the best camels and we proceeded along the road to rejoin those i had left behind  i had got what i wanted but i had found the dervish so easy to deal with that i rather regretted i had not asked for ten more  i looked back  he had only gone a few paces and i called after him  my brother i said i am unwilling to part from you without pointing out what i think you scarcely grasp that large experience of cameldriving is necessary to anybody who intends to keep together a troop of thirty  in your own interest i feel sure you would be much happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me for with my practice it is all one to me if i take two or a hundred  as before the dervish made no difficulties and i drove off my ten camels in triumph only leaving him with twenty for his share  i had now sixty and anyone might have imagined that i should be content  but commander of the faithful there is a proverb that says the more one has the more one wants  so it was with me  i could not rest as long as one solitary camel remained to the dervish and returning to him i redoubled my prayers and embraces and promises of eternal gratitude till the last twenty were in my hands  make a good use of them my brother said the holy man  remember riches sometimes have wings if we keep them for ourselves and the poor are at our gates expressly that we may help them  my eyes were so blinded by gold that i paid no heed to his wise counsel and only looked about for something else to grasp  suddenly i remembered the little box of ointment that the dervish had hidden and which most likely contained a treasure more precious than all the rest giving him one last embrace i observed accidentally what are you going to do with that little box of ointment  it seems hardly worth taking with you you might as well let me have it  and really a dervish who has given up the world has no need of ointment  oh if he had only refused my request  but then supposing he had i should have got possession of it by force so great was the madness that had laid hold upon me  however far from refusing it the dervish at once held it out saying gracefully take it my friend and if there is anything else i can do to make you happy you must let me know  directly the box was in my hands i wrenched off the cover  as you are so kind i said tell me i pray you what are the virtues of this ointment  they are most curious and interesting replied the dervish  if you apply a little of it to your left eye you will behold in an instant all the treasures hidden in the bowels of the earth  but beware lest you touch your right eye with it or your sight will be destroyed for ever  his words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch  make trial on me i implore you i cried holding out the box to the dervish  you will know how to do it better than i  i am burning with impatience to test its charms  the dervish took the box i had extended to him and bidding me shut my left eye touched it gently with the ointment  when i opened it again i saw spread out as it were before me treasures of every kind and without number  but as all this time i had been obliged to keep my right eye closed which was very fatiguing i begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also  if you insist upon it i will do it answered the dervish but you must remember what i told you just nowthat if it touches your right eye you will become blind on the spot  unluckily in spite of my having proved the truth of the dervishs words in so many instances i was firmly convinced that he was now keeping concealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the ointment  so i turned a deaf ear to all he said  my brother i replied smiling i see you are joking  it is not natural that the same ointment should have two such exactly opposite effects  it is true all the same answered the dervish and it would be well for you if you believed my word  but i would not believe and dazzled by the greed of avarice i thought that if one eye could show me riches the other might teach me how to get possession of them  and i continued to press the dervish to anoint my right eye but this he resolutely declined to do  after having conferred such benefits on you said he i am loth indeed to work you such evil  think what it is to be blind and do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you live  it was of no use  my brother i said firmly pray say no more but do what i ask  you have most generously responded to my wishes up to this time do not spoil my recollection of you for a thing of such little consequence  let what will happen i take it on my own head and will never reproach you  since you are determined upon it he answered with a sigh there is no use talking and taking the ointment he laid some on my right eye which was tight shut  when i tried to open it heavy clouds of darkness floated before me  i was as blind as you see me now  miserable dervish  i shrieked so it is true after all  into what a bottomless pit has my lust after gold plunged me  ah now that my eyes are closed they are really opened  i know that all my sufferings are caused by myself alone  but good brother you who are so kind and charitable and know the secrets of such vast learning have you nothing that will give me back my sight  unhappy man replied the dervish it is not my fault that this has befallen you but it is a just chastisement  the blindness of your heart has wrought the blindness of your body  yes i have secrets that you have seen in the short time that we have known each other but i have none that will give you back your sight  you have proved yourself unworthy of the riches that were given you  now they have passed into my hands whence they will flow into the hands of others less greedy and ungrateful than you  the dervish said no more and left me speechless with shame and confusion and so wretched that i stood rooted to the spot while he collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his way to balsora  it was in vain that i entreated him not to leave me but at least to take me within reach of the first passing caravan  he was deaf to my prayers and cries and i should soon have been dead of hunger and misery if some merchants had not come along the track the following day and kindly brought me back to bagdad  from a rich man i had in one moment become a beggar and up to this time i have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed on me but in order to expiate the sin of avarice which was my undoing i oblige each passerby to give me a blow  this commander of the faithful is my story  when the blind man had ended the caliph addressed him babaabdalla truly your sin is great but you have suffered enough  henceforth repent in private for i will see that enough money is given you day by day for all your wants  at these words babaabdalla flung himself at the caliphs feet and prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for ever    the story of sidinouman   the caliph harounalraschid was much pleased with the tale of the blind man and the dervish and when it was finished he turned to the young man who had illtreated his horse and inquired his name also the young man replied that he was called sidinouman  sidinouman observed the caliph i have seen horses broken all my life long and have even broken them myself but i have never seen any horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you yesterday  every one who looked on was indignant and blamed you loudly  as for myself i was so angry that i was very nearly disclosing who i was and putting a stop to it at once  still you have not the air of a cruel man and i would gladly believe that you did not act in this way without some reason  as i am told that it was not the first time and indeed that every day you are to be seen flogging and spurring your horse i wish to come to the bottom of the matter  but tell me the whole truth and conceal nothing  sidinouman changed colour as he heard these words and his manner grew confused but he saw plainly that there was no help for it  so he prostrated himself before the throne of the caliph and tried to obey but the words stuck in his throat and he remained silent  the caliph accustomed though he was to instant obedience guessed something of what was passing in the young mans mind and sought to put him at his ease  sidinouman he said do not think of me as the caliph but merely as a friend who would like to hear your story if there is anything in it that you are afraid may offend me take courage for i pardon you beforehand  speak then openly and without fear as to one who knows and loves you  reassured by the kindness of the caliph sidinouman at length began his tale  commander of the faithful said he dazzled though i am by the lustre of your highness presence i will do my best to satisfy your wishes  i am by no means perfect but i am not naturally cruel neither do i take pleasure in breaking the law  i admit that the treatment of my horse is calculated to give your highness a bad opinion of me and to set an evil example to others yet i have not chastised it without reason and i have hopes that i shall be judged more worthy of pity than punishment  commander of the faithful i will not trouble to describe my birth it is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your highness attention my ancestors were careful people and i inherited enough money to enable me to live comfortably though without show  having therefore a modest fortune the only thing wanting to my happiness was a wife who could return my affection but this blessing i was not destined to get for on the very day after my marriage my bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hard to bear  now seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry without ever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our lives a man has of course no right to complain as long as his wife is not absolutely repulsive or is not positively deformed  and whatever defects her body may have pleasant ways and good behaviour will go far to remedy them  the first time i saw my wife unveiled when she had been brought to my house with the usual ceremonies i was enchanted to find that i had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been given me of her beauty  i began my married life in high spirits and the best hopes of happiness  the following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did not appear i ordered a servant to call her  still she did not come and i waited impatiently for some time  at last she entered the room and she took our places at the table and plates of rice were set before us  i ate mine as was natural with a spoon but great was my surprise to notice that my wife instead of doing the same drew from her pocket a little case from which she selected a long pin and by the help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth  amina i exclaimed in astonishment is that the way you eat rice at home  and did you do it because your appetite was so small or did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eat more than a certain number  if it was from economy and you are anxious to teach me not to be wasteful you have no cause for alarm  we shall never ruin ourselves in that way  our fortune is large enough for all our needs therefore dear amina do not seek to check yourself but eat as much as you desire as i do  in reply to my affectionate words i expected a cheerful answer yet amina said nothing at all but continued to pick her rice as before only at longer and longer intervals  and instead of trying the other dishes all she did was to put every now and then a crumb of bread into her mouth that would not have made a meal for a sparrow  i felt provoked by her obstinacy but to excuse her to myself as far as i could i suggested that perhaps she had never been used to eat in the company of men and that her family might have taught her that she ought to behave prudently and discreetly in the presence of her husband  likewise that she might either have dined already or intend to do so in her own apartments  so i took no further notice and when i had finished left the room secretly much vexed at her strange conduct  the same thing occurred at supper and all through the next day whenever we ate together  it was quite clear that no woman could live upon two or three breadcrumbs and a few grains of rice and i determined to find out how and when she got food  i pretended not to pay attention to anything she did in the hope that little by little she would get accustomed to me and become more friendly but i soon saw that my expectations were quite vain  one night i was lying with my eyes closed and to all appearance sound asleep when amina arose softly and dressed herself without making the slightest sound  i could not imagine what she was going to do and as my curiosity was great i made up my mind to follow her  when she was fully dressed she stole quietly from the room  the instant she had let the curtain fall behind her i flung a garment on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet  looking from a lattice which opened into the court i saw her in the act of passing through the street door which she carefully left open  it was bright moonlight so i easily managed to keep her in sight till she entered a cemetery not far from the house  there i hid myself under the shadow of the wall and crouched down cautiously and hardly was i concealed when i saw my wife approaching in company with a ghoulone of those demons which as your highness is aware wander about the country making their lairs in deserted buildings and springing out upon unwary travellers whose flesh they eat  if no live being goes their way they then betake themselves to the cemeteries and feed upon the dead bodies  i was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with this hideous female ghoul  they passed by me without noticing me began to dig up a corpse which had been buried that day and then sat down on the edge of the grave to enjoy their frightful repast talking quietly and cheerfully all the while though i was too far off to hear what they said  when they had finished they threw back the body into the grave and heaped back the earth upon it  i made no effort to disturb them and returned quickly to the house when i took care to leave the door open as i had previously found it  then i got back into bed and pretended to sleep soundly  a short time after amina entered as quietly as she had gone out  she undressed and stole into bed congratulating herself apparently on the cleverness with which she had managed her expedition  as may be guessed after such a scene it was long before i could close my eyes and at the first sound which called the faithful to prayer i put on my clothes and went to the mosque  but even prayer did not restore peace to my troubled spirit and i could not face my wife until i had made up my mind what future course i should pursue in regard to her  i therefore spent the morning roaming about from one garden to another turning over various plans for compelling my wife to give up her horrible ways i thought of using violence to make her submit but felt reluctant to be unkind to her  besides i had an instinct that gentle means had the best chance of success so a little soothed i turned towards home which i reached about the hour of dinner  as soon as i appeared amina ordered dinner to be served and we sat down together  as usual she persisted in only picking a few grains of rice and i resolved to speak to her at once of what lay so heavily on my heart  amina i said as quietly as possible you must have guessed the surprise i felt when the day after our marriage you declined to eat anything but a few morsels of rice and altogether behaved in such a manner that most husbands would have been deeply wounded  however i had patience with you and only tried to tempt your appetite by the choicest dishes i could invent but all to no purpose  still amina it seems to me that there be some among them as sweet to the taste as the flesh of a corpse  i had no sooner uttered these words than amina who instantly understood that i had followed her to the graveyard was seized with a passion beyond any that i have ever witnessed  her face became purple her eyes looked as if they would start from her head and she positively foamed with rage  i watched her with terror wondering what would happen next but little thinking what would be the end of her fury  she seized a vessel of water that stood at hand and plunging her hand in it murmured some words i failed to catch  then sprinkling it on my face she cried madly  wretch receive the reward of your prying and become a dog  the words were not out of her mouth when without feeling conscious that any change was passing over me i suddenly knew that i had ceased to be a man  in the greatness of the shock and surprisefor i had no idea that amina was a magiciani never dreamed of running away and stood rooted to the spot while amina grasped a stick and began to beat me  indeed her blows were so heavy that i only wonder they did not kill me at once  however they succeeded in rousing me from my stupor and i dashed into the courtyard followed closely by amina who made frantic dives at me which i was not quick enough to dodge  at last she got tired of pursuing me or else a new trick entered into her head which would give me speedy and painful death she opened the gate leading into the street intending to crush me as i passed through dog though i was i saw through her design and stung into presence of mind by the greatness of the danger i timed my movements so well that i contrived to rush through and only the tip of my tail received a squeeze as she banged the gate  i was safe but my tail hurt me horribly and i yelped and howled so loud all along the streets that the other dogs came and attacked me which made matters no better  in order to avoid them i took refuge in a cookshop where tongues and sheeps heads were sold  at first the owner showed me great kindness and drove away the other dogs that were still at my heels while i crept into the darkest corner  but though i was safe for the moment i was not destined to remain long under his protection for he was one of those who hold all dogs to be unclean and that all the washing in the world will hardly purify you from their contact  so after my enemies had gone to seek other prey he tried to lure me from my corner in order to force me into the street  but i refused to come out of my hole and spent the night in sleep which i sorely needed after the pain inflicted on me by amina  i have no wish to weary your highness by dwelling on the sad thoughts which accompanied my change of shape but it may interest you to hear that the next morning my host went out early to do his marketing and returned laden with the sheeps heads and tongues and trotters that formed his stock in trade for the day  the smell of meat attracted various hungry dogs in the neighbourhood and they gathered round the door begging for some bits  i stole out of my corner and stood with them  in spite of his objection to dogs as unclean animals my protector was a kindhearted man and knowing i had eaten nothing since yesterday he threw me bigger and better bits than those which fell to the share of the other dogs  when i had finished i tried to go back into the shop but this he would not allow and stood so firmly at the entrance with a stout stick that i was forced to give it up and seek some other home  a few paces further on was a bakers shop which seemed to have a gay and merry man for a master  at that moment he was having his breakfast and though i gave no signs of hunger he at once threw me a piece of bread  before gobbling it up as most dogs are in the habit of doing i bowed my head and wagged my tail in token of thanks and he understood and smiled pleasantly  i really did not want the bread at all but felt it would be ungracious to refuse so i ate it slowly in order that he might see that i only did it out of politeness  he understood this also and seemed quite willing to let me stay in his shop so i sat down with my face to the door to show that i only asked his protection  this he gave me and indeed encouraged me to come into the house itself giving me a corner where i might sleep without being in anybodys way  the kindness heaped on me by this excellent man was far greater than i could ever have expected  he was always affectionate in his manner of treating me and i shared his breakfast dinner and supper while on my side i gave him all the gratitude and attachment to which he had a right  i sat with my eyes fixed on him and he never left the house without having me at his heels and if it ever happened that when he was preparing to go out i was asleep and did not notice he would call rufus rufus for that was the name he gave me  some weeks passed in this way when one day a woman came in to buy bread  in paying for it she laid down several pieces of money one of which was bad  the baker perceived this and declined to take it demanding another in its place  the woman for her part refused to take it back declaring it was perfectly good but the baker would have nothing to do with it  it is really such a bad imitation he exclaimed at last that even my dog would not be taken in  here rufus  rufus and hearing his voice i jumped on to the counter  the baker threw down the money before me and said find out if there is a bad coin  i looked at each in turn and then laid my paw on the false one glancing at the same time at my master so as to point it out  the baker who had of course been only in joke was exceedingly surprised at my cleverness and the woman who was at last convinced that the man spoke the truth produced another piece of money in its place  when she had gone my master was so pleased that he told all the neighbours what i had done and made a great deal more of it than there really was  the neighbours very naturally declined to believe his story and tried me several times with all the bad money they could collect together but i never failed to stand the test triumphantly  soon the shop was filled from morning till night with people who on the pretence of buying bread came to see if i was as clever as i was reported to be  the baker drove a roaring trade and admitted that i was worth my weight in gold to him  of course there were plenty who envied him his large custom and many was the pitfall set for me so that he never dared to let me out of his sight  one day a woman who had not been in the shop before came to ask for bread like the rest  as usual i was lying on the counter and she threw down six coins before me one of which was false  i detected it at once and put my paw on it looking as i did so at the woman  yes she said nodding her head  you are quite right that is the one  she stood gazing at me attentively for some time then paid for the bread and left the shop making a sign for me to follow her secretly  now my thoughts were always running on some means of shaking off the spell laid on me and noticing the way in which this woman had looked at me the idea entered my head that perhaps she might have guessed what had happened and in this i was not deceived  however i let her go on a little way and merely stood at the door watching her  she turned and seeing that i was quite still she again beckoned to me  the baker all this while was busy with his oven and had forgotten all about me so i stole out softly and ran after the woman  when we came to her house which was some distance off she opened the door and then said to me come in come in you will never be sorry that you followed me  when i had entered she fastened the door and took me into a large room where a beautiful girl was working at a piece of embroidery  my daughter exclaimed my guide i have brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker which can tell good money from bad  you know that when i first heard of him i told you i was sure he must be really a man changed into a dog by magic  today i went to the bakers to prove for myself the truth of the story and persuaded the dog to follow me here  now what do you say  you are right mother replied the girl and rising she dipped her hand into a vessel of water  then sprinkling it over me she said if you were born dog remain dog but if you were born man by virtue of this water resume your proper form  in one moment the spell was broken  the dogs shape vanished as if it had never been and it was a man who stood before her  overcome with gratitude at my deliverance i flung myself at her feet and kissed the hem of her garment  how can i thank you for your goodness towards a stranger and for what you have done  henceforth i am your slave  deal with me as you will  then in order to explain how i came to be changed into a dog i told her my whole story and finished with rendering the mother the thanks due to her for the happiness she had brought me  sidinouman returned the daughter say no more about the obligation you are under to us  the knowledge that we have been of service to you is ample payment  let us speak of amina your wife with whom i was acquainted before her marriage  i was aware that she was a magician and she knew too that i had studied the same art under the same mistress  we met often going to the same baths but we did not like each other and never sought to become friends  as to what concerns you it is not enough to have broken your spell she must be punished for her wickedness  remain for a moment with my mother i beg she added hastily i will return shortly  left alone with the mother i again expressed the gratitude i felt to her as well as to her daughter  my daughter she answered is as you see as accomplished a magician as amina herself but you would be astonished at the amount of good she does by her knowledge  that is why i have never interfered otherwise i should have put a stop to it long ago  as she spoke her daughter entered with a small bottle in her hand  sidinouman she said the books i have just consulted tell me that amina is not home at present but she should return at any moment  i have likewise found out by their means that she pretends before the servants great uneasiness as to your absence  she has circulated a story that while at dinner with her you remembered some important business that had to be done at once and left the house without shutting the door  by this means a dog had strayed in which she was forced to get rid of by a stick  go home then without delay and await aminas return in your room  when she comes in go down to meet her and in her surprise she will try to run away  then have this bottle ready and dash the water it contains over her saying boldly receive the reward of your crimes that is all i have to tell you  everything happened exactly as the young magician had foretold  i had not been in my house many minutes before amina returned and as she approached i stepped in front of her with the water in my hand  she gave one loud cry and turned to the door but she was too late  i had already dashed the water in her face and spoken the magic words  amina disappeared and in her place stood the horse you saw me beating yesterday  this commander of the faithful is my story and may i venture to hope that now you have heard the reason of my conduct your highness will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated  sidinouman replied the caliph your story is indeed a strange one and there is no excuse to be offered for your wife  but without condemning your treatment of her i wish you to reflect how much she must suffer from being changed into an animal and i hope you will let that punishment be enough  i do not order you to insist upon the young magician finding the means to restore your wife to her human shape because i know that when once women such as she begin to work evil they never leave off and i should only bring down on your head a vengeance far worse than the one you have undergone already    the story of ali colia merchant of bagdad   in the reign of harounalraschid there lived in bagdad a merchant named ali cogia who having neither wife nor child contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade  he had spent some years quite happily in the house his father had left him when three nights running he dreamed that an old man had appeared to him and reproached him for having neglected the duty of a good mussulman in delaying so long his pilgrimage to mecca  ali cogia was much troubled by this dream as he was unwilling to give up his shop and lose all his customers  he had shut his eyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage and tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works but the dream seemed to him a direct warning and he resolved to put the journey off no longer  the first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares he had in his shop only reserving to himself such goods as he might trade with on the road  the shop itself he sold also and easily found a tenant for his private house  the only matter he could not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand pieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him  after some thought ali cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one he took a large vase and placing the money in the bottom of it filled up the rest with olives  after corking the vase tightly down he carried it to one of his friends a merchant like himself and said to him  my brother you have probably heard that i am staffing with a caravan in a few days for mecca  i have come to ask whether you would do me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till i come back  the merchant replied readily look this is the key of my shop take it and put the vase wherever you like  i promise that you shall find it in the same place on your return  a few days later ali cogia mounted the camel that he had laden with merchandise joined the caravan and arrived in due time at mecca like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred mosque and after all his religious duties were performed he set out his goods to the best advantage hoping to gain some customers among the passersby  very soon two merchants stopped before the pile and when they had turned it over one said to the other  if this man was wise he would take these things to cairo where he would get a much better price than he is likely to do here  ali cogia heard the words and lost no time in following the advice he packed up his wares and instead of returning to bagdad joined a caravan that was going to cairo  the results of the journey gladdened his heart  he sold off everything almost directly and bought a stock of egyptian curiosities which he intended selling at damascus but as the caravan with which he would have to travel would not be starting for another six weeks he took advantage of the delay to visit the pyramids and some of the cities along the banks of the nile  now the attractions of damascus so fascinated the worthy ali that he could hardly tear himself away but at length he remembered that he had a home in bagdad meaning to return by way of aleppo and after he had crossed the euphrates to follow the course of the tigris  but when he reached mossoul ali had made such friends with some persian merchants that they persuaded him to accompany them to their native land and even as far as india and so it came to pass that seven years had slipped by since he had left bagdad and during all that time the friend with whom he had left the vase of olives had never once thought of him or of it  in fact it was only a month before ali cogias actual return that the affair came into his head at all owing to his wifes remarking one day that it was a long time since she had eaten any olives and would like some  that reminds me said the husband that before ali cogia went to mecca seven years ago he left a vase of olives in my care  but really by this time he must be dead and there is no reason we should not eat the olives if we like  give me a light and i will fetch them and see how they taste  my husband answered the wife beware i pray of your doing anything so base  supposing seven years have passed without news of ali cogia he need not be dead for all that and may come back any day how shameful it would be to have to confess that you had betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase  pay no attention to my idle words i really have no desire for olives now  and probably after all this while they are no longer good  i have a presentiment that ali cogia will return and what will he think of you  give it up i entreat  the merchant however refused to listen to her advice sensible though it was  he took a light and a dish and went into his shop  if you will be so obstinate said his wife i cannot help it but do not blame me if it turns out ill  when the merchant opened the vase he found the topmost olives were rotten and in order to see if the under ones were in better condition he shook some out into the dish  as they fell out a few of the gold pieces fell out too  the sight of the money roused all the merchants greed  he looked into the vase and saw that all the bottom was filled with gold  he then replaced the olives and returned to his wife  my wife he said as he entered the room you were quite right the olives are rotten and i have recorked the vase so well that ali cogia will never know it has been touched  you would have done better to believe me replied the wife  i trust that no harm will come of it  these words made no more impression on the merchant than the others had done and he spent the whole night in wondering how he could manage to keep the gold if ali cogia should come back and claim his vase  very early next morning he went out and bought fresh new olives he then threw away the old ones took out the gold and hid it and filled up the vase with the olives he had bought  this done he recorked the vase and put it in the same place where it had been left by ali cogia  a month later ali cogia reentered bagdad and as his house was still let he went to an inn and the following day set out to see his friend the merchant who received him with open arms and many expressions of surprise  after a few moments given to inquiries ali cogia begged the merchant to hand him over the vase that he had taken care of for so long  oh certainly said he i am only glad i could be of use to you in the matter  here is the key of my shop you will find the vase in the place where you put it  ali cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn where he opened it  he thrust down his hand but could feel no money but still was persuaded it must be there  so he got some plates and vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives  to no purpose  the gold was not there  the poor man was dumb with horror then lifting up his hands he exclaimed can my old friend really have committed such a crime  in great haste he went back to the house of the merchant  my friend he cried you will be astonished to see me again but i can find nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that i placed in the bottom under the olives  perhaps you may have taken a loan of them for your business purposes if that is so you are most welcome  i will only ask you to give me a receipt and you can pay the money at your leisure  the merchant who had expected something of the sort had his reply all ready  ali cogia he said when you brought me the vase of olives did i ever touch it  i gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you liked and did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in the same state if you placed any gold in it it must be there still  i know nothing about that you only told me there were olives  you can believe me or not but i have not laid a finger on the vase  ali cogia still tried every means to persuade the merchant to admit the truth  i love peace he said and shall deeply regret having to resort to harsh measures  once more think of your reputation  i shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the aid of the law  ali cogia answered the merchant you allow that it was a vase of olives you placed in my charge  you fetched it and removed it yourself and now you tell me it contained a thousand pieces of gold and that i must restore them to you  did you ever say anything about them before  why i did not even know that the vase had olives in it you never showed them to me  i wonder you have not demanded pearls or diamonds  retire i pray you lest a crowd should gather in front of my shop  by this time not only the casual passersby but also the neighbouring merchants were standing round listening to the dispute and trying every now and then to smooth matters between them  but at the merchants last words ali cogia resolved to lay the cause of the quarrel before them and told them the whole story  they heard him to the end and inquired of the merchant what he had to say  the accused man admitted that he had kept ali cogias vase in his shop but he denied having touched it and swore that as to what it contained he only knew what ali cogia had told him and called them all to witness the insult that had been put upon him  you have brought it on yourself said ali cogia taking him by the arm and as you appeal to the law the law you shall have  let us see if you will dare to repeat your story before the cadi  now as a good mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse this choice of a judge so he accepted the test and said to ali cogia very well i should like nothing better  we shall soon see which of us is in the right  so the two men presented themselves before the cadi and ali cogia again repeated his tale  the cadi asked what witnesses he had  ali cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution as he had considered the man his friend and up to that time had always found him honest  the merchant on his side stuck to his story and offered to swear solemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand gold pieces but that he did not even know they were there  the cadi allowed him to take the oath and pronounced him innocent  ali cogia furious at having to suffer such a loss protested against the verdict declaring that he would appeal to the caliph harounalraschid himself  but the cadi paid no attention to his threats and was quite satisfied that he had done what was right  judgment being given the merchant returned home triumphant and ali cogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the caliph  the next morning he placed himself on the road along which the caliph must pass after midday prayer and stretched out his petition to the officer who walked before the caliph whose duty it was to collect such things and on entering the palace to hand them to his master  there harounalraschid studied them carefully  knowing this custom ali cogia followed the caliph into the public hall of the palace and waited the result  after some time the officer appeared and told him that the caliph had read his petition and had appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience  he then inquired the merchants address so that he might be summoned to attend also  that very evening the caliph with his grandvizir giafar and mesrour chief of the eunuchs all three disguised as was their habit went out to take a stroll through the town  going down one street the caliphs attention was attracted by a noise and looking through a door which opened into a court he perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight  he hid himself in a dark corner and watched them  let us play at being the cadi said the brightest and quickest of them all i will be the cadi  bring before me ali cogia and the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold  the boys words recalled to the caliph the petition he had read that morning and he waited with interest to see what the children would do  the proposal was hailed with joy by the other children who had heard a great deal of talk about the matter and they quickly settled the part each one was to play  the cadi took his seat gravely and an officer introduced first ali cogia the plaintiff and then the merchant who was the defendant  ali cogia made a low bow and pleaded his cause point by point concluding by imploring the cadi not to inflict on him such a heavy loss  the cadi having heard his case turned to the merchant and inquired why he had not repaid ali cogia the sum in question  the false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchant had given to the cadi of bagdad and also offered to swear that he had told the truth  stop a moment said the little cadi before we come to oaths i should like to examine the vase with the olives  ali cogia he added have you got the vase with you and finding he had not the cadi continued go and get it and bring it to me  so ali cogia disappeared for an instant and then pretended to lay a vase at the feet of the cadi declaring it was his vase which he had given to the accused for safe custody and in order to be quite correct the cadi asked the merchant if he recognised it as the same vase  by his silence the merchant admitted the fact and the cadi then commanded to have the vase opened  ali cogia made a movement as if he was taking off the lid and the little cadi on his part made a pretence of peering into a vase  what beautiful olives he said i should like to taste one and pretending to put one in his mouth he added they are really excellent  but he went on it seems to me odd that olives seven years old should be as good as that  send for some dealers in olives and let us hear what they say  two children were presented to him as olive merchants and the cadi addressed them  tell me he said how long can olives be kept so as to be pleasant eating  my lord replied the merchants however much care is taken to preserve them they never last beyond the third year  they lose both taste and colour and are only fit to be thrown away  if that is so answered the little cadi examine this vase and tell me how long the olives have been in it  the olive merchants pretended to examine the olives and taste them then reported to the cadi that they were fresh and good  you are mistaken said he ali cogia declares he put them in that vase seven years ago  my lord returned the olive merchants we can assure you that the olives are those of the present year  and if you consult all the merchants in bagdad you will not find one to give a contrary opinion  the accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest but the cadi gave him no time  be silent he said you are a thief  take him away and hang him  so the game ended the children clapping their hands in applause and leading the criminal away to be hanged  harounalraschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the child who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself was to hear on the morrow  is there any other verdict possible he asked the grandvizir who was as much impressed as himself  i can imagine no better judgment  if the circumstances are really such as we have heard replied the grandvizir it seems to me your highness could only follow the example of this boy in the method of reasoning and also in your conclusions  then take careful note of this house said the caliph and bring me the boy tomorrow so that the affair may be tried by him in my presence  summon also the cadi to learn his duty from the mouth of a child  bid ali cogia bring his vase of olives and see that two dealers in olives are present  so saying the caliph returned to the palace  the next morning early the grandvizir went back to the house where they had seen the children playing and asked for the mistress and her children  three boys appeared and the grandvizir inquired which had represented the cadi in their game of the previous evening  the eldest and tallest changing colour confessed that it was he and to his mothers great alarm the grandvizir said that he had strict orders to bring him into the presence of the caliph  does he want to take my son from me cried the poor woman but the grandvizir hastened to calm her by assuring her that she should have the boy again in an hour and she would be quite satisfied when she knew the reason of the summons  so she dressed the boy in his best clothes and the two left the house  when the grandvizir presented the child to the caliph he was a little awed and confused and the caliph proceeded to explain why he had sent for him  approach my son he said kindly  i think it was you who judged the case of ali cogia and the merchant last night  i overheard you by chance and was very pleased with the way you conducted it today you will see the real ali cogia and the real merchant  seat yourself at once next to me  the caliph being seated on his throne with the boy next him the parties to the suit were ushered in  one by one they prostrated themselves and touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with their foreheads  when they rose up the caliph said  now speak  this child will give you justice and if more should be wanted i will see to it myself  ali cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the other but when the merchant offered to swear the same oath that he had taken before the cadi he was stopped by the child who said that before this was done he must first see the vase of olives  at these words ali cogia presented the vase to the caliph and uncovered it  the caliph took one of the olives tasted it and ordered the expert merchants to do the same  they pronounced the olives good and fresh that year  the boy informed them that ali cogia declared it was seven years since he had placed them in the vase to which they returned the same answer as the children had done  the accused merchant saw by this time that his condemnation was certain and tried to allege something in his defence  the boy had too much sense to order him to be hanged and looked at the caliph saying commander of the faithful this is not a game now it is for your highness to condemn him to death and not for me  then the caliph convinced that the man was a thief bade them take him away and hang him which was done but not before he had confessed his guilt and the place in which he had hidden ali cogias money  the caliph ordered the cadi to learn how to deal out justice from the mouth of a child and sent the boy home with a purse containing a hundred pieces of gold as a mark of his favour    the enchanted horse   it was the feast of the new year the oldest and most splendid of all the feasts in the kingdom of persia and the day had been spent by the king in the city of schiraz taking part in the magnificent spectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival  the sun was setting and the monarch was about to give his court the signal to retire when suddenly an indian appeared before his throne leading a horse richly harnessed and looking in every respect exactly like a real one  sire said he prostrating himself as he spoke although i make my appearance so late before your highness i can confidently assure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day can be compared to this horse if you will deign to cast your eyes upon him  i see nothing in it replied the king except a clever imitation of a real one and any skilled workman might do as much  sire returned the indian it is not of his outward form that i would speak but of the use that i can make of him  i have only to mount him and to wish myself in some special place and no matter how distant it may be in a very few moments i shall find myself there  it is this sire that makes the horse so marvellous and if your highness will allow me you can prove it for yourself  the king of persia who was interested in every thing out of the common and had never before come across a horse with such qualities bade the indian mount the animal and show what he could do  in an instant the man had vaulted on his back and inquired where the monarch wished to send him  do you see that mountain asked the king pointing to a huge mass that towered into the sky about three leagues from schiraz go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot  the words were hardly out of the kings mouth when the indian turned a screw placed in the horses neck close to the saddle and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air and was soon beyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes  in a quarter of an hour the indian was seen returning bearing in his hand the palm and guiding his horse to the foot of the throne he dismounted and laid the leaf before the king  now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the horse was capable than he longed to possess it himself and indeed so sure was he that the indian would be quite ready to sell it that he looked upon it as his own already  i never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was he remarked to the indian and i am grateful to you for having shown me my error said he  if you will sell it name your own price  sire replied the indian i never doubted that a sovereign so wise and accomplished as your highness would do justice to my horse when he once knew its power and i even went so far as to think it probable that you might wish to possess it  greatly as i prize it i will yield it up to your highness on one condition  the horse was not constructed by me but it was given me by the inventor in exchange for my only daughter who made me take a solemn oath that i would never part with it except for some object of equal value  name anything you like cried the monarch interrupting him  my kingdom is large and filled with fair cities  you have only to choose which you would prefer to become its ruler to the end of your life  sire answered the indian to whom the proposal did not seem nearly so generous as it appeared to the king i am most grateful to your highness for your princely offer and beseech you not to be offended with me if i say that i can only deliver up my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter  a shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words and prince firouz schah the heir apparent was filled with anger at the indians presumption  the king however thought that it would not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain such a delightful toy and while he was hesitating as to his answer the prince broke in  sire he said it is not possible that you can doubt for an instant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain  consider what you owe to yourself and to the blood of your ancestors  my son replied the king you speak nobly but you do not realise either the value of the horse or the fact that if i reject the proposal of the indian he will only make the same to some other monarch and i should be filled with despair at the thought that anyone but myself should own this seventh wonder of the world  of course i do not say that i shall accept his conditions and perhaps he may be brought to reason but meanwhile i should like you to examine the horse and with the owners permission to make trial of its powers  the indian who had overheard the kings speech thought that he saw in it signs of yielding to his proposal so he joyfully agreed to the monarchs wishes and came forward to help the prince to mount the horse and show him how to guide it  but before he had finished the young man turned the screw and was soon out of sight  they waited some time expecting that every moment he might be seen returning in the distance but at length the indian grew frightened and prostrating himself before the throne he said to the king sire your highness must have noticed that the prince in his impatience did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary to do in order to return to the place from which he started  i implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault and not to visit on me any misfortune that may occur  but why cried the king in a burst of fear and anger why did you not call him back when you saw him disappearing  sire replied the indian the rapidity of his movements took me so by surprise that he was out of hearing before i recovered my speech but we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth  but supposing he does answered the king what is to hinder the horse from descending straight into the sea or dashing him to pieces on the rocks  have no fears your highness said the indian the horse has the gift of passing over seas and of carrying his rider wherever he wishes to go  well your head shall answer for it returned the monarch and if in three months he is not safe back with me or at any rate does not send me news of his safety your life shall pay the penalty so saying he ordered his guards to seize the indian and throw him into prison  meanwhile prince firouz schah had gone gaily up into the air and for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher till the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains  then he began to think it was time to come down and took for granted that in order to do this it was only needful to turn the screw the reverse way but to his surprise and horror he found that turn as he might he did not make the smallest impression  he then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to get back to earth again and understood the danger in which he stood  luckily he did not lose his head and set about examining the horses neck with great care till at last to his intense joy he discovered a tiny little peg much smaller than the other close to the right ear  this he turned and found himself dropping to the earth though more slowly than he had left it  it was now dark and as the prince could see nothing he was obliged not without some feeling of disquiet to allow the horse to direct his own course and midnight was already passed before prince firouz schah again touched the ground faint and weary from his long ride and from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning  the first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out where he was and as far as he could discover in the thick darkness he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace with a balustrade of marble running round  in one corner of the terrace stood a small door opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace  some people might have hesitated before exploring further but not so the prince  i am doing no harm he said and whoever the owner may be he will not touch me when he sees i am unarmed and in dread of making a false step he went cautiously down the staircase  on a landing he noticed an open door beyond which was a faintly lighted hall  before entering the prince paused and listened but he heard nothing except the sound of men snoring  by the light of a lantern suspended from the roof he perceived a row of black guards sleeping each with a naked sword lying by him and he understood that the hall must form the anteroom to the chamber of some queen or princess  standing quite still prince firouz schah looked about him till his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom and he noticed a bright light shining through a curtain in one corner  he then made his way softly towards it and drawing aside its folds passed into a magnificent chamber full of sleeping women all lying on low couches except one who was on a sofa and this one he knew must be the princess  gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her and saw that she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld  but fascinated though he was he was well aware of the danger of his position as one cry of surprise would awake the guards and cause his certain death  so sinking quietly on his knees he took hold of the sleeve of the princess and drew her arm lightly towards him  the princess opened her eyes and seeing before her a handsome welldressed man she remained speechless with astonishment  this favourable moment was seized by the prince who bowing low while he knelt thus addressed her  you behold madame a prince in distress son to the king of persia who owing to an adventure so strange that you will scarcely believe it finds himself here a suppliant for your protection  but yesterday i was in my fathers court engaged in the celebration of our most solemn festival today i am in an unknown land in danger of my life  now the princess whose mercy prince firouz schah implored was the eldest daughter of the king of bengal who was enjoying rest and change in the palace her father had built her at a little distance from the capital  she listened kindly to what he had to say and then answered  prince be not uneasy hospitality and humanity are practised as widely in bengal as they are in persia  the protection you ask will be given you by all  you have my word for it  and as the prince was about to thank her for her goodness she added quickly however great may be my curiosity to learn by what means you have travelled here so speedily i know that you must be faint for want of food so i shall give orders to my women to take you to one of my chambers where you will be provided with supper and left to repose  by this time the princesss attendants were all awake and listening to the conversation  at a sign from their mistress they rose dressed themselves hastily and snatching up some of the tapers which lighted the room conducted the prince to a large and lofty room where two of the number prepared his bed and the rest went down to the kitchen from which they soon returned with all sorts of dishes  then showing him cupboards filled with dresses and linen they quitted the room  during their absence the princess of bengal who had been greatly struck by the beauty of the prince tried in vain to go to sleep again it was of no use  she felt broad awake and when her women entered the room she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted and what they thought of him  madame they replied it is of course impossible for us to tell what impression this young man has made on you  for ourselves we think you would be fortunate if the king your father should allow you to marry anyone so amiable  certainly there is no one in the court of bengal who can be compared with him  these flattering observations were by no means displeasing to the princess but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she merely said you are all a set of chatterboxes go back to bed and let me sleep  when she dressed the following morning her maids noticed that contrary to her usual habit the princess was very particular about her toilette and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three times over  for she said to herself if my appearance was not displeasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition i was how much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all my charms  then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamonds she could find with a necklace bracelets and girdle all of precious stones  and over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the richest stuff in all the indies that no one was allowed to wear except members of the royal family  when she was fully dressed according to her wishes she sent to know if the prince of persia was awake and ready to receive her as she desired to present herself before him  when the princesss messenger entered his room prince firouz schah was in the act of leaving it to inquire if he might be allowed to pay his homage to her mistress  but on hearing the princesss wishes he at once gave way  her will is my law he said i am only here to obey her orders  in a few moments the princess herself appeared and after the usual compliments had passed between them the princess sat down on a sofa and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him an audience in her own apartments  had i done so she said we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs who has the right to enter whenever it pleases him whereas this is forbidden ground  i am all impatience to learn the wonderful accident which has procured the pleasure of your arrival and that is why i have come to you here where no one can intrude upon us  begin then i entreat you without delay  so the prince began at the beginning and told all the story of the festival of nedrouz held yearly in persia and of the splendid spectacles celebrated in its honour  but when he came to the enchanted horse the princess declared that she could never have imagined anything half so surprising  well then continued the prince you can easily understand how the king my father who has a passion for all curious things was seized with a violent desire to possess this horse and asked the indian what sum he would take for it  the mans answer was absolutely absurd as you will agree when i tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess my sister but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked and i was beside myself with rage i saw to my despair that my father could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it deserved  i tried to argue with him but in vain  he only begged me to examine the horse with a view as i quite understood of making me more sensible of its value  to please my father i mounted the horse and without waiting for any instructions from the indian turned the peg as i had seen him do  in an instant i was soaring upwards much quicker than an arrow could fly and i felt as if i must be getting so near the sky that i should soon hit my head against it  i could see nothing beneath me and for some time was so confused that i did not even know in what direction i was travelling  at last when it was growing dark i found another screw and on turning it the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth  i was forced to trust to chance and to see what fate had in store and it was already past midnight when i found myself on the roof of this palace  i crept down the little staircase and made directly for a light which i perceived through an open doori peeped cautiously in and saw as you will guess the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor  i knew the risks i ran but my need was so great that i paid no attention to them and stole safely past your guards to the curtain which concealed your doorway  the rest princess you know and it only remains for me to thank you for the kindness you have shown me and to assure you of my gratitude by the law of nations i am already your slave and i have only my heart that is my own to offer you  but what am i saying  my own alas madame it was yours from the first moment i beheld you  the air with which he said these words could have left no doubt on the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms and the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty  prince returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to speak you have given me the greatest pleasure and i have followed you closely in all your adventures and though you are positively sitting before me i even trembled at your danger in the upper regions of the air  let me say what a debt i owe to the chance that has led you to my house you could have entered none which would have given you a warmer welcome  as to your being a slave of course that is merely a joke and my reception must itself have assured you that you are as free here as at your fathers court  as to your heart continued she in tones of encouragement i am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago to some princess who is well worthy of it and i could not think of being the cause of your unfaithfulness to her  prince firouz schah was about to protest that there was no lady with any prior claims but he was stopped by the entrance of one of the princesss attendants who announced that dinner was served and after all neither was sorry for the interruption  dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment and the table was covered with delicious fruits while during the repast richly dressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments  after the prince and princess had finished they passed into a small room hung with blue and gold looking out into a garden stocked with flowers and arbutus trees quite different from any that were to be found in persia  princess observed the young man till now i had always believed that persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely gardens than any kingdom upon earth  but my eyes have been opened and i begin to perceive that wherever there is a great king he will surround himself with buildings worthy of him  prince replied the princess of bengal i have no idea what a persian palace is like so i am unable to make comparisons  i do not wish to depreciate my own palace but i can assure you that it is very poor beside that of the king my father as you will agree when you have been there to greet him as i hope you will shortly do  now the princess hoped that by bringing about a meeting between the prince and her father the king would be so struck with the young mans distinguished air and fine manners that he would offer him his daughter to wife  but the reply of the prince of persia to her suggestion was not quite what she wished  madame he said by taking advantage of your proposal to visit the palace of the king of bengal i should satisfy not merely my curiosity but also the sentiments of respect with which i regard him  but princess i am persuaded that you will feel with me that i cannot possibly present myself before so great a sovereign without the attendants suitable to my rank  he would think me an adventurer  if that is all she answered you can get as many attendants here as you please  there are plenty of persian merchants and as for money my treasury is always open to you  take what you please  prince firouz schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on the part of the princess and was much touched by it  still his passion which increased every moment did not make him forget his duty  so he replied without hesitation  i do not know princess how to express my gratitude for your obliging offer which i would accept at once if it were not for the recollection of all the uneasiness the king my father must be suffering on my account  i should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon me if i did not return to him at the first possible moment  for while i am enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses he is i am quite convinced plunged in the deepest grief having lost all hope of seeing me again  i am sure you will understand my position and will feel that to remain away one instant longer than is necessary would not only be ungrateful on my part but perhaps even a crime for how do i know if my absence may not break his heart  but continued the prince having obeyed the voice of my conscience i shall count the moments when with your gracious permission i may present myself before the king of bengal not as a wanderer but as a prince to implore the favour of your hand  my father has always informed me that in my marriage i shall be left quite free but i am persuaded that i have only to describe your generosity for my wishes to become his own  the princess of bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanation offered by prince firouz schah but she was much disturbed at his intention of departing at once for she feared that no sooner had he left her than the impression she had made on him would fade away  so she made one more effort to keep him and after assuring him that she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father begged him to give her a day or two more of his company  in common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this request and the princess set about inventing every kind of amusement for him and succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost unnoticed in balls spectacles and in hunting of which when unattended by danger the princess was passionately fond  but at last one day he declared seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer and entreated her to put no further obstacles in his way promising at the same time to return as soon as he could with all the magnificence due both to her and to himself  princess he added it may be that in your heart you class me with those false lovers whose devotion cannot stand the test of absence  if you do you wrong me and were it not for fear of offending you i would beseech you to come with me for my life can only be happy when passed with you  as for your reception at the persian court it will be as warm as your merits deserve and as for what concerns the king of bengal he must be much more indifferent to your welfare than you have led me to believe if he does not give his consent to our marriage  the princess could not find words in which to reply to the arguments of the prince of persia but her silence and her downcast eyes spoke for her and declared that she had no objection to accompanying him on his travels  the only difficulty that occurred to her was that prince firouz schah did not know how to manage the horse and she dreaded lest they might find themselves in the same plight as before  but the prince soothed her fears so successfully that she soon had no other thought than to arrange for their flight so secretly that no one in the palace should suspect it  this was done and early the following morning when the whole palace was wrapped in sleep she stole up on to the roof where the prince was already awaiting her with his horses head towards persia  he mounted first and helped the princess up behind then when she was firmly seated with her hands holding tightly to his belt he touched the screw and the horse began to leave the earth quickly behind him  he travelled with his accustomed speed and prince firouz schah guided him so well that in two hours and a half from the time of starting he saw the capital of persia lying beneath him  he determined to alight neither in the great square from which he had started nor in the sultans palace but in a country house at a little distance from the town  here he showed the princess a beautiful suite of rooms and begged her to rest while he informed his father of their arrival and prepared a public reception worthy of her rank  then he ordered a horse to be saddled and set out  all the way through the streets he was welcomed with shouts of joy by the people who had long lost all hope of seeing him again  on reaching the palace he found the sultan surrounded by his ministers all clad in the deepest mourning and his father almost went out of his mind with surprise and delight at the mere sound of his sons voice when he had calmed down a little he begged the prince to relate his adventures  the prince at once seized the opening thus given him and told the whole story of his treatment by the princess of bengal not even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him  and sire ended the prince having given my royal word that you would not refuse your consent to our marriage i persuaded her to return with me on the indians horse  i have left her in one of your highnesss country houses where she is waiting anxiously to be assured that i have not promised in vain  as he said this the prince was about to throw himself at the feet of the sultan but his father prevented him and embracing him again said eagerly  my son not only do i gladly consent to your marriage with the princess of bengal but i will hasten to pay my respects to her and to thank her in my own person for the benefits she has conferred on you i will then bring her back with me and make all arrangements for the wedding to be celebrated today  so the sultan gave orders that the habits of mourning worn by the people should be thrown off and that there should be a concert of drums trumpets and cymbals  also that the indian should be taken from prison and brought before him  his commands were obeyed and the indian was led into his presence surrounded by guards  i have kept you locked up said the sultan so that in case my son was lost your life should pay the penalty  he has now returned so take your horse and begone for ever  the indian hastily quitted the presence of the sultan and when he was outside he inquired of the man who had taken him out of prison where the prince had really been all this time and what he had been doing they told him the whole story and how the princess of bengal was even then awaiting in the country palace the consent of the sultan which at once put into the indians head a plan of revenge for the treatment he had experienced  going straight to the country house he informed the doorkeeper who was left in charge that he had been sent by the sultan and by the prince of persia to fetch the princess on the enchanted horse and to bring her to the palace  the doorkeeper knew the indian by sight and was of course aware that nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison by the sultan and seeing him at liberty the man took for granted that he was speaking the truth and made no difficulty about leading him before the princess of bengal while on her side hearing that he had come from the prince the lady gladly consented to do what he wished  the indian delighted with the success of his scheme mounted the horse assisted the princess to mount behind him and turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving the palace in schiraz for the country house followed closely by the sultan and all the court knowing this the indian deliberately steered the horse right above the city in order that his revenge for his unjust imprisonment might be all the quicker and sweeter  when the sultan of persia saw the horse and its riders he stopped short with astonishment and horror and broke out into oaths and curses which the indian heard quite unmoved knowing that he was perfectly safe from pursuit  but mortified and furious as the sultan was his feelings were nothing to those of prince firouz schah when he saw the object of his passionate devotion being borne rapidly away and while he was struck speechless with grief and remorse at not having guarded her better she vanished swiftly out of his sight  what was he to do  should he follow his father into the palace and there give reins to his despair  both his love and his courage alike forbade it and he continued his way to the palace  the sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of what folly he had been guilty and flinging himself at his masters feet implored his pardon rise said the prince i am the cause of this misfortune and not you  go and find me the dress of a dervish but beware of saying it is for me  at a short distance from the country house a convent of dervishes was situated and the superior or scheih was the doorkeepers friend  so by means of a false story made up on the spur of the moment it was easy enough to get hold of a dervishs dress which the prince at once put on instead of his own  disguised like this and concealing about him a box of pearls and diamonds he had intended as a present to the princess he left the house at nightfall uncertain where he should go but firmly resolved not to return without her  meanwhile the indian had turned the horse in such a direction that before many hours had passed it had entered a wood close to the capital of the kingdom of cashmere  feeling very hungry and supposing that the princess also might be in want of food he brought his steed down to the earth and left the princess in a shady place on the banks of a clear stream  at first when the princess had found herself alone the idea had occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself  but as she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left bengal she felt she was too weak to venture far and was obliged to abandon her design  on the return of the indian with meats of various kinds she began to eat voraciously and soon had regained sufficient courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks  goaded by his threats she sprang to her feet calling loudly for help and luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen who rode up to inquire what was the matter  now the leader of these horsemen was the sultan of cashmere returning from the chase and he instantly turned to the indian to inquire who he was and whom he had with him  the indian rudely answered that it was his wife and there was no occasion for anyone else to interfere between them  the princess who of course was ignorant of the rank of her deliverer denied altogether the indians story  my lord she cried whoever you may be put no faith in this impostor  he is an abominable magician who has this day torn me from the prince of persia my destined husband and has brought me here on this enchanted horse  she would have continued but her tears choked her and the sultan of cashmere convinced by her beauty and her distinguished air of the truth of her tale ordered his followers to cut off the indians head which was done immediately  but rescued though she was from one peril it seemed as if she had only fallen into another  the sultan commanded a horse to be given her and conducted her to his own palace where he led her to a beautiful apartment and selected female slaves to wait on her and eunuchs to be her guard  then without allowing her time to thank him for all he had done he bade her repose saying she should tell him her adventures on the following day  the princess fell asleep flattering herself that she had only to relate her story for the sultan to be touched by compassion and to restore her to the prince without delay  but a few hours were to undeceive her  when the king of cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before he had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princess becoming his wife and at daybreak proclamation of his intention was made throughout the town by the sound of drums trumpets cymbals and other instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy  the princess of bengal was early awakened by the noise but she did not for one moment imagine that it had anything to do with her till the sultan arriving as soon as she was dressed to inquire after her health informed her that the trumpet blasts she heard were part of the solemn marriage ceremonies for which he begged her to prepare  this unexpected announcement caused the princess such terror that she sank down in a dead faint  the slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid and the sultan himself did his best to bring her back to consciousness but for a long while it was all to no purpose  at length her senses began slowly to come back to her and then rather than break faith with the prince of persia by consenting to such a marriage she determined to feign madness  so she began by saying all sorts of absurdities and using all kinds of strange gestures while the sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise  but as this sudden seizure showed no sign of abating he left her to her women ordering them to take the greatest care of her  still as the day went on the malady seemed to become worse and by night it was almost violent  days passed in this manner till at last the sultan of cashmere decided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult together over her sad state  their answer was that madness is of so many different kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion on the case without seeing the princess so the sultan gave orders that they were to be introduced into her chamber one by one every man according to his rank  this decision had been foreseen by the princess who knew quite well that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse the most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectly good health and that her madness was feigned so as each man approached she broke out into such violent paroxysms that not one dared to lay a finger on her  a few who pretended to be cleverer than the rest declared that they could diagnose sick people only from sight ordered her certain potions which she made no difficulty about taking as she was persuaded they were all harmless  when the sultan of cashmere saw that the court doctors could do nothing towards curing the princess he called in those of the city who fared no better  then he had recourse to the most celebrated physicians in the other large towns but finding that the task was beyond their science he finally sent messengers into the other neighbouring states with a memorandum containing full particulars of the princesss madness offering at the same time to pay the expenses of any physician who would come and see for himself and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her  in answer to this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into cashmere but they naturally were not more successful than the rest had been as the cure depended neither on them nor their skill but only on the princess herself  it was during this time that prince firouz schah wandering sadly and hopelessly from place to place arrived in a large city of india where he heard a great deal of talk about the princess of bengal who had gone out of her senses on the very day that she was to have been married to the sultan of cashmere  this was quite enough to induce him to take the road to cashmere and to inquire at the first inn at which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story  when he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he had so long lost he set about devising a plan for her rescue  the first thing he did was to procure a doctors robe so that his dress added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his travels might unmistakably proclaim his profession  he then lost no time in going to the palace where he obtained an audience of the chief usher and while apologising for his boldness in presuming to think that he could cure the princess where so many others had failed declared that he had the secret of certain remedies which had hitherto never failed of their effect  the chief usher assured him that he was heartily welcome and that the sultan would receive him with pleasure and in case of success he would gain a magnificent reward  when the prince of persia in the disguise of a physician was brought before him the sultan wasted no time in talking beyond remarking that the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into transports of rage he then led the prince up to a room under the roof which had an opening through which he might observe the princess without himself being seen  the prince looked and beheld the princess reclining on a sofa with tears in her eyes singing softly to herself a song bewailing her sad destiny which had deprived her perhaps for ever of a being she so tenderly loved  the young mans heart beat fast as he listened for he needed no further proof that her madness was feigned and that it was love of him which had caused her to resort to this species of trick he softly left his hidingplace and returned to the sultan to whom he reported that he was sure from certain signs that the princesss malady was not incurable but that he must see her and speak with her alone  the sultan made no difficulty in consenting to this and commanded that he should be ushered in to the princesss apartment  the moment she caught sight of his physicians robe she sprang from her seat in a fury and heaped insults upon him  the prince took no notice of her behaviour and approaching quite close so that his words might be heard by her alone he said in a low whisper look at me princess and you will see that i am no doctor but the prince of persia who has come to set you free  at the sound of his voice the princess of bengal suddenly grew calm and an expression of joy overspread her face such as only comes when what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly happens to us  for some time she was too enchanted to speak and prince firouz schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her all that had occurred his despair at watching her disappear before his very eyes the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world and his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at cashmere  when he had finished he begged in his turn that the princess would tell him how she had come there so that he might the better devise some means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the sultan  it needed but a few words from the princess to make him acquainted with the whole situation and how she had been forced to play the part of a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage with the sultan who had not had sufficient politeness even to ask her consent  if necessary she added she had resolved to die sooner than permit herself to be forced into such a union and break faith with a prince whom she loved  the prince then inquired if she knew what had become of the enchanted horse since the indians death but the princess could only reply that she had heard nothing about it  still she did not suppose that the horse could have been forgotten by the sultan after all she had told him of its value  to this the prince agreed and they consulted together over a plan by which she might be able to make her escape and return with him into persia  and as the first step she was to dress herself with care and receive the sultan with civility when he visited her next morning  the sultan was transported with delight on learning the result of the interview and his opinion of the doctors skill was raised still higher when on the following day the princess behaved towards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete cure would not be long delayed  however he contented himself with assuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician and to repose entire confidence in him then he retired without awaiting any reply from the princess  the prince of persia left the room at the same time and asked if he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the princess of bengal had reached cashmere which was so far distant from her fathers kingdom and how she came to be there alone  the sultan thought the question very natural and told him the same story that the princess of bengal had done adding that he had ordered the enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity though he was quite ignorant how it could be used  sire replied the physician your highnesss tale has supplied me with the clue i needed to complete the recovery of the princess during her voyage hither on an enchanted horse a portion of its enchantment has by some means been communicated to her person and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which i possess the secret  if your highness will deign to consent and to give the court and the people one of the most astonishing spectacles they have ever witnessed command the horse to be brought into the big square outside the palace and leave the rest to me  i promise that in a very few moments in presence of all the assembled multitude you shall see the princess as healthy both in mind and body as ever she was in her life and in order to make the spectacle as impressive as possible i would suggest that she should be richly dressed and covered with the noblest jewels of the crown  the sultan readily agreed to all that the prince proposed and the following morning he desired that the enchanted horse should be taken from the treasury and brought into the great square of the palace soon the rumour began to spread through the town that something extraordinary was about to happen and such a crowd began to collect that the guards had to be called out to keep order and to make a way for the enchanted horse  when all was ready the sultan appeared and took his place on a platform surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of his court when they were seated the princess of bengal was seen leaving the palace accompanied by the ladies who had been assigned to her by the sultan  she slowly approached the enchanted horse and with the help of her ladies she mounted on its back  directly she was in the saddle with her feet in the stirrups and the bridle in her hand the physician placed around the horse some large braziers full of burning coals into each of which he threw a perfume composed of all sorts of delicious scents  then he crossed his hands over his breast and with lowered eyes walked three times round the horse muttering the while certain words  soon there arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke which almost concealed both the horse and princess and this was the moment for which he had been waiting  springing lightly up behind the lady he leaned forward and turned the peg and as the horse darted up into the air he cried aloud so that his words were heard by all present sultan of cashmere when you wish to marry princesses who have sought your protection learn first to gain their consent  it was in this way that the prince of persia rescued the princess of bengal and returned with her to persia where they descended this time before the palace of the king himself  the marriage was only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as brilliant as possible and as soon as the rejoicings were over an ambassador was sent to the king of bengal to inform him of what had passed and to ask his approbation of the alliance between the two countries which he heartily gave    the story of two sisters who were jealous of their younger sister   once upon a time there reigned over persia a sultan named kosrouschah who from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a disguise and seeking adventures in all parts of the city accompanied by one of his officers disguised like himself  and no sooner was his father buried and the ceremonies over that marked his accession to the throne than the young man hastened to throw off his robes of state and calling to his vizir to make ready likewise stole out in the simple dress of a private citizen into the less known streets of the capital  passing down a lonely street the sultan heard womens voices in loud discussion and peeping through a crack in the door he saw three sisters sitting on a sofa in a large hall talking in a very lively and earnest manner  judging from the few words that reached his ear they were each explaining what sort of men they wished to marry  i ask nothing better cried the eldest than to have the sultans baker for a husband  think of being able to eat as much as one wanted of that delicious bread that is baked for his highness alone  let us see if your wish is as good as mine  i replied the second sister should be quite content with the sultans head cook  what delicate stews i should feast upon  and as i am persuaded that the sultans bread is used all through the palace i should have that into the bargain  you see my dear sister my taste is as good as yours  it was now the turn of the youngest sister who was by far the most beautiful of the three and had besides more sense than the other two  as for me she said i should take a higher flight and if we are to wish for husbands nothing less than the sultan himself will do for me  the sultan was so much amused by the conversation he had overheard that he made up his mind to gratify their wishes and turning to the grandvizir he bade him note the house and on the following morning to bring the ladies into his presence  the grandvizir fulfilled his commission and hardly giving them time to change their dresses desired the three sisters to follow him to the palace  here they were presented one by one and when they had bowed before the sultan the sovereign abruptly put the question to them  tell me do you remember what you wished for last night when you were making merry  fear nothing but answer me the truth  these words which were so unexpected threw the sisters into great confusion their eyes fell and the blushes of the youngest did not fail to make an impression on the heart of the sultan  all three remained silent and he hastened to continue  do not be afraid i have not the slightest intention of giving you pain and let me tell you at once that i know the wishes formed by each one  you he said turning to the youngest who desired to have me for an husband shall be satisfied this very day  and you he added addressing himself to the other two shall be married at the same moment to my baker and to my chief cook  when the sultan had finished speaking the three sisters flung themselves at his feet and the youngest faltered out oh sire since you know my foolish words believe i pray you that they were only said in joke  i am unworthy of the honour you propose to do me and i can only ask pardon for my boldness  the other sisters also tried to excuse themselves but the sultan would hear nothing  no no he said my mind is made up  your wishes shall be accomplished  so the three weddings were celebrated that same day but with a great difference  that of the youngest was marked by all the magnificence that was customary at the marriage of the shah of persia while the festivities attending the nuptials of the sultans baker and his chief cook were only such as were suitable to their conditions  this though quite natural was highly displeasing to the elder sisters who fell into a passion of jealousy which in the end caused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people  and the first time that they had the opportunity of speaking to each other which was not till several days later at a public bath they did not attempt to disguise their feelings  can you possibly understand what the sultan saw in that little cat said one to the other for him to be so fascinated by her  he must be quite blind returned the wife of the chief cook  as for her looking a little younger than we do what does that matter  you would have made a far better sultana than she  oh i say nothing of myself replied the elder and if the sultan had chosen you it would have been all very well but it really grieves me that he should have selected a wretched little creature like that however i will be revenged on her somehow and i beg you will give me your help in the matter and to tell me anything that you can think of that is likely to mortify her  in order to carry out their wicked scheme the two sisters met constantly to talk over their ideas though all the while they pretended to be as friendly as ever towards the sultana who on her part invariably treated them with kindness  for a long time no plan occurred to the two plotters that seemed in the least likely to meet with success but at length the expected birth of an heir gave them the chance for which they had been hoping  they obtained permission of the sultan to take up their abode in the palace for some weeks and never left their sister night or day  when at last a little boy beautiful as the sun was born they laid him in his cradle and carried it down to a canal which passed through the grounds of the palace  then leaving it to its fate they informed the sultan that instead of the son he had so fondly desired the sultana had given birth to a puppy  at this dreadful news the sultan was so overcome with rage and grief that it was with great difficulty that the grandvizir managed to save the sultana from his wrath  meanwhile the cradle continued to float peacefully along the canal till on the outskirts of the royal gardens it was suddenly perceived by the intendant one of the highest and most respected officials in the kingdom  go he said to a gardener who was working near and get that cradle out for me  the gardener did as he was bid and soon placed the cradle in the hands of the intendant  the official was much astonished to see that the cradle which he had supposed to be empty contained a baby which young though it was already gave promise of great beauty  having no children himself although he had been married some years it at once occurred to him that here was a child which he could take and bring up as his own and bidding the man pick up the cradle and follow him he turned towards home  my wife he exclaimed as he entered the room heaven has denied us any children but here is one that has been sent in their place  send for a nurse and i will do what is needful publicly to recognise it as my son  the wife accepted the baby with joy and though the intendant saw quite well that it must have come from the royal palace he did not think it was his business to inquire further into the mystery  the following year another prince was born and sent adrift but happily for the baby the intendant of the gardens again was walking by the canal and carried it home as before  the sultan naturally enough was still more furious the second time than the first but when the same curious accident was repeated in the third year he could control himself no longer and to the great joy of the jealous sisters commanded that the sultana should be executed but the poor lady was so much beloved at court that not even the dread of sharing her fate could prevent the grandvizir and the courtiers from throwing themselves at the sultans feet and imploring him not to inflict so cruel a punishment for what after all was not her fault  let her live entreated the grandvizir and banish her from your presence for the rest of her days  that in itself will be punishment enough  his first passion spent the sultan had regained his selfcommand let her live then he said since you have it so much at heart  but if i grant her life it shall only be on one condition which shall make her daily pray for death  let a box be built for her at the door of the principal mosque and let the window of the box be always open there she shall sit in the coarsest clothes and every mussulman who enters the mosque shall spit in her face in passing  anyone that refuses to obey shall be exposed to the same punishment himself  you vizir will see that my orders are carried out  the grandvizir saw that it was useless to say more and full of triumph the sisters watched the building of the box and then listened to the jeers of the people at the helpless sultana sitting inside  but the poor lady bore herself with so much dignity and meekness that it was not long before she had won the sympathy of those that were best among the crowd  but it is now time to return to the fate of the third baby this time a princess  like its brothers it was found by the intendant of the gardens and adopted by him and his wife and all three were brought up with the greatest care and tenderness  as the children grew older their beauty and air of distinction became more and more marked and their manners had all the grace and ease that is proper to people of high birth  the princes had been named by their fosterfather bahman and perviz after two of the ancient kings of persia while the princess was called parizade or the child of the genii  the intendant was careful to bring them up as befitted their real rank and soon appointed a tutor to teach the young princes how to read and write  and the princess determined not to be left behind showed herself so anxious to learn with her brothers that the intendant consented to her joining in their lessons and it was not long before she knew as much as they did  from that time all their studies were done in common  they had the best masters for the fine arts geography poetry history and science and even for sciences which are learned by few and every branch seemed so easy to them that their teachers were astonished at the progress they made  the princess had a passion for music and could sing and play upon all sorts of instruments she could also ride and drive as well as her brothers shoot with a bow and arrow and throw a javelin with the same skill as they and sometimes even better  in order to set off these accomplishments the intendant resolved that his foster children should not be pent up any longer in the narrow borders of the palace gardens where he had always lived so he bought a splendid country house a few miles from the capital surrounded by an immense park  this park he filled with wild beasts of various sorts so that the princes and princess might hunt as much as they pleased  when everything was ready the intendant threw himself at the sultans feet and after referring to his age and his long services begged his highnesss permission to resign his post  this was granted by the sultan in a few gracious words and he then inquired what reward he could give to his faithful servant  but the intendant declared that he wished for nothing except the continuance of his highnesss favour and prostrating himself once more he retired from the sultans presence  five or six months passed away in the pleasures of the country when death attacked the intendant so suddenly that he had no time to reveal the secret of their birth to his adopted children and as his wife had long been dead also it seemed as if the princes and the princess would never know that they had been born to a higher station than the one they filled  their sorrow for their father was very deep and they lived quietly on in their new home without feeling any desire to leave it for court gaieties or intrigues  one day the princes as usual went out to hunt but their sister remained alone in her apartments  while they were gone an old mussulman devotee appeared at the door and asked leave to enter as it was the hour of prayer  the princess sent orders at once that the old woman was to be taken to the private oratory in the grounds and when she had finished her prayers was to be shown the house and gardens and then to be brought before her  although the old woman was very pious she was not at all indifferent to the magnificence of all around her which she seemed to understand as well as to admire and when she had seen it all she was led by the servants before the princess who was seated in a room which surpassed in splendour all the rest  my good woman said the princess pointing to a sofa come and sit beside me  i am delighted at the opportunity of speaking for a few moments with so holy a person  the old woman made some objections to so much honour being done her but the princess refused to listen and insisted that her guest should take the best seat and as she thought she must be tired ordered refreshments  while the old woman was eating the princess put several questions to her as to her mode of life and the pious exercises she practiced and then inquired what she thought of the house now that she had seen it  madam replied the pilgrim one must be hard indeed to please to find any fault  it is beautiful comfortable and well ordered and it is impossible to imagine anything more lovely than the garden  but since you ask me i must confess that it lacks three things to make it absolutely perfect  and what can they be cried the princess  only tell me and i will lose no time in getting them  the three things madam replied the old woman are first the talking bird whose voice draws all other singing birds to it to join in chorus  and second the singing tree where every leaf is a song that is never silent  and lastly the golden water of which it is only needful to pour a single drop into a basin for it to shoot up into a fountain which will never be exhausted nor will the basin ever overflow  oh how can i thank you cried the princess for telling me of such treasures  but add i pray you to your goodness by further informing me where i can find them  madam replied the pilgrim i should ill repay the hospitality you have shown me if i refused to answer your question  the three things of which i have spoken are all to be found in one place on the borders of this kingdom towards india  your messenger has only to follow the road that passes by your house for twenty days and at the end of that time he is to ask the first person he meets for the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water she then rose and bidding farewell to the princess went her way  the old woman had taken her departure so abruptly that the princess parizade did not perceive till she was really gone that the directions were hardly clear enough to enable the search to be successful  and she was still thinking of the subject and how delightful it would be to possess such rarities when the princes her brothers returned from the chase  what is the matter my sister asked prince bahman why are you so grave  are you ill  or has anything happened  princess parizade did not answer directly but at length she raised her eyes and replied that there was nothing wrong  but there must be something persisted prince bahman for you to have changed so much during the short time we have been absent  hide nothing from us i beseech you unless you wish us to believe that the confidence we have always had in one another is now to cease  when i said that it was nothing said the princess moved by his words i meant that it was nothing that affected you although i admit that it is certainly of some importance to me  like myself you have always thought this house that our father built for us was perfect in every respect but only today i have learned that three things are still lacking to complete it  these are the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water  after explaining the peculiar qualities of each the princess continued  it was a mussulman devotee who told me all this and where they might all be found  perhaps you will think that the house is beautiful enough as it is and that we can do quite well without them but in this i cannot agree with you and i shall never be content until i have got them  so counsel me i pray whom to send on the undertaking  my dear sister replied prince bahman that you should care about the matter is quite enough even if we took no interest in it ourselves  but we both feel with you and i claim as the elder the right to make the first attempt if you will tell me where i am to go and what steps i am to take  prince perviz at first objected that being the head of the family his brother ought not to be allowed to expose himself to danger but prince bahman would hear nothing and retired to make the needful preparations for his journey  the next morning prince bahman got up very early and after bidding farewell to his brother and sister mounted his horse  but just as he was about to touch it with his whip he was stopped by a cry from the princess  oh perhaps after all you may never come back one never can tell what accidents may happen  give it up i implore you for i would a thousand times rather lose the talking bird and the singing tree and the golden water than that you should run into danger  my dear sister answered the prince accidents only happen to unlucky people and i hope that i am not one of them  but as everything is uncertain i promise you to be very careful  take this knife he continued handing her one that hung sheathed from his belt and every now and then draw it out and look at it  as long as it keeps bright and clean as it is today you will know that i am living but if the blade is spotted with blood it will be a sign that i am dead and you shall weep for me  so saying prince bahman bade them farewell once more and started on the high road well mounted and fully armed  for twenty days he rode straight on turning neither to the right hand nor to the left till he found himself drawing near the frontiers of persia  seated under a tree by the wayside he noticed a hideous old man with a long white moustache and beard that almost fell to his feet  his nails had grown to an enormous length and on his head he wore a huge hat which served him for an umbrella  prince bahman who remembering the directions of the old woman had been since sunrise on the lookout for some one recognised the old man at once to be a dervish  he dismounted from his horse and bowed low before the holy man saying by way of greeting my father may your days be long in the land and may all your wishes be fulfilled  the dervish did his best to reply but his moustache was so thick that his words were hardly intelligible and the prince perceiving what was the matter took a pair of scissors from his saddle pockets and requested permission to cut off some of the moustache as he had a question of great importance to ask the dervish  the dervish made a sign that he might do as he liked and when a few inches of his hair and beard had been pruned all round the prince assured the holy man that he would hardly believe how much younger he looked  the dervish smiled at his compliments and thanked him for what he had done  let me he said show you my gratitude for making me more comfortable by telling me what i can do for you  gentle dervish replied prince bahman i come from far and i seek the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water  i know that they are to be found somewhere in these parts but i am ignorant of the exact spot  tell me i pray you if you can so that i may not have travelled on a useless quest  while he was speaking the prince observed a change in the countenance of the dervish who waited for some time before he made reply  my lord he said at last i do know the road for which you ask but your kindness and the friendship i have conceived for you make me loth to point it out  but why not inquired the prince  what danger can there be  the very greatest danger answered the dervish  other men as brave as you have ridden down this road and have put me that question  i did my best to turn them also from their purpose but it was of no use not one of them would listen to my words and not one of them came back  be warned in time and seek to go no further  i am grateful to you for your interest in me said prince bahman and for the advice you have given though i cannot follow it  but what dangers can there be in the adventure which courage and a good sword cannot meet  and suppose answered the dervish that your enemies are invisible how then  nothing will make me give it up replied the prince and for the last time i ask you to tell me where i am to go  when the dervish saw that the princes mind was made up he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him and held it out  if it must be so he said with a sigh take this and when you have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you  it will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain and when it stops you will stop also  you will then throw the bridle on your horses neck without any fear of his straying and will dismount  on each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones and will hear a multitude of insulting voices but pay no heed to them and above all beware of ever turning your head if you do you will instantly become a black stone like the rest  for those stones are in reality men like yourself who have been on the same quest and have failed as i fear that you may fail also  if you manage to avoid this pitfall and to reach the top of the mountain you will find there the talking bird in a splendid cage and you can ask of him where you are to seek the singing tree and the golden water  that is all i have to say  you know what you have to do and what to avoid but if you are wise you will think of it no more but return whence you have come  the prince smilingly shook his head and thanking the dervish once more he sprang on his horse and threw the ball before him  the ball rolled along the road so fast that prince bahman had much difficulty in keeping up with it and it never relaxed its speed till the foot of the mountain was reached  then it came to a sudden halt and the prince at once got down and flung the bridle on his horses neck  he paused for a moment and looked round him at the masses of black stones with which the sides of the mountain were covered and then began resolutely to ascend  he had hardly gone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around him although not another creature was in sight  who is this imbecile cried some stop him at once  kill him shrieked others help robbers murderers help help  oh let him alone sneered another and this was the most trying of all he is such a beautiful young man i am sure the bird and the cage must have been kept for him  at first the prince took no heed to all this clamour but continued to press forward on his way  unfortunately this conduct instead of silencing the voices only seemed to irritate them the more and they arose with redoubled fury in front as well as behind  after some time he grew bewildered his knees began to tremble and finding himself in the act of falling he forgot altogether the advice of the dervish  he turned to fly down the mountain and in one moment became a black stone  as may be imagined prince perviz and his sister were all this time in the greatest anxiety and consulted the magic knife not once but many times a day  hitherto the blade had remained bright and spotless but on the fatal hour on which prince bahman and his horse were changed into black stones large drops of blood appeared on the surface  ah my beloved brother cried the princess in horror throwing the knife from her i shall never see you again and it is i who have killed you  fool that i was to listen to the voice of that temptress who probably was not speaking the truth  what are the talking bird and the singing tree to me in comparison with you passionately though i long for them  prince pervizs grief at his brothers loss was not less than that of princess parizade but he did not waste his time on useless lamentations  my sister he said why should you think the old woman was deceiving you about these treasures and what would have been her object in doing so  no no our brother must have met his death by some accident or want of precaution and tomorrow i will start on the same quest  terrified at the thought that she might lose her only remaining brother the princess entreated him to give up his project but he remained firm  before setting out however he gave her a chaplet of a hundred pearls and said when i am absent tell this over daily for me  but if you should find that the beads stick so that they will not slip one after the other you will know that my brothers fate has befallen me  still we must hope for better luck  then he departed and on the twentieth day of his journey fell in with the dervish on the same spot as prince bahman had met him and began to question him as to the place where the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water were to be found  as in the case of his brother the dervish tried to make him give up his project and even told him that only a few weeks since a young man bearing a strong resemblance to himself had passed that way but had never come back again  that holy dervish replied prince perviz was my elder brother who is now dead though how he died i cannot say  he is changed into a black stone answered the dervish like all the rest who have gone on the same errand and you will become one likewise if you are not more careful in following my directions then he charged the prince as he valued his life to take no heed of the clamour of voices that would pursue him up the mountain and handing him a ball from the bag which still seemed to be half full he sent him on his way  when prince perviz reached the foot of the mountain he jumped from his horse and paused for a moment to recall the instructions the dervish had given him  then he strode boldly on but had scarcely gone five or six paces when he was startled by a mans voice that seemed close to his ear exclaiming  stop rash fellow and let me punish your audacity  this outrage entirely put the dervishs advice out of the princes head  he drew his sword and turned to avenge himself but almost before he had realised that there was nobody there he and his horse were two black stones  not a morning had passed since prince perviz had ridden away without princess parizade telling her beads and at night she even hung them round her neck so that if she woke she could assure herself at once of her brothers safety  she was in the very act of moving them through her fingers at the moment that the prince fell a victim to his impatience and her heart sank when the first pearl remained fixed in its place  however she had long made up her mind what she would do in such a case and the following morning the princess disguised as a man set out for the mountain  as she had been accustomed to riding from her childhood she managed to travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done and it was as before on the twentieth day that she arrived at the place where the dervish was sitting  good dervish she said politely will you allow me to rest by you for a few moments and perhaps you will be so kind as to tell me if you have ever heard of a talking bird a singing tree and some golden water that are to be found somewhere near this  madam replied the dervish for in spite of your manly dress your voice betrays you i shall be proud to serve you in any way i can  but may i ask the purpose of your question  good dervish answered the princess i have heard such glowing descriptions of these three things that i cannot rest till i possess them  madam said the dervish they are far more beautiful than any description but you seem ignorant of all the difficulties that stand in your way or you would hardly have undertaken such an adventure give it up i pray you and return home and do not ask me to help you to a cruel death  holy father answered the princess i come from far and i should be in despair if i turned back without having attained my object  you have spoken of difficulties tell me i entreat you what they are so that i may know if i can overcome them or see if they are beyond my strength  so the dervish repeated his tale and dwelt more firmly than before on the clamour of the voices the horrors of the black stones which were once living men and the difficulties of climbing the mountain and pointed out that the chief means of success was never to look behind till you had the cage in your grasp  as far as i can see said the princess the first thing is not to mind the tumult of the voices that follow you till you reach the cage and then never to look behind  as to this i think i have enough selfcontrol to look straight before me but as it is quite possible that i might be frightened by the voices as even the boldest men have been i will stop up my ears with cotton so that let them make as much noise as they like i shall hear nothing  madam cried the dervish out of all the number who have asked me the way to the mountain you are the first who has ever suggested such a means of escaping the danger  it is possible that you may succeed but all the same the risk is great  good dervish answered the princess i feel in my heart that i shall succeed and it only remains for me to ask you the way i am to go  then the dervish said that it was useless to say more and he gave her the ball which she flung before her  the first thing the princess did on arriving at the mountain was to stop her ears with cotton and then making up her mind which was the best way to go she began her ascent  in spite of the cotton some echoes of the voices reached her ears but not so as to trouble her indeed though they grew louder and more insulting the higher she climbed the princess only laughed and said to herself that she certainly would not let a few rough words stand between her and the goal  at last she perceived in the distance the cage and the bird whose voice joined itself in tones of thunder to those of the rest return return never dare to come near me  at the sight of the bird the princess hastened her steps and without vexing herself at the noise which by this time had grown deafening she walked straight up to the cage and seizing it she said now my bird i have got you and i shall take good care that you do not escape  as she spoke she took the cotton from her ears for it was needed no longer  brave lady answered the bird do not blame me for having joined my voice to those who did their best to preserve my freedom  although confined in a cage i was content with my lot but if i must become a slave i could not wish for a nobler mistress than one who has shown so much constancy and from this moment i swear to serve you faithfully some day you will put me to the proof for i know who you are better than you do yourself  meanwhile tell me what i can do and i will obey you  bird replied the princess who was filled with a joy that seemed strange to herself when she thought that the bird had cost her the lives of both her brothers bird let me first thank you for your good will and then let me ask you where the golden water is to be found  the bird described the place which was not far distant and the princess filled a small silver flask that she had brought with her for the purpose  she then returned to the cage and said  bird there is still something else where shall i find the singing tree  behind you in that wood replied the bird and the princess wandered through the wood till a sound of the sweetest voices told her she had found what she sought  but the tree was tall and strong and it was hopeless to think of uprooting it  you need not do that said the bird when she had returned to ask counsel  break off a twig and plant it in your garden and it will take root and grow into a magnificent tree  when the princess parizade held in her hands the three wonders promised her by the old woman she said to the bird  all that is not enough it was owing to you that my brothers became black stones  i cannot tell them from the mass of others but you must know and point them out to me i beg you for i wish to carry them away  for some reason that the princess could not guess these words seemed to displease the bird and he did not answer  the princess waited a moment and then continued in severe tones have you forgotten that you yourself said that you are my slave to do my bidding and also that your life is in my power  no i have not forgotten replied the bird but what you ask is very difficult  however i will do my best  if you look round he went on you will see a pitcher standing near  take it and as you go down the mountain scatter a little of the water it contains over every black stone and you will soon find your two brothers  princess parizade took the pitcher and carrying with her besides the cage the twig and the flask returned down the mountain side  at every black stone she stopped and sprinkled it with water and as the water touched it the stone instantly became a man  when she suddenly saw her brothers before her her delight was mixed with astonishment  why what are you doing here she cried  we have been asleep they said  yes returned the princess but without me your sleep would probably have lasted till the day of judgment  have you forgotten that you came here in search of the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water and the black stones that were heaped up along the road  look round and see if there is one left  these gentlemen and yourselves and all your horses were changed into these stones and i have delivered you by sprinkling you with the water from this pitcher  as i could not return home without you even though i had gained the prizes on which i had set my heart i forced the talking bird to tell me how to break the spell  on hearing these words prince bahman and prince perviz understood all they owed their sister and the knights who stood by declared themselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes  but the princess while thanking them for their politeness explained that she wished for no company but that of her brothers and that the rest were free to go where they would  so saying the princess mounted her horse and declining to allow even prince bahman to carry the cage with the talking bird she entrusted him with the branch of the singing tree while prince perviz took care of the flask containing the golden water  then they rode away followed by the knights and gentlemen who begged to be permitted to escort them  it had been the intention of the party to stop and tell their adventures to the dervish but they found to their sorrow that he was dead whether from old age or whether from the feeling that his task was done they never knew  as they continued their road their numbers grew daily smaller for the knights turned off one by one to their own homes and only the brothers and sister finally drew up at the gate of the palace  the princess carried the cage straight into the garden and as soon as the bird began to sing nightingales larks thrushes finches and all sorts of other birds mingled their voices in chorus  the branch she planted in a corner near the house and in a few days it had grown into a great tree  as for the golden water it was poured into a great marble basin specially prepared for it and it swelled and bubbled and then shot up into the air in a fountain twenty feet high  the fame of these wonders soon spread abroad and people came from far and near to see and admire  after a few days prince bahman and prince perviz fell back into their ordinary way of life and passed most of their time hunting  one day it happened that the sultan of persia was also hunting in the same direction and not wishing to interfere with his sport the young men on hearing the noise of the hunt approaching prepared to retire but as luck would have it they turned into the very path down which the sultan was coming  they threw themselves from their horses and prostrated themselves to the earth but the sultan was curious to see their faces and commanded them to rise  the princes stood up respectfully but quite at their ease and the sultan looked at them for a few moments without speaking then he asked who they were and where they lived  sire replied prince bahman we are sons of your highnesss late intendant of the gardens and we live in a house that he built a short time before his death waiting till an occasion should offer itself to serve your highness  you seem fond of hunting answered the sultan  sire replied prince bahman it is our usual exercise and one that should be neglected by no man who expects to comply with the ancient customs of the kingdom and bear arms  the sultan was delighted with this remark and said at once in that case i shall take great pleasure in watching you  come choose what sort of beasts you would like to hunt  the princes jumped on their horses and followed the sultan at a little distance  they had not gone very far before they saw a number of wild animals appear at once and prince bahman started to give chase to a lion and prince perviz to a bear  both used their javelins with such skill that directly they arrived within striking range the lion and the bear fell pierced through and through  then prince perviz pursued a lion and prince bahman a bear and in a very few minutes they too lay dead  as they were making ready for a third assault the sultan interfered and sending one of his officials to summon them he said smiling if i let you go on there will soon be no beasts left to hunt  besides your courage and manners have so won my heart that i will not have you expose yourselves to further danger  i am convinced that some day or other i shall find you useful as well as agreeable  he then gave them a warm invitation to stay with him altogether but with many thanks for the honour done them they begged to be excused and to be suffered to remain at home  the sultan who was not accustomed to see his offers rejected inquired their reasons and prince bahman explained that they did not wish to leave their sister and were accustomed to do nothing without consulting all three together  ask her advice then replied the sultan and tomorrow come and hunt with me and give me your answer  the two princes returned home but their adventure made so little impression on them that they quite forgot to speak to their sister on the subject  the next morning when they went to hunt they met the sultan in the same place and he inquired what advice their sister had given  the young men looked at each other and blushed  at last prince bahman said sire we must throw ourselves on your highnesss mercy neither my brother nor myself remembered anything about it  then be sure you do not forget today answered the sultan and bring me back your reply tomorrow  when however the same thing happened a second time they feared that the sultan might be angry with them for their carelessness  but he took it in good part and drawing three little golden balls from his purse he held them out to prince bahman saying put these in your bosom and you will not forget a third time for when you remove your girdle tonight the noise they will make in falling will remind you of my wishes  it all happened as the sultan had foreseen and the two brothers appeared in their sisters apartments just as she was in the act of stepping into bed and told their tale  the princess parizade was much disturbed at the news and did not conceal her feelings  your meeting with the sultan is very honourable to you she said and will i dare say be of service to you but it places me in a very awkward position  it is on my account i know that you have resisted the sultans wishes and i am very grateful to you for it  but kings do not like to have their offers refused and in time he would bear a grudge against you which would render me very unhappy  consult the talking bird who is wise and farseeing and let me hear what he says  so the bird was sent for and the case laid before him  the princes must on no account refuse the sultans proposal said he and they must even invite him to come and see your house  but bird objected the princess you know how dearly we love each other will not all this spoil our friendship  not at all replied the bird it will make it all the closer  then the sultan will have to see me said the princess  the bird answered that it was necessary that he should see her and everything would turn out for the best  the following morning when the sultan inquired if they had spoken to their sister and what advice she had given them prince bahman replied that they were ready to agree to his highnesss wishes and that their sister had reproved them for their hesitation about the matter  the sultan received their excuses with great kindness and told them that he was sure they would be equally faithful to him and kept them by his side for the rest of the day to the vexation of the grandvizir and the rest of the court  when the procession entered in this order the gates of the capital the eyes of the people who crowded the streets were fixed on the two young men strangers to every one  oh if only the sultan had had sons like that they murmured they look so distinguished and are about the same age that his sons would have been  the sultan commanded that splendid apartments should be prepared for the two brothers and even insisted that they should sit at table with him  during dinner he led the conversation to various scientific subjects and also to history of which he was especially fond but whatever topic they might be discussing he found that the views of the young men were always worth listening to  if they were my own sons he said to himself they could not be better educated and aloud he complimented them on their learning and taste for knowledge  at the end of the evening the princes once more prostrated themselves before the throne and asked leave to return home and then encouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the sultan prince bahman said  sire may we dare to take the liberty of asking whether you would do us and our sister the honour of resting for a few minutes at our house the first time the hunt passes that way  with the utmost pleasure replied the sultan and as i am all impatience to see the sister of such accomplished young men you may expect me the day after tomorrow  the princess was of course most anxious to entertain the sultan in a fitting way but as she had no experience in court customs she ran to the talking bird and begged he would advise her as to what dishes should be served  my dear mistress replied the bird your cooks are very good and you can safely leave all to them except that you must be careful to have a dish of cucumbers stuffed with pearl sauce served with the first course  cucumbers stuffed with pearls exclaimed the princess  why bird who ever heard of such a dish  the sultan will expect a dinner he can eat and not one he can only admire  besides if i were to use all the pearls i possess they would not be half enough  mistress replied the bird do what i tell you and nothing but good will come of it  and as to the pearls if you go at dawn tomorrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park on the right hand you will find as many as you want  the princess had faith in the bird who generally proved to be right and taking the gardener with her early next morning followed out his directions carefully  after digging for some time they came upon a golden box fastened with little clasps  these were easily undone and the box was found to be full of pearls not very large ones but wellshaped and of a good colour  so leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the tree the princess took up the box and returned to the house  the two princes had seen her go out and had wondered what could have made her rise so early  full of curiosity they got up and dressed and met their sister as she was returning with the box under her arm  what have you been doing they asked and did the gardener come to tell you he had found a treasure  on the contrary replied the princess it is i who have found one and opening the box she showed her astonished brothers the pearls inside  then on the way back to the palace she told them of her consultation with the bird and the advice it had given her  all three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel but they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them and they must be content blindly to obey  the first thing the princess did on entering the palace was to send for the head cook and to order the repast for the sultan when she had finished she suddenly added besides the dishes i have mentioned there is one that you must prepare expressly for the sultan and that no one must touch but yourself  it consists of a stuffed cucumber and the stuffing is to be made of these pearls  the head cook who had never in all his experience heard of such a dish stepped back in amazement  you think i am mad answered the princess who perceived what was in his mind  but i know quite well what i am doing  go and do your best and take the pearls with you  the next morning the princes started for the forest and were soon joined by the sultan  the hunt began and continued till midday when the heat became so great that they were obliged to leave off  then as arranged they turned their horses heads towards the palace and while prince bahman remained by the side of the sultan prince perviz rode on to warn his sister of their approach  the moment his highness entered the courtyard the princess flung herself at his feet but he bent and raised her and gazed at her for some time struck with her grace and beauty and also with the indefinable air of courts that seemed to hang round this country girl they are all worthy one of the other he said to himself and i am not surprised that they think so much of her opinions  i must know more of them  by this time the princess had recovered from the first embarrassment of meeting and proceeded to make her speech of welcome  this is only a simple country house sire she said suitable to people like ourselves who live a quiet life  it cannot compare with the great city mansions much less of course with the smallest of the sultans palaces  i cannot quite agree with you he replied even the little that i have seen i admire greatly and i will reserve my judgment until you have shown me the whole  the princess then led the way from room to room and the sultan examined everything carefully  do you call this a simple country house he said at last  why if every country house was like this the towns would soon be deserted  i am no longer astonished that you do not wish to leave it  let us go into the gardens which i am sure are no less beautiful than the rooms  a small door opened straight into the garden and the first object that met the sultans eyes was the golden water  what lovely coloured water he exclaimed where is the spring and how do you make the fountain rise so high  i do not believe there is anything like it in the world  he went forward to examine it and when he had satisfied his curiosity the princess conducted him towards the singing tree  as they drew near the sultan was startled by the sound of strange voices but could see nothing  where have you hidden your musicians he asked the princess are they up in the air or under the earth surely the owners of such charming voices ought not to conceal themselves  sire answered the princess the voices all come from the tree which is straight in front of us and if you will deign to advance a few steps you will see that they become clearer  the sultan did as he was told and was so wrapt in delight at what he heard that he stood some time in silence  tell me madam i pray you he said at last how this marvellous tree came into your garden  it must have been brought from a great distance or else fond as i am of all curiosities i could not have missed hearing of it  what is its name  the only name it has sire replied she is the singing tree and it is not a native of this country  its history is mixed up with those of the golden water and the talking bird which you have not yet seen  if your highness wishes i will tell you the whole story when you have recovered from your fatigue  indeed madam returned he you show me so many wonders that it is impossible to feel any fatigue  let us go once more and look at the golden water and i am dying to see the talking bird  the sultan could hardly tear himself away from the golden water which puzzled him more and more  you say he observed to the princess that this water does not come from any spring neither is brought by pipes  all i understand is that neither it nor the singing tree is a native of this country  it is as you say sire answered the princess and if you examine the basin you will see that it is all in one piece and therefore the water could not have been brought through it  what is more astonishing is that i only emptied a small flaskful into the basin and it increased to the quantity you now see  well i will look at it no more today said the sultan  take me to the talking bird  on approaching the house the sultan noticed a vast quantity of birds whose voices filled the air and he inquired why they were so much more numerous here than in any other part of the garden  sire answered the princess do you see that cage hanging in one of the windows of the saloon that is the talking bird whose voice you can hear above them all even above that of the nightingale  and the birds crowd to this spot to add their songs to his  the sultan stepped through the window but the bird took no notice continuing his song as before  my slave said the princess this is the sultan make him a pretty speech  the bird stopped singing at once and all the other birds stopped too  the sultan is welcome he said  i wish him long life and all prosperity  i thank you good bird answered the sultan seating himself before the repast which was spread at a table near the window and i am enchanted to see in you the sultan and king of the birds  the sultan noticing that his favourite dish of cucumber was placed before him proceeded to help himself to it and was amazed to and that the stuffing was of pearls  a novelty indeed cried he but i do not understand the reason of it one cannot eat pearls  sire replied the bird before either the princes or the princess could speak surely your highness cannot be so surprised at beholding a cucumber stuffed with pearls when you believed without any difficulty that the sultana had presented you instead of children with a dog a cat and a log of wood  i believed it answered the sultan because the women attending on her told me so  the women sire said the bird were the sisters of the sultana who were devoured with jealousy at the honour you had done her and in order to revenge themselves invented this story  have them examined and they will confess their crime  these are your children who were saved from death by the intendant of your gardens and brought up by him as if they were his own  like a flash the truth came to the mind of the sultan  bird he cried my heart tells me that what you say is true  my children he added let me embrace you and embrace each other not only as brothers and sister but as having in you the blood royal of persia which could flow in no nobler veins  when the first moments of emotion were over the sultan hastened to finish his repast and then turning to his children he exclaimed today you have made acquaintance with your father  tomorrow i will bring you the sultana your mother  be ready to receive her  the sultan then mounted his horse and rode quickly back to the capital without an instants delay he sent for the grandvizir and ordered him to seize and question the sultanas sisters that very day  this was done  they were confronted with each other and proved guilty and were executed in less than an hour  but the sultan did not wait to hear that his orders had been carried out before going on foot followed by his whole court to the door of the great mosque and drawing the sultana with his own hand out of the narrow prison where she had spent so many years madam he cried embracing her with tears in his eyes i have come to ask your pardon for the injustice i have done you and to repair it as far as i may  i have already begun by punishing the authors of this abominable crime and i hope you will forgive me when i introduce you to our children who are the most charming and accomplished creatures in the whole world  come with me and take back your position and all the honour that is due to you  this speech was delivered in the presence of a vast multitude of people who had gathered from all parts on the first hint of what was happening and the news was passed from mouth to mouth in a few seconds  early next day the sultan and sultana dressed in robes of state and followed by all the court set out for the country house of their children  here the sultan presented them to the sultana one by one and for some time there was nothing but embraces and tears and tender words  then they ate of the magnificent dinner which had been prepared for them and after they were all refreshed they went into the garden where the sultan pointed out to his wife the golden water and the singing tree  as to the talking bird she had already made acquaintance with him  in the evening they rode together back to the capital the princes on each side of their father and the princess with her mother  long before they reached the gates the way was lined with people and the air filled with shouts of welcome with which were mingled the songs of the talking bird sitting in its cage on the lap of the princess and of the birds who followed it  and in this manner they came back to their fathers palace
