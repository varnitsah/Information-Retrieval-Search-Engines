38532067	all roads lead to calvary   chapter i   she had not meant to stay for the service  the door had stood invitingly open and a glimpse of the interior had suggested to her the idea that it would make good copy  old london churches their social and historical associations  it would be easy to collect anecdotes of the famous people who had attended them  she might fix up a series for one of the religious papers  it promised quite exceptional material this particular specimen rich in tombs and monuments  there was character about it a scent of bygone days  she pictured the vanished congregations in their powdered wigs and stiff brocades  how picturesque must have been the marriages that had taken place there say in the reign of queen anne or of the early georges  the church would have been ancient even then  with its air of faded grandeur its sculptured recesses and dark niches the tattered banners hanging from its roof it must have made an admirable background  perhaps an historical novel in the thackeray vein  she could see her heroine walking up the aisle on the arm of her proud old soldier father  later on when her journalistic position was more established she might think of it  it was still quite early  there would be nearly half an hour before the first worshippers would be likely to arrive just time enough to jot down a few notes  if she did ever take to literature it would be the realistic school she felt that would appeal to her  the rest too would be pleasant after her long walk from westminster  she would find a secluded seat in one of the high stiff pews and let the atmosphere of the place sink into her  and then the pewopener had stolen up unobserved and had taken it so for granted that she would like to be shown round and had seemed so pleased and eager that she had not the heart to repel her  a curious little old party with a smooth peachlike complexion and white soft hair that the fading twilight stealing through the yellow glass turned to gold  so that at first sight joan took her for a child  the voice too was so absurdly childishappealing and yet confident  not until they were crossing the aisle where the clearer light streamed in through the open doors did joan see that she was very old and feeble with about her figure that curious patient droop that comes to the workworn  she proved to be most interesting and full of helpful information  mary stopperton was her name  she had lived in the neighbourhood all her life had as a girl worked for the leigh hunts and had assisted mrs carlyle  she had been very frightened of the great man himself and had always hidden herself behind doors or squeezed herself into corners and stopped breathing whenever there had been any fear of meeting him upon the stairs  until one day having darted into a cupboard to escape from him and drawn the door to after her it turned out to be the cupboard in which carlyle was used to keep his boots  so that there was quite a struggle between them she holding grimly on to the door inside and carlyle equally determined to open it and get his boots  it had ended in her exposure with trembling knees and scarlet face and carlyle had addressed her as woman and had insisted on knowing what she was doing there  and after that she had lost all terror of him  and he had even allowed her with a grim smile to enter occasionally the sacred study with her broom and pan  it had evidently made a lasting impression upon her that privilege  they didnt get on very well together mr and mrs carlyle joan queried scenting the opportunity of obtaining firstclass evidence  there wasnt much difference so far as i could see between them and most of us answered the little old lady  youre not married dear she continued glancing at joans ungloved hand but people must have a deal of patience when they have to live with us for twentyfour hours a day  you see little things we do and say without thinking and little ways we have that we do not notice ourselves may all the time be irritating to other people  what about the other people irritating us suggested joan  yes dear and of course that can happen too agreed the little old lady  did he carlyle ever come to this church asked joan  mary stopperton was afraid he never had in spite of its being so near and yet he was a dear good christianin his way mary stopperton felt sure  how do you mean in his way demanded joan  it certainly if froude was to be trusted could not have been the orthodox way  well you see dear explained the little old lady he gave up things he could have ridden in his carriageshe was quoting it seemed the words of the carlyles old servantif hed written the sort of lies that people pay for being told instead of throwing the truth at their head  but even that would not make him a christian argued joan  it is part of it dear isnt it insisted mary stopperton  to suffer for ones faith  i think jesus must have liked him for that  they had commenced with the narrow strip of burial ground lying between the south side of the church and cheyne walk  and there the little pew opener had showed her the grave of anna afterwards mrs spragg  who long declining wedlock and aspiring above her sex fought under her brother with arms and manly attire in a flagship against the french  as also of mary astell her contemporary who had written a spirited essay in defence of the fair sex  so there had been a suffrage movement as far back as in the days of pope and swift  returning to the interior joan had duly admired the cheyne monument but had been unable to disguise her amusement before the tomb of mrs colvile whom the sculptor had represented as a somewhat impatient lady refusing to await the day of resurrection but pushing through her coffin and starting for heaven in her graveclothes  pausing in front of the dacre monument joan wondered if the actor of that name who had committed suicide in australia and whose london address she remembered had been dacre house just round the corner was descended from the family thinking that if so it would give an uptodate touch to the article  she had fully decided now to write it  but mary stopperton could not inform her  they had ended up in the chapel of sir thomas more  he too had given up things including his head  though mary stopperton siding with father morris was convinced he had now got it back and that with the remainder of his bones it rested in the tomb before them  there the little pewopener had left her having to show the earlycomers to their seats and joan had found an outoftheway pew from where she could command a view of the whole church  they were chiefly poor folk the congregation with here and there a sprinkling of faded gentility  they seemed in keeping with the place  the twilight faded and a snuffy old man shuffled round and lit the gas  it was all so sweet and restful  religion had never appealed to her before  the businesslike service in the bare cold chapel where she had sat swinging her feet and yawning as a child had only repelled her  she could recall her father aloof and aweinspiring in his sunday black passing round the bag  her mother always veiled sitting beside her a thin tall woman with passionate eyes and ever restless hands the women mostly overdressed and the sleek prosperous men trying to look meek  at school and at girton chapel which she had attended no oftener than she was obliged had had about it the same atmosphere of chill compulsion but here was poetry  she wondered if after all religion might not have its place in the worldin company with the other arts  it would be a pity for it to die out  there seemed nothing to take its place  all these lovely cathedrals these dear little old churches that for centuries had been the focus of mens thoughts and aspirations  the harbour lights illumining the troubled waters of their lives  what could be done with them  they could hardly be maintained out of the public funds as mere mementoes of the past  besides there were too many of them  the taxpayer would naturally grumble  as town halls assembly rooms  the idea was unthinkable  it would be like a performance of barnums circus in the coliseum at rome  yes they would disappear though not she was glad to think in her time  in towns the space would be required for other buildings  here and there some gradually decaying specimen would be allowed to survive taking its place with the feudal castles and walled cities of the continent the joy of the american tourist the textbook of the antiquary  a pity  yes but then from the aesthetic point of view it was a pity that the groves of ancient greece had ever been cut down and replanted with currant bushes their altars scattered that the stones of the temples of isis should have come to be the shelter of the fisher of the nile and the corn wave in the wind above the buried shrines of mexico  all these dead truths that from time to time had encumbered the living world  each in its turn had had to be cleared away  and yet was it altogether a dead truth this passionate belief in a personal god who had ordered all things for the best who could be appealed to for comfort for help  might it not be as good an explanation as any other of the mystery surrounding us  it had been so universal  she was not sure where but somewhere she had come across an analogy that had strongly impressed her  the fact that a man feels thirstythough at the time he may be wandering through the desert of saharaproves that somewhere in the world there is water  might not the success of christianity in responding to human needs be evidence in its favour  the love of god the fellowship of the holy ghost the grace of our lord jesus christ  were not all human needs provided for in that one comprehensive promise the desperate need of man to be convinced that behind all the seeming muddle was a loving hand guiding towards good the need of the soul in its loneliness for fellowship for strengthening the need of man in his weakness for the kindly grace of human sympathy of human example  and then as fate would have it the first lesson happened to be the story of jonah and the whale  half a dozen shocked faces turned suddenly towards her told joan that at some point in the thrilling history she must unconsciously have laughed  fortunately she was alone in the pew and feeling herself scarlet squeezed herself into its farthest corner and drew down her veil  no it would have to go  a religion that solemnly demanded of grown men and women in the twentieth century that they should sit and listen with reverential awe to a prehistoric edition of grimms fairy stories including noah and his ark the adventures of samson and delilah the conversations between balaam and his ass and culminating in what if it were not so appallingly wicked an idea would be the most comical of them all the conception of an elaborately organized hell into which the god of the christians plunged his creatures for all eternity  of what use was such a religion as that going to be to the world of the future  she must have knelt and stood mechanically for the service was ended the pulpit was occupied by an elderly uninterestinglooking man with a troublesome cough  but one sentence he had let fall had gripped her attention  for a moment she could not remember it and then it came to her all roads lead to calvary  it struck her as rather good  perhaps he was going to be worth listening to  to all of us sooner or later he was saying comes a choosing of two ways either the road leading to success the gratification of desires the honour and approval of our fellowmenor the path to calvary  and then he had wandered off into a maze of detail  the tradesman dreaming perhaps of becoming a whiteley having to choose whether to go forward or remain for all time in the little shop  the statesmanshould he abide by the faith that is in him and suffer loss of popularity or renounce his god and enter the cabinet  the artist the writer the mere labourerthere were too many of them  a few wellchosen examples would have sufficed  and then that irritating cough  and yet every now and then he would be arresting  in his prime joan felt he must have been a great preacher  even now decrepit and wheezy he was capable of flashes of magnetism of eloquence  the passage where he pictured the garden of gethsemane  the fair jerusalem only hidden from us by the shadows  so easy to return to  its soft lights shining through the trees beckoning to us its mingled voices stealing to us through the silence whispering to us of its wellremembered ways its pleasant places its open doorways friends and loved ones waiting for us  and above the rockstrewn calvary and crowning its summit clear against the starlit sky the cold dark cross  not perhaps to us the bleeding hands and feet but to all the bitter tears  our calvary may be a very little hill compared with the mountains where prometheus suffered but to us it is steep and lonely  there he should have stopped  it would have been a good note on which to finish  but it seemed there was another point he wished to make  even to the sinner calvary calls  to judaseven to him the gates of the life giving garden of gethsemane had not been closed  with his thirty pieces of silver he could have stolen away  in some distant crowded city of the roman empire have lived unknown forgotten  life still had its pleasures its rewards  to him also had been given the choice  the thirty pieces of silver that had meant so much to him  he flings them at the feet of his tempters  they would not take them back  he rushes out and hangs himself  shame and death  with his own hands he will build his own cross none to help him  he tooeven judas climbs his calvary  enters into the fellowship of those who through all ages have trod its stony pathway  joan waited till the last of the congregation had disappeared and then joined the little pewopener who was waiting to close the doors  joan asked her what she had thought of the sermon but mary stopperton being a little deaf had not heard it  it was quite goodthe matter of it joan told her  all roads lead to calvary  the idea is that there comes a time to all of us when we have to choose  whether like your friend carlyle we will give up things for our faiths sake  or go for the carriage and pair  mary stopperton laughed  he is quite right dear she said  it does seem to come and it is so hard  you have to pray and pray and pray  and even then we cannot always do it  she touched with her little withered fingers joans fine white hand  but you are so strong and brave she continued with another little laugh  it wont be so difficult for you  it was not until well on her way home that joan recalling the conversation found herself smiling at mary stoppertons literal acceptation of the argument  at the time she remembered the shadow of a fear had passed over her  mary stopperton did not know the name of the preacher  it was quite common for chance substitutes to officiate there especially in the evening  joan had insisted on her acceptance of a shilling and had made a note of her address feeling instinctively that the little old woman would come in useful from a journalistic point of view  shaking hands with her she had turned eastward intending to walk to sloane square and there take the bus  at the corner of oakley street she overtook him  he was evidently a stranger to the neighbourhood and was peering up through his glasses to see the name of the street and joan caught sight of his face beneath a gas lamp  and suddenly it came to her that it was a face she knew  in the dimlit church she had not seen him clearly  he was still peering upward  joan stole another glance  yes she had met him somewhere  he was very changed quite different but she was sure of it  it was a long time ago  she must have been quite a child     chapter ii   one of joans earliest recollections was the picture of herself standing before the high cheval glass in her mothers dressingroom  her clothes lay scattered far and wide falling where she had flung them not a shred of any kind of covering was left to her  she must have been very small for she could remember looking up and seeing high above her head the two brass knobs by which the glass was fastened to its frame  suddenly out of the upper portion of the glass there looked a scared red face  it hovered there a moment and over it in swift succession there passed the expressions first of petrified amazement secondly of shocked indignation and thirdly of righteous wrath  and then it swooped down upon her and the image in the glass became a confusion of small naked arms and legs mingled with green cotton gloves and purple bonnet strings  you young imp of satan demanded mrs mundayher feelings of outraged virtue exaggerating perhaps her real sentiments  what are you doing  go away  ise looking at myself had explained joan struggling furiously to regain the glass  but where are your clothes was mrs mundays wonder  ise tooked them off explained joan  a piece of information that really all things considered seemed unnecessary  but cant you see yourself you wicked child without stripping yourself as naked as you were born  no maintained joan stoutly  i hate clothes  as a matter of fact she didnt even in those early days  on the contrary one of her favourite amusements was dressing up  this sudden overmastering desire to arrive at the truth about herself had been a new conceit  i wanted to see myself  clothes aint me was all she would or could vouchsafe and mrs munday had shook her head and had freely confessed that there were things beyond her and that joan was one of them and had succeeded partly by force partly by persuasion in restoring to joan once more the semblance of a christian child  it was mrs munday poor soul who all unconsciously had planted the seeds of disbelief in joans mind  mrs mundays god from joans point of view was a most objectionable personage  he talked a lotor rather mrs munday talked for himabout his love for little children  but it seemed he only loved them when they were good  joan was under no delusions about herself  if those were his terms well then so far as she could see he wasnt going to be of much use to her  besides if he hated naughty children why did he make them naughty  at a moderate estimate quite half joans wickedness so it seemed to joan came to her unbidden  take for example that selfexamination before the cheval glass  the idea had come into her mind  it had never occurred to her that it was wicked  if as mrs munday explained it was the devil that had whispered it to her then what did god mean by allowing the devil to go about persuading little girls to do indecent things  god could do everything  why didnt he smash the devil  it seemed to joan a mean trick look at it how you would  fancy leaving a little girl to fight the devil all by herself  and then get angry because the devil won  joan came to cordially dislike mrs mundays god  looking back it was easy enough to smile but the agony of many nights when she had lain awake for hours battling with her childish terrors had left a burning sense of anger in joans heart  poor mazed bewildered mrs munday preaching the eternal damnation of the wickedwho had loved her who had only thought to do her duty the blame was not hers  but that a religion capable of inflicting such suffering upon the innocent should still be preached maintained by the state  that its educated followers no longer believed in a physical hell that its more advanced clergy had entered into a conspiracy of silence on the subject was no answer  the great mass of the people were not educated  official christendom in every country still preached the everlasting torture of the majority of the human race as a well thought out part of the creators scheme  no leader had been bold enough to come forward and denounce it as an insult to his god  as one grew older kindly mother nature ever seeking to ease the selfinflicted burdens of her foolish brood gave one forgetfulness insensibility  the condemned criminal puts the thought of the gallows away from him as long as may be eats and sleeps and even jokes  mans soul grows pachydermoid  but the children  their sensitive brains exposed to every cruel breath  no philosophic doubt permitted to them  no learned disputation on the relationship between the literal and the allegorical for the easing of their frenzied fears  how many million tiny whitefaced figures scattered over christian europe and america stared out each night into a vision of black horror how many million tiny hands clutched wildly at the bedclothes  the society for the prevention of cruelty to children if they had done their duty would have prosecuted before now the archbishop of canterbury  of course she would go to hell  as a special kindness some generous relative had on joans seventh birthday given her an edition of dantes inferno with illustrations by dore  from it she was able to form some notion of what her eternity was likely to be  and god all the while up in his heaven surrounded by that glorious band of praisetrumpeting angels watching her out of the corner of his eye  her courage saved her from despair  defiance came to her aid  let him send her to hell  she was not going to pray to him and make up to him  he was a wicked god yes he was a cruel wicked god  and one night she told him so to his face  it had been a pretty crowded day even for so busy a sinner as little joan  it was springtime and they had gone into the country for her mothers health  maybe it was the season a stirring of the human sap conducing to that feeling of being too big for ones boots as the saying is  a dangerous period of the year  indeed on the principle that prevention is better than cure mrs munday had made it a custom during april and may to administer to joan a cooling mixture but on this occasion had unfortunately come away without it  joan dressed for use rather than show and without either shoes or stockings had stolen stealthily downstairs something seemed to be calling to her silentlylike a thief in the night to adopt mrs mundays metaphorhad slipped the heavy bolts had joined the thousand creatures of the woodhad danced and leapt and shouted had behaved in short more as if she had been a pagan nymph than a happy english child  she had regained the house unnoticed as she thought the devil no doubt assisting her and had hidden her wet clothes in the bottom of a mighty chest  deceitfulness in her heart she had greeted mrs munday in sleepy tones from beneath the sheets and before breakfast assailed by suspicious questions had told a deliberate lie  later in the morning during an argument with an active young pig who was willing enough to play at red riding hood so far as eating things out of a basket was concerned but who would not wear a nightcap she had used a wicked word  in the afternoon she might have killed the farmers only son and heir  they had had a row  in one of those sad lapses from the higher christian standards into which satan was always egging her she had pushed him and he had tumbled head over heels into the horsepond  the reason that instead of lying there and drowning he had got up and walked back to the house howling fit to wake the seven sleepers was that god watching over little children had arranged for the incident taking place on that side of the pond where it was shallow  had the scrimmage occurred on the opposite bank beneath which the water was much deeper joan in all probability would have had murder on her soul  it seemed to joan that if god allpowerful and allforeseeing had been so careful in selecting the site he might with equal ease have prevented the row from ever taking place  why couldnt the little beast have been guided back from school through the orchard much the shorter way instead of being brought round by the yard so as to come upon her at a moment when she was feeling a bit shorttempered to put it mildly  and why had god allowed him to call her carrots  that joan should have put it this way instead of going down on her knees and thanking the lord for having saved her from a crime was proof of her inborn evil disposition  in the evening was reached the culminating point  just before going to bed she had murdered old george the cowman  for all practical purposes she might just as well have been successful in drowning william augustus earlier in the day  it seemed to be one of those things that had to be  mr hornflower still lived it was true but that was not joans fault  joan standing in white nightgown beside her bed everything around her breathing of innocence and virtue the spotless bedclothes the chintz curtains the white hyacinths upon the windowledge joans bible a present from aunt susan her prayerbook handsomely bound in calf a present from grandpapa upon their little table mrs munday in evening black and cameo brooch pale red with tomb and weeping willow in white relief sacred to the memory of the departed mr mundayjoan standing there erect with pale passionate face defying all these aids to righteousness had deliberately wished mr hornflower dead  old george hornflower it was who unseen by her had passed her that morning in the wood  grumpy old george it was who had overheard the wicked word with which she had cursed the pig who had met william augustus on his emergence from the pond  to mr george hornflower the humble instrument in the hands of providence helping her towards possible salvation she ought to have been grateful  and instead of that she had flung into the agonized face of mrs munday these awful words  i wish he was dead  he who in his heart there was verse and chapter for it  joan was a murderess  just as well so far as joan was concerned might she have taken a carvingknife and stabbed deacon hornflower to the heart  joans prayers that night to the accompaniment of mrs mundays sobs had a hopeless air of unreality about them  mrs mundays kiss was cold  how long joan lay and tossed upon her little bed she could not tell somewhere about the middle of the night or so it seemed to her the frenzy seized her  flinging the bedclothes away she rose to her feet  it is difficult to stand upon a spring mattress but joan kept her balance of course he was there in the room with her  god was everywhere spying upon her  she could distinctly hear his measured breathing  face to face with him she told him what she thought of him  she told him he was a cruel wicked god  there are no victoria crosses for sinners or surely little joan that night would have earned it  it was not lack of imagination that helped her courage  god and she alone in the darkness  he with all the forces of the universe behind him  he armed with his eternal pains and penalties and eightyearold joan the creature that he had made in his own image that he could torture and destroy  hell yawned beneath her but it had to be said  somebody ought to tell him  you are a wicked god joan told him  yes you are  a cruel wicked god  and then that she might not see the walls of the room open before her hear the wild laughter of the thousand devils that were coming to bear her off she threw herself down her face hidden in the pillow and clenched her hands and waited  and suddenly there burst a song  it was like nothing joan had ever heard before  so clear and loud and near that all the night seemed filled with harmony  it sank into a tender yearning cry throbbing with passionate desire and then it rose again in thrilling ecstasy a song of hope of victory  joan trembling stole from her bed and drew aside the blind  there was nothing to be seen but the stars and the dim shape of the hills  but still that song filling the air with its wild triumphant melody  years afterwards listening to the overture to tannhauser there came back to her the memory of that night  ever through the mad satanic discords she could hear now faint now conquering the pilgrims onward march  so through the jangled discords of the world one heard the song of life  through the dim aeons of mans savage infancy through the centuries of bloodshed and of horror through the dark ages of tyranny and superstition through wrong through cruelty through hate heedless of doom heedless of death still the nightingales song i love you  i love you  i love you  we will build a nest  we will rear our brood  i love you  i love you  life shall not die  joan crept back into bed  a new wonder had come to her  and from that night joans belief in mrs mundays god began to fade circumstances helping  firstly there was the great event of going to school  she was glad to get away from home a massive stiffly furnished house in a wealthy suburb of liverpool  her mother since she could remember had been an invalid rarely leaving her bedroom till the afternoon  her father the owner of large engineering works she only saw as a rule at dinnertime when she would come down to dessert  it had been different when she was very young before her mother had been taken ill  then she had been more with them both  she had dim recollections of her father playing with her pretending to be a bear and growling at her from behind the sofa  and then he would seize and hug her and they would both laugh while he tossed her into the air and caught her  he had looked so big and handsome  all through her childhood there had been the desire to recreate those days to spring into the air and catch her arms about his neck  she could have loved him dearly if he had only let her  once seeking explanation she had opened her heart a little to mrs munday  it was disappointment mrs munday thought that she had not been a boy and with that joan had to content herself  maybe also her mothers illness had helped to sadden him  or perhaps it was mere temperament as she argued to herself later for which they were both responsible  those little tricks of coaxing of tenderness of wilfulness by means of which other girls wriggled their way so successfully into a warm nest of cosy affection she had never been able to employ them  beneath her selfconfidence was a shyness an immovable reserve that had always prevented her from expressing her emotions  she had inherited it doubtless enough from him  perhaps one day between them they would break down the barrier the strength of which seemed to lie in its very flimsiness its impalpability  and then during college vacations returning home with growing notions and views of her own she had found herself so often in antagonism with him  his fierce puritanism so opposed to all her enthusiasms  arguing with him she might almost have been listening to one of his cromwellian ancestors risen from the dead  there had been disputes between him and his workpeople and joan had taken the side of the men  he had not been angry with her but coldly contemptuous  and yet in spite of it all if he had only made a sign  she wanted to fling herself crying into his arms and shake himmake him listen to her wisdom sitting on his knee with her hands clasped round his neck  he was not really intolerant and stupid  that had been proved by his letting her go to a church of england school  her mother had expressed no wish  it was he who had selected it  of her mother she had always stood somewhat in fear never knowing when the mood of passionate affection would give place to a chill aversion that seemed almost like hate  perhaps it had been good for her so she told herself in after years her lonely unguided childhood  it had forced her to think and act for herself  at school she reaped the benefit  selfreliant confident original leadership was granted to her as a natural prerogative  nature had helped her  nowhere does a young girl rule more supremely by reason of her beauty than among her fellows  joan soon grew accustomed to having her boots put on and taken off for her all her needs of service anticipated by eager slaves contending with one another for the privilege  by giving a command by bestowing a few moments of her conversation it was within her power to make some small adoring girl absurdly happy for the rest of the day while her displeasure would result in tears in fawning pleadings for forgiveness  the homage did not spoil her  rather it helped to develop her  she accepted it from the beginning as in the order of things  power had been given to her  it was her duty to see to it that she did not use it capriciously for her own gratification  no conscientious youthful queen could have been more careful in the distribution of her favoursthat they should be for the encouragement of the deserving the reward of virtue more sparing of her frowns reserving them for the rectification of error  at girton it was more by force of will of brain that she had to make her position  there was more competition  joan welcomed it as giving more zest to life  but even there her beauty was by no means a negligible quantity  clever brilliant young women accustomed to sweep aside all opposition with a blaze of rhetoric found themselves to their irritation sitting in front of her silent not so much listening to her as looking at her  it puzzled them for a time  because a girls features are classical and her colouring attractive surely that has nothing to do with the value of her political views  until one of them discovered by chance that it has  well what does beauty think about it this one had asked laughing she had arrived at the end of a discussion just as joan was leaving the room  and then she gave a long low whistle feeling that she had stumbled upon the explanation  beauty that mysterious force that from the date of creation has ruled the world what does it think  dumb passive as a rule exercising its influence unconsciously  but if it should become intelligent active  a philosopher has dreamed of the vast influence that could be exercised by a dozen sincere men acting in unity suppose a dozen of the most beautiful women in the world could form themselves into a league  joan found them late in the evening still discussing it  her mother died suddenly during her last term and joan hurried back to attend the funeral  her father was out when she reached home  joan changed her traveldusty clothes and then went into the room where her mother lay and closed the door  she must have been a beautiful woman now that the fret and the restlessness had left her it had come back to her  the passionate eyes were closed  joan kissed the marble lids and drawing a chair to the bedside sat down  it grieved her that she had never loved her mothernot as one ought to love ones mother unquestioningly unreasoningly as a natural instinct  for a moment a strange thought came to her and swiftly almost guiltily she stole across and drawing back a corner of the blind examined closely her own features in the glass comparing them with the face of the dead woman thus called upon to be a silent witness for or against the living  joan drew a sigh of relief and let fall the blind  there could be no misreading the evidence  death had smoothed away the lines given back youth  it was almost uncanny the likeness between them  it might have been her drowned sister lying there  and they had never known one another  had this also been temperament again keeping them apart  why did it imprison us each one as in a moving cell so that we never could stretch out our arms to one another except when at rare intervals love or death would unlock for a while the key  impossible that two beings should have been so alike in feature without being more or less alike in thought and feeling  whose fault had it been  surely her own she was so hideously calculating  even mrs munday because the old lady had been fond of her and had shown it had been of more service to her more a companion had been nearer to her than her own mother  in selfexcuse she recalled the two or three occasions when she had tried to win her mother  but fate seemed to have decreed that their moods should never correspond  her mothers sudden fierce outbursts of love when she would be jealous exacting almost cruel had frightened her when she was a child and later on had bored her  other daughters would have shown patience unselfishness but she had always been so selfcentred  why had she never fallen in love like other girls  there had been a boy at brighton when she was at school therequite a nice boy who had written her wildly extravagant loveletters  it must have cost him half his pocketmoney to get them smuggled in to her  why had she only been amused at them  they might have been beautiful if only one had read them with sympathy  one day he had caught her alone on the downs  evidently he had made it his business to hang about every day waiting for some such chance  he had gone down on his knees and kissed her feet and had been so abject so pitiful that she had given him some flowers she was wearing  and he had sworn to dedicate the rest of his life to being worthy of her condescension  poor lad  she wonderedfor the first time since that afternoonwhat had become of him  there had been others a third cousin who still wrote to her from egypt sending her presents that perhaps he could ill afford and whom she answered about once a year  and promising young men she had met at cambridge ready the felt instinctively to fall down and worship her  and all the use she had had for them was to convert them to her viewsa task so easy as to be quite uninterestingwith a vague idea that they might come in handy in the future when she might need help in shaping that world of the future  only once had she ever thought of marriage  and that was in favour of a middleaged rheumatic widower with three children a professor of chemistry very learned and justly famous  for about a month she had thought herself in love  she pictured herself devoting her life to him rubbing his poor left shoulder where it seemed he suffered most and brushing his picturesque hair inclined to grey  fortunately his eldest daughter was a young woman of resource or the poor gentleman naturally carried off his feet by this adoration of youth and beauty might have made an ass of himself  but apart from this one episode she had reached the age of twentythree heartwhole  she rose and replaced the chair  and suddenly a wave of pity passed over her for the dead woman who had always seemed so lonely in the great stifflyfurnished house and the tears came  she was glad she had been able to cry  she had always hated herself for her lack of tears it was so unwomanly  even as a child she had rarely cried  her father had always been very tender very patient towards her mother but she had not expected to find him so changed  he had aged and his shoulders drooped  she had been afraid that he would want her to stay with him and take charge of the house  it had worried her considerably it would be so difficult to refuse and yet she would have to  but when he never broached the subject she was hurt  he had questioned her about her plans the day after the funeral and had seemed only anxious to assist them  she proposed continuing at cambridge till the end of the term  she had taken her degree the year before  after that she would go to london and commence her work  let me know what allowance you would like me to make you when you have thought it out  things are not what they were at the works but there will always be enough to keep you in comfort he had told her  she had fixed it there and then at two hundred a year  she would not take more and that only until she was in a position to keep herself  i want to prove to myself she explained that i am capable of earning my own living  i am going down into the marketplace  if im no good if i cant take care of even one poor woman ill come back and ask you to keep me  she was sitting on the arm of his chair and laughing she drew his head towards her and pressed it against her  if i succeed if i am strong enough to fight the world for myself and win that will mean i am strong enough and clever enough to help others  i am only at the end of a journey when you need me he had answered and they had kissed  and next morning she returned to her own life     chapter iii   it was at madge singletons rooms that the details of joans entry into journalistic london were arranged  the coming of beauty was flora lessings phrase for designating the event  flora lessing known among her associates as flossie was the girl who at cambridge had accidentally stumbled upon the explanation of joans influence  in appearance she was of the fluffy ruffles type with childish innocent eyes and the unruly curls beloved of the family herald novelist  at the first these latter had been the result of a habit of late rising and consequent hurried toilet operations but on the discovery that for the purposes of her profession they possessed a market value they had been sedulously cultivated  editors of the old order had ridiculed the idea of her being of any use to them when two years previously she had by combination of cheek and patience forced herself into their sanctum had patted her paternally upon her generally ungloved hand and told her to go back home and get some honest worthy young man to love and cherish her  it was carleton of the daily dispatch group who had first divined her possibilities  with a swift glance on his way through he had picked her out from a line of depressedlooking men and women ranged against the wall of the dark entrance passage and with a snap of his fingers had beckoned to her to follow him  striding in front of her up to his room he had pointed to a chair and had left her sitting there for threequarters of an hour while he held discussion with a stream of subordinates managers and editors of departments who entered and departed one after another evidently in prearranged order  all of them spoke rapidly without ever digressing by a single word from the point giving her the impression of their speeches having been rehearsed beforehand  carleton himself never interrupted them  indeed one might have thought he was not listening so engrossed he appeared to be in the pile of letters and telegrams that lay waiting for him on his desk  when they had finished he would ask them questions still with his attention fixed apparently upon the paper in his hand  then looking up for the first time he would run off curt instructions much in the tone of a commander inchief giving orders for an immediate assault and finishing abruptly return to his correspondence  when the last as it transpired had closed the door behind him he swung his chair round and faced her  what have you been doing he asked her  wasting my time and money hanging about newspaper offices listening to silly talk from old fossils she told him  and having learned that respectable journalism has no use for brains you come to me he answered her  what do you think you can do  anything that can be done with a pen and ink she told him  interviewing he suggested  ive always been considered good at asking awkward questions she assured him  he glanced at the clock  ill give you five minutes he said interview me  she moved to a chair beside the desk and opening her bag took out a writingblock  what are your principles she asked him  have you got any  he looked at her sharply across the corner of the desk  i mean she continued to what fundamental rule of conduct do you attribute your success  she leant forward fixing her eyes on him  dont tell me she persisted that you had none  that life is all just mere blind chance think of the young men who are hanging on your answer  wont you send them a message  yes he answered musingly  its your baby face that does the trick in the ordinary way i should have known you were pulling my leg and have shown you the door  as it was i felt half inclined for the moment to reply with some damned silly platitude that would have set all fleet street laughing at me  why do my principles interest you  as a matter of fact they dont she explained  but its what people talk about whenever they discuss you  what do they say he demanded  your friends that you never had any  and your enemies that they are always the latest she informed him  youll do he answered with a laugh  with nine men out of ten that speech would have ended your chances  you sized me up at a glance and knew it would only interest me  and your instinct is right he added what people are saying always go straight for that  he gave her a commission then and there for a heart to heart talk with a gentleman whom the editor of the home news department of the daily dispatch would have referred to as a leading literary luminary and who had just invented a new world in two volumes  she had asked him childish questions and had listened with wideopen eyes while he sitting over against her and smiling benevolently had laid bare to her all the seeming intricacies of creation and had explained to her in simple language the necessary alterations and improvements he was hoping to bring about in human nature  he had the sensation that his hair must be standing on end the next morning after having read in cold print what he had said  expanding oneself before the admiring gaze of innocent simplicity and addressing the easily amused ear of an unsympathetic public are not the same thing  he ought to have thought of that  it consoled him later that he was not the only victim  the daily dispatch became famous for its piquant interviews especially with elderly celebrities of the masculine gender  its dirty work flossie confided one day to madge singleton  i trade on my silly face  dont see that im much different to any of these poor devils  they were walking home in the evening from a theatre  if i hadnt been stony broke id never have taken it up  i shall get out of it as soon as i can afford to  i should make it a bit sooner than that suggested the elder woman one cant always stop oneself just where one wants to when sliding down a slope  it has a knack of getting steeper and steeper as one goes on  madge had asked joan to come a little earlier so that they could have a chat together before the others arrived  ive only asked a few she explained as she led joan into the restful whitepanelled sittingroom that looked out upon the gardens  madge shared a set of chambers in grays inn with her brother who was an actor but i have chosen them with care  joan murmured her thanks  i havent asked any men she added as she fixed joan in an easy chair before the fire  i was afraid of its introducing the wrong element  tell me asked joan am i likely to meet with much of that sort of thing  oh about as much as there always is wherever men and women work together answered madge  its a nuisance but it has to be faced  nature appears to have only one idea in her head she continued after a pause so far as we men and women are concerned  shes been kinder to the lower animals  man has more interests joan argued a thousand other allurements to distract him we must cultivate his finer instincts  it doesnt seem to answer grumbled madge  one is always told it is the artistthe brain worker the very men who have these fine instincts who are the most sexual  she made a little impatient movement with her hands that was characteristic of her  personally i like men she went on  it is so splendid the way they enjoy life just like a dog does whether its wet or fine  we are always blinking up at the clouds and worrying about our hat  it would be so nice to be able to have friendship with them  i dont mean that its all their fault she continued  we do all we can to attract themthe way we dress  who was it said that to every woman every man is a potential lover  we cant get it out of our minds its there even when we dont know it  we will never succeed in civilizing nature  we wont despair of her laughed joan  shes creeping up poor lady as whistler said of her  we have passed the phase when everything she did was right in our childish eyes  now we dare to criticize her  that shows we are growing up  she will learn from us later on  shes a dear old thing at heart  shes been kind enough to you replied madge somewhat irrelevantly there was a note of irritation in her tone  i suppose you know you are supremely beautiful  you seem so indifferent to it i wonder sometimes if you do  im not indifferent to it answered joan  im reckoning on it to help me  why not she continued with a flash of defiance though madge had not spoken  it is a weapon like any otherknowledge intellect courage god has given me beauty  i shall use it in his service  they formed a curious physical contrast these two women in this moment joan radiant serene sat upright in her chair her head slightly thrown back her fine hands clasping one another so strongly that the delicate muscles could be traced beneath the smooth white skin  madge with puckered brows leant forward in a crouching attitude her thin nervous hands stretched out towards the fire  how does one know when one is serving god she asked after a pause apparently rather of herself than of joan  it seems so difficult  one feels it explained joan  yes but didnt they all feel it madge suggested  she still seemed to be arguing with herself rather than with joan  nietzsche  i have been reading him  they are forming a nietzsche society to give lectures about himpropagate him over here  eleanors in it up to the neck  it seems to me awful  every fibre in my being revolts against him  yet theyre all cocksure that he is the coming prophet  he must have convinced himself that he is serving god  if i were a fighter i should feel i was serving god trying to down him  how do i know which of us is right torquemadacalvin she went on without giving joan the chance of a reply  its easy enough to see they were wrong now  but at the time millions of people believed in themfelt it was gods voice speaking through them  joan of arc  fancy dying to put a thing like that upon a throne  it would be funny if it wasnt so tragic  you can say she drove out the englishsaved france  but for what  the bartholomew massacres the ruin of the palatinate by louis xiv  the horrors of the french revolution ending with napoleon and all the misery and degeneracy that he bequeathed to europe  history might have worked itself out so much better if the poor child had left it alone and minded her sheep  wouldnt that train of argument lead to nobody ever doing anything suggested joan  i suppose it would mean stagnation admitted madge  and yet i dont know  are there not forces moving towards right that are crying to us to help them not by violence which only interruptsdelays them but by quietly preparing the way for them  you know what i mean  erasmus always said that luther had hindered the reformation by stirring up passion and hate  she broke off suddenly  there were tears in her eyes  oh if god would only say what he wants of us she almost cried call to us in trumpet tones that would ring through the world compelling us to take sides  why cant he speak  he does answered joan  i hear his voice  there are things ive got to do  wrongs that i must fight against  rights that i must never dare to rest till they are won  her lips were parted  her breasts heaving he does call to us  he has girded his sword upon me  madge looked at her in silence for quite a while  how confident you are she said  how i envy you  they talked for a time about domestic matters  joan had established herself in furnished rooms in a quiet street of pleasant georgian houses just behind the abbey a member of parliament and his wife occupied the lower floors the landlord a retired butler and his wife an excellent cook confining themselves to the basement and the attics  the remaining floor was tenanted by a shy young mana poet so the landlady thought but was not sure  anyhow he had long hair lived with a pipe in his mouth and burned his lamp long into the night  joan had omitted to ask his name  she made a note to do so  they discussed ways and means  joan calculated she could get through on two hundred a year putting aside fifty for dress  madge was doubtful if this would be sufficient  joan urged that she was stock size and would be able to pick up models at sales but madge measuring her against herself was sure she was too full  you will find yourself expensive to dress she told her cheap things wont go well on you and it would be madness even from a business point of view for you not to make the best of yourself  men stand more in awe of a welldressed woman than they do even of a beautiful woman madge was of opinion  if you go into an office looking dowdy theyll beat you down  tell them the price they are offering you wont keep you in gloves for a week and theyll be ashamed of themselves  theres nothing infra dig in being mean to the poor but not to sympathize with the rich stamps you as middle class  she laughed  joan was worried  i told dad i should only ask him for enough to make up two hundred a year she explained  hell laugh at me for not knowing my own mind  i should let him advised madge  she grew thoughtful again  we cranky young women with our newfangled independent ways i guess we hurt the old folks quite enough as it is  the bell rang and madge opened the door herself  it turned out to be flossie  joan had not seen her since they had been at girton together and was surprised at flossies youthful get up  flossie explained and without waiting for any possible attack flew to her own defence  the revolution that the world is waiting for was flossies opinion is the providing of every man and woman with a hundred and fifty a year then we shall all be able to afford to be noble and highminded  as it is ninetenths of the contemptible things we do comes from the necessity of our having to earn our living  a hundred and fifty a year would deliver us from evil  would there not still be the diamond dogcollar and the motor car left to tempt us suggested madge  only the really wicked contended flossie  it would classify us  we should know then which were the sheep and which the goats  at present were all jumbled together the ungodly who sin out of mere greed and rapacity and the just men compelled to sell their birthright of fine instincts for a mess of meat and potatoes  yah socialist commented madge who was busy with the tea things  flossie seemed struck by an idea  by jove she exclaimed  why did i never think of it  with a red flag and my hair down id be in all the illustrated papers  it would put up my price no end  and id be able to get out of this silly job of mine  i cant go on much longer  im getting too well known  i do believe ill try it  the shoutings easy enough  she turned to joan  are you going to take up socialism she demanded  i may answered joan  just to spank it and put it down again  im rather a believer in temptationthe struggle for existence  i only want to make it a finer existence more worth the struggle in which the best man shall rise to the top  your universal securitythat will be the last act of the human drama the cue for ringing down the curtain  but do not all our isms work towards that end suggested madge  joan was about to reply when the maids announcement of mrs denton postponed the discussion  mrs denton was a short greyhaired lady  her large strong features must have made her when she was young a hardlooking woman but time and sorrow had strangely softened them while about the corners of the thin firm mouth lurked a suggestion of humour that possibly had not always been there  joan waiting to be introduced towered head and shoulders above her yet when she took the small proffered hand and felt those steely blue eyes surveying her she had the sensation of being quite insignificant  mrs denton seemed to be reading her and then still retaining joans hand she turned to madge with a smile  so this is our new recruit she said  she is come to bring healing to the sad sick worldto right all the old old wrongs  she patted joans hand and spoke gravely  that is right dear  that is youths metier to take the banner from our failing hands bear it still a little onward  her small gloved hand closed on joans with a pressure that made joan wince  and you must not despair she continued because in the end it will seem to you that you have failed  it is the fallen that win the victories  she released joans hand abruptly  come and see me tomorrow morning at my office she said  we will fix up something that shall be serviceable to us both  madge flashed joan a look  she considered joans position already secured  mrs denton was the doyen of women journalists  she edited a monthly review and was leader writer of one of the most important dailies besides being the controlling spirit of various social movements  anyone she took up would be assured of steady work  the pay might not be able to compete with the prices paid for more popular journalism but it would afford a foundation and give to joan that opportunity for influence which was her main ambition  joan expressed her thanks  she would like to have had more talk with the stern old lady but was prevented by the entrance of two new comers  the first was miss lavery a handsome loudtoned young woman  she ran a nursing paper but her chief interest was in the womans suffrage question just then coming rapidly to the front  she had heard joan speak at cambridge and was eager to secure her adherence being wishful to surround herself with a group of young and goodlooking women who should take the movement out of the hands of the frumps as she termed them  her doubt was whether joan would prove sufficiently tractable  she intended to offer her remunerative work upon the nursing news without saying anything about the real motive behind trusting to gratitude to make her task the easier  the second was a clumsylooking overdressed woman whom miss lavery introduced as mrs phillips a very dear friend of mine who is going to be helpful to us all adding in a hurried aside to madge i simply had to bring her  will explain to you another time  an apology certainly seemed to be needed  the woman was absurdly out of her place  she stood there panting and slightly perspiring  she was short and fat with dyed hair  as a girl she had possibly been pretty in a dimpled giggling sort of way  joan judged her in spite of her complexion to be about forty  joan wondered if she could be the wife of the member of parliament who occupied the rooms below her in cowley street  his name so the landlady had told her was phillips  she put the suggestion in a whisper to flossie  quite likely thought flossie just the type that sort of man does marry  a barmaid i expect  others continued to arrive until altogether there must have been about a dozen women present  one of them turned out to be an old schoolfellow of joans and two had been with her at girton  madge had selected those who she knew would be sympathetic and all promised help those who could not give it direct undertaking to provide introductions and recommendations though some of them were frankly doubtful of journalism affording joan anything more than the meansnot always too honestof earning a living  i started out to preach the gospel all that sort of thing drawled a miss simmonds from beneath a hat that if she had paid for it would have cost her five guineas  now my chief purpose in life is to tickle silly women into spending twice as much upon their clothes as their husbands can afford bamboozling them into buying any old thing that our advertising manager instructs me to boom  they talk about the editors opinions struck in a fiery little woman who was busy flinging crumbs out of the window to a crowd of noisy sparrows  its the advertiser edits half the papers  write anything that three of them object to and your proprietor tells you to change your convictions or go  most of us change  she jerked down the window with a slam  its the syndicates that have done it was a mrs elliots opinion  she wrote society notes for a labour weekly  when one man owned a paper he wanted it to express his views  a company is only out for profit your modern newspaper is just a shop  its only purpose is to attract customers  look at the methodist herald owned by the same syndicate of jews that runs the racing news  they work it as far as possible with the same staff  were a pack of hirelings asserted the fiery little woman  our pens are for sale to the highest bidder  i had a letter from jocelyn only two days ago  he was one of the original staff of the socialist  he writes me that he has gone as leader writer to a conservative paper at twice his former salary  expected me to congratulate him  one of these days somebody will start a society for the reformation of the press thought flossie  i wonder how the papers will take it  much as rome took savonarola thought madge  mrs denton had risen  they are right to a great extent she said to joan  but not all the temple has been given over to the hucksters  you shall place your preaching stool in some quiet corner where the passing feet shall pause awhile to listen  her going was the signal for the breaking up of the party  in a short time joan and madge found themselves left with only flossie  what on earth induced helen to bring that poor old dutch doll along with her demanded flossie  the woman never opened her mouth all the time did she tell you  no answered madge but i think i can guess  she hopesor perhaps fears would be more correctthat her husband is going to join the cabinet and is trying to fit herself by suddenly studying political and social questions  for a month shes been clinging like a leech to helen lavery who takes her to meetings and gatherings  i suppose theyve struck up some sort of a bargain  its rather pathetic  good heavens  what a tragedy for the man commented flossie  what is he like asked joan  not much to look at if thats what you mean answered madge  began life as a miner i believe  looks like ending as prime minister  i heard him at the albert hall last week said flossie  hes quite wonderful  in what way questioned joan  oh you know explained flossie  like a volcano compressed into a steam engine  they discussed joans plans  it looked as if things were going to be easy for her     chapter iv   yet in the end it was carleton who opened the door for her  mrs denton was helpful and would have been more so if joan had only understood  mrs denton lived alone in an old house in gower street with a high stone hall that was always echoing to sounds that no one but itself could ever hear  her son had settled it was supposed in one of the colonies  no one knew what had become of him and mrs denton herself never spoke of him while her daughter on whom she had centred all her remaining hopes had died years ago  to those who remembered the girl with her weak eyes and wispy ginger coloured hair it would have seemed comical the idea that joan resembled her  but mrs dentons memory had lost itself in dreams and to her the likeness had appeared quite wonderful  the gods had given her child back to her grown strong and brave and clever  life would have a new meaning for her  her work would not die with her  she thought she could harness joans enthusiasm to her own wisdom  she would warn her of the errors and pitfalls into which she herself had fallen for she too had started as a rebel  youth should begin where age left off  had the old lady remembered a faded dogseared volume labelled oddments that for many years had rested undisturbed upon its shelf in her great library and opening it had turned to the letter e she would have read recorded there in her own precise thin penmanship this very wise reflection  experience is a book that all men write but no man reads  to which she would have found added by way of complement experience is untranslatable  we write it in the cipher of our sufferings and the key is hidden in our memories  and turning to the letter y she might have read  youth comes to teach  age remains to listen and underneath the following  the ability to learn is the last lesson we acquire  mrs denton had long ago given up the practice of jotting down her thoughts experience having taught her that so often when one comes to use them one finds that one has changed them  but in the case of joan the recollection of these twin oddments might have saved her disappointment  joan knew of a new road that avoided mrs dentons pitfalls  she grew impatient of being perpetually pulled back  for the nursing times she wrote a series of condensed biographies entitled ladies of the lamp commencing with elizabeth fry  they formed a record of good women who had battled for the weak and suffering winning justice for even the uninteresting  miss lavery was delighted with them  but when joan proposed exposing the neglect and even cruelty too often inflicted upon the helpless patients of private nursing homes miss lavery shook her head  i know she said  one does hear complaints about them  unfortunately it is one of the few businesses managed entirely by women and just now in particular if we were to say anything it would be made use of by our enemies to injure the cause  there was a summer years agoit came back to joans mindwhen she had shared lodgings with a girl chum at a crowded seaside wateringplace the rooms were shockingly dirty and tired of dropping hints she determined one morning to clean them herself  she climbed a chair and started on a row of shelves where lay the dust of ages  it was a jerry built house and the result was that she brought the whole lot down about her head together with a quarter of a hundredweight of plaster  yes i thought youd do some mischief had commented the landlady wearily  it seemed typical  a jerrybuilt world apparently  with the best intentions it seemed impossible to move in it without doing more harm than good to it bringing things down about one that one had not intended  she wanted to abolish steel rabbittraps  she had heard the little beggars cry  it had struck her as such a harmless reform  but they told her there were worthy people in the neighbourhood of wolverhamptonquite a number of themwho made their living by the manufacture of steel rabbittraps  if thinking only of the rabbits you prohibited steel rabbittraps then you condemned all these worthy people to slow starvation  the local mayor himself wrote in answer to her article  he drew a moving picture of the sad results that might follow such an ill considered agitation hundreds of greyhaired men too old to learn new jobs begging from door to door shoals of little children whitefaced and pinched sobbing women  her editor was sorry for the rabbits  had often spent a pleasant day with them himself  but after all the human race claimed our first sympathies  she wanted to abolish sweating  she had climbed the rotting stairways seen the famished creatures in their holes  but it seemed that if you interfered with the complicated system based on sweating then you dislocated the entire structure of the british export clothing trade  not only would these poor creatures lose their admittedly wretched livingbut still a livingbut thousands of other innocent victims would also be involved in the common ruin  all very sad but half a loafor even let us frankly say a thin sliceis better than no bread at all  she wanted board school childrens heads examined  she had examined one or two herself  it seemed to her wrong that healthy children should be compelled to sit for hours within jumping distance of the diseased  she thought it better that the dirty should be made fit company for the clean than the clean should be brought down to the level of the dirty  it seemed that in doing this you were destroying the independence of the poor  opposition reformers in letters scintillating with paradox bristling with classical allusion denounced her attempt to impose middle class ideals upon a too long suffering proletariat  better far a few lively little heads than a brokenspirited people robbed of their parental rights  through miss lavery she obtained an introduction to the great sir william  he owned a group of popular provincial newspapers and was most encouraging  sir william had often said to himself  what can i do for god who has done so much for me  it seemed only fair  he asked her down to his little place in hampshire to talk plans over the little place it turned out ran to forty bedrooms and was surrounded by three hundred acres of park  god had evidently done his bit quite handsomely  it was in a secluded corner of the park that sir william had gone down upon one knee and gallantly kissed her hand  his idea was that if she could regard herself as his dear lady and allow him the honour and privilege of being her true knight that between them they might accomplish something really useful  there had been some difficulty about his getting up again sir william being an elderly gentleman subject to rheumatism and joan had had to expend no small amount of muscular effort in assisting him so that the episode which should have been symbolical ended by leaving them both red and breathless  he referred to the matter again the same evening in the library while lady william slept peacefully in the blue drawingroom but as it appeared necessary that the compact should be sealed by a knightly kiss joan had failed to ratify it  she blamed herself on her way home  the poor old gentleman could easily have been kept in his place  the suffering of an occasional harmless caress would have purchased for her power and opportunity  had it not been somewhat selfish of her  should she write to himsee him again  she knew that she never would  it was something apart from her reason it would not even listen to her  it bade or forbade as if one were a child without any right to a will of ones own  it was decidedly exasperating  there were others  there were the editors who frankly told her that the business of a newspaper was to write what its customers wanted to read and that the public so far as they could judge was just about fed up with plans for new jerusalems at their expense  and the editors who were prepared to take up any number of reforms insisting only that they should be new and original and promise popularity  and then she met greyson  it was at a lunch given by mrs denton  greyson was a bachelor and lived with an unmarried sister a few years older than himself  he was editor and part proprietor of an evening paper  it had ideals and was in consequence regarded by the general public with suspicion but by reason of sincerity and braininess was rapidly becoming a power  he was a shy reserved man with an aristocratic head set upon stooping shoulders  the face was that of a dreamer but about the mouth there was suggestion of the fighter  joan felt at her ease with him in spite of the air of detachment that seemed part of his character  mrs denton had paired them off together and during the lunch one of themjoan could not remember whichhad introduced the subject of reincarnation  greyson was unable to accept the theory because of the fact that in old age the mind in common with the body is subject to decay  perhaps by the time i am fortyor let us say fifty he argued i shall be a bright intelligent being  if i die then well and good  i select a likely baby and go straight on  but suppose i hang about till eighty and die a childish old gentleman with a mind all gone to seed what am i going to do then  i shall have to begin all over again perhaps worse off than i was before  thats not going to help us much  joan explained it to him that old age might be likened to an illness  a genius lies upon a bed of sickness and babbles childish nonsense  but with returning life he regains his power goes on increasing it  the mind the soul has not decayed  it is the lines of communication that old age has destroyed  but surely you dont believe it he demanded  why not laughed joan  all things are possible  it was the possession of a hand that transformed monkeys into men  we used to take things up you know and look at them and wonder and wonder and wonder till at last there was born a thought and the world became visible  it is curiosity that will lead us to the next great discovery  we must take things up and think and think and think till one day there will come knowledge and we shall see the universe  joan always avoided getting excited when she thought of it  i love to make you excited flossie had once confessed to her in the old student days  you look so ridiculously young and you are so pleased with yourself laying down the law  she did not know she had given way to it  he was leaning back in his chair looking at her and the tired look she had noticed in his eyes when she had been introduced to him in the drawingroom had gone out of them  during the coffee mrs denton beckoned him to come to her and miss greyson crossed over and took his vacant chair  she had been sitting opposite to them  ive been hearing so much about you she said  i cant help thinking that you ought to suit my brothers paper  he has all your ideas  have you anything that you could send him  joan considered a moment  nothing very startling she answered  i was thinking of a series of articles on the old london churchestouching upon the people connected with them and the things they stood for  ive just finished the first one  it ought to be the very thing answered miss greyson  she was a thin faded woman with a soft plaintive voice  it will enable him to judge your style  hes particular about that  though im confident hell like it she hastened to add  address it to me will you  i assist him as much as i can  joan added a few finishing touches that evening and posted it and a day or two later received a note asking her to call at the office  my sister is enthusiastic about your article on chelsea church and insists on my taking the whole series greyson informed her  she says you have the stevensonian touch  joan flushed with pleasure  and you she asked did you think it had the stevensonian touch  no he answered it seemed to me to have more of your touch  whats that like she demanded  they couldnt suppress you he explained  sir thomas more with his head under his arm bloody old bluebeard grim queen bess snarling old swift pope addison carlylethe whole grisly crowd of them  i could see you holding your own against them all explaining things to them getting excited  he laughed  his sister joined them coming in from the next room  she had a proposal to make  it was that joan should take over the weekly letter from clorinda  it was supposed to give the views of aperhaps unusuallysane and thoughtful woman upon the questions of the day  miss greyson had hitherto conducted it herself but was wishful as she explained to be relieved of it so that she might have more time for home affairs  it would necessitate joans frequent attendance at the office for there would be letters from the public to be answered and points to be discussed with her brother  she was standing behind his chair with her hands upon his head  there was something strangely motherly about her whole attitude  greyson was surprised for the letter had been her own conception and had grown into a popular feature  but she was evidently in earnest and joan accepted willingly  clorinda grew younger more selfassertive on the whole more human  but still so eminently sane and reasonable  we must not forget that she is quite a respectable lady connectedaccording to her own accountwith the higher political circles joans editor would insist with a laugh  miss greyson working in the adjoining room would raise her head and listen  she loved to hear him laugh  its absurd flossie told her one morning as having met by chance they were walking home together along the embankment  youre not clorinda you ought to be writing letters to her not from her waking her up telling her to come off her perch and find out what the earth feels like  ill tell you what ill do ill trot you round to carleton  if youre out for stirring up strife and contention well thats his game too  hell use you for his beastly sordid ends  hed have roped in john the baptist if hed been running the jerusalem star at the time and have given him a daily column for so long as the boom lasted  whats that matter if hes willing to give you a start  joan jibbed at first  but in the end flossies arguments prevailed  one afternoon a week later she was shown into carletons private room and the door closed behind her  the light was dim and for a moment she could see no one until carleton who had been standing near one of the windows came forward and placed a chair for her  and they both sat down  ive glanced through some of your things he said  theyre all right theyre alive  whats your idea  remembering flossies counsel she went straight to the point  she wanted to talk to the people  she wanted to get at them  if she had been a man she would have taken a chair and gone to hyde park  as it was she hadnt the nerve for hyde park  at least she was afraid she hadnt  it might have to come to that  there was a trembling in her voice that annoyed her  she was so afraid she might cry  she wasnt out for anything crazy  she wanted only those things done that could be done if the people would but lift their eyes look into one anothers faces see the wrong and the injustice that was all around them and swear that they would never rest till the pain and the terror had been driven from the land  she wanted soldiersmen and women who would forget their own sweet selves not counting their own loss thinking of the greater gain as in times of war and revolution when men gave even their lives gladly for a dream for a hope  without warning he switched on the electric lamp that stood upon the desk causing her to draw back with a start  all right he said  go ahead  you shall have your tub and a weekly audience of a million readers for as long as you can keep them interested  up with anything you like and down with everything you dont  be careful not to land me in a libel suit  call the whole bench of bishops hypocrites and all the ground landlords thieves if you will but dont mention names  and dont get me into trouble with the police beyond that i shant interfere with you  she was about to speak  one stipulation he went on that every article is headed with your photograph  he read the sudden dismay in her eyes  how else do you think you are going to attract their attention he asked her  by your eloquence  hundreds of men and women as eloquent as you could ever be are shouting to them every day  who takes any notice of them  why should they listen any the more to youanother cranky highbrow some old maid most likely with a bony throat and a beaky nose  if woman is going to come into the fight she will have to use her own weapons  if she is prepared to do that shell make things hum with a vengeance  shes the biggest force going if she only knew it  he had risen and was pacing the room  the advertiser has found that out and is showing the way  he snatched at an illustrated magazine fresh from the press that had been placed upon his desk and opened it at the first page  johnsons blacking he read out advertised by a dainty little minx showing her ankles  whos going to stop for a moment to read about somebodys blacking  if a saucy little minx isnt there to trip him up with her ankles  he turned another page  do you suffer from gout  classical lady preparing to take a bath and very nearly ready  the old johnny in the train stops to look at her  reads the advertisement because she seems to want him to  rubber heels  save your boot leather  lady in evening dressjolly pretty shoulderswaves them in front of your eyes otherwise youd never think of them  he fluttered the pages  then flung the thing across to her  look at it he said  fountain penscorn plasterscharitable appealsmotor carssoapsgrand pianos  its the girl in tights and spangles outside the show that brings them trooping in  let them see you he continued  you say you want soldiers  throw off your veil and call for them  your namesake of france  do you think if she had contented herself with writing stirring appeals that orleans would have fallen  she put on a becoming suit of armour and got upon a horse where everyone could see her  chivalry isnt dead  you modern women are ashamed of yourselvesashamed of your sex  you dont give it a chance  revive it  stir the young mens blood  their souls will follow  he reseated himself and leant across towards her  im not talking business he said  this things not going to mean much to me one way or the other  i want you to win  farm labourers bringing up families on twelve and six a week  shirt hands working half into the night for three farthings an hour  stinking dens for men to live in  degraded women  half fed children  its damnable  tell them its got to stop  that the eternal feminine has stepped out of the poster and commands it  a dapper young man opened the door and put his head into the room  railway smash in yorkshire he announced  carleton sat up  much of a one he asked  the dapper gentleman shrugged his shoulders  three killed eight injured so far he answered  carletons interest appeared to collapse  stop press column asked the dapper gentleman  yes i suppose so replied carleton  unless something better turns up  the dapper young gentleman disappeared  joan had risen  may i talk it over with a friend she asked  myself im inclined to accept  you will if youre in earnest he answered  ill give you twenty four hours  look in tomorrow afternoon and see finch  it will be for the sunday postthe inset  we use surfaced paper for that and can do you justice  finch will arrange about the photograph  he held out his hand  shall be seeing you again he said  it was but a stones throw to the office of the evening gazette  she caught greyson just as he was leaving and put the thing before him  his sister was with him  he did not answer at first  he was walking to and fro and catching his foot in the waste paper basket he kicked it savagely out of his way so that the contents were scattered over the room  yes hes right he said  it was the virgin above the altar that popularized christianity  her face has always been womans fortune  if shes going to become a fighter it will have to be her weapon  he had used almost the same words that carleton had used  i so want them to listen to me she said  after all its only like having a very loud voice  he looked at her and smiled  yes he said its a voice men will listen to  mary greyson was standing by the fire  she had not spoken hitherto  you wont give up clorinda she asked  joan had intended to do so but something in marys voice caused her against her will to change her mind  of course not she answered  i shall run them both  it will be like writing jekyll and hyde  what will you sign yourself he asked  my own name i think she said  joan allway  miss greyson suggested her coming home to dinner with them but joan found an excuse  she wanted to be alone     chapter v   the twilight was fading as she left the office  she turned northward choosing a broad illlighted road  it did not matter which way she took  she wanted to think or rather to dream  it would all fall out as she had intended  she would commence by becoming a power in journalism  she was reconciled now to the photograph ideawas even keen on it herself  she would be taken full face so that she would be looking straight into the eyes of her readers as she talked to them  it would compel her to be herself just a hopeful loving woman a little better educated than the majority having had greater opportunity a little further seeing maybe having had more leisure for thought but otherwise no whit superior to any other young eager woman of the people  this absurd journalistic pose of omniscience of infallibilitythis nonexistent garment of supreme wisdom that like the kings clothes in the fairy story was donned to hide his nakedness by every strutting nonentity of fleet street  she would have no use for it it should be a friend a comrade a fellowservant of the great master taking counsel with them asking their help  government by the people for the people  it must be made real  these silent thoughtfullooking workers hurrying homewards through the darkening streets these patient shrewdplanning housewives casting their shadows on the drawndown blinds it was they who should be shaping the world not the journalists to whom all life was but so much copy  this monstrous conspiracy once of the sword of the church now of the press that put all government into the hands of a few stuffy old gentlemen politicians leader writers without sympathy or understanding it was time that it was swept away  she would raise a new standard  it should be not listen to me oh ye dumb but speak to me  tell me your hidden hopes your fears your dreams  tell me your experience your thoughts born of knowledge of suffering  she would get into correspondence with them go among them talk to them the difficulty at first would be in getting them to write to her to open their minds to her  these voiceless masses that never spoke but were always being spoken for by selfappointed leaders representatives who immediately they had climbed into prominence took their place among the rulers and then from press and platform shouted to them what they were to think and feel  it was as if the drillsergeant were to claim to be the leader the representative of his squad or the sheepdog to pose as the delegate of the sheep  dealt with always as if they were mere herds mere flocks they had almost lost the power of individual utterance  one would have to teach them encourage them  she remembered a sunday class she had once conducted and how for a long time she had tried in vain to get the children to come in to take a hand  that she might get in touch with them understand their small problems she had urged them to ask questions  and there had fallen such long silences  until at last one cheeky ragamuffin had piped out  please miss have you got red hair all over you  or only on your head  for answer she had rolled up her sleeve and let them examine her arm and then in her turn had insisted on rolling up his sleeve revealing the fact that his arms above the wrists had evidently not too recently been washed and the episode had ended in laughter and a babel of shrill voices  and at once they were a party of chums discussing matters together  they were but children these tired men and women just released from their days toil hastening homeward to their play or to their evening tasks  a little humour a little understanding a recognition of the wonderful likeness of us all to one another underneath our outward coverings was all that was needed to break down the barrier establish comradeship  she stood aside a moment to watch them streaming by  keen strong faces were among them high thoughtful brows kind eyes they must learn to think to speak for themselves  she would build again the forum  the peoples business should no longer be settled for them behind lackeyguarded doors  the good of the farm labourer should be determined not exclusively by the squire and his relations  the man with the hoe the man with the bent back and the patient oxlike eyes he too should be invited to the council board middleclass domestic problems should be solved not solely by fine gentlemen from oxford the wife of the little clerk should be allowed her say  war or peace it should no longer be regarded as a question concerning only the aged rich  the common peoplethe cannon fodder the men who would die and the women who would weep they should be given something more than the privilege of either cheering platform patriots or being summoned for interrupting public meetings  from a dismal side street there darted past her a small shapeless figure in crumpled cap and apron evidently a member of that lazy overindulged class the domestic servant  judging from the talk of the drawingrooms the correspondence in the papers a singularly unsatisfactory body  they toiled not lived in luxury and demanded grand pianos  someone had proposed doing something for them  they themselvesit seemed that even they had a sort of consciencewere up in arms against it  too much kindness even they themselves perceived was bad for them  they were holding a meeting that night to explain how contented they were  six peeresses had consented to attend and speak for them  likely enough that there were goodfornothing cockered menials imposing upon incompetent mistresses  there were pampered slaves in rome  but these others  these poor little helpless sluts  there were thousands such in every city overworked and underfed living lonely pleasureless lives  they must be taught to speak in other voices than the dulcet tones of peeresses  by the light of the guttering candles from their chill attics they should write to her their illspelt visions  she had reached a quiet treebordered road surrounding a great park lovers furtively holding hands passed her by whispering  she would write books  she would choose for her heroine a woman of the people  how full of drama of tragedy must be their stories their problems the grim realities of life not only its mere sentimental embroideries  the daily struggle for bare existence the evershadowing menace of unemployment of illness leaving them helpless amid the grinding forces crushing them down on every side  the ceaseless need for courage for cunning  for in the kingdom of the poor the tyrant and the oppressor still sit in the high places the robber still rides fearless  in a noisy flaring street a thinclad woman passed her carrying a netted bag showing two loaves  in a flash it came to her what it must mean to the poor this daily bread that in comfortable homes had come to be regarded as a thing like water not to be considered to be used without stint wasted thrown about  borne by those feeble knotted hands joan saw it revealed as something holy hallowed by labour sanctified by suffering by sacrifice worshipped with fear and prayer  in quiet streets of stately houses she caught glimpses through uncurtained windows of richlylaid dinnertables about which servants moved noiselessly arranging flowers and silver  she wondered idly if she would every marry  a gracious hostess gathering around her brilliant men and women statesmen writers artists captains of industry counselling them even learning from them encouraging shy genius  perhaps in a perfectly harmless way allowing it the inspiration derivable from a wellregulated devotion to herself  a salon that should be the nucleus of all those forces that influence influences over which she would rule with sweet and wise authority  the idea appealed to her  into the picture slightly to the background she unconsciously placed greyson  his tall thin figure with its air of distinction seemed to fit in greyson would be very restful  she could see his handsome ascetic face flush with pleasure as after the guests were gone she would lean over the back of his chair and caress for a moment his dark soft hair tinged here and there with grey  he would always adore her in that distant undemonstrative way of his that would never be tiresome or exacting  they would have children  but not too many  that would make the house noisy and distract her from her work  they would be beautiful and clever unless all the laws of heredity were to be set aside for her especial injury  she would train them shape them to be the heirs of her labour bearing her message to the generations that should follow  at a corner where the trams and buses stopped she lingered for a while watching the fierce struggle the weak and aged being pushed back time after time hardly seeming to even resent it regarding it as in the natural order of things  it was so absurd apart from the injustice the brutality of it  the poor fighting among themselves  she felt as once when watching a crowd of birds to whom she had thrown a handful of crumbs in winter time  as if they had not enemies enough cats weasels rats hawks owls the hunger and the cold  and added to all they must needs make the struggle yet harder for one another pecking at each others eyes joining with one another to attack the fallen  these tired men these weary women palefaced lads and girls why did they not organize among themselves some system that would do away with this daily warfare of each against all  if only they could be got to grasp the fact that they were one family bound together by suffering  then and not till then would they be able to make their power felt  that would have to come first the esprit de corps of the poor  in the end she would go into parliament  it would be bound to come soon the womans vote  and after that the opening of all doors would follow she would wear her college robes  it would be far more fitting than a succession of flimsy frocks that would have no meaning in them  what pity it was that the art of dressingits relation to lifewas not better understood  what beautyhating devil had prompted the workers to discard their characteristic costumes that had been both beautiful and serviceable for these hateful slopshop clothes that made them look like walking scarecrows  why had the coming of democracy coincided seemingly with the spread of ugliness dull towns mean streets paperstrewn parks corrugated iron roofs christian chapels that would be an insult to a heathen idol hideous factories why need they be hideous chimney pot hats baggy trousers vulgar advertisements stupid fashions for women that spoilt every line of their figure dinginess drabness monotony everywhere  it was ugliness that was strangling the soul of the people stealing from them all dignity all selfrespect all honour for one another robbing them of hope of reverence of joy in life  beauty  that was the key to the riddle  all nature its golden sunsets and its silvery dawns the glory of piledup clouds the mystery of moonlit glades its rivers winding through the meadows the calling of its restless seas the tender witchery of spring the blazonry of autumn woods its purple moors and the wonder of its silent mountains its cobwebs glittering with a thousand jewels the pageantry of starry nights  form colour music  the feathered choristers of bush and brake raising their matin and their evensong the whispering of the leaves the singing of the waters the voices of the winds  beauty and grace in every living thing but man  the leaping of the hares the grouping of cattle the flight of swallows the dainty loveliness of insects wings the glossy skin of horses rising and falling to the play of mighty muscles  was it not seeking to make plain to us that gods language was beauty  man must learn beauty that he may understand god  she saw the london of the future  not the vision popular just then a soaring whirl of machinery in motion of moving pavements and flying omnibuses of screaming gramophones and standardized homes a city where electricity was king and man its soulless slave  but a city of peace of restful spaces of leisured men and women a city of fine streets and pleasant houses where each could live his own life learning freedom individuality a city of noble schools of workshops that should be worthy of labour filled with light and air smoke and filth driven from the land science no longer bound to commercialism having discovered cleaner forces a city of gay playgrounds where children should learn laughter of leafy walks where the creatures of the wood and field should be as welcome guests helping to teach sympathy and kindliness a city of music of colour of gladness  beauty worshipped as religion ugliness banished as a sin no ugly slums no ugly cruelty no slatternly women and brutalized men no ugly sobbing children no ugly vice flaunting in every highway its insult to humanity a city clad in beauty as with a living garment where god should walk with man  she had reached a neighbourhood of narrow crowded streets  the women were mostly without hats and swarthy men rolling cigarettes lounged against doorways  the place had a quaint foreign flavour  tiny cafes filled with smoke and noise and clean inviting restaurants abounded she was feeling hungry and choosing one the door of which stood open revealing white tablecloths and a pleasant air of cheerfulness she entered  it was late and the tables were crowded  only at one in a far corner could she detect a vacant place opposite to a slight pretty looking girl very quietly dressed  she made her way across and the girl anticipating her request welcomed her with a smile  they ate for a while in silence divided only by the narrow table their heads when they leant forward almost touching  joan noticed the short white hands the fragrance of some delicate scent  there was something odd about her  she seemed to be unnecessarily conscious of being alone suddenly she spoke  nice little restaurant this she said  one of the few places where you can depend upon not being annoyed  joan did not understand  in what way she asked  oh you know men answered the girl  they come and sit down opposite to you and wont leave you alone  at most of the places youve got to put up with it or go outside  here old gustav never permits it  joan was troubled  she was rather looking forward to occasional restaurant dinners where she would be able to study londons bohemia  you mean she asked that they force themselves upon you even if you make it plain  oh the plainer you make it that you dont want them the more sport they think it interrupted the girl with a laugh  joan hoped she was exaggerating  i must try and select a table where there is some goodnatured girl to keep me in countenance she said with a smile  yes i was glad to see you answered the girl  its hateful dining by oneself  are you living alone  yes answered joan  im a journalist  i thought you were something answered the girl  im an artist  or rather was she added after a pause  why did you give it up asked joan  oh i havent given it up not entirely the girl answered  i can always get a couple of sovereigns for a sketch if i want it from one or another of the framemakers  and they can generally sell them for a fiver  ive seen them marked up  have you been long in london  no answered joan  im a lancashire lass  curious said the girl so am i  my fathers a mill manager near bolton  you werent educated there  no joan admitted  i went to rodean at brighton when i was ten years old and so escaped it  nor were you she added with a smile judging from your accent  no answered the other i was at hastingsmiss gwyns  funny how we seem to have always been near to one another  dad wanted me to be a doctor  but id always been mad about art  joan had taken a liking to the girl  it was a spiritual vivacious face with frank eyes and a firm mouth and the voice was low and strong  tell me she said what interfered with it  unconsciously she was leaning forward her chin supported by her hands  their faces were very near to one another  the girl looked up  she did not answer for a moment  there came a hardening of the mouth before she spoke  a baby she said  oh it was my own fault she continued  i wanted it  it was all the talk at the time  you dont remember  our right to children  no woman complete without one  maternity womans kingdom all that sort of thing  as if the storks brought them  dont suppose it made any real difference but it just helped me to pretend that it was something pretty and highclass  overmastering passion used to be the explanation before that  i guess its all much of a muchness just natural instinct  the restaurant had been steadily emptying  monsieur gustav and his ample bosomed wife were seated at a distant table eating their own dinner  why couldnt you have married asked joan  the girl shrugged her shoulders  who was there for me to marry she answered  the men who wanted me clerks young tradesmen down at homei wasnt taking any of that lot  and the men i might have fancied were all of them too poor  there was one student  hes got on since easy enough for him to talk about waiting  meanwhile  well its like somebody suggesting dinner to you the day after tomorrow  all right enough if youre not troubled with an appetite  the waiter came to clear the table  they were almost the last customers left  the mans tone and manner jarred upon joan  she had not noticed it before  joan ordered coffee and the girl exchanging a joke with the waiter added a liqueur  but why should you give up your art persisted joan  it was that was sticking in her mind  i should have thought that if only for the sake of the child you would have gone on with it  oh i told myself all that answered the girl  was going to devote my life to it  did for nearly two years  till i got sick of living like a nun never getting a bit of excitement  you see ive got the poison in me  or maybe it had always been there  whats become of it asked joan  the child  mothers got it answered the girl  seemed best for the poor little beggar  im supposed to be dead and my husband gone abroad  she gave a short dry laugh  mother brings him up to see me once a year  theyve got quite fond of him  what are you doing now asked joan in a low tone  oh you neednt look so scared laughed the girl i havent come down to that  her voice had changed  it had a note of shrillness  in some indescribable way she had grown coarse  im a kept woman she explained  what else is any woman  she reached for her jacket and the waiter sprang forward and helped her on with it prolonging the business needlessly  she wished him good evening in a tone of distant hauteur and led the way to the door outside the street was dim and silent  joan held out her hand  no hope of happy endings she said with a forced laugh  couldnt marry him i suppose  he has asked me answered the girl with a swagger  not sure that it would suit me now  theyre not so nice to you when theyve got you fixed up  so long  she turned abruptly and walked rapidly away  joan moved instinctively in the opposite direction and after a few minutes found herself in a broad welllighted thoroughfare  a newsboy was shouting his wares  orrible murder of a woman  shockin details  speshul repeating it over and over again in a hoarse expressionless monotone  he was selling the papers like hot cakes the purchasers too eager to even wait for their change  she wondered with a little lump in her throat how many would have stopped to buy had he been calling instead discovery of new sonnet by shakespeare  extra special  through swinging doors she caught glimpses of foul interiors crowded with men and women released from their toil taking their evening pleasure  from coloured posters outside the great theatres and music halls vulgarity and lewdness leered at her side by side with announcements that the house was full  from every roaring corner scintillating lights flared forth the merits of this public benefactors whisky of this other celebritys beer it seemed the only message the people cared to hear  even among the sirens of the pavement she noticed that the quiet and merely pretty were hardly heeded  it was everywhere the painted and the overdressed that drew the roving eyes  she remembered a pet dog that someone had given her when she was a girl and how one afternoon she had walked with the tears streaming down her face because in spite of her scoldings and her pleadings it would keep stopping to lick up filth from the roadway  a kindly passerby had laughed and told her not to mind  why thats a sign of breeding that is missie the man had explained its the classy ones that are always the worst  it had come to her afterwards craving with its soft brown troubled eyes for forgiveness  but she had never been able to break it of the habit  must man for ever be chained by his appetites to the unclean ever be driven back dragged down again into the dirt by his own instincts ever be rendered useless for all finer purposes by the baseness of his own desires  the city of her dreams  the mingled voices of the crowd shaped itself into a mocking laugh  it seemed to her that it was she that they were laughing at pointing her out to one another jeering at her reviling her threatening her  she hurried onward with bent head trying to escape them  she felt so small so helpless  almost she cried out in her despair  she must have walked mechanically  looking up she found herself in her own street  and as she reached her doorway the tears came suddenly  she heard a quick step behind her and turning she saw a man with a latch key in his hand  he passed her and opened the door and then facing round stood aside for her to enter  he was a sturdy thickset man with a strong massive face  it would have been ugly but for the deep flashing eyes  there was tenderness and humour in them  we are next floor neighbours he said  my names phillips  joan thanked him  as he held the door open for her their hands accidentally touched  joan wished him goodnight and went up the stairs there was no light in her room only the faint reflection of the street lamp outside  she could still see him the boyish smile  and his voice that had sent her tears back again as if at the word of command  she hoped he had not seen them  what a little fool she was  a little laugh escaped her     chapter vi   one day joan lunching at the club met madge singleton  ive had such a funny letter from flossie said joan begging me almost with tears in her ink to come to her on sunday evening to meet a gentleman friend of hers as she calls him and give her my opinion of him  what on earth is she up to  its all right answered madge  she doesnt really want our opinion of himor rather she doesnt want our real opinion of him  she only wants us to confirm hers  shes engaged to him  flossie engaged joan seemed surprised  yes answered madge  it used to be a custom  young men used to ask young women to marry them  and if they consented it was called being engaged  still prevails so i am told in certain classes  thanks said joan  i have heard of it  i thought perhaps you hadnt from your tone explained madge  but if shes already engaged to him why risk criticism of him argued joan ignoring madges flippancy  its too late  oh shes going to break it off unless we all assure her that we find him brainy madge explained with a laugh  it seems her father wasnt brainy and her mother was  or else it was the other way about im not quite sure  but whichever it was it led to ructions  myself if hes at all possible and seems to care for her i intend to find him brilliant  and suppose she repeats her mothers experience suggested joan  there were the nortonbrowns answered madge  impossible to have found a more evenly matched pair  they both write novelsvery good novels too and got jealous of one another and threw pressnotices at one anothers head all breakfasttime until they separated  dont know of any recipe myself for being happy ever after marriage except not expecting it  or keeping out of it altogether added joan  ever spent a day at the home for destitute gentlewomen at east sheen demanded madge  not yet admitted joan  may have to later on  it ought to be included in every womans education madge continued it is reserved for spinsters of over fortyfive  susan fleming wrote an article upon it for the teachers friend and spent an afternoon and evening there  a month later she married a grocer with five children the only sound suggestion for avoiding trouble that i ever came across was in a burlesque of the blue bird  you remember the scene where the spirits of the children are waiting to go down to earth and be made into babies  someone had stuck up a notice at the entrance to the gangway dont get born  it only means worry  flossie had her dwellingplace in a second floor bedsittingroom of a lodging house in queens square bloomsbury but the drawingroom floor being for the moment vacant flossie had persuaded her landlady to let her give her party there it seemed as if fate approved of the idea  the room was fairly full when joan arrived  flossie took her out on the landing and closed the door behind them  you will be honest with me wont you pleaded flossie because its so important and i dont seem able to think for myself  as they say no man can be his own solicitor can he  of course i like him and all thatvery much  and i really believe he loves me  we were children together when mummy was alive and then he had to go abroad and has only just come back  of course ive got to think of him too as he says but then on the other hand i dont want to make a mistake  that would be so terrible for both of us and of course i am clever and there was poor mummy and daddy  ill tell you all about them one day  it was so awfully sad  get him into a corner and talk to him  youll be able to judge in a moment youre so wonderful  hes quiet on the outside but i think theres depth in him  we must go in now  she had talked so rapidly joan felt as if her hat were being blown away she had difficulty in recognizing flossie  all the cocksure pertness had departed  she seemed just a kid  joan promised faithfully and flossie standing on tiptoe suddenly kissed her and then bustled her in  flossies young man was standing near the fire talking or rather listening to a birdlike little woman in a short white frock and blue ribbons  a sombre lady just behind her whom joan from the distance took to be her nurse turned out to be her secretary whose duty it was to be always at hand prepared to take down any happy idea that might occur to the birdlike little woman in the course of conversation  the birdlike little woman was miss rose tolley a popular novelist  she was explaining to flossies young man whose name was sam halliday the reason for her having written running waters her latest novel  it is daring she admitted  i must be prepared for opposition  but it had to be stated  i take myself as typical she continued  when i was twenty i could have loved you  you were the type of man i did love  mr halliday who had been supporting the weight of his body upon his right leg transferred the burden to his left  but now im thirtyfive and i couldnt love you if i tried  she shook her curls at him  it isnt your fault  it is that i have changed suppose id married you  bit of bad luck for both of us suggested mr halliday  a tragedy miss tolley corrected him  there are millions of such tragedies being enacted around us at this moment  sensitive women compelled to suffer the embraces of men that they have come to loathe whats to be done  flossie who had been hovering impatient broke in  oh dont you believe her she advised mr halliday  she loves you still  shes only teasing you  this is joan  she introduced her  miss tolley bowed and allowed herself to be drawn away by a lankhaired young man who had likewise been waiting for an opening  he represented the uplift film association of chicago and was wishful to know if miss tolley would consent to altering the last chapter and so providing running waters with a happy ending  he pointed out the hopelessness of it in its present form for film purposes  the discussion was brief  then ill send your agent the contract to morrow joan overheard him say a minute later  mr sam halliday she liked at once  he was a cleanshaven squarejawed young man with quiet eyes and a pleasant voice  try and find me brainy he whispered to her as soon as flossie was out of earshot  talk to me about china  im quite intelligent on china  they both laughed and then shot a guilty glance in flossies direction  do the women really crush their feet asked joan  yes he answered  all those who have no use for them  about one per cent of the population  to listen to miss tolley you would think that half the women wanted a new husband every ten years  its always the one per cent that get themselves talked about  the other ninetynine are too busy  you are young for a philosopher said joan  he laughed  i told you id be all right if you started me on china he said  why are you marrying  flossie joan asked him  she thought his point of view would be interesting  not sure i am yet he answered with a grin  it depends upon how i get through this evening  he glanced round the room  have i got to pass all this crowd i wonder he added  joans eyes followed  it was certainly an odd collection  flossie in her hunt for brains had issued her invitations broadcast and her fate had been that of the charity concert  not all the stars upon whom she had most depended had turned up  on the other hand not a single freak had failed her  at the moment the centre of the room was occupied by a gentleman and two ladies in classical drapery  they were holding hands in an attitude suggestive of a basrelief  joan remembered them having seen them on one or two occasions wandering in the kings road chelsea still maintaining as far as the traffic would allow the basrelief suggestion and generally surrounded by a crowd of children ever hopeful that at the next corner they would stop and do something really interesting  they belonged to a society whose object was to lure the london public by the force of example towards the adoption of the early greek fashions and the simpler greek attitudes  a friend of flossies had thrown in her lot with them but could never be induced to abandon her umbrella  they also as joan told herself were reformers  near to them was a picturesque gentleman with a beard down to his waist whose stuntas flossie would have termed itwas hygienic clothing it seemed to contain an undue proportion of fresh air  there were ladies in coats and standup collars and gentlemen with ringlets  more than one of the guests would have been better though perhaps not happier for a bath  i fancy thats the idea said joan  what will you do if you fail  go back to china  yes he answered  and take her with me  poor little girl  joan rather resented his tone  we are not all alike she remarked  some of us are quite sane  he looked straight into her eyes  you are he said  i have been reading your articles  they are splendid  im going to help  how can you she said  i mean how will you  shipping is my business he said  im going to help sailor men  see that they have somewhere decent to go to and dont get robbed  and then there are the lascars poor devils  nobody ever takes their part  how did you come across them she asked  the articles i mean  did flo give them to you  no he answered  just chance  caught sight of your photo  tell me she said  if it had been the photo of a woman with a bony throat and a beaky nose would you have read them  he thought a moment  guess not he answered  youre just as bad he continued  isnt it the palefaced young clergyman with the wavy hair and the beautiful voice that you all flock to hear  no getting away from nature  but it wasnt only that  he hesitated  i want to know she said  you looked so young he answered  i had always had the idea that it was up to the old people to put the world to rightsthat all i had to do was to look after myself  it came to me suddenly while you were talking to mei mean while i was reading you that if you were worrying yourself about it id got to come in toothat it would be mean of me not to  it wasnt like being preached to  it was somebody calling for help  instinctively she held out her hand and he grasped it  flossie came up at the same instant  she wanted to introduce him to miss lavery who had just arrived  hullo she said  are you two concluding a bargain  yes said joan  we are founding the league of youth  youve got to be in it  we are going to establish branches all round the world  flossies young man was whisked away  joan who had seated herself in a small chair was alone for a few minutes  miss tolley had chanced upon a human document with the help of which she was hopeful of starting a press controversy concerning the morality or otherwise of running waters  the secretary stood just behind her taking notes  they had drifted quite close  joan could not help overhearing  it always seemed to me immoral the marriage ceremony the human document was explaining  she was a thin sallow woman with an untidy head and restless eyes that seemed to be always seeking something to look at and never finding it  how can we pledge the future  to bind oneself to live with a man when perhaps we have ceased to care for him its hideous  miss tolley murmured agreement  our love was beautiful continued the human document eager apparently to relate her experience for the common good just because it was a free gift  we were not fettered to one another  at any moment either of us could have walked out of the house  the idea never occurred to us not for yearsfive to be exact  the secretary at a sign from miss tolley made a memorandum of it  and then did your feelings towards him change suddenly questioned miss tolley  no explained the human document in the same quick even tones so far as i was concerned i was not conscious of any alteration in my own attitude  but he felt the need of more solitudefor his development  we parted quite good friends  oh said miss tolley  and were there any children  only two answered the human document both girls  what has become of them persisted miss tolley  the human document looked offended  you do not think i would have permitted any power on earth to separate them from me do you she answered  i said to him they are mine mine  where i go they go where i stay they stay  he saw the justice of my argument  and they are with you now concluded miss tolley  you must come and see them the human document insisted  such dear magnetic creatures  i superintend their entire education myself  we have a cottage in surrey  its rather a tight fit  you see there are seven of us now  but the three girls can easily turn in together for a night abner will be delighted  abner is your second suggested miss tolley  my third the human document corrected her  after eustace i married ivanoff  i say married because i regard it as the holiest form of marriage  he had to return to his own country  there was a political movement on foot  he felt it his duty to go  i want you particularly to meet the boy  he will interest you  miss tolley appeared to be getting muddled  whose boy she demanded  ivanoffs explained the human document  he was our only child  flossie appeared towing a whitehaired distinguishedlooking man a mr folk  she introduced him and immediately disappeared  joan wished she had been left alone a little longer  she would like to have heard more especially was she curious concerning abner the ladys third  would the higher moral law compel him likewise to leave the poor lady saddled with another couple of children  or would she on this occasion get inor rather get off first  her own fancy was to back abner  she did catch just one sentence before miss tolley having obtained more food for reflection than perhaps she wanted signalled to her secretary that the notebook might be closed  womans right to follow the dictates of her own heart uncontrolled by any law the human document was insisting that is one of the first things we must fight for  mr folk was a wellknown artist  he lived in paris  you are wonderfully like your mother he told joan  in appearance i mean he added  i knew her when she was miss caxton  i acted with her in america  joan made a swift effort to hide her surprise  she had never heard of her mother having been upon the stage  i did not know that you had been an actor she answered  i wasnt really explained mr folk  i just walked and talked naturally  it made rather a sensation at the time  your mother was a genius  you have never thought of going on the stage yourself  no said joan  i dont think ive got what you call the artistic temperament  i have never felt drawn towards anything of that sort  i wonder he said  you could hardly be your mothers daughter without it  tell me said joan  what was my mother like  i can only remember her as more or less of an invalid  he did not reply to her question  master or mistress eminent artist he said intends to retire from his or her particular stage whatever it may be  that paragraph ought always to be put among the obituary notices  whats your line he asked her  i take it you have one by your being here  besides i am sure you have  i am an old fighter  i can tell the young soldier  whats your regiment  joan laughed  im a drummer boy she answered  i beat my drum each week in a sunday newspaper hoping the lads will follow  you feel you must beat that drum he suggested  beat it louder and louder and louder till all the world shall hear it  yes joan agreed i think that does describe me  he nodded  i thought you were an artist he said  dont let them ever take your drum away from you  youll go to pieces and get into mischief without it  i know an old actress he continued  shes the mother of four  they are all on the stage and theyve all made their mark  the youngest was born in her dressingroom just after the curtain had fallen  she was playing the nurse to your mothers juliet  she is still the best nurse that i know  jacks always worrying me to chuck it and devote myself to the children she confided to me one evening while she was waiting for her cue  but as i tell him im more helpful to them being with them half the day alive than all the day dead  thats an anecdote worth remembering when your time comes  if god gives woman a drum he doesnt mean man to take it away from her  she hasnt got to be playing it for twentyfour hours a day  id like you to have seen your mothers cordelia  flossie was tacking her way towards them  joan acted on impulse  i wish youd give me your address she said where i could write to you or perhaps you would not mind my coming and seeing you one day  i would like you to tell me more about my mother  he gave her his address in paris where he was returning almost immediately  do come he said  it will take me back thirtythree years  i proposed to your mother on la grande terrasse at st germain  we will walk there  im still a bachelor  he laughed and kissing her hand allowed himself to be hauled away by flossie in exchange for mrs phillips for whom miss lavery had insisted on an invitation  joan had met mrs phillips several times and once on the stairs had stopped and spoken to her but had never been introduced to her formally till now  we have been meaning to call on you so often panted mrs phillips  the room was crowded and the exertion of squeezing her way through had winded the poor lady  we take so much interest in your articles  my husband she paused for a second before venturing upon the word and the aitch came out somewhat overaspiratedreads them most religiously  you must come and dine with us one evening  joan answered that she would be very pleased  i will find out when robert is free and run up and let you know she continued  of course there are so many demands upon him especially during this period of national crisis that i spare him all the social duties that i can  but i shall insist on his making an exception in your case  joan murmured her sense of favour but hoped she would not be allowed to interfere with more pressing calls upon mr phillipss time  it will do him good answered mrs phillips getting away from them all for an hour or two  i dont see much of him myself  she glanced round and lowered her voice  they tell me she said that youre a ba  yes answered joan  one goes in for it more out of vanity im afraid than for any real purpose that it serves  i took one or two prizes myself said mrs phillips  but of course one forgets things  i was wondering if you would mind if i ran up occasionally to ask you a question  of course as you know my usband as ad so few advantagesthe ladys mind was concerned with more important matters and the aspirates on this occasion got themselves neglectedit is wonderful what he as done without them  but if now and then i could elp him  there was something about the poor foolish painted face as it looked up pleadingly that gave it a momentary touch of beauty  do said joan speaking earnestly  i shall be so very pleased if you will  thank you said the woman  miss lavery came up in a hurry to introduce her to miss tolley  i am telling all my friends to read your articles she added resuming the gracious patroness as she bowed her adieus  joan was alone again for a while  a handsome girl with her hair cut short and parted at the side was discussing diseases of the spine with a curlyheaded young man in a velvet suit  the gentleman was describing some of the effects in detail  joan felt there was danger of her being taken ill if she listened any longer and seeing madges brother near the door and unoccupied she made her way across to him  niel singleton or keeley as he called himself upon the stage was quite unlike his sister  he was short and plump with a preternaturally solemn face contradicted by small twinkling eyes  he motioned joan to a chair and told her to keep quiet and not disturb the meeting  is he brainy he whispered after a minute  i like him said joan  i didnt ask you if you liked him he explained to her  i asked you if he was brainy  im not too sure that you like brainy men  yes i do said joan  i like you sometimes  now none of that he said severely  its no good your thinking of me  im wedded to my art  we are talking about mr halliday  what does madge think of him asked joan  madge has fallen in love with him and her judgment is not to be relied upon he said  i suppose you couldnt answer a straight question if you tried  dont be so harsh with me pleaded joan meekly  im trying to think yes she continued decidedly hes got brains  enough for the two of them demanded mr singleton  because he will want them  now think before you speak  joan considered  yes she answered  i should say hes just the man to manage her  then its settled he said  we must save her  save her from what demanded joan  from his saying to himself this is flossies idea of a party  this is the sort of thing that if i marry her i am letting myself in for  if he hasnt broken off the engagement already we may be in time  he led the way to the piano  tell madge i want her he whispered  he struck a few notes and then in a voice that drowned every other sound in the room struck up a comic song  the effect was magical  he followed it up with another  this one with a chorus consisting chiefly of umpty umpty umpty umpty ay which was vociferously encored  by the time it was done with madge had discovered a girl who could sing three little pigs and a sad palefaced gentleman who told stories  at the end of one of them madges brother spoke to joan in a tone more of sorrow than of anger  hardly the sort of anecdote that a truly noble and highminded young woman would have received with laughter he commented  did i laugh said joan  your having done so unconsciously only makes the matter worse observed mr singleton  i had hoped it emanated from politeness not enjoyment  dont tease her said madge  shes having an evening off  joan and the singletons were the last to go  they promised to show mr halliday a short cut to his hotel in holborn  have you thanked miss lessing for a pleasant evening asked mr singleton turning to mr halliday  he laughed and put his arm round her  poor little woman he said youre looking so tired  it was jolly at the end  he kissed her  he had passed through the swing doors and they were standing on the pavement waiting for joans bus  why did we all like him asked joan  even miss lavery  theres nothing extraordinary about him  oh yes there is said madge  love has lent him gilded armour  from his helmet waves her crest she quoted  most men look fine in that costume  pity they cant always wear it  the conductor seemed impatient  joan sprang upon the step and waved her hand     chapter vii   joan was making herself a cup of tea when there came a tap at the door it was mrs phillips  i heard you come in she said  youre not busy are you  no answered joan  i hope youre not  im generally in about this time and its always nice to gossip over a dish of tea  why do you say dish of tea asked mrs phillips as she lowered herself with evident satisfaction into the easy chair joan placed for her  oh i dont know laughed joan  dr johnson always talked of a dish of tea  gives it a literary flavour  ive heard of him said mrs phillips  hes worth reading isnt he  well he talked more amusingly than he wrote explained joan  get boswells life of him  or ill lend you mine she added if youll be careful of it  youll find all the passages marked that are best worth remembering  at least i think so  thanks said mrs phillips  you see as the wife of a public man i get so little time for study  is it settled yet asked joan  are they going to make room for him in the cabinet  im afraid so answered mrs phillips  oh of course i want him to she corrected herself  and he must of course if the king insists upon it  but i wish it hadnt all come with such a whirl  what shall i have to do do you think  joan was pouring out the tea  oh nothing she answered but just be agreeable to the right people  hell tell you who they are  and take care of him  i wish id taken more interest in politics when i was young said mrs phillips  of course when i was a girl women werent supposed to  do you know i shouldnt worry about them if i were you joan advised her  let him forget them when hes with you  a man can have too much of a good thing she laughed  i wonder if youre right mused mrs phillips  he does often say that hed just as soon i didnt talk about them  joan shot a glance from over her cup  the poor puzzled face was staring into the fire  joan could almost hear him saying it  im sure i am she said  make homecoming a change to him  as you said yourself the other evening  its good for him to get away from it all now and then  i must try agreed mrs phillips looking up  what sort of things ought i to talk to him about do you think  joan gave an inward sigh  hadnt the poor lady any friends of her own oh almost anything she answered vaguely so long as its cheerful and nonpolitical  what used you to talk about before he became a great man  there came a wistful look into the worried eyes  oh it was all so different then she said  e just liked toyou know  we didnt seem to ave to talk  e was a rare one to tease  i didnt know ow clever e was then  it seemed a difficult case to advise upon  how long have you been married joan asked  fifteen years she answered  i was a bit older than im  but ive never looked my age they tell me  lord what a boy e was  swept you off your feet like  e wasnt the only one  id got a way with me i suppose  anyhow the men seemed to think so  there was always a few anging about  like flies round a oneypot mother used to say  she giggled  but e wouldnt take no for an answer  and i didnt want to give it im neither  i was gone on im right enough  no use saying i wasnt  you must be glad you didnt say no suggested joan  yes she answered es got on  i always think of that little poem lord burleigh she continued whenever i get worrying about myself ever read it  yes answered joan  he was a landscape painter wasnt he  thats the one said mrs phillips  i little thought i was letting myself in for being the wife of a big pot when bob phillips came along in is miners jacket  youll soon get used to it joan told her  the great thing is not to be afraid of ones fate whatever it is but just to do ones best  it was rather like talking to a child  youre the right sort to put eart into a body  im glad i came up said mrs phillips  i get a bit down in the mouth sometimes when e goes off into one of is brown studies and i dont seem to know what es thinking about  but it dont last long  i was always one of the lightearted ones  they discussed life on two thousand a year the problems it would present and mrs phillips became more cheerful  joan laid herself out to be friendly  she hoped to establish an influence over mrs phillips that should be for the poor ladys good and as she felt instinctively for poor phillipss also  it was not an unpleasing face  underneath the paint it was kind and womanly  joan was sure he would like it better clean  a few months attention to diet would make a decent figure of her and improve her wind  joan watched her spreading the butter a quarter of an inch thick upon her toast and restrained with difficulty the impulse to take it away from her  and her clothes  joan had seen guys carried through the streets on the fifth of november that were less obtrusive  she remembered as she was taking her leave what she had come for which was to invite joan to dinner on the following friday  its just a homely affair she explained  she had recovered her form and was now quite the lady again  two other guests beside yourself a mr airliei am sure you will like him  hes so dilletantyand mr mckean  hes the young man upstairs  have you met him  joan hadnt except once on the stairs when to avoid having to pass her he had gone down again and out into the street  from the doorstep she had caught sight of his disappearing coattails round the corner yielding to impishness she had run after him and his expression of blank horror when glancing over his shoulder he found her walking abstractedly three yards behind him had gladdened all her evening  joan recounted the episodeso far as the doorstep  he tried to be shy with me said mrs phillips but i wouldnt let him  i chipped him out of it  if hes going to write plays as i told him he will have to get over his fear of a petticoat  she offered her cheek and joan kissed it somewhat gingerly  you wont mind robert not wearing evening dress she said  he never will if he can help it  i shall just slip on a semitoilette myself  joan had difficulty in deciding on her own frock  her four evening dresses as she walked round them spread out upon the bed all looked too imposing for what mrs phillips had warned her would be a homely affair  she had one other a greyishfawn with sleeves to the elbow that she had had made expressly for public dinners and political at homes  but that would be going to the opposite extreme and might seem discourteousto her hostess  besides mousey colours didnt really suit her  they gave her a curious sense of being affected  in the end she decided to risk a black crepedechine square cut with a girdle of gold embroidery  there couldnt be anything quieter than black and the gold embroidery was of the simplest  she would wear it without any jewellery whatever except just a star in her hair  the result as she viewed the effect in the long glass quite satisfied her  perhaps the jewelled star did scintillate rather  it had belonged to her mother  but her hair was so full of shadows it wanted something to relieve it  also she approved the curved line of her bare arms  it was certainly very beautiful a womans arm  she took her gloves in her hand and went down  mr phillips was not yet in the room  mrs phillips in applegreen with an ostrich feather in her hair greeted her effusively and introduced her to her fellow guests  mr airlie was a slight elegant gentleman of uncertain age with sandy hair and beard cut vandyke fashion  he asked joans permission to continue his cigarette  you have chosen the better part he informed her on her granting it when im not smoking im talking  mr mckean shook her hand vigorously without looking at her  and this is hilda concluded mrs phillips  she ought to be in bed if she hadnt a naughty daddy who spoils her  a lank blackhaired girl with a pair of burning eyes looking out of a face that but for the thin line of the lips would have been absolutely colourless rose suddenly from behind a bowl of artificial flowers  joan could not suppress a slight start she had not noticed her on entering the girl came slowly forward and joan felt as if the uncanny eyes were eating her up  she made an effort and held out her hand with a smile and the girls long thin fingers closed on it in a pressure that hurt she did not speak  she only came back yesterday for the halfterm explained mrs phillips  theres no keeping her away from her books  twas her own wish to be sent to boardingschool  how would you like to go to girton and be a ba like miss allway she asked turning to the child  phillipss entrance saved the need of a reply  to the evident surprise of his wife he was in evening clothes  hulloa  youve got em on she said  he laughed  i shall have to get used to them sooner or later he said  joan felt relievedshe hardly knew whythat he bore the test  it was a wellbuilt athletic frame and he had gone to a good tailor  he looked taller in them and the strong cleanshaven face less rugged  joan sat next to him at the round dinnertable with the child the other side of him  she noticed that he ate as far as possible with his right handhis hands were large but smooth and well shapedhis left remaining under the cloth beneath which the childs right hand when free would likewise disappear  for a while the conversation consisted chiefly of anecdotes by mr airlie  there were few public men and women about whom he did not know something to their disadvantage  joan listening found herself repeating the experience of a night or two previous when during a performance of hamlet niel singleton who was playing the gravedigger had taken her behind the scenes  hamlet the king of denmark and the ghost were sharing a bottle of champagne in the ghosts dressingroom it happened to be the ghosts birthday  on her return to the front of the house her interest in the play was gone  it was absurd that it should be so but the fact remained  mr airlie had lunched the day before with a leonine old gentleman who every sunday morning thundered forth social democracy to enthusiastic multitudes on tower hill  joan had once listened to him and had almost been converted he was so tremendously in earnest  she now learnt that he lived in curzon street mayfair and filled in private life the perfectly legitimate calling of a company promoter in partnership with a dutch jew  his latest prospectus dwelt upon the profits to be derived from an amalgamation of the leading tanning industries by means of which the price of leather could be enormously increased  it was utterly illogical but her interest in the principles of social democracy was gone  a very little while ago mr airlie in his capacity of second cousin to one of the ladies concerned a charming girl but impulsive had been called upon to attend a family council of a painful nature  the gentlemans name took joans breath away it was the name of one of her heroes an eminent writer one might almost say prophet  she had hitherto read his books with grateful reverence  they pictured for her the world made perfect and explained to her just precisely how it was to be accomplished  but as far as his own particular corner of it was concerned he seemed to have made a sad mess of it  human nature of quite an oldfashioned pattern had crept in and spoilt all his own theories  of course it was unreasonable  the signpost may remain embedded in weeds it notwithstanding points the way to the fair city  she told herself this but it left her still shorttempered  she didnt care which way it pointed  she didnt believe there was any fair city  there was a famous preacher  he lived the simple life in a small house in battersea and consecrated all his energies to the service of the poor  almost by his unselfish zeal he had persuaded joan of the usefulness of the church  mr airlie frequently visited him  they interested one another  what struck mr airlie most was the selfsacrificing devotion with which the reverend gentlemans wife and family surrounded him  it was beautiful to see  the calls upon his moderate purse necessitated by his widespread and much paragraphed activities left but a narrow margin for domestic expenses with the result that often the only fire in the house blazed brightly in the study where mr airlie and the reverend gentleman sat talking while mother and children warmed themselves with sense of duty in the cheerless kitchen and often as mr airlie who was of an inquiring turn of mind had convinced himself the only evening meal that resources would permit was the satisfying supper for one brought by the youngest daughter to her father where he sat alone in the small diningroom  mr airlie picking daintily at his food continued his stories of philanthropists who paid starvation wages of feminists who were a holy terror to their women folk of socialists who travelled firstclass and spent their winters in egypt or monaco of stern critics of public morals who preferred the society of youthful affinities to the continued company of elderly wives of poets who wrote divinely about babies feet and whose children hated them  do you think its all true joan whispered to her host  he shrugged his shoulders  no reason why it shouldnt be he said ive generally found him right  ive never been able myself he continued to understand the lords enthusiasm for david  i suppose it was the psalms that did it  joan was about to offer comment but was struck dumb with astonishment on hearing mckeans voice it seemed he could talk  he was telling of an old scotch peasant farmer  a mean cantankerous old cuss whose curious pride it was that he had never given anything away  not a crust nor a sixpence nor a rag and never would  many had been the attempts to make him break his boast some for the joke of the thing and some for the need but none had ever succeeded  it was his one claim to distinction and he guarded it  one evening it struck him that the milkpail standing just inside the window had been tampered with  next day he marked with a scratch the inside of the pan and returning later found the level of the milk had sunk half an inch  so he hid himself and waited and at twilight the next day the window was stealthily pushed open and two small terror haunted eyes peered round the room  they satisfied themselves that no one was about and a tiny hand clutching a cracked jug was thrust swiftly in and dipped into the pan and the window softly closed  he knew the thief the grandchild of an old bedridden dame who lived some miles away on the edge of the moor  the old man stood long watching the small cloaked figure till it was lost in the darkness  it was not till he lay upon his dying bed that he confessed it  but each evening from that day he would steal into the room and see to it himself that the window was left ajar  after the coffee mrs phillips proposed their adjourning to the drawing room the other side of the folding doors which had been left open phillips asked her to leave joan and himself where they were  he wanted to talk to her  he promised not to bore her for more than ten minutes  the others rose and moved away  hilda came and stood before joan with her hands behind her  i am going to bed now she said  i wanted to see you from what papa told me  may i kiss you  it was spoken so gravely that joan did not ask her as in lighter mood she might have done what it was that phillips had said  she raised her face quietly and the child bent forward and kissed her and went out without looking back at either of them leaving joan more serious than there seemed any reason for  phillips filled his pipe and lighted it  i wish i had your pen he said suddenly breaking the silence  im all right at talking but i want to get at the others the men and women who never come thinking it has nothing to do with them  im shy and awkward when i try to write  there seems a barrier in front of me  you break through it  one hears your voice  tell me he said are you getting your way  do they answer you  yes said joan  not any great number of them not yet  but enough to show that i really am interesting them  it grows every week  tell them that he said  let them hear each other  its the same at a meeting  you wait ten minutes sometimes before one man will summon up courage to put a question but once one or two have ventured they spring up all round you  i was wondering he added if you would help me let me use you now and again  it is what i should love she answered  tell me what to do  she was not conscious of the low vibrating tone in which she spoke  i want to talk to them he said about their stomachs  i want them to see the need of concentrating upon the food problem insisting that it shall be solved  the other things can follow  there was an old egyptian chap he said a governor of one of their provinces thousands of years before the pharaohs were ever heard of they dug up his tomb a little while ago  it bore this inscription in my time no man went hungry  id rather have that carved upon my gravestone than the boastings of all the robbers and the butchers of history  think what it must have meant in that land of drought and famine only a narrow strip of river bank where a grain of corn would grow and that only when old nile was kind  if not your nearest supplies five hundred miles away across the desert your only means of transport the slowmoving camel  your convoy must be guarded against attack provided with provisions and water for a two months journey  yet he never failed his people  fat year and lean year in my time no man went hungry  and here today with our steamships and our railways with the granaries of the world filled to overflowing one third of our population lives on the border line of want  in india they die by the roadside  whats the good of it all your science and your art and your religion  how can you help mens souls if their bodies are starving  a hungry mans a hungry beast  i spent a week at grimsby some years ago organizing a fishermans union  they used to throw the fish back into the sea tons upon tons of it that men had risked their lives to catch that would have fed half londons poor  there was a glut of it they said  the market didnt want it  funny isnt it a glut of food and the kiddies cant learn their lessons for want of it  i was talking with a farmer down in kent the plums were rotting on his trees  there were too many of them that was the trouble  the railway carriage alone would cost him more than he could get for them  they were too cheap  so nobody could have them its the muddle of the thing that makes me madthe ghastly muddleheaded way the chief business of the world is managed  theres enough food could be grown in this country to feed all the people and then of the fragments each man might gather his ten basketsful  theres no miracle needed  i went into the matter once with dalroy of the board of agriculture  hes the best man theyve got if theyd only listen to him  its never been organized thats all  it isnt the fault of the individual  it ought not to be left to the individual  the man who makes a corner in wheat in chicago and condemns millions to privationlikely enough hes a decent sort of fellow in himself a kind husband and fatherwould be upset for the day if he saw a child crying for bread  my dogs a decent enough little chap as dogs go but i dont let him run my larder  it could be done with a little good will all round he continued and nine men out of every ten would be the better off  but they wont even let you explain  their newspapers shout you down  its such a damned fine world for the few never mind the many  my father was a farm labourer and all his life he never earned more than thirteen and sixpence a week  i left when i was twelve and went into the mines  there were six of us children and my mother brought us up healthy and decent she fed us and clothed us and sent us to school and when she died we buried her with the money she had put by for the purpose and never a penny of charity had ever soiled her hands  i can see them now  talk of your chancellors of the exchequer and their problems  she worked herself to death of course  well thats all right  one doesnt mind that where one loves  if they would only let you  she had no opposition to contend withno thwarting and hampering at every turnthe very people you are working for hounded on against you  the difficulty of a man like myself who wants to do something who could do something is that for the best part of his life he is fighting to be allowed to do it  by the time ive lived down their lies and got my chance my energy will be gone  he knocked the ashes from his pipe and relit it  ive no quarrel with the rich he said  i dont care how many rich men there are so long as there are no poor  who does  i was riding on a bus the other day and there was a man beside me with a bandaged head hed been hurt in that railway smash at morpeth  he hadnt claimed damages from the railway company and wasnt going to  oh its only a few scratches he said  theyll be hit hard enough as it is  if hed been a poor devil on eighteen shillings a week it would have been different  he was an engineer earning good wages so he wasnt feeling sore and bitter against half the world  suppose you tried to run an army with your men half starved while your officers had more than they could eat  its been tried and whats been the result  see that your soldiers have their proper rations and the general can sit down to his sixcourse dinner if he will  they are not begrudging it to him  a nation works on its stomach  underfeed your rank and file and what sort of a fight are you going to put up against your rivals  i want to see england going ahead  i want to see her workers properly fed  i want to see the corn upon her unused acres the cattle grazing on her wasted pastures  i object to the food being thrown into the sealeft to rot upon the ground while men are hungrysidetracked in chicago while the children grow up stunted  i want the commissariat properly organized  he had been staring through her rather than at her so it had seemed to joan  suddenly their eyes met and he broke into a smile  im so awfully sorry he said  ive been talking to you as if you were a public meeting  im afraid im more used to them than i am to women  please forgive me  the whole man had changed  the eyes had a timid pleading in them  joan laughed  ive been feeling as if i were the king of bavaria she said  how did he feel he asked her leaning forward  he had his own private theatre joan explained where wagner gave his operas  and the king was the sole audience  i should have hated that he said if i had been wagner  he looked at her and a flush passed over his boyish face  all right he said if it had been a queen  joan found herself tracing patterns with her spoon upon the tablecloth but you have won now she said still absorbed apparently with her drawing you are going to get your chance  he gave a short laugh  a trick he said to weaken me  they think to shave my locks show me to the people bound by their red tape  to put it another way a rat among the terriers  joan laughed  you dont somehow suggest the rat she said rather another sort of beast  what do you advise me he asked  i havent decided yet  they were speaking in whispered tones  through the open doors they could see into the other room  mrs phillips under airlies instructions was venturing upon a cigarette  to accept she answered  they wont influence youthe terriers as you call them  you are too strong  it is you who will sway them  it isnt as if you were a mere agitator  take this opportunity of showing them that you can build plan organize that you were meant to be a ruler  you cant succeed without them as things are  youve got to win them over  prove to them that they can trust you  he sat for a minute tattooing with his fingers on the table before speaking  its the frills and flummery part of it that frightens me he said you wouldnt think that sensitiveness was my weak point  but it is ive stood up to a birmingham mob that was waiting to lynch me and enjoyed the experience but id run ten miles rather than face a drawing room of welldressed people with their masked faces and ironic courtesies  it leaves me for days feeling like a lobster that has lost its shell  i wouldnt say it if i didnt mean it answered joan but you havent got to trouble yourself about that    youre quite passable  she smiled  it seemed to her that most women would find him more than passable  he shook his head  with you he said  theres something about you that makes one ashamed of worrying about the little things  but the others the sneering women and the men who wink over their shoulder while they talk to you i shall never be able to get away from them and of course wherever i go  he stopped abruptly with a sudden tightening of the lips  joan followed his eyes  mrs phillips had swallowed the smoke and was giggling and spluttering by turns  the yellow ostrich feather had worked itself loose and was rocking to and fro as if in a fit of laughter of its own  he pushed back his chair and rose  shall we join the others he said  he moved so that he was between her and the other room his back to the open doors  you think i ought to he said  yes she answered firmly as if she were giving a command  but he read pity also in her eyes  well have you two settled the affairs of the kingdom  is it all decided asked airlie  yes he answered laughing  we are going to say to the people eat drink and be wise  he rearranged his wifes feather and smoothed her tumbled hair  she looked up at him and smiled  joan set herself to make mckean talk and after a time succeeded  they had a mutual friend a rawboned youth she had met at cambridge  he was engaged to mckeans sister  his eyes lighted up when he spoke of his sister jenny  the little mother he called her  shes the most beautiful body in all the world he said  though merely seeing her you mightnt know it  he saw her home and went on up the stairs to his own floor  joan stood for a while in front of the glass before undressing but felt less satisfied with herself  she replaced the star in its case and took off the regallooking dress with the golden girdle and laid it carelessly aside  she seemed to be growing smaller  in her white night dress with her hair in two long plaits she looked at herself once more  she seemed to be no one of any importance at all just a long little girl going to bed  with no one to kiss her good night  she blew out the candle and climbed into the big bed feeling very lonesome as she used to when a child  it had not troubled her until to night  suddenly she sat up again  she neednt be back in london before tuesday evening and today was only friday  she would run down home and burst in upon her father  he would be so pleased to see her  she would make him put his arms around her     chapter viii   she reached home in the evening  she thought to find her father in his study  but they told her that now he usually sat alone in the great drawingroom  she opened the door softly  the room was dark save for a flicker of firelight she could see nothing  nor was there any sound  dad she cried are you here  he rose slowly from a highbacked chair beside the fire  it is you he said  he seemed a little dazed  she ran to him and seizing his listless arms put them round her  give me a hug dad she commanded  a real hug  he held her to him for what seemed a long while  there was strength in his arms in spite of the bowed shoulders and white hair  i was afraid you had forgotten how to do it she laughed when at last he released her  do you know you havent hugged me dad since i was five years old  thats nineteen years ago  you do love me dont you  yes he answered  i have always loved you  she would not let him light the gas  i have dinedin the train she explained  let us talk by the firelight  she forced him gently back into his chair and seated herself upon the floor between his knees  what were you thinking of when i came in she asked  you werent asleep were you  no he answered  not that sort of sleep  she could not see his face  but she guessed his meaning  am i very like her she asked  yes he answered  marvellously like her as she used to be except for just one thing  perhaps that will come to you later  i thought for the moment as you stood there by the door      he did not finish the sentence  tell me about her she said  i never knew she had been an actress  he did not ask her how she had learnt it  she gave it up when we were married he said  the people she would have to live among would have looked askance at her if they had known  there seemed no reason why they should  how did it all happen she persisted  was it very beautiful in the beginning  she wished she had not added that last  the words had slipped from her before she knew  very beautiful he answered in the beginning  it was my fault he went on that it was not beautiful all through  i ought to have let her take up her work again as she wished to when she found what giving it up meant to her  the world was narrower then than it is now and i listened to the world  i thought it another voice  its difficult to tell isnt it she said  i wonder how one can  he did not answer and they sat for a time in silence  did you ever see her act asked joan  every evening for about six months he answered  a little flame shot up and showed a smile upon his face  i owe to her all the charity and tenderness i know  she taught it to me in those months  i might have learned more if i had let her go on teaching  it was the only way she knew  joan watched her as gradually she shaped herself out of the shadows the poor thin fretful lady of the ever restless hands with her bursts of jealous passion her long moods of sullen indifference all her music turned to waste  how did she come to fall in love with you asked joan  i dont mean to be uncomplimentary dad  she laughed taking his hand in hers and stroking it  you must have been ridiculously handsome when you were young  and you must always have been strong and brave and clever  i can see such a lot of women falling in love with you  but not the artistic woman  it wasnt so incongruous at the time he answered  my father had sent me out to america to superintend a contract  it was the first time i had ever been away from home though i was nearly thirty and all my pentup youth rushed out of me at once  it was a harumscarum fellow mad with the joy of life that made love to her not the man who went out nor the man who came back  it was at san francisco that i met her  she was touring the western states and i let everything go to the wind and followed her  it seemed to me that heaven had opened up to me  i fought a duel in colorado with a man who had insulted her  the law didnt run there in those days and three of his hired gunmen as they called them held us up that night in the train and gave her the alternative of going back with them and kissing him or seeing me dead at her feet  i didnt give her time to answer nor for them to finish  it seemed a fine death anyhow that  and id have faced hell itself for the chance of fighting for her  though she told me afterwards that if id died shed have gone back with them and killed him  joan did not speak for a time  she could see him gravea little pompous in his sunday black his footsteps creaking down the stoneflagged aisle the silveredged collecting bag held stiffly in his hand  couldnt you have saved a bit daddy she asked of all that wealth of youthjust enough to live on  i might he answered if i had known the value of it  i found a cable waiting for me in new york  my father had been dead a month and i had to return immediately  and so you married her and took her drum away from her said joan  oh the thing god gives to some of us she explained to make a little noise with and set the people marching  the little flame died out  she could feel his body trembling  but you still loved her didnt you dad she asked  i was very little at the time but i can just remember  you seemed so happy together  till her illness came  it was more than love he answered  it was idolatry  god punished me for it  he was a hard god my god  she raised herself putting her hands upon his shoulders so that her face was very close to his  what has become of him dad she said  she spoke in a cold voice as one does of a false friend  i do not know he answered her  i dont seem to care  he must be somewhere she said the living god of love and hope the god that christ believed in  they were his last words too he answered my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  no not his last said joan lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world  love was christs god  he will help us to find him  their arms were about one another  joan felt that a new need had been born in her the need of loving and of being loved  it was good to lay her head upon his breast and know that he was glad of her coming  he asked her questions about herself  but she could see that he was tired so she told him it was too important a matter to start upon so late  she would talk about herself tomorrow  it would be sunday  do you still go to the chapel she asked him a little hesitatingly  yes he answered  one lives by habit  it is the only temple i know he continued after a moment  perhaps god one day will find me there  he rose and lit the gas and a letter on the mantelpiece caught his eye  have you heard from arthur he asked suddenly turning to her  no  not since about a month she answered  why  he will be pleased to find you here waiting for him he said with a smile handing her the letter  he will be here some time tomorrow  arthur allway was her cousin the son of a nonconformist minister  her father had taken him into the works and for the last three years he had been in egypt helping in the laying of a tramway line  he was in love with her at least so they all told her and his letters were certainly somewhat committal  joan replied to themwhen she did not forget to do soin a studiously sisterly vein and always reproved him for unnecessary extravagance whenever he sent her a present  the letter announced his arrival at southampton  he would stop at birmingham where his parents lived for a couple of days and be in liverpool on sunday evening so as to be able to get straight to business on monday morning joan handed back the letter  it contained nothing else  it only came an hour or two ago her father explained  if he wrote to you by the same post you may have left before it arrived  so long as he doesnt think that i came down specially to see him i dont mind said joan  they both laughed  hes a good lad said her father  they kissed good night and joan went up to her own room  she found it just as she had left it  a bunch of roses stood upon the dressingtable her father would never let anyone cut his roses but himself  young allway arrived just as joan and her father had sat down to supper a place had been laid for him  he flushed with pleasure at seeing her but was not surprised  i called at your diggings he said  i had to go through london  they told me you had started  it is good of you  no it isnt said joan  i came down to see dad  i didnt know you were back  she spoke with some asperity and his face fell  how are you she added holding out her hand  youve grown quite good looking  i like your moustache  and he flushed again with pleasure  he had a sweet almost girlish face with delicate skin that the egyptian sun had deepened into ruddiness with soft dreamy eyes and golden hair he looked lithe and agile rather than strong  he was shy at first but once set going talked freely and was interesting  his work had taken him into the desert far from the beaten tracks  he described the life of the people very little different from what it must have been in noahs time  for months he had been the only white man there and had lived among them  what had struck him was how little he had missed all the paraphernalia of civilization once he had got over the first shock  he had learnt their sports and games wrestled and swum and hunted with them  provided one was a little hungry and tired with toil a stew of goats flesh with sweet cakes and fruits washed down with wine out of a sheeps skin made a feast and after there was music and singing and dancing or the travelling storyteller would gather round him his rapt audience  paris had only robbed women of their grace and dignity  he preferred the young girls in their costume of the fourteenth dynasty  progress he thought had tended only to complicate life and render it less enjoyable  all the essentials of happinesslove courtship marriage the home children friendship social intercourse and play were independent of it had always been there for the asking  joan thought his mistake lay in regarding mans happiness as more important to him than his selfdevelopment  it was not what we got out of civilization but what we put into it that was our gain  its luxuries and ostentations were in themselves perhaps bad for us  but the pursuit of them was good  it called forth thought and effort sharpened our wits strengthened our brains  primitive man content with his necessities would never have produced genius  art literature science would have been stillborn  he hesitated before replying glancing at her furtively while crumbling his bread  when he did it was in the tone that one of her younger disciples might have ventured into a discussion with hypatia  but he stuck to his guns  how did she account for david and solomon moses and the prophets  they had sprung from a shepherd race  yet surely there was genius literature  greece owed nothing to progress  she had preceded it  her thinkers her poets her scientists had draws their inspiration from nature not civilization  her art had sprung full grown out of the soil we had never surpassed it  but the greek ideal could not have been the right one or greece would not so utterly have disappeared suggested mr allway  unless you reject the law of the survival of the fittest  he had no qualms about arguing with his uncle  so did archimedes disappear he answered with a smile  the nameless roman soldier remained  that was hardly the survival of the fittest  he thought it the tragedy of the world that rome had conquered greece imposing her lower ideals upon the race  rome should have been the servant of greece the hands directed by the brain  she would have made roads and harbours conducted the traffic reared the market place  she knew of the steam engine employed it for pumping water in the age of the antonines  sooner or later she would have placed it on rails and in ships  rome should have been the policeman keeping the world in order making it a fit habitation  her mistake was in regarding these things as an end in themselves dreaming of nothing beyond  from her we had inherited the fallacy that man was made for the world not the world for man  rome organized only for mans body  greece would have legislated for his soul  they went into the drawingroom  her father asked her to sing and arthur opened the piano for her and lit the candles  she chose some ballads and a song of herricks playing her own accompaniment while arthur turned the leaves  she had a good voice a low contralto  the room was high and dimly lighted  it looked larger than it really was  her father sat in his usual chair beside the fire and listened with halfclosed eyes glancing now and then across at him she was reminded of orchardsons picture  she was feeling sentimental a novel sensation to her  she rather enjoyed it  she finished with one of burnss lyrics and then told arthur that it was now his turn and that she would play for him  he shook his head pleading that he was out of practice  i wish it she said speaking low  and it pleased her that he made no answer but to ask her what he should sing  he had a light tenor voice it was wobbly at first but improved as he went on  they ended with a duet  the next morning she went into town with them  she never seemed to have any time in london and wanted to do some shopping  they joined her again for lunch and afterwards at her fathers suggestion she and arthur went for a walk  they took the tram out of the city and struck into the country  the leaves still lingered brown and red upon the trees  he carried her cloak and opened gates for her and held back brambles while she passed  she had always been indifferent to these small gallantries but today she welcomed them  she wished to feel her power to attract and command  they avoided all subjects on which they could differ even in words  they talked of people and places they had known together  they remembered their common love of animals and told of the comedies and tragedies that had befallen their pets  joans regret was that she had not now even a dog thinking it cruel to keep them in london  she hated the women she met dragging the poor little depressed beasts about at the end of a string savage with them if they dared to stop for a moment to exchange a passing wag of the tail with some other little lonely sufferer  it was as bad as keeping a lark in a cage  she had tried a cat but so often she did not get home till late and that was just the time when the cat wanted to be out so that they seldom met  he suggested a parrot  his experience of them was that they had no regular hours and would willingly sit up all night if encouraged and talk all the time  joans objection to running a parrot was that it stamped you as an old maid and she wasnt that at least not yet  she wondered if she could make an owl really happy  minerva had an owl  he told her how one spring walking across a common after a fire he had found a mother thrush burnt to death upon her nest her charred wings spread out in a vain endeavour to protect her brood  he had buried her there among the blackened thorn and furze and placed a little cross of stones above her  i hope nobody saw me he said with a laugh  but i couldnt bear to leave her there unhonoured  its one of the things that make me less certain than i want to be of a future existence said joan the thought that animals can have no part in it that all their courage and love and faithfulness dies with them and is wasted  are you sure it is he answered  it would be so unreasonable  they had tea at an oldfashioned inn beside a stream  it was a favourite resort in summer time but now they had it to themselves  the wind had played pranks with her hair and he found a mirror and knelt before her holding it  she stood erect looking down at him while seeming to be absorbed in the rearrangement of her hair feeling a little ashamed of herself  she was encouraging him  there was no other word for it  she seemed to have developed a sudden penchant for this sort of thing  it would end in his proposing to her and then she would have to tell him that she cared for him only in a cousinly sort of waywhatever that might meanand that she could never marry him  she dared not ask herself why  she must manoeuvre to put it off as long as possible and meanwhile some opening might occur to enlighten him  she would talk to him about her work and explain to him how she had determined to devote her life to it to the exclusion of all other distractions  if then he chose to go on loving heror if he couldnt help itthat would not be her fault  after all it did him no harm  she could always be gracious and kind to him  it was not as if she had tricked him  he had always loved her  kneeling before her serving her it was evident it made him supremely happy  it would be cruel of her to end it  the landlady entered unexpectedly with the tea but he did not rise till joan turned away nor did he seem disconcerted  neither did the landlady  she was an elderly quieteyed woman and had served more than one generation of young people with their teas  they returned home by train  joan insisted on travelling third class and selected a compartment containing a stout woman and two children arthur had to be at the works  an important contract had got behindhand and they were working overtime  she and her father dined alone  he made her fulfil her promise to talk about herself and she told him all she thought would interest him  she passed lightly over her acquaintanceship with phillips  he would regard it as highly undesirable she told herself and it would trouble him  he was reading her articles in the sunday post as also her letters from clorinda and of the two preferred the latter as being less subversive of law and order  also he did not like seeing her photograph each week displayed across two columns with her name beneath in one inch type  he supposed he was old fashioned  she was getting rather tired of it herself  the editor insisted upon it she explained  it was worth it for the opportunity it gives me  i preach every sunday to a congregation of over a million souls  its better than being a bishop  besides she added the men are just as bad  you see their silly faces everywhere  thats like you women he answered with a smile  you pretend to be superior and then you copy us  she laughed  but the next moment she was serious  no we dont she said not those of us who think  we know we shall never oust man from his place  he will always be the greater  we want to help him thats all  but wasnt that the lords idea he said when he gave eve to adam to be his helpmeet  yes that was all right she answered  he fashioned eve for adam and saw that adam got her  the ideal marriage might have been the ideal solution  if the lord had intended that he should have kept the match making in his own hands not have left it to man  somewhere in athens there must have been the helpmeet god had made for socrates  when they met it was xanthippe that she kissed  a servant brought the coffee and went out again  her father lighted a cigar and handed her the cigarettes  will it shock you dad she asked  rather late in the day for you to worry yourself about that isnt it he answered with a smile  he struck a match and held it for her  joan sat with her elbows on the table and smoked in silence  she was thinking  why had he never brought her up never exacted obedience from her never even tried to influence her  it could not have been mere weakness she stole a sidelong glance at the tired lined face with its steelblue eyes  she had never seen them other than calm but they must have been able to flash  why had he always been so just and kind and patient with her  why had he never scolded her and bullied her and teased her  why had he let her go away leaving him lonely in his empty voiceless house why had he never made any claim upon her  the idea came to her as an inspiration  at least it would ease her conscience  why dont you let arthur live here she said instead of going back to his lodgings  it would be company for you  he did not answer for some time  she had begun to wonder if he had heard  what do you think of him he said without looking at her  oh hes quite a nice lad she answered  it was some while again before he spoke  he will be the last of the allways he said  i should like to think of the name being continued and hes a good business man in spite of his dreaminess  perhaps he would get on better with the men  she seized at the chance of changing the subject  it was a foolish notion she said that of the manchester school that men and women could be treated as mere figures in a sum  to her surprise he agreed with her  the feudal system had a fine idea in it he said if it had been honestly carried out  a master should be the friend the helper of his men  they should be one family  she looked at him a little incredulously remembering the bitter periods of strikes and lockouts  did you ever try dad she asked  oh yes he answered  but i tried the wrong way  the right way might be found he added by the right man and woman  she felt that he was watching her through his halfclosed eyes  there are those cottages he continued just before you come to the bridge they might be repaired and a club house added  the idea is catching on they tell me  garden villages they call them now  it gets the men and women away from the dirty streets and gives the children a chance  she knew the place  a sad group of dilapidated little houses forming three sides of a paved quadrangle with a shattered fountain and withered trees in the centre  ever since she could remember they had stood there empty ghostly with creaking doors and broken windows their gardens overgrown with weeds  are they yours she asked  she had never connected them with the works some half a mile away  though had she been curious she might have learnt that they were known as allways folly  your mothers he answered  i built them the year i came back from america and gave them to her  i thought it would interest her  perhaps it would if i had left her to her own ways  why didnt they want them she asked  they did at first he answered  the timeservers and the hypocrites among them  i made it a condition that they should be teetotallers and chapel goers and everything else that i thought good for them  i thought that i could save their souls by bribing them with cheap rents and share of profits  and then the union came and that of course finished it  so he too had thought to build jerusalem  yes he said  ill sound him about giving up his lodgings  joan lay awake for a long while that night  the moon looked in at the window  it seemed to have got itself entangled in the tops of the tall pines  would it not be her duty to come backmake her father happy to say nothing of the other  he was a dear sweet lovable lad  together they might realize her fathers dream repair the blunders plant gardens where the weeds now grew drive out the old sad ghosts with living voices  it had been a fine thought a kings thought  others had followed profiting by his mistakes  but might it not be carried further than even they had gone shaped into some noble venture that should serve the future  was not her america here  why seek it further  what was this unknown force that against all sense and reason seemed driving her out into the wilderness to preach  might it not be mere vanity mere egoism almost she had convinced herself  and then there flashed remembrance of her mother  she too had laid aside herself had thought that love and duty could teach one to be other than one was  the ego was the all important thing entrusted to us as the talents of silver to the faithful servant to be developed not for our own purposes but for the service of the master  one did no good by suppressing ones nature  in the end it proved too strong  marriage with arthur would be only repeating the mistake  to be worshipped to be served  it would be very pleasant when one was in the mood  but it would not satisfy her  there was something strong and fierce and primitive in her naturesomething that had come down to her through the generations from some harnessgirded ancestresssomething impelling her instinctively to choose the fighter to share with him the joy of battle healing his wounds giving him of her courage exulting with him in the victory  the moon had risen clear of the entangling pines  it rode serene and free  her father came to the station with her in the morning  the train was not in and they walked up and down and talked  suddenly she remembered it had slipped her mind  could i as a child have known an old clergyman she asked him  at least he wouldnt have been old then  i dropped into chelsea church one evening and heard him preach and on the way home i passed him again in the street  it seemed to me that i had seen his face before  but not for many years  i meant to write you about it but forgot  he had to turn aside for a moment to speak to an acquaintance about business  oh its possible he answered on rejoining her  what was his name  i do not know she answered  he was not the regular incumbent  but it was someone that i seemed to know quite wellthat i must have been familiar with  it may have been he answered carelessly though the gulf was wider then than it is now  ill try and think  perhaps it is only your fancy  the train drew in and he found her a corner seat and stood talking by the window about common things  what did he preach about he asked her unexpectedly  she was puzzled for the moment  oh the old clergyman she answered recollecting  oh calvary  all roads lead to calvary he thought  it was rather interesting  she looked back at the end of the platform  he had not moved     chapter ix   a pile of correspondence was awaiting her and standing by the desk she began to open and read it  suddenly she paused conscious that someone had entered the room and turning she saw hilda  she must have left the door ajar for she had heard no sound  the child closed the door noiselessly and came across holding out a letter  papa told me to give you this the moment you came in she said  joan had not yet taken off her things  the child must have been keeping a close watch  save for the signature it contained but one line i have accepted  joan replaced the letter in its envelope and laid it down upon the desk unconsciously a smile played about her lips  the child was watching her  im glad you persuaded him she said  joan felt a flush mount to her face  she had forgotten hilda for the instant  she forced a laugh  oh i only persuaded him to do what he had made up his mind to do she explained  it was all settled  no it wasnt answered the child  most of them were against it  and then there was mama she added in a lower tone  what do you mean asked joan  didnt she wish it  the child raised her eyes  there was a dull anger in them  oh whats the good of pretending she said  hes so great  he could be the prime minister of england if he chose  but then he would have to visit kings and nobles and receive them at his house and mama  she broke off with a passionate gesture of the small thin hands  joan was puzzled what to say  she knew exactly what she ought to say what she would have said to any ordinary child  but to say it to this uncannily knowing little creature did not promise much good  who told you i persuaded him she asked  nobody answered the child  i knew  joan seated herself and drew the child towards her  it isnt as terrible as you think she said  many men who have risen and taken a high place in the world were married to kind good women unable to share their greatness  there was shakespeare you know who married anne hathaway and had a clever daughter  she was just a nice homely body a few years older than himself  and he seems to have been very fond of her and was always running down to stratford to be with her  yes but he didnt bring her up to london answered the child  mama would have wanted to come and papa would have let her and wouldnt have gone to see queen elizabeth unless she had been invited too  joan wished she had not mentioned shakespeare  there had surely been others men who had climbed up and carried their impossible wives with them  but she couldnt think of one just then  we must help her she answered somewhat lamely  shes anxious to learn i know  the child shook her head  she doesnt understand she said  and papa wont tell her  he says it would only hurt her and do no good  the small hands were clenched  i shall hate her if she spoils his life  the atmosphere was becoming tragic  joan felt the need of escaping from it  she sprang up  oh dont be nonsensical she said  your father isnt the only man married to a woman not as clever as himself  he isnt going to let that stop him  and your mothers going to learn to be the wife of a great man and do the best she can  and if they dont like her theyve got to put up with her  i shall talk to the both of them  a wave of motherliness towards the entire phillips family passed over her  it included hilda she caught the child to her and gave her a hug  you go back to school she said and get on as fast as you can so that youll be able to be useful to him  the child flung her arms about her  youre so beautiful and wonderful she said  you can do anything  im so glad you came  joan laughed  it was surprising how easily the problem had been solved she would take mrs phillips in hand at once  at all events she should be wholesome and unobtrusive  it would be a delicate mission but joan felt sure of her own tact  she could see his boyish eyes turned upon her with wonder and gratitude  i was so afraid you would not be back before i went said the child  i ought to have gone this afternoon but papa let me stay till the evening  you will help she added fixing on joan her great grave eyes  joan promised and the child went out  she looked pretty when she smiled  she closed the door behind her noiselessly  it occurred to joan that she would like to talk matters over with greyson  there was clorindas attitude to be decided upon and she was interested to know what view he himself would take  of course he would be on ps side  the evening gazette had always supported the gas and water school of socialism and to include the peoples food was surely only an extension of the principle  she rang him up and miss greyson answered asking her to come round to dinner they would be alone  and she agreed  the greysons lived in a small house squeezed into an angle of the outer circle overlooking regents park  it was charmingly furnished chiefly with old chippendale  the drawingroom made quite a picture  it was homelike and restful with its faded colouring and absence of all show and overcrowding  they sat there after dinner and discussed joans news miss greyson was repairing a piece of old embroidery she had brought back with her from italy and greyson sat smoking with his hands behind his head and his long legs stretched out towards the fire  carleton will want him to make his food policy include tariff reform he said  if he prove pliable and is willing to throw over his free trade principles all well and good  whats carleton got to do with it demanded joan with a note of indignation  he turned his head towards her with an amused raising of the eyebrows carleton owns two london dailies he answered and is in treaty for a third together with a dozen others scattered about the provinces  most politicians find themselves sooner or later convinced by his arguments phillips may prove the exception  it would be rather interesting a fight between them said joan myself i should back phillips  he might win through mused greyson  hes the man to do it if anybody could  but the odds will be against him  i dont see it said joan with decision  im afraid you havent yet grasped the power of the press he answered with a smile  phillips speaks occasionally to five thousand people carleton addresses every day a circle of five million readers  yes but when phillips does speak he speaks to the whole country retorted joan  through the medium of carleton and his like and just so far as they allow his influence to permeate beyond the platform answered greyson  but they report his speeches  they are bound to explained joan  it doesnt read quite the same he answered  phillips goes home under the impression that he has made a great success and has roused the country  he and millions of other readers learn from the next mornings headlines that it was a tame speech that he made  what sounded to him loud cheers have sunk to mild hear hears  that five minutes hurricane of applause during which wildly excited men and women leapt upon the benches and roared themselves hoarse and which he felt had settled the whole question he searches for in vain  a few silly interjections probably prearranged by carletons young lions become renewed interruptions  the report is strictly truthful but the impression produced is that robert phillips has failed to carry even his own people with him  and then follow leaders in fourteen widelycirculated dailies stretching from the clyde to the severn foretelling how mr robert phillips could regain his waning popularity by the simple process of adopting tariff reform or whatever the pet panacea of carleton and co may at the moment happen to be  dont make us out all alike pleaded his sister with a laugh  there are still a few oldfashioned papers that do give their opponents fair play  they are not increasing in numbers he answered and the carleton group is  there is no reason why in another ten years he should not control the entire popular press of the country  hes got the genius and hes got the means  the cleverest thing he has done he continued turning to joan is your sunday post  up till then the working classes had escaped him with the sunday post he has solved the problem  they open their mouths and he gives them their politics wrapped up in pictures and gossipy pars  miss greyson rose and put away her embroidery  but whats his object she said  he must have more money than he can spend and he works like a horse  i could understand it if he had any beliefs  oh we can all persuade ourselves that we are the heavenordained dictator of the human race he answered  love of power is at the bottom of it  why do our rockefellers and our carnegies condemn themselves to the existence of galley slaves ruining their digestions so that they never can enjoy a square meal  it isnt the money its the trouble of their lives how to get rid of that  it is the notoriety the power that they are out for  in carletons case it is to feel himself the power behind the throne to know that he can make and unmake statesmen has the keys of peace and war in his pocket is able to exclaim public opinion  it is i  it can be a respectable ambition suggested joan  it has been responsible for most of mans miseries he answered  every worlds conqueror meant to make it happy after he had finished knocking it about  we are all born with it thanks to the devil  he shifted his position and regarded her with critical eyes  youve got it badly he said  i can see it in the tilt of your chin and the quivering of your nostrils  you beware of it  miss greyson left them  she had to finish an article  they debated clorindas views and agreed that as a practical housekeeper she would welcome attention being given to the question of the nations food the evening gazette would support phillips in principle while reserving to itself the right of criticism when it came to details  whats he like in himself he asked her  youve been seeing something of him havent you  oh a little she answered  hes absolutely sincere and he means business  he wont stop at the bottom of the ladder now hes once got his foot upon it  but hes quite common isnt he he asked again  ive only met him in public  no thats precisely what he isnt answered joan  you feel that he belongs to no class but his own  the class of the abraham lincolns and the dantons  englands a different proposition he mused  society counts for so much with us  i doubt if we should accept even an abraham lincoln unless in some supreme crisis  his wife rather handicaps him too doesnt she  she wasnt born to be the chatelaine of downing street joan admitted but its not an official position  im not so sure that it isnt he laughed  its the dinnertable that rules in england  we settle everything round a dinnertable  she was sitting in front of the fire in a highbacked chair  she never cared to loll and the shaded light from the electric sconces upon the mantelpiece illumined her  if the world were properly stagemanaged thats what you ought to be he said the wife of a prime minister  i can see you giving such an excellent performance  i must talk to mary he added see if we cant get you off on some promising young under secretary  dont give me ideas above my station laughed joan  im a journalist  thats the pity of it he said  youre wasting the most important thing about you your personality  you would do more good in a drawing room influencing the rulers than you will ever do hiding behind a pen it was the drawingroom that made the french revolution  the firelight played about her hair  i suppose every woman dreams of reviving the old french salon she answered  they must have been gloriously interesting  he was leaning forward with clasped hands  why shouldnt she he said  the reason that our drawingrooms have ceased to lead is that our beautiful women are generally frivolous and our clever women unfeminine  what we are waiting for is an english madame roland  joan laughed  perhaps i shall some day she answered  he insisted on seeing her as far as the bus  it was a soft mild night and they walked round the circle to gloucester gate  he thought there would be more room in the buses at that point  i wish you would come oftener he said  mary has taken such a liking to you  if you care to meet people we can always whip up somebody of interest  she promised that she would  she always felt curiously at home with the greysons  they were passing the long sweep of chester terrace  i like this neighbourhood with its early victorian atmosphere she said  it always makes me feel quiet and good  i dont know why  i like the houses too he said  theres a character about them  you dont often find such fine drawingrooms in london  dont forget your promise he reminded her when they parted  i shall tell mary she may write to you  she met carleton by chance a day or two later as she was entering the office  i want to see you he said and took her up with him into his room  we must stir the people up about this food business he said plunging at once into his subject  phillips is quite right  it overshadows everything  we must make the country selfsupporting  it can be done and must  if a war were to be sprung upon us we could be starved out in a month  our navy in face of these new submarines is no longer able to secure us  france is working day and night upon them  it may be a bogey or it may not  if it isnt she would have us at her mercy and its too big a risk to run  you live in the same house with him dont you  do you often see him  not often she answered  he was reading a letter  you were dining there on friday night werent you he asked her without looking up  joan flushed  what did he mean by crossexamining her in this way  she was not at all used to impertinence from the opposite sex  your information is quite correct she answered  her anger betrayed itself in her tone and he shot a swift glance at her  i didnt mean to offend you he said  a mutual friend a mr airlie happened to be of the party and he mentioned you  he threw aside the letter  ill tell you what i want you to do he said  its nothing to object to  tell him that youve seen me and had a talk  i understand his scheme to be that the country should grow more and more food until it eventually becomes selfsupporting and that the government should control the distribution  tell him that with that im heart and soul in sympathy and would like to help him  he pushed aside a pile of papers and leaning across the desk spoke with studied deliberation  if he can see his way to making his policy dependent upon protection we can work together  and if he cant suggested joan  he fixed his large colourless eyes upon her  thats where you can help him he answered  if he and i combine forces we can pull this through in spite of the furious opposition that it is going to arouse  without a good press he is helpless and where is he going to get his press backing if he turns me down  from half a dozen socialist papers whose support will do him more harm than good  if he will bring the working class over to protection i will undertake that the tariff reformers and the agricultural interest shall accept his socialism  it will be a victory for both of us  if he gain his end what do the means matter he continued as joan did not answer  food may be dearer the unions can square that by putting up wages while the poor devil of a farm labourer will at last get fair treatment  we can easily insist upon that  what do you think yourself  about protection she answered  its one of the few subjects i havent made up my mind about  he laughed  you will find all your pet reforms depend upon it when you come to work them out he said  you cant have a minimum wage without a minimum price  they had risen  ill give him your message said joan  but i dont see him exchanging his principles even for your support  i admit its important  talk it over with him he said  and bear this in mind for your own guidance  he took a step forward which brought his face quite close to hers if he fails and all his lifes work goes for nothing i shall be sorry but i shant break my heart  he will  joan dropped a note into phillipss letterbox on her return home saying briefly that she wished to see him and he sent up answer asking her if she would come to the gallery that evening and meet him after his speech which would be immediately following the dinner hour  it was the first time he had risen since his appointment and he was received with general cheers  he stood out curiously youthful against the background of greyhaired and baldheaded men behind him and there was youth also in his clear ringing voice that not even the vaultlike atmosphere of that shadowless chamber could altogether rob of its vitality  he spoke simply and goodhumouredly without any attempt at rhetoric relying chiefly upon a crescendo of telling facts that gradually as he proceeded roused the house to that tense stillness that comes to it when it begins to think  a distinctly dangerous man joan overheard a little old lady behind her comment to a friend  if i didnt hate him i should like him  he met her in the corridor and they walked up and down and talked too absorbed to be aware of the curious eyes that were turned upon them  joan gave him carletons message  it was clever of him to make use of you he said  if hed sent it through anybody else id have published it  you dont think it even worth considering suggested joan  protection he flashed out scornfully  yes ive heard of that  ive listened as a boy while the old men told of it to one another in thin piping voices round the fireside how the labourers were flung eightand sixpence a week to die on and the men starved in the towns while the farmers kept their hunters and got drunk each night on fine old crusted port  do you know what their toast was in the big hotels on market day with the windows open to the street to a long war and a bloody one  it would be their toast tomorrow if they had their way  does he think i am going to be a party to the putting of the peoples neck again under their pitiless yoke  but the people are more powerful now argued joan  if the farmer demanded higher prices they could demand higher wages  they would never overtake the farmer he answered with a laugh  and the last word would always be with him  i am out to get rid of the landlords he continued not to establish them as the permanent rulers of the country as they are in germany  the people are more powerfuljust a little because they are no longer dependent on the land  they can say to the farmer all right my son if thats your figure im going to the shop next doorto south america to canada to russia  it isnt a satisfactory solution  i want to see england happy and healthy before i bother about the argentine  it drives our men into the slums when they might be living fine lives in gods fresh air  in the case of war it might be disastrous  there i agree with him  we must be able to shut our door without fear of having to open it ourselves to ask for bread  how would protection accomplish that  did he tell you  dont eat me laughed joan  i havent been sent to you as a missionary  im only a humble messenger  i suppose the argument is that good profits assured to him the farmer would bustle up and produce more  can you see him bustling up he answered with a laugh organizing himself into a body and working the thing out from the point of view of the public weal  ill tell you what ninetenths of him would do grow just as much or little as suited his own purposes and then go to sleep and protection would be his security against ever being awakened  im afraid you dont like him joan commented  he will be all right in his proper place he answered as the servant of the public told what to do and turned out of his job if he doesnt do it  my scheme does depend upon protection  you can tell him that but this time its going to be protection for the people  they were at the far end of the corridor and the few others still promenading were some distance away  she had not delivered the whole of her message  she crossed to a seat and he followed her  she spoke with her face turned away from him  you have got to consider the cost of refusal she said  his offer wasnt help or neutrality it was help or opposition by every means in his power  he left me in no kind of doubt as to that  hes not used to being challenged and he wont be squeamish  you will have the whole of his press against you and every other journalistic and political influence that he possesses  hes getting a hold upon the working classes  the sunday post has an enormous sale in the manufacturing towns and hes talking of starting another  are you strong enough to fight him  she very much wanted to look at him but she would not  it seemed to her quite a time before he replied  yes he answered im strong enough to fight him  shall rather enjoy doing it  and its time that somebody did  whether im strong enough to win has got to be seen  she turned and looked at him then  she wondered why she had ever thought him ugly  you can face it she said the possibility of all your lifes work being wasted  it wont be wasted he answered  the land is there  ive seen it from afar and its a good land a land where no man shall go hungry  if not i another shall lead the people into it  i shall have prepared the way  she liked him for that touch of exaggeration  she was so tired of the men who make out all things little including themselves and their own work  after all was it exaggeration  might he not have been chosen to lead the people out of bondage to a land where there should be no more fear  youre not angry with me he asked  i havent been rude have i  abominably rude she answered youve defied my warnings and treated my embassy with contempt  she turned to him and their eyes met  i should have despised you if you hadnt she added  there was a note of exultation in her voice and as if in answer something leapt into his eyes that seemed to claim her  perhaps it was well that just then the bell rang for a division and the moment passed  he rose and held out his hand  we will fight him he said  and you can tell him this if he asks that im going straight for him parliament may as well close down if a few men between them are to be allowed to own the entire press of the country and stifle every voice that does not shout their bidding  we havent dethroned kings to put up a newspaper boss  he shall have all the fighting he wants  they met more often from that day for joan was frankly using her two columns in the sunday post to propagate his aims  carleton to her surprise made no objection  nor did he seek to learn the result of his ultimatum  it looked they thought as if he had assumed acceptance and was willing for phillips to choose his own occasion  meanwhile replies to her articles reached joan in weekly increasing numbers  there seemed to be a wind arising blowing towards protection  farm labourers especially appeared to be enthusiastic for its coming  from their ill spelt smeared epistles one gathered that after years of doubt and hesitation they hadhowever reluctantlyarrived at the conclusion that without it there could be no hope for them  factory workers miners engineersmore fluent less apologeticwrote as strong supporters of phillipss scheme but saw clearly how upon protection its success depended  shopmen clerksonly occasionally ungrammaticalfelt sure that robert phillips the tried friend of the poor would insist upon the boon of protection being no longer held back from the people  wives and mothers claimed it as their childrens birthright  similar views got themselves at the same time into the correspondence columns of carletons other numerous papers  evidently democracy had been throbbing with a passion for protection hitherto unknown even to itself  he means it kindly laughed phillips  he is offering me an excuse to surrender gracefully  we must have a public meeting or two after christmas and clear the ground  they had got into the habit of speaking in the plural  mrs phillipss conversion joan found more difficult than she had anticipated  she had persuaded phillips to take a small house and let her furnish it upon the hire system  joan went with her to the widely advertised emporium in the city road meaning to advise her  but in the end she gave it up out of sheer pity  nor would her advice have served much purpose confronted by the rich and varied choice provided for his patrons by mr krebs the furnisher for connoisseurs  weve never had a home exactly explained mrs phillips during their journey in the tram  its always been lodgings up to now  nice enough some of them but you know what i mean everybody elses taste but your own  ive always fancied a little house with ones own things in it  you know things that you can get fond of  oh the things she was going to get fond of  the things that her poor round foolish eyes gloated upon the moment that she saw them  joan tried to enlist the shopman on her side descending even to flirtation unfortunately he was a young man with a high sense of duty convinced that his employers interests lay in his support of mrs phillips  the sight of the furniture that between them they selected for the dining room gave joan a quite distinct internal pain  they ascended to the floor above devoted to the exhibition of recherche drawingroom suites  mrs phillipss eye instinctively fastened with passionate desire upon the most atrocious  joan grew vehement  it was impossible  i always was a one for cheerful colours explained mrs phillips  even the shopman wavered  joan pressed her advantage directed mrs phillipss attention to something a little less awful  mrs phillips yielded  of course you know best dear she admitted  perhaps i am a bit too fond of bright things  the victory was won  mrs phillips had turned away  the shopman was altering the order  joan moved towards the door and accidentally caught sight of mrs phillipss face  the flabby mouth was trembling  a tear was running down the painted cheek  joan slipped her hand through the others arm  im not so sure youre not right after all she said fixing a critical eye upon the rival suites  it is a bit mousey that other  the order was once more corrected  joan had the consolation of witnessing the childish delight that came again into the foolish face but felt angry with herself at her own weakness  it was the womans feebleness that irritated her  if only she had shown a spark of fight joan could have been firm  poor feckless creature what could have ever been her attraction for phillips  she followed inwardly fuming while mrs phillips continued to pile monstrosity upon monstrosity  what would phillips think  and what would hildas eyes say when they looked upon that recherche drawingroom suite  hilda who would have had no sentimental compunctions  the woman would be sure to tell them both that she joan had accompanied her and helped in the choosing  the whole ghastly house would be exhibited to every visitor as the result of their joint taste  she could hear mr airlies purring voice congratulating her  she ought to have insisted on their going to a decent shop  the mere advertisement ought to have forewarned her  it was the posters that had captured mrs phillips those dazzling apartments where bejewelled society reposed upon the highclass but inexpensive designs of mr krebs  artists ought to have more selfrespect than to sell their talents for such purposes  the contract was concluded in mr krebs private office a very stout gentleman with a very thin voice whose dream had always been to one day be of service to the renowned mr robert phillips  he was clearly under the impression that he had now accomplished it  even as mrs phillips took up the pen to sign the wild idea occurred to joan of snatching the paper away from her hustling her into a cab and in some quiet street or square making the woman see for herself that she was a useless fool that the glowing dreams and fancies she had cherished in her silly head for fifteen years must all be given up that she must stand aside knowing herself of no account  it could be done  she felt it  if only one could summon up the needful brutality  if only one could stifle that still small voice of pity  mrs phillips signed amid splutterings and blots  joan added her signature as witness  she did effect an improvement in the poor ladys dress  on madges advice she took her to a voluble little woman in the earls court road who was struck at once by madame phillipss remarkable resemblance to the baroness von stein  had not joan noticed it  whatever suited the baroness von steinallowed by common consent to be one of the bestdressed women in londonwas bound to show up madame phillips to equal advantage  by curious coincidence a costume for the baroness had been put in hand only the day before  it was sent for and pinned upon the delighted madame phillips  perfection  as the baroness herself would always say my frock must be a framework for my personality  it must never obtrude  the supremely welldressed woman  one never notices what she has on that is the test  it seemed it was what mrs phillips had always felt herself  joan could have kissed the voluble emphatic little woman  but the dyed hair and the paint put up a fight for themselves  i want you to do something very brave said joan  she had invited herself to tea with mrs phillips and they were alone in the small white panelled room that they were soon to say goodbye to  the new house would be ready at christmas  it will be a little hard at first continued joan but afterwards you will be glad that you have done it it is a duty you owe to your position as the wife of a great leader of the people  the firelight showed to joan a comically frightened face with round staring eyes and an open mouth  what is it you want me to do she faltered  i want you to be just yourself said joan a kind good woman of the people who will win their respect and set them an example  she moved across and seating herself on the arm of mrs phillipss chair touched lightly with her hand the flaxen hair and the rouged cheek  i want you to get rid of all this she whispered  it isnt worthy of you  leave it to the silly dolls and the bad women  there was a long silence  joan felt the tears trickling between her fingers  you havent seen me came at last in a thin broken voice  joan bent down and kissed her  lets try it she whispered  a little choking sound was the only answer  but the woman rose and joan following they stole upstairs into the bedroom and mrs phillips turned the key  it took a long time and joan seated on the bed remembered a night when she had taken a trapped mouse if only he had been a quiet mouse into the bathroom and had waited while it drowned  it was finished at last and mrs phillips stood revealed with her hair down showing streaks of dingy brown  joan tried to enthuse but the words came haltingly  she suggested to joan a candle that some wind had suddenly blown out  the paint and powder had been obvious but at least it had given her the mask of youth she looked old and withered  the life seemed to have gone out of her  you see dear i began when i was young she explained and he has always seen me the same  i dont think i could live like this  the painted doll that the child fancied the paint washed off and the golden hair all turned to drab  could one be sure of getting used to it of liking it better  and the poor bewildered doll itself  how could one expect to make of it a statue the woman of the people  one could only bruise it  it ended in joans promising to introduce her to discreet theatrical friends who would tell her of cosmetics less injurious to the skin and advise her generally in the ancient and proper art of making up  it was not the end she had looked for  joan sighed as she closed her door behind her  what was the meaning of it  on the one hand that unimpeachable law the greatest happiness of the greatest number the sacred cause of democracy the moral uplift of the people sanity wisdom truth the higher justice all the forces on which she was relying for the regeneration of the worldall arrayed in stern demand that the flabby useless mrs phillips should be sacrificed for the general good  only one voice had pleaded for foolish helpless mrs phillipsand had conquered  the still small voice of pity     chapter x   arthur sprang himself upon her a little before christmas  he was full of a great project  it was that she and her father should spend christmas with his people at birmingham  her father thought he would like to see his brother they had not often met of late and birmingham would be nearer for her than liverpool  joan had no intention of being lured into the birmingham parlour  she thought she could see in it a scheme for her gradual entanglement besides she was highly displeased  she had intended asking her father to come to brighton with her  as a matter of fact she had forgotten all about christmas and the idea only came into her head while explaining to arthur how his impulsiveness had interfered with it  arthur crestfallen suggested telegrams  it would be quite easy to alter everything and of course her father would rather be with her wherever it was  but it seemed it was too late  she ought to have been consulted  a sudden sense of proprietorship in her father came to her assistance and added pathos to her indignation  of course now she would have to spend christmas alone  she was far too busy to think of birmingham  she could have managed brighton  argument founded on the length of journey to birmingham as compared with the journey to brighton she refused to be drawn into  her feelings had been too deeply wounded to permit of descent into detail  but the sinner confessing his fault is entitled to forgiveness and having put him back into his proper place she let him kiss her hand  she even went further and let him ask her out to dinner  as the result of her failure to reform mrs phillips she was feeling dissatisfied with herself  it was an unpleasant sensation and somewhat new to her experience  an evening spent in arthurs company might do her good  the experiment proved successful  he really was quite a dear boy  eyeing him thoughtfully through the smoke of her cigarette it occurred to her how like he was to guidos painting of st sebastian those soft dreamy eyes and that beautiful almost feminine face  there always had been a suspicion of the saint about him even as a boy nothing one could lay hold of just that odd suggestion of a shadow intervening between him and the world  it seemed a favourable opportunity to inform him of that fixed determination of hers neverin all probabilityto marry but to devote her life to her work  she was feeling very kindly towards him and was able to soften her decision with touches of gentle regret  he did not appear in the least upset  but thought that her duty might demand later on that she should change her mind that was if fate should offer her some noble marriage giving her wider opportunity  she was a little piqued at his unexpected attitude of aloofness  what did he mean by a noble marriageto a duke or something of that sort  he did not think the candidature need be confined to dukes though he had no objection to a worthy duke  he meant any really great man who would help her and whom she could help  she promised somewhat shortly to consider the matter whenever the duke or other class of nobleman should propose to her  at present no sign of him had appeared above the horizon  her own idea was that if she lived long enough she would become a spinster  unless someone took pity on her when she was old and decrepit and past her work  there was a little humorous smile about his mouth  but his eyes were serious and pleading  when shall i know that you are old and decrepit he asked  she was not quite sure  she thought it would be when her hair was greyor rather white  she had been informed by experts that her peculiar shade of hair went white not grey  i shall ask you to marry me when your hair is white he said  may i  it did not suggest any overwhelming impatience  yes she answered  in case you havent married yourself and forgotten all about me  i shall keep you to your promise he said quite gravely  she felt the time had come to speak seriously  i want you to marry she said and be happy  i shall be troubled if you dont  he was looking at her with those shy worshipping eyes of his that always made her marvel at her own wonderfulness  it need not do that he answered  it would be beautiful to be with you always so that i might serve you  but i am quite happy loving you let me see you now and then touch you and hear your voice  behind her drawndown lids she offered up a little prayer that she might always be worthy of his homage  she didnt know it would make no difference to him  she walked with him to euston and saw him into the train  he had given up his lodgings and was living with her father at the pines  they were busy on a plan for securing the cooperation of the workmen and she promised to run down and hear all about it  she would not change her mind about birmingham but sent everyone her love  she wished she had gone when it came to christmas day  this feeling of loneliness was growing upon her  the phillips had gone up north and the greysons to some relations of theirs swell country people in hampshire flossie was on a sea voyage with sam and his mother and even madge had been struck homesick  it happened to be a sunday too of all days in the week and london in a drizzling rain was just about the limit  she worked till late in the afternoon but sitting down to her solitary cup of tea she felt she wanted to howl  from the basement came faint sounds of laughter  her landlord and lady were entertaining guests  if they had not been she would have found some excuse for running down and talking to them if only for a few minutes  suddenly the vision of old chelsea church rose up before her with its little motherly old pewopener  she had so often been meaning to go and see her again but something had always interfered  she hunted through her drawers and found a comparatively sobercoloured shawl and tucked it under her cloak  the service was just commencing when she reached the church  mary stopperton showed her into a seat and evidently remembered her  i want to see you afterwards she whispered and mary stopperton had smiled and nodded  the service with its need for being continually upon the move bored her she was not in the mood for it  and the sermon preached by a young curate who had not yet got over his oxford drawl was uninteresting  she had half hoped that the wheezy old clergyman who had preached about calvary on the evening she had first visited the church would be there again  she wondered what had become of him and if it were really a fact that she had known him when she was a child or only her fancy  it was strange how vividly her memory of him seemed to pervade the little church  she had the feeling he was watching her from the shadows  she waited for mary in the vestibule and gave her the shawl making her swear on the big key of the church door that she would wear it herself and not give it away  the little old pewopeners pink and white face flushed with delight as she took it and the thin workworn hands fingered it admiringly  but i may lend it she pleaded  they turned up church street  joan confided to mary what a rotten christmas she had had all by herself without a soul to speak to except her landlady who had brought her meals and had been in such haste to get away  i dont know what made me think of you she said  im so glad i did she gave the little old lady a hug  mary laughed  where are you going now dearie she asked  oh i dont mind so much now answered joan  now that ive seen a friendly face i shall go home and go to bed early  they walked a little way in silence  mary slipped her hand into joans you wouldnt care to come home and have a bit of supper with me would you dearie she asked  oh may i answered joan  marys hand gave joans a little squeeze  you wont mind if anybody drops in she said  they do sometimes of a sunday evening  you dont mean a party asked joan  no dear answered mary  its only one or two who have nowhere else to go  joan laughed  she thought she would be a fit candidate  you see it makes company for me explained mary  mary lived in a tiny house behind a strip of garden  it stood in a narrow side street between two publichouses and was covered with ivy it had two windows above and a window and a door below  the upstairs rooms belonged to the churchwardens and were used as a storehouse for old parish registers deemed of little value  mary stopperton and her bedridden husband lived in the two rooms below  mary unlocked the door and joan passed in and waited  mary lit a candle that was standing on a bracket and turned to lead the way  shall i shut the door suggested joan  mary blushed like a child that has been found out just as it was hoping that it had not been noticed  it doesnt matter dearie she explained  they know if they find it open that im in  the little room looked very cosy when mary had made up the fire and lighted the lamp  she seated joan in the worn horsehair easychair out of which one had to be careful one did not slip on to the floor and spread her handsome shawl over the back of the dilapidated sofa  you wont mind my running away for a minute she said  i shall only be in the next room  through the thin partition joan heard a constant shrill complaining voice  at times it rose into an angry growl  mary looked in at the door  im just running round to the doctors she whispered  his medicine hasnt come  i shant be long  joan offered to go in and sit with the invalid  but mary feared the exertion of talking might be too much for him  he gets so excited she explained  she slipped out noiselessly  it seemed in spite of its open door a very silent little house behind its strip of garden  joan had the feeling that it was listening  suddenly she heard a light step in the passage and the room door opened a girl entered  she was wearing a large black hat and a black boa round her neck  between them her face shone unnaturally white  she carried a small cloth bag  she started on seeing joan and seemed about to retreat  oh please dont go cried joan  mrs stopperton has just gone round to the doctors  she wont be long  im a friend of hers  the girl took stock of her and apparently reassured closed the door behind her  whats he like tonight she asked with a jerk of her head in the direction of the next room  she placed her bag carefully upon the sofa and examined the new shawl as she did so  well i gather hes a little fretful answered joan with a smile  thats a bad sign said the girl  means hes feeling better  she seated herself on the sofa and fingered the shawl  did you give it her she asked  yes admitted joan  i rather fancied her in it  shell only pawn it said the girl to buy him grapes and port wine  i felt a bit afraid of her laughed joan so i made her promise not to part with it  is he really very ill her husband  oh yes theres no makebelieve this time answered the girl  a bad thing for her if he wasnt  oh its only whats known all over the neighbourhood continued the girl  shes had a pretty rough time with him  twice ive found her getting ready to go to sleep for the night by sitting on the bare floor with her back against the wall  had sold every stick in the place and gone off  but shed always some excuse for him  it was sure to be half her fault and the other half he couldnt help  now shes got her reward according to her own account  heard he was dying in a dosshouse and must fetch him home and nurse him back to life  seems hes getting fonder of her every day  now that he cant do anything else  it doesnt seem to depress her spirits mused joan  oh she  shes all right agreed the girl  having the time of her life someone to look after for twentyfour hours a day that cant help themselves  she examined joan awhile in silence  are you on the stage she asked  no answered joan  but my mother was  are you  thought you looked a bit like it said the girl  im in the chorus its better than being in service or in a shop thats all you can say for it  but youll get out of that suggested joan  youve got the actress face  the girl flushed with pleasure  it was a striking face with intelligent eyes and a mobile sensitive mouth  oh yes she said i could act all right  i feel it  but you dont get out of the chorus  except at a price  joan looked at her  i thought that sort of thing was dying out she said  the girl shrugged her shoulders  not in my shop she answered anyhow it was the only chance i ever had  wish sometimes id taken it it was quite a good part  they must have felt sure you could act said joan  next time it will be a clean offer  the girl shook her head  theres no next time she said once youre put down as one of the standoffs  plenty of others to take your place  oh i dont blame them she added  it isnt a thing to be dismissed with a toss of your head  i thought it all out  dont know now what decided me  something inside me i suppose  joan found herself poking the fire  have you known mary stopperton long she asked  oh yes answered the girl  ever since ive been on my own  did you talk it over with her asked joan  no answered the girl  i may have just told her  she isnt the sort that gives advice  im glad you didnt do it said joan that you put up a fight for all women  the girl gave a short laugh  afraid i wasnt thinking much about that she said  no said joan  but perhaps thats the way the best fights are foughtwithout thinking  mary peeped round the door  she had been lucky enough to find the doctor in  she disappeared again and they talked about themselves  the girl was a miss ensor  she lived by herself in a room in lawrence street  im not good at getting on with people she explained  mary joined them and went straight to miss ensors bag and opened it she shook her head at the contents which consisted of a small flabby looking meat pie in a tin dish and two pale flat mince tarts  it doesnt nourish you dearie complained mary  you could have bought yourself a nice bit of meat with the same money  and you would have had all the trouble of cooking it answered the girl  that only wants warming up  but i like cooking you know dearie grumbled mary  theres no interest in warming things up  the girl laughed  you dont have to go far for your fun she said ill bring a sole next time and you shall do it au gratin  mary put the indigestiblelooking pasties into the oven and almost banged the door  miss ensor proceeded to lay the table  how many do you think she asked  mary was doubtful  she hoped that it being christmas day they would have somewhere better to go  i passed old bubble and squeak just now spouting away to three men and a dog outside the worlds end  i expect hell turn up thought miss ensor  she laid for four leaving space for more if need be  i call it the cadgers arms she explained turning to joan  we bring our own victuals and mary cooks them for us and waits on us and the more of us the merrier  you look forward to your sunday evening parties dont you she asked of mary  mary laughed  she was busy in a corner with basins and a saucepan  of course i do dearie she answered  ive always been fond of company  there came another opening of the door  a little hairy man entered  he wore spectacles and was dressed in black  he carried a paper parcel which he laid upon the table  he looked a little doubtful at joan  mary introduced them  his name was julius simson  he shook hands as if under protest  as friends of mary stopperton he said we meet on neutral ground  but in all matters of moment i expect we are as far asunder as the poles  i stand for the people  we ought to be comrades answered joan with a smile  i too am trying to help the people  you and your class said mr simson are friends enough to the people so long as they remember that they are the people and keep their proper placeat the bottom  i am for putting the people at the top  then they will be the upper classes suggested joan  and i may still have to go on fighting for the rights of the lower orders  in this world explained mr simson someone has got to be master  the only question is who  mary had unwrapped the paper parcel  it contained half a sheeps head how would you like it done she whispered  mr simson considered  there came a softer look into his eyes  how did you do it last time he asked  it came up brown i remember with thick gravy  braised suggested mary  thats the word agreed mr simson  braised  he watched while mary took things needful from the cupboard and commenced to peel an onion  thats the sort that makes me despair of the people said mr simson joan could not be sure whether he was addressing her individually or imaginary thousands  likes working for nothing  thinks she was born to be everybodys servant  he seated himself beside miss ensor on the antiquated sofa  it gave a complaining groan but held out  did you have a good house the girl asked him  saw you from the distance waving your arms about  hadnt time to stop  not many admitted mr simson  a christmassy lot  you know  sort of crowd that interrupts you and tries to be funny  dead to their own interests  its slow work  why do you do it asked miss ensor  damned if i know answered mr simson with a burst of candour  cant help it i suppose  lost me job again  the old story suggested miss ensor  the old story sighed mr simson  one of the customers happened to be passing last wednesday when i was speaking on the embankment  heard my opinion of the middle classes  well you cant expect em to like it can you submitted miss ensor  no admitted mr simson with generosity  its only natural  its a fight to the finish between me and the bourgeois  i cover them with ridicule and contempt and they hit back at me in the only way they know  take care they dont get the best of you miss ensor advised him  oh im not afraid he answered  ill get another place all right give me time  the only thing im worried about is my young woman  doesnt agree with you inquired miss ensor  oh it isnt that he answered  but shes frightened  you know  says life with me is going to be a bit too uncertain for her  perhaps shes right  oh why dont you chuck it advised miss ensor give the bourgeois a rest  mr simson shook his head  somebodys got to tackle them he said tell them the truth about themselves to their faces  yes but it neednt be you suggested miss ensor  mary was leaning over the table  miss ensors fourpenny veal and ham pie was ready  mary arranged it in front of her  eat it while its hot dearie she counselled  it wont be so indigestible  miss ensor turned to her  oh you talk to him she urged  here hes lost his job again and is losing his girl all because of his silly politics  tell him hes got to have sense and stop it  mary seemed troubled  evidently as miss ensor had stated advice was not her line  perhaps hes got to do it dearie she suggested  what do you mean by got to do it exclaimed miss ensor  whos making him do it except himself  mary flushed  she seemed to want to get back to her cooking  its something inside us dearie she thought that nobody hears but ourselves  that tells him to talk all that twaddle demanded miss ensor  have you heard him  no dearie mary admitted  but i expect its got its purpose  or he wouldnt have to do it  miss ensor gave a gesture of despair and applied herself to her pie  the hirsute face of mr simson had lost the foolish aggressiveness that had irritated joan  he seemed to be pondering matters  mary hoped that joan was hungry  joan laughed and admitted that she was its the smell of all the nice things she explained  mary promised it should soon be ready and went back to her corner  a short dark thickset man entered and stood looking round the room the frame must once have been powerful but now it was shrunken and emaciated  the shabby threadbare clothes hung loosely from the stooping shoulders  only the head seemed to have retained its vigour  the face from which the long black hair was brushed straight back was ghastly white  out of it deep set beneath great shaggy overhanging brows blazed the fierce restless eyes of a fanatic  the huge thinlipped mouth seemed to have petrified itself into a savage snarl  he gave joan the idea as he stood there glaring round him of a hunted beast at bay  miss ensor whose bump of reverence was undeveloped greeted him cheerfully as boanerges  mr simson more respectful rose and offered his small grimy hand  mary took his hat and cloak away from him and closed the door behind him  she felt his hands and put him into a chair close to the fire  and then she introduced him to joan  joan started on hearing his name  it was one well known  the cyril baptiste she asked  she had often wondered what he might be like  the cyril baptiste he answered in a low even passionate voice that he flung at her almost like a blow  the atheist the gaol bird the pariah the blasphemer the antichrist  ive hoofs instead of feet shall i take off my boots and show them to you  i tuck my tail inside my coat  you cant see my horns  ive cut them off close to my head thats why i wear my hair long to hide the stumps  mary had been searching in the pockets of his cloak  she had found a paper bag  you mustnt get excited she said laying her little work worn hand upon his shoulder or youll bring on the bleeding  aye he answered i must be careful i dont die on christmas day  it would make a fine text that for their sermons  he lapsed into silence his almost transparent hands stretched out towards the fire  mr simson fidgeted  the quiet of the room broken only by marys ministering activities evidently oppressed him  paper going well sir he asked  i often read it myself  it still sells answered the proprietor and editor and publisher and entire staff of the rationalist  i like the articles you are writing on the history of superstition quite illuminating remarked mr simson  its many a year i am afraid to the final chapter thought their author  they afford much food for reflection thought mr simson though i cannot myself go as far as you do in including christianity under that heading  mary frowned at him but mr simson eager for argument or not noticing blundered on  whether we accept the miraculous explanation of christs birth continued mr simson in his best streetcorner voice or whether with the great french writer whose name for the moment escapes me we regard him merely as a man inspired we must i think admit that his teaching has been of help especially to the poor  the fanatic turned upon him so fiercely that mr simsons arm involuntarily assumed the posture of defence  to the poor the old man almost shrieked  to the poor that he has robbed of all power of resistance to oppression by his vile submissive creed that he has drugged into passive acceptance of every evil done to them by his false promises that their sufferings here shall win for them some wonderful reward when they are dead  what has been his teaching to the poor  bow your backs to the lash kiss the rod that scars your flesh  be ye humble oh my people  be ye poor in spirit  let wrong rule triumphant through the world  raise no hand against it lest ye suffer my eternal punishments  learn from me to be meek and lowly  learn to be good slaves and give no trouble to your taskmasters  let them turn the world into a hell for you  the gravethe grave shall be your gate to happiness  helpful to the poor  helpful to their rulers to their owners  they take good care that christ shall be well taught  their fat priests shall bear his message to the poor  the rod may be broken the prison door be forced  it is christ that shall bind the people in eternal fetters christ the lackey the jackal of the rich  mr simson was visibly shocked  evidently he was less familiar with the opinions of the rationalist than he had thought  i really must protest exclaimed mr simson  to whatever wrong uses his words may have been twisted christ himself i regard as divine and entitled to be spoken of with reverence  his whole life his sufferings  but the old fanatics vigour had not yet exhausted itself  his sufferings he interrupted  does suffering entitle a man to be regarded as divine  if so so also am i a god  look at me  he stretched out his long thin arms with their clawlike hands thrusting forward his great savage head that the bony wizened throat seemed hardly strong enough to bear  wealth honour happiness i had them once  i had wife children and a home  now i creep an outcast keeping to the shadows and the children in the street throw stones at me  thirty years i have starved that i might preach  they shut me in their prisons they hound me into garrets  they jibe at me and mock me but they cannot silence me  what of my life  am i divine  miss ensor having finished her supper sat smoking  why must you preach she asked  it doesnt seem to pay you  there was a curious smile about the girls lips as she caught joans eye  he turned to her with his last flicker of passion  because to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth he answered  he sank back a huddled heap upon the chair  there was foam about his mouth great beads of sweat upon his forehead  mary wiped them away with a corner of her apron and felt again his trembling hands  oh please dont talk to him any more she pleaded not till hes had his supper she fetched her fine shawl and pinned it round him  his eyes followed her as she hovered about him  for the first time since he had entered the room they looked human  they gathered round the table  mr baptiste was still pinned up in marys bright shawl  it lent him a curious dignity  he might have been some ancient prophet stepped from the pages of the talmud  miss ensor completed her supper with a cup of tea and some little cakes just to keep us all company as mary had insisted  the old fanatics eyes passed from face to face  there was almost the suggestion of a smile about the savage mouth  a strange supperparty he said  cyril the apostate and julius who strove against the high priests and the pharisees and inez a dancer before the people and joanna a daughter of the rulers gathered together in the house of one mary a servant of the lord  are you too a christian he asked of joan  not yet answered joan  but i hope to be one day  she spoke without thinking not quite knowing what she meant  but it came back to her in after years  the talk grew lighter under the influence of marys cooking  mr baptiste could be interesting when he got away from his fanaticism and even the apostolic mr simson had sometimes noticed humour when it had chanced his way  a message came for mary about ten oclock brought by a scared little girl who whispered it to her at the door  mary apologized  she had to go out  the party broke up  mary disappeared into the next room and returned in a shawl and bonnet carrying a small brown paper parcel  joan walked with her as far as the kings road  a little child is coming she confided to joan  she was quite excited about it  joan thought  its curious she said one so seldom hears of anybody being born on christmas day  they were passing a lamp  joan had never seen a face look quite so happy as marys looked just then  it always seems to me christs birthday she said whenever a child is born  they had reached the corner  joan could see her bus in the distance  she stooped and kissed the little withered face  dont stop she whispered  mary gave her a hug and almost ran away  joan watched the little child like figure growing smaller  it glided in and out among the people     chapter xi   in the spring joan at mrs dentons request undertook a mission  it was to go to paris  mrs denton had meant to go herself but was laid up with sciatica and the matter she considered would not brook of any delay  its rather a delicate business she told joan  she was lying on a couch in her great library and joan was seated by her side  i want someone who can go into private houses and mix with educated people on their own level and especially i want you to see one or two women they count in france  you know french pretty well dont you  oh sufficiently joan answered  the one thing her mother had done for her had been to talk french with her when she was a child and at girton she had chummed on with a french girl and made herself tolerably perfect  you will not go as a journalist continued mrs denton but as a personal friend of mine whose discretion i shall vouch for  i want you to find out what the people i am sending you among are thinking themselves and what they consider ought to be done  if we are not very careful on both sides we shall have the newspapers whipping us into war  the perpetual egyptian trouble had cropped up again and the carleton papers in particular were already sounding the tocsin  carletons argument was that we ought to fall upon france and crush her before she could develop her supposed submarine menace  his flaming posters were at every corner  every obscure french newspaper was being ransacked for insults and pinpricks  a section of the paris press is doing all it can to help him of course explained mrs denton  it doesnt seem to matter to them that germany is only waiting her opportunity and that if russia comes in it is bound to bring austria  europe will pay dearly one day for the luxury of a free press  but youre surely not suggesting any other kind of press at this period of the worlds history exclaimed joan  oh but i am answered the old lady with a grim tightening of the lips not even carleton would be allowed to incite to murder or arson  i would have him prosecuted for inciting a nation to war  why is the press always so eager for war mused joan  according to their own account war doesnt pay them  i dont suppose it does not directly answered mrs denton  but it helps them to establish their position and get a tighter hold upon the public  war does pay the newspaper in the long run  the daily newspaper lives on commotion crime lawlessness in general  if people no longer enjoyed reading about violence and bloodshed half their occupation and that the most profitable half would be gone  it is the interest of the newspaper to keep alive the savage in human nature and war affords the readiest means of doing this  you cant do much to increase the number of gruesome murders and loathsome assaults beyond giving all possible advertisement to them when they do occur  but you can preach war and cover yourself with glory as a patriot at the same time  i wonder how many of my ideals will be left to me sighed joan  i always used to regard the press as the modern pulpit  the old pulpit became an evil the moment it obtained unlimited power answered mrs denton  it originated persecution and inflamed mens passions against one another  it too preached war for its own ends taught superstition and punished thought as a crime  the press of to day is stepping into the shoes of the medieval priest  it aims at establishing the worst kind of tyranny the tyranny over mens minds they pretend to fight among themselves but its rapidly becoming a close corporation  the institute of journalists will soon be followed by the union of newspaper proprietors and the few independent journals will be squeezed out  already we have german shareholders on english papers and english capital is interested in the st petersburg press  it will one day have its international pope and its school of cosmopolitan cardinals  joan laughed  i can see carleton rather fancying himself in a tiara she said  i must tell phillips what you say  hes out for a fight with him  government by parliament or government by press is going to be his war cry  good man said mrs denton  im quite serious  you tell him from me that the next revolution has got to be against the press  and it will be the stiffest fight democracy has ever had  the old lady had tired herself  joan undertook the mission  she thought she would rather enjoy it and mrs denton promised to let her have full instructions  she would write to her friends in paris and prepare them for joans coming  joan remembered folk the artist she had met at flossies party who had promised to walk with her on the terrace at st germain and tell her more about her mother  she looked up his address on her return home and wrote to him giving him the name of the hotel in the rue de grenelle where mrs denton had arranged that she should stay  she found a note from him awaiting her when she arrived there  he thought she would like to be quiet after her journey  he would call round in the morning  he had presumed on the privilege of age to send her some lilies  they had been her mothers favourite flower  monsieur folk the great artist had brought them himself and placed them in her dressingroom so madame informed her  it was one of the halfdozen old hotels still left in paris and was built round a garden famous for its mighty mulberry tree  she breakfasted underneath it and was reading there when folk appeared before her smiling and with his hat in his hand  he excused himself for intruding upon her so soon thinking from what she had written him that her first morning might be his only chance  he evidently considered her remembrance of him a feather in his cap  we old fellows feel a little sadly at times how unimportant we are he explained  we are grateful when youth throws us a smile  you told me my coming would take you back thirtythree years joan reminded him  it makes us about the same age  i shall treat you as just a young man  he laughed  dont be surprised he said if i make a mistake occasionally and call you lena  joan had no appointment till the afternoon  they drove out to st germain and had dejeuner at a small restaurant opposite the chateau and afterwards they strolled on to the terrace  what was my mother doing in paris asked joan  she was studying for the stage he answered  paris was the only school in those days  i was at juliens studio  we acted together for some charity  i had always been fond of it  an american manager who was present offered us both an engagement and i thought it would be a change and that i could combine the two arts  and it was here that you proposed to her said joan  just by that tree that leans forward he answered pointing with his cane a little way ahead  i thought that in america id get another chance  i might have if your father hadnt come along  i wonder if he remembers me  did you ever see her again after her marriage asked joan  no he answered  we used to write to one another until she gave it up  she had got into the habit of looking upon me as a harmless sort of thing to confide in and ask advice ofwhich she never took  forgive me he said  you must remember that i am still her lover they had reached the tree that leant a little forward beyond its fellows and he had halted and turned so that he was facing her  did she and your father get on together  was she happy  i dont think she was happy answered joan  she was at first  as a child i can remember her singing and laughing about the house and she liked always to have people about her  until her illness came  it changed her very much  but my father was gentleness itself to the end  they had resumed their stroll  it seemed to her that he looked at her once or twice a little oddly without speaking  what caused your mothers illness he asked abruptly  the question troubled her  it struck her with a pang of selfreproach that she had always been indifferent to her mothers illness regarding it as more or less imaginary  it was mental rather than physical i think she answered  i never knew what brought it about  again he looked at her with that odd inquisitive expression  she never got over it he asked  oh there were times answered joan when she was more like her old self again  but i dont think she ever quite got over it  unless it was towards the end she added  they told me she seemed much better for a little while before she died  i was away at cambridge at the time  poor dear lady he said all those years  and poor jack allway  he seemed to be talking to himself  suddenly he turned to her  how is the dear fellow he asked  again the question troubled her  she had not seen her father since that weekend nearly six months ago when she had ran down to see him because she wanted something from him  he felt my mothers death very deeply she answered  but hes well enough in health  remember me to him he said  and tell him i thank him for all those years of love and gentleness  i dont think he will be offended  he drove her back to paris and she promised to come and see him in his studio and let him introduce her to his artist friends  i shall try to win you over i warn you he said  politics will never reform the world  they appeal only to mens passions and hatreds  they divide us  it is art that is going to civilize mankind broaden his sympathies  art speaks to him the common language of his loves his dreams reveals to him the universal kinship  mrs dentons friends called upon her and most of them invited her to their houses  a few were politicians senators or ministers  others were bankers heads of business houses literary men and women  there were also a few quiet folk with names that were historical  they all thought that war between france and england would be a world disaster but were not very hopeful of averting it  she learnt that carleton was in berlin trying to secure possession of a wellknown german daily that happened at the moment to be in low water  he was working for an alliance between germany and england  in france the royalists had come to an understanding with the clericals and both were evidently making ready to throw in their lot with the warmongers hoping that out of the troubled waters the fish would come their way  of course everything depended on the people  if the people only knew it  but they didnt they stood about in puzzled flocks like sheep wondering which way the newspaper dog was going to hound them  they took her to the great music halls  every allusion to war was greeted with rapturous applause  the marseillaise was demanded and encored till the orchestra rebelled from sheer exhaustion  joans patience was sorely tested  she had to listen with impassive face to coarse jests and brutal gibes directed against england and everything english to sit unmoved while the vast audience rocked with laughter at senseless caricatures of supposed english soldiers whose knees always gave way at the sight of a french uniform even in the eyes of her courteous hosts joans quick glance would occasionally detect a curious glint  the fools  had they never heard of waterloo and trafalgar  even if their memories might be excused for forgetting crecy and poictiers and the campaigns of marlborough  one eveningit had been a particularly trying one for joanthere stepped upon the stage a woodenlooking man in a kilt with bagpipes under his arm  how he had got himself into the programme joan could not understand  managerial watchfulness must have gone to sleep for once  he played scotch melodies and the parisians liked them and when he had finished they called him back  joan and her friends occupied a box close to the stage  the woodenlooking scot glanced up at her and their eyes met  and as the applause died down there rose the first low warning strains of the pibroch  joan sat up in her chair and her lips parted the savage music quickened  it shrilled and skrealed  the blood came surging through her veins  and suddenly something lying hidden there leaped to life within her brain  a mad desire surged hold of her to rise and shout defiance at those three thousand pairs of hostile eyes confronting her  she clutched at the arms of her chair and so kept her seat  the pibroch ended with its wild sad notes of wailing and slowly the mist cleared from her eyes and the stage was empty  a strange hush had fallen on the house  she was not aware that her hostess had been watching her  she was a sweetfaced whitehaired lady  she touched joan lightly on the hand thats the trouble she whispered  its in our blood  could we ever hope to eradicate it  was not the survival of this fighting instinct proof that war was still needful to us  in the sculptureroom of an exhibition she came upon a painted statue of bellona  its grotesqueness shocked her at first sight the red streaming hair the wild eyes filled with fury the wide open mouthone could almost hear it screamingthe white uplifted arms with outstretched hands  appalling  terrible  and yet as she gazed at it gradually the thing grew curiously real to her  she seemed to hear the gathering of the chariots the neighing of the horses the hurrying of many feet the sound of an armouring multitude the shouting and the braying of the trumpets  these cold thinlipped calculators arguing that war doesnt pay those lankhaired cosmopolitans preaching their international as if the only business of mankind were wages  war still was the stern school where men learnt virtue duty forgetfulness of self faithfulness unto death  this particular war of course must be stopped if it were not already too late  it would be a war for markets for spheres of commercial influence a sordid war that would degrade the people  war the supreme test of a nations worth must be reserved for great ideals  besides she wanted to down carleton  one of the women on her list and the one to whom mrs denton appeared to attach chief importance a madame de barante disappointed joan  she seemed to have so few opinions of her own  she had buried her young husband during the francoprussian war  he had been a soldier  and she had remained unmarried  she was still beautiful  i do not think we women have the right to discuss war she confided to joan in her gentle highbred voice  i suppose you think that out of date  i should have thought so myself forty years ago  we talk of giving our sons and lovers as if they were ours to give  it makes me a little angry when i hear pampered women speak like that  it is the men who have to suffer and die  it is for them to decide  but perhaps i can arrange a meeting for you with a friend she added who will be better able to help you if he is in paris  i will let you know  she told joan what she remembered herself of 1870  she had turned her country house into a hospital and had seen a good deal of the fighting  it would not do to tell the truth or we should have our children growing up to hate war she concluded  she was as good as her word and sent joan round a message the next morning to come and see her in the afternoon  joan was introduced to a monsieur de chaumont  he was a soldierlylooking gentleman with a grey moustache and a deep scar across his face  hanged if i can see how we are going to get out of it he answered joan cheerfully  the moment there is any threat of war it becomes a point of honour with every nation to do nothing to avoid it  i remember my old duelling days  the quarrel may have been about the silliest trifle imaginable  a single word would have explained the whole thing away  but to utter it would have stamped one as a coward  this egyptian tralala it isnt worth the bones of a single grenadier as our friends across the rhine would say  but i expect before its settled there will be mens bones sufficient bleaching on the desert to build another pyramid  its so easily started thats the devil of it  a mischievous boy can throw a lighted match into a powder magazine and then it becomes every patriots business to see that it isnt put out  i hate war  it accomplishes nothing and leaves everything in a greater muddle than it was before but if the idea ever catches fire i shall have to do all i can to fan the conflagration  unless i am prepared to be branded as a poltroon every professional soldier is supposed to welcome war  most of us do its our opportunity  theres some excuse for us  but these mencarleton and their lot i regard them as nothing better than the menades of the commune  they care nothing if the whole of europe blazes they cannot personally get harmed whatever happens  its fun to them  but the people who can get harmed argued joan  the men who will be dragged away from their work from their business used as cannon fodder  he shrugged his shoulders  oh they are always eager enough for it at first he answered  there is the excitement  the curiosity  you must remember that life is a monotonous affair to the great mass of the people  theres the natural craving to escape from it to court adventure  they are not so enthusiastic about it after they have tasted it  modern warfare they soon find is about as dull a business as science ever invented  there was only one hope that he could see and that was to switch the peoples mind on to some other excitement  his advices from london told him that a parliamentary crisis was pending  could not mrs denton and her party do something to hasten it  he on his side would consult with the socialist leaders who might have something to suggest  he met joan radiant a morning or two later  the english government had resigned and preparations for a general election were already on foot  and god has been good to us also he explained  a wellknown artist had been found murdered in his bed and grave suspicion attached to his beautiful young wife  she deserves the croix de guerre if it is proved that she did it he thought  she will have saved many thousands of livesfor the present  folk had fixed up a party at his studio to meet her  she had been there once or twice but this was a final affair  she had finished her business in paris and would be leaving the next morning  to her surprise she found phillips there  he had come over hurriedly to attend a socialist conference and leblanc the editor of le nouveau monde had brought him along  i took smedleys place at the last moment he whispered to her  ive never been abroad before  you dont mind do you  it didnt strike her as at all odd that a leader of a political party should ask her if she minded his being in paris to attend a political conference  he was wearing a light grey suit and a blue tie  there was nothing about him at that moment suggesting that he was a leader of any sort  he might have been just any man but for his eyes  no she whispered  of course not  i dont like your tie  it seemed to depress him that  she felt elated at the thought that he would see her for the first time amid surroundings where she would shine  folk came forward to meet her with that charming air of protective deference that he had adopted towards her  he might have been some favoured minister of state kissing the hand of a youthful queen  she glanced down the long studio ending in its fine window overlooking the park  some of the most distinguished men in paris were there and the immediate stir of admiration that her entrance had created was unmistakable  even the women turned pleased glances at her as if willing to recognize in her their representative  a sense of power came to her that made her feel kind to all the world there was no need for her to be clever to make any effort to attract her presence her sympathy her approval seemed to be all that was needed of her  she had the consciousness that by the mere exercise of her will she could sway the thoughts and actions of these men that sovereignty had been given to her  it reflected itself in her slightly heightened colour in the increased brilliance of her eyes in the confident case of all her movements  it added a compelling softness to her voice  she never quite remembered what the talk was about  men were brought up and presented to her and hung about her words and sought to please her she had spoken her own thoughts indifferent whether they expressed agreement or not and the argument had invariably taken another plane  it seemed so important that she should be convinced  some had succeeded and had been strengthened  others had failed and had departed sorrowful conscious of the necessity of thinking it out again  guests with other engagements were taking their leave  a piquante little woman outrageously but effectively dressedshe looked like a drawing by beardsleydrew her aside  ive always wished i were a man she said it seemed to me that they had all the power  from this afternoon i shall be proud of belonging to the governing sex  she laughed and slipped away  phillips was waiting for her in the vestibule  she had forgotten him but now she felt glad of his humble request to be allowed to see her home  it would have been such a big drop from her crowded hour of triumph to the long lonely cab ride and the solitude of the hotel  she resolved to be gracious feeling a little sorry for her neglect of himbut reflecting with satisfaction that he had probably been watching her the whole time  whats the matter with my tie he asked  wrong colour  she laughed  yes she answered  it ought to be grey to match your suit  and so ought your socks  i didnt know it was going to be such a swell affair or i shouldnt have come he said  she touched his hand lightly  i want you to get used to it she said  its part of your work  put your brain into it and dont be afraid  ill try he said  he was sitting on the front seat facing her  im glad i went he said with sudden vehemence  i loved watching you moving about among all those people  i never knew before how beautiful you are  something in his eyes sent a slight thrill of fear through her  it was not an unpleasant sensationrather exhilarating  she watched the passing street till she felt that his eyes were no longer devouring her  youre not offended he asked  at my thinking you beautiful he added in case she hadnt understood  she laughed  her confidence had returned to her  it doesnt generally offend a woman she answered  he seemed relieved  thats whats so wonderful about you he said ive met plenty of clever brilliant women but one could forget that they were women  youre everything  he pleaded standing below her on the steps of the hotel that she would dine with him  but she shook her head  she had her packing to do  she could have managed it but something prudent and absurd had suddenly got hold of her and he went away with much the same look in his eyes that comes to a dog when he finds that his master cannot be persuaded into an excursion  she went up to her room  there really was not much to do  she could quite well finish her packing in the morning  she sat down at the desk and set to work to arrange her papers  it was a warm spring evening and the window was open  a crowd of noisy sparrows seemed to be delighted about something  from somewhere unseen a blackbird was singing  she read over her report for mrs denton  the blackbird seemed never to have heard of war  he sang as if the whole world were a garden of languor and love  joan looked at her watch  the first gong would sound in a few minutes  she pictured the dreary silent diningroom with its few scattered occupants and her heart sank at the prospect  to her relief came remembrance of a cheerful but entirely respectable restaurant near to the louvre to which she had been taken a few nights before  she had noticed quite a number of women dining there alone  she closed her dispatch case with a snap and gave a glance at herself in the great mirror  the blackbird was still singing  she walked up the rue des sts peres enjoying the delicious air  half way across the bridge she overtook a man strolling listlessly in front of her  there was something familiar about him  he was wearing a grey suit and had his hands in his pockets  suddenly the truth flashed upon her  she stopped  if he strolled on she would be able to slip back instead of which he abruptly turned to look down at a passing steamer and they were face to face  it made her mad the look of delight that came into his eyes  she could have boxed his ears  hadnt he anything else to do but hang about the streets  he explained that he had been listening to the band in the gardens returning by the quai dorsay  do let me come with you he said  i kept myself free this evening hoping  and im feeling so lonesome  poor fellow  she had come to understand that feeling  after all it wasnt altogether his fault that they had met  and she had been so cross to him  he was reading every expression on her face  its such a lovely evening he said  couldnt we go somewhere and dine under a tree  it would be rather pleasant  there was a little place at meudon she remembered  the plane trees would just be in full leaf  a passing cab had drawn up close to them  the chauffeur was lighting his pipe  even mrs grundy herself couldnt object to a journalist dining with a politician  the stars came out before they had ended dinner  she had made him talk about himself  it was marvellous what he had accomplished with his opportunities  ten hours a day in the mines had earned for him his living and the night had given him his leisure  an attic lighted by a tallow candle with a shelf of books that left him hardly enough for bread had been his alma mater  history was his chief study  there was hardly an authority joan could think of with which he was not familiar julius caesar was his favourite play  he seemed to know it by heart at twentythree he had been elected a delegate and had entered parliament at twentyeight  it had been a life of hardship of privation of constant strain but she found herself unable to pity him it was a tale of strength of struggle of victory that he told her  strength  the shaded lamplight fell upon his fearless kindly face with its flashing eyes and its humorous mouth  he ought to have been drinking out of a horn not a wine glass that his wellshaped hand could have crushed by a careless pressure  in a winged helmet and a coat of mail he would have looked so much more fitly dressed than in that soft felt hat and ridiculous blue tie  she led him to talk on about the future  she loved to hear his clear confident voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness  what was there to stop him  why should he not climb from power to power till he had reached the end  and as he talked and dreamed there grew up in her heart a fierce anger what would her own future be  she would marry probably some man of her own class settle down to the average womans life be allowed like a spoilt child to still take an interest in public affairs hold drawingrooms attended by cranks and political nonentities be president perhaps of the local womans liberal league  the alternative to spend her days glued to a desk penning exhortations to the people that carleton and his like might or might not allow them to read while youth and beauty slipped away from her leaving her one of the ten thousand other lonely faded women forcing themselves unwelcome into mens jobs  there came to her a sense of having been robbed of what was hers by primitive eternal law  greyson had been right  she did love powerpower to serve and shape the world  she would have earned it and used it well  she could have helped him inspired him  they would have worked together he the force and she the guidance  she would have supplied the things he lacked  it was to her he came for counsel as it was  but for her he would never have taken the first step  what right had this poor brainless lump of painted flesh to share his wounds his triumphs  what help could she give him when the time should come that he should need it  suddenly he broke off  what a fool im making of myself he said  i always was a dreamer  she forced a laugh  why shouldnt it come true she asked  they had the little garden to themselves  the million lights of paris shone below them  because you wont be there he answered and without you i cant do it  you think im always like i am tonight bragging confident  so i am when you are with me  you give me back my strength  the plans and hopes and dreams that were slipping from me come crowding round me laughing and holding out their hands  they are like the children  they need two to care for them  i want to talk about them to someone who understands them and loves them as i do  i want to feel they are dear to someone else as well as to myself that i must work for them for her sake as well as for my own  i want someone to help me to bring them up  there were tears in his eyes  he brushed them angrily away  oh i know i ought to be ashamed of myself he said  it wasnt her fault  she wasnt to know that a hotblooded young chap of twenty hasnt all his wits about him any more than i was  if i had never met you it wouldnt have mattered  id have done my bit of good and have stopped there content  with you beside mehe looked away from her to where the silent city peeped through its veil of nighti might have left the world better than i found it  the blood had mounted to her face  she drew back into the shadow beyond the tiny sphere of light made by the little lamp  men have accomplished great things without a womans help she said  some men he answered  artists and poets  they have the woman within them  men like myselfthe mere fighter we are incomplete in ourselves male and female created he them  we are lost without our mate  he was thinking only of himself  had he no pity for her  so was she also useless without her mate  neither was she of those here and there who can stand alone  her task was that of the eternal woman to make a home to cleanse the world of sin and sorrow make it a kinder dwellingplace for the children that should come  this man was her true helpmeet  he would have been her weapon her dear servant and she could have rewarded him as none other ever could  the lamplight fell upon his ruddy face his strong white hands resting on the flimsy table  he belonged to an older order than her own  that suggestion about him of something primitive of something not yet altogether tamed  she felt again that slight thrill of fear that so strangely excited her  a mist seemed to be obscuring all things  he seemed to be coming towards her only by keeping her eyes fixed on his moveless hands still resting on the table could she convince herself that his arms were not closing about her that she was not being drawn nearer and nearer to him powerless to resist  suddenly out of the mist she heard voices  the waiter was standing beside him with the bill  she reached out her hand and took it  the usual few mistakes had occurred  she explained them good temperedly and the waiter with profuse apologies went back to have it corrected  he turned to her as the man went  try and forgive me he said in a low voice  it all came tumbling out before i thought what i was saying  the blood was flowing back into her veins  oh it wasnt your fault she answered  we must make the best we can of it  he bent forward so that he could see into her eyes  tell me he said  there was a note of fierce exultation in his voice ill promise never to speak of it again  if i had been a free man could i have won you  she had risen while he was speaking  she moved to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders  will you serve me and fight for me against all my enemies she asked  so long as i live he answered  she glanced round  there was no sign of the returning waiter  she bent over him and kissed him  dont come with me she said  theres a cab stand in the avenue  i shall walk to sevres and take the train  she did not look back     chapter xii   she reached home in the evening  the phillipss old rooms had been twice let since christmas but were now again empty  the mckean with his silent ways and his everlasting pipe had gone to america to superintend the production of one of his plays  the house gave her the feeling of being haunted  she had her dinner brought up to her and prepared for a long evenings work but found herself unable to thinkexcept on the one subject that she wanted to put off thinking about  to her relief the last post brought her a letter from arthur  he had been called to lisbon to look after a contract and would be away for a fortnight  her father was not as well as he had been  it seemed to just fit in  she would run down and spend a few quiet days at liverpool  in her old familiar room where the moon peeped in over the tops of the tall pines she would be able to reason things out  perhaps her father would be able to help her  she had lost her childish conception of him as of someone prim and proper with cut and dried formulas for all occasions  that glimpse he had shown her of himself had established a fellowship between them  he too had wrestled with lifes riddles not sure of his own answers  she found him suffering from his old heart trouble but more cheerful than she had known him for years arthur seemed to be doing wonders with the men  they were coming to trust him  the difficulty i have always been up against explained her father has been their suspicion  whats the cunning old rascal up to now whats his little game  that is always what i have felt they were thinking to themselves whenever i have wanted to do anything for them  it isnt anything he says to them  it seems to be just he himself  he sketched out their plans to her  it seemed to be all going in at one ear and out at the other  what was the matter with her  perhaps she was tired without knowing it  she would get him to tell her all about it to morrow  also tomorrow she would tell him about phillips and ask his advice  it was really quite late  if he talked any more now it would give her a headache  she felt it coming on  she made her goodnight extra affectionate hoping to disguise her impatience  she wanted to get up to her own room  but even that did not help her  it seemed in some mysterious way to be no longer her room but the room of someone she had known and half forgotten who would never come back  it gave her the same feeling she had experienced on returning to the house in london that the place was haunted  the high cheval glass from her mothers dressingroom had been brought there for her use  the picture of an absurdly small childthe child to whom this room had once belongedstanding before it naked rose before her eyes  she had wanted to see herself  she had thought that only her clothes stood in the way  if we could but see ourselves as in some magic mirror  all the garments usage and education has dressed us up in laid aside  what was she underneath her artificial niceties her prim moralities her laboriously acquired restraints her unconscious pretences and hypocrisies  she changed her clothes for a loose robe and putting out the light drew back the curtains  the moon peeped in over the top of the tall pines but it only stared at her indifferent  it seemed to be looking for somebody else  suddenly and intensely to her own surprise she fell into a passionate fit of weeping  there was no reason for it and it was altogether so unlike her  but for quite a while she was unable to control it gradually and of their own accord her sobs lessened and she was able to wipe her eyes and take stock of herself in the long glass  she wondered for the moment whether it was really her own reflection that she saw there or that of some ghostly image of her mother  she had so often seen the same look in her mothers eyes  evidently the likeness between them was more extensive than she had imagined  for the first time she became conscious of an emotional hysterical side to her nature of which she had been unaware  perhaps it was just as well that she had discovered it  she would have to keep a stricter watch upon herself this question of her future relationship with phillips it would have to be thought out coldly dispassionately  nothing unexpected must be allowed to enter into it  it was some time before she fell asleep  the high glass faced her as she lay in bed  she could not get away from the idea that it was her mothers face that every now and then she saw reflected there  she woke late the next morning  her father had already left for the works  she was rather glad to have no need of talking  she would take a long walk into the country and face the thing squarely with the help of the cheerful sun and the free west wind that was blowing from the sea she took the train up north and struck across the hills  her spirits rose as she walked  it was only the intellectual part of him she wantedthe spirit not the man  she would be taking nothing away from the woman nothing that had ever belonged to her  all the rest of him his home life the benefits that would come to her from his improved means from his social position all that the woman had ever known or cared for in him would still be hers  he would still remain to her the kind husband and father  what more was the woman capable of understanding  what more had she any right to demand  it was not of herself she was thinking  it was for his works sake that she wanted to be near to him always that she might counsel him encourage him  for this she was prepared to sacrifice herself give up her womans claim on life  they would be friends comradesnothing more  that little lurking curiosity of hers concerning what it would be like to feel his strong arms round her pressing her closer and closer to him it was only a foolish fancy  she could easily laugh that out of herself  only bad women had need to be afraid of themselves  she would keep guard for both of them  their purity of motive their high purpose would save them from the danger of anything vulgar or ridiculous  of course they would have to be careful  there must be no breath of gossip no food for evil tongues  about that she was determined even more for his sake than her own  it would be fatal to his career  she was quite in agreement with the popular demand supposed to be peculiarly english that a public mans life should be above reproach  of what use these prophets without selfcontrol these social reformers who could not shake the ape out of themselves  only the brave could give courage to others  only through the pure could gods light shine upon men  it was vexing his having moved round the corner into north street  why couldnt the silly woman have been content where she was  living under one roof they could have seen one another as often as was needful without attracting attention  now she supposed she would have to be more than ever the bosom friend of mrs phillipsspend hours amid that hideous furniture surrounded by those bilious wallpapers  of course he could not come to her  she hoped he would appreciate the sacrifice she would be making for him  fortunately mrs phillips would give no trouble  she would not even understand  what about hilda  no hope of hiding their secret from those sharp eyes but hilda would approve  they could trust hilda  the child might prove helpful  it cast a passing shadow upon her spirits this necessary descent into details  it brought with it the suggestion of intrigue of deceit robbing the thing to a certain extent of its fineness  still what was to be done  if women were coming into public life these sort of relationships with men would have to be faced and worked out  sex must no longer be allowed to interfere with the working together of men and women for common ends  it was that had kept the world back  they would be the pioneers of the new order  casting aside their earthly passions humbly with pure hearts they would kneel before gods altar  he should bless their union  a lark was singing  she stood listening  higher and higher he rose pouring out his song of worship till the tiny fragile body disappeared as if fallen from him leaving his sweet soul still singing  the happy tears came to her eyes and she passed on  she did not hear that little last faint sob with which he sank exhausted back to earth beside a hidden nest among the furrows  she had forgotten the time  it was already late afternoon  her long walk and the keen air had made her hungry  she had a couple of eggs with her tea at a village inn and was fortunate enough to catch a train that brought her back in time for dinner  a little ashamed of her unresponsiveness the night before she laid herself out to be sympathetic to her fathers talk  she insisted on hearing again all that he and arthur were doing opposing him here and there with criticism just sufficient to stimulate him careful in the end to let him convince her  these small hypocrisies were new to her  she hoped she was not damaging her character  but it was good watching him slyly from under drawndown lids to see the flash of triumph that would come into his tired eyes in answer to her halfprotesting yes i see your point i hadnt thought of that her half reluctant admission that perhaps he was right there that perhaps she was wrong  it was delightful to see him young again eager boyishly pleased with himself  it seemed there was a joy she had not dreamed of in yielding victory as well as in gaining it  a new tenderness was growing up in her  how considerate how patient how selfforgetful he had always been  she wanted to mother him  to take him in her arms and croon over him hushing away remembrance of the old sad days  folks words came back to her and poor jack allway  tell him i thank him for all those years of love and gentleness  she gave him the message  folk had been right  he was not offended  dear old chap he said that was kind of him  he was always generous  he was silent for a while with a quiet look on his face  give him our love he said  tell him we came together at the end  it was on her tongue to ask him as so often she had meant to do of late what had been the cause of her mothers illnessif illness it was what it was that had happened to change both their lives  but always something had stopped hersomething ever present ever watchful that seemed to shape itself out of the air bending towards her with its finger on its lips  she stayed over the weekend and on the saturday at her suggestion they took a long excursion into the country  it was the first time she had ever asked him to take her out  he came down to breakfast in a new suit and was quite excited  in the car his hand had sought hers shyly and feeling her responsive pressure he had continued to hold it and they had sat for a long time in silence  she decided not to tell him about phillips just yet  he knew of him only from the tory newspapers and would form a wrong idea  she would bring them together and leave phillips to make his own way  he would like phillips when he knew him she felt sure  he too was a peoples man  the torch passed down to him from his old ironside ancestors it still glowed  more than once she had seen it leap to flame  in congenial atmosphere it would burn clear and steadfast  it occurred to her what a delightful solution of her problem if later on her father could be persuaded to leave arthur in charge of the works and come to live with her in london  there was a fine block of flats near chelsea church with long views up and down the river  how happy they could be there the drawingroom in the adams style with winecoloured curtains  he was a father any young woman could be proud to take about  unconsciously she gave his hand an impulsive squeeze  they lunched at an old inn upon the moors and the landlady judging from his shy attentive ways had begun by addressing her as madame  you grow wonderfully like your mother he told her that evening at dinner  there used to be something missing  but i dont feel that now  she wrote to phillips to meet her if possible at euston  there were things she wanted to talk to him about  there was the question whether she should go on writing for carleton or break with him at once  also one or two points that were worrying her in connection with tariff reform  he was waiting for her on the platform  it appeared he too had much to say  he wanted her advice concerning his next speech  he had not dined and suggested supper  they could not walk about the streets  likely enough it was only her imagination but it seemed to her that people in the restaurant had recognized him and were whispering to one another he was bound to be well known  likewise her own appearance she felt was against them as regarded their desire to avoid observation  she would have to take to those mousey colours that did not suit her and wear a veil  she hated the idea of a veil  it came from the east and belonged there  besides what would be the use  unless he wore one too  who is the veiled woman that phillips goes about with that is what they would ask  it was going to be very awkward the whole thing  viewed from the distance it had looked quite fine  dedicating herself to the service of humanity was how it had presented itself to her in the garden at meudon the twinkling labyrinth of paris at her feet its sordid byways hidden beneath its myriad lights  she had not bargained for the dedication involving the loss of her selfrespect  they did not talk as much as they had thought they would  he was not very helpful on the carleton question  there was so much to be said both for and against  it might be better to wait and see how circumstances shaped themselves  she thought his speech excellent  it was difficult to discover any argument against it  he seemed to be more interested in looking at her when he thought she was not noticing  that little faint vague fear came back to her and stayed with her but brought no quickening of her pulse  it was a fear of something ugly  she had the feeling they were both acting that everything depended upon their not forgetting their parts  in handing things to one another they were both of them so careful that their hands should not meet and touch  they walked together back to westminster and wished each other a short goodnight upon what once had been their common doorstep  with her latchkey in her hand she turned and watched his retreating figure and suddenly a wave of longing seized her to run after him and call him backto see his eyes light up and feel the pressure of his hands  it was only by clinging to the railings and counting till she was sure he had entered his own house round the corner and closed the door behind him that she restrained herself  it was a frightened face that looked at her out of the glass as she stood before it taking off her hat  she decided that their future meetings should be at his own house  mrs phillipss only complaint was that she knocked at the door too seldom  i dont know what i should do without you i really dont confessed the grateful lady  if ever i become a prime ministers wife its you i shall have to thank  youve got so much courage yourself you can put the heart into him  i never had any pluck to spare myself  she concluded by giving joan a hug accompanied by a sloppy but heartfelt kiss  she would stand behind phillipss chair with her fat arms round his neck nodding her approval and encouragement while joan seated opposite would strain every nerve to keep her brain fixed upon the argument never daring to look at poor phillipss wretched face with its pleading apologetic eyes lest she should burst into hysterical laughter  she hoped she was being helpful and inspiring  mrs phillips would assure her afterwards that she had been wonderful  as for herself there were periods when she hadnt the faintest idea about what she was talking  sometimes mrs phillips called away by domestic duty would leave them returning full of excuses just as they had succeeded in forgetting her it was evident she was under the impression that her presence was useful to them making it easier for them to open up their minds to one another  dont you be put off by his seeming a bit unresponsive mrs phillips would explain  hes shy with women  what im trying to do is to make him feel you are one of the family  and dont you take any notice of me further explained the good woman when i seem to be in opposition like  i chip in now and then on purpose just to keep the ball rolling  it stirs him up a bit of contradictoriness  you have to live with a man before you understand him  one morning joan received a letter from phillips marked immediate  he informed her that his brain was becoming addled  he intended that afternoon to give it a draught of fresh air  he would be at the robin hood gate in richmond park at three oclock  perhaps the gods would be good to him  he would wait there for half an hour to give them a chance anyway  she slipped the letter unconsciously into the bosom of her dress and sat looking out of the window  it promised to be a glorious day and london was stifling and gritty  surely no one but an unwholesomeminded prude could jib at a walk across a park  mrs phillips would be delighted to hear that she had gone  for the matter of that she would tell herwhen next they met  phillips must have seen her getting off the bus for he came forward at once from the other side of the gate his face radiant with boyish delight  a young man and woman entering the park at the same time looked at them and smiled sympathetically  joan had no idea the park contained such pleasant byways  but for an occasional perambulator they might have been in the heart of the country the fallow deer stole near to them with noiseless feet regarding them out of their large gentle eyes with looks of comradeship  they paused and listened while a missal thrush from a branch close to them poured out his song of hope and courage  from quite a long way off they could still hear his clear voice singing telling to the young and brave his gallant message  it seemed too beautiful a day for politics  after all politicsone has them always with one but the spring passes  he saw her on to a bus at kingston and himself went back by train  they agreed they would not mention it to mrs phillips  not that she would have minded  the danger was that she would want to come too honestly thinking thereby to complete their happiness  it seemed to be tacitly understood there would be other such excursions  the summer was propitious  phillips knew his london well and how to get away from it  there were winding lanes in hertfordshire surrey hills and commons deep cool birdhaunted woods in buckingham  each week there was something to look forward to something to plan for and manoeuvre  the sense of adventure a spice of danger added zest  she still knocked frequently as before at the door of the hideouslyfurnished little house in north street but mrs phillips no longer oppressed her as some old man of the sea she could never hope to shake off from her shoulders  the flabby foolish face robbed of its terrors became merely pitiful  she found herself able to be quite gentle and patient with mrs phillips  even the sloppy kisses she came to bear without a shudder down her spine  i know you are only doing it because you sympathize with his aims and want him to win acknowledged the good lady  but i cant help feeling grateful to you  i dont feel how useless i am while ive got you to run to  they still discussed their various plans for the amelioration and improvement of humanity but there seemed less need for haste than they had thought  the world joan discovered was not so sad a place as she had judged it  there were chubby rogueeyed children whistling lads and smiling maidens kindly men with ruddy faces happy mothers crooning over gurgling babies  there was no call to be fretful and vehement  they would work together in patience and in confidence  gods sun was everywhere  it needed only that dark places should be opened up and it would enter  sometimes seated on a lichened log or on the short grass of some sloping hillside looking down upon some quiet valley they would find they had been holding hands while talking  it was but as two happy thoughtless children might have done  they would look at one another with frank clear eyes and smile  once when their pathway led through a littered farmyard he had taken her up in his arms and carried her and she had felt a glad pride in him that he had borne her lightly as if she had been a child looking up at her and laughing  an old bent man paused from his work and watched them  lean more over him missie he advised her  thats the way  many a mile ive carried my lass like that in flood time and never felt her weight  often on returning home not knowing why she would look into the glass it seemed to her that the girlhood she had somehow missed was awakening in her taking possession of her changing her  the lips she had always seen pressed close and firm were growing curved leaving a little parting as though they were not quite so satisfied with one another  the level brows were becoming slightly raised  it gave her a questioning look that was new to her  the eyes beneath were less confident  they seemed to be seeking something  one evening on her way home from a theatre she met flossie  cant stop now said flossie who was hurrying  but i want to see you most particular  was going to look you up  will you be at home tomorrow afternoon at teatime  there was a distinct challenge in flossies eye as she asked the question  joan felt herself flush and thought a moment  yes she answered  will you be coming alone  thats the idea answered flossie a heart to heart talk between you and me and nobody else  halfpast four  dont forget  joan walked on slowly  she had the worried feeling with which once or twice when a schoolgirl she had crawled up the stairs to bed after the head mistress had informed her that she would see her in her private room at eleven oclock the next morning leaving her to guess what about  it occurred to her in trafalgar square that she had promised to take tea with the greysons the next afternoon to meet some big pot from america she would have to get out of that  she felt it wouldnt do to put off flossie  she went to bed wakeful  it was marvellously like being at school again what could flossie want to see her about that was so important  she tried to pretend to herself that she didnt know  after all perhaps it wasnt that  but she knew that it was the instant flossie put up her hands in order to take off her hat  flossie always took off her hat when she meant to be unpleasant  it was her way of pulling up her sleeves  they had their tea first  they seemed both agreed that that would be best  and then flossie pushed back her chair and sat up  she had just the head mistress expression  joan wasnt quite sure she oughtnt to stand  but controlling the instinct leant back in her chair and tried to look defiant without feeling it  how far are you going demanded flossie  joan was not in a comprehending mood  if youre going the whole hog thats something i can understand continued flossie  if not youd better pull up  what do you mean by the whole hog requested joan assuming dignity  oh dont come the kid advised flossie  if you dont mind being talked about yourself you might think of him  if carleton gets hold of it hes done for  a little bird whispers to me that robert phillips was seen walking across richmond park the other afternoon in company with miss joan allway formerly one of our contributors  is that going to end his political career retorted joan with fine sarcasm  flossie fixed a relentless eye upon her  hell wait till the bird has got a bit more than that to whisper to him she suggested  therell be nothing more explained joan  so long as my friendship is of any assistance to robert phillips in his work hes going to have it what use are we going to be in politicswhats all the fuss about if men and women mustnt work together for their common aims and help one another  why cant you help him in his own house instead of wandering all about the country flossie wanted to know  so i do joan defended herself  im in and out there till im sick of the hideous place  you havent seen the inside  and his wife knows all about it and is only too glad  does she know about richmond parkand the other places asked flossie  she wouldnt mind if she did explained joan  and you know what shes like  how can one think what ones saying with that silly goggleeyed face in front of one always  flossie since she had become engaged had acquired quite a matronly train of thought  she spoke kindly with a little grave shake of her head  my dear she said the wife is always in the way  youd feel just the same whatever her face was like  joan grew angry  if you choose to suspect evil of course you can she answered with hauteur  but you might have known me better  i admire the man and sympathize with him  all the things i dream of are the things he is working for  i can do more good by helping and inspiring himshe wished she had not let slip that word inspire  she knew that flossie would fasten upon itthan i can ever accomplish by myself  and i mean to do it  she really did feel defiant now  i know dear agreed flossie youve both of you made up your minds it shall always remain a beautiful union of twin spirits  unfortunately youve both got bodiesrather attractive bodies  well keep it off that plane if you dont mind answered joan with a touch of severity  im willing enough answered flossie  but what about old mother nature  shes going to be in this you know  take off your glasses and look at it straight she went on without giving joan time to reply  what is it in us that inspires men  if its only advice and sympathy hes after whats wrong with dear old mrs denton  shes a good walker except now and then when shes got the lumbago  why doesnt he get her to inspire him  it isnt only that explained joan  i give him courage  i always did have more of that than is any use to a woman  he wants to be worthy of my belief in him  what is the harm if he does admire meif a smile from me or a touch of the hand can urge him to fresh effort  suppose he does love me  flossie interrupted  how about being quite frank she suggested suppose we do love one another  how about putting it that way  and suppose we do agreed joan her courage rising  why should we shun one another as if we were both of us incapable of decency or self control  why must love be always assumed to make us weak and contemptible as if it were some subtle poison  why shouldnt it strengthen and ennoble us  why did the apple fall answered flossie  why when it escapes from its bonds doesnt it soar upward  if it wasnt for the irritating law of gravity we could skip about on the brink of precipices without danger  things being what they are sensible people keep as far away from the edge as possible  im sorry she continued awfully sorry old girl  its a bit of rotten bad luck for both of you  you were just made for one another  and fate knowing what was coming bustles round and gets hold of poor silly mrs phillips so as to be able to say yah  unless it all comes right in the end she added musingly and the poor old soul pegs out  i wouldnt give much for her liver  thats not bringing me up well suggested joan putting those ideas into my head  oh well one cant help ones thoughts explained flossie  it would be a blessing all round  they had risen  joan folded her hands  thank you for your scolding maam she said  shall i write out a hundred lines of greek  or do you think it will be sufficient if i promise never to do it again  you mean it said flossie  of course you will go on seeing himvisiting them and all that  but you wont go gadding about so that people can talk  only through the bars in future she promised  with the gaoler between us  she put her arms round flossie and bent her head so that her face was hidden  flossie still seemed troubled  she held on to joan  you are sure of yourself she asked  were only the female of the species  we get hungry and thirsty too  you know that kiddy dont you  joan laughed without raising her face  yes maam i know that she answered  ill be good  she sat in the dusk after flossie had gone and the laboured breathing of the tired city came to her through the open window  she had rather fancied that martyrs crown  it had not looked so very heavy the thorns not so very alarmingas seen through the window  she would wear it bravely  it would rather become her  facing the mirror of the days to come she tried it on  it was going to hurt  there was no doubt of that  she saw the fatuous approving face of the eternal mrs phillips thrust ever between them against the background of that hideous furniture of those bilious wall papersthe loneliness that would ever walk with her sit down beside her in the crowded restaurant steal up the staircase with her creep step by step with her from room to roomthe ever unsatisfied yearning for a tender word a kindly touch  yes it was going to hurt  poor robert  it would be hard on him too  she could not help feeling consolation in the thought that he also would be wearing that invisible crown  she must write to him  the sooner it was done the better  half a dozen contradictory moods passed over her during the composing of that letter but to her they seemed but the unfolding of a single thought  on one page it might have been his mother writing to him an experienced sagacious lady quite aware in spite of her affection for him of his faults and weaknesses solicitous that he should avoid the dangers of an embarrassing entanglement his happiness being the only consideration of importance  on others it might have been a queen laying her immutable commands upon some loyal subject sworn to her service  part of it might have been written by a laughing philosopher who had learnt the folly of taking life too seriously knowing that all things pass that the tears of today will be remembered with a smile  and a part of it was the unconsidered language of a loving woman  and those were the pages that he kissed  his letter in answer was much shorter  of course he would obey her wishes  he had been selfish thinking only of himself  as for his political career he did not see how that was going to suffer by his being occasionally seen in company with one of the most brilliantly intellectual women in london known to share his views  and he didnt care if it did  but inasmuch as she valued it all things should be sacrificed to it  it was hers to do what she would with  it was the only thing he had to offer her  their meetings became confined as before to the little house in north street  but it really seemed as if the gods appeased by their submission had decided to be kind  hilda was home for the holidays and her piercing eyes took in the situation at a flash  she appeared to have returned with a newborn and exacting affection for her mother that astonished almost as much as it delighted the poor lady  feeling sudden desire for a walk or a bus ride or to be taken to an entertainment no one was of any use to hilda but her mother  daddy had his silly politics to think and talk about  he must worry them out alone or with the assistance of miss allway  that was what she was there for  mrs phillips torn between her sense of duty and fear of losing this new happiness would yield to the childs coaxing  often they would be left alone to discuss the nations needs uninterrupted  conscientiously they would apply themselves to the task  always to find that sooner or later they were looking at one another in silence  one day phillips burst into a curious laugh  they had been discussing the problem of the smallholder  joan had put a question to him and with a slight start he had asked her to repeat it  but it seemed she had forgotten it  i had to see our solicitor one morning he explained when i was secretary to a miners union up north  a point had arisen concerning the legality of certain payments  it was a matter of vast importance to us but he didnt seem to be taking any interest and suddenly he jumped up im sorry phillips he said but ive got a big trouble of my own on at homei guess you know whatand i dont seem to care a damn about yours  youd better see delauny if youre in a hurry  and i did  he turned and leant over his desk  i guess theyll have to find another leader if theyre in a hurry he added  i dont seem able to think about turnips and cows  dont make me feel ive interfered with your work only to spoil it said joan  i guess im spoiling yours too he answered  im not worth it  i might have done something to win you and keep you  im not going to do much without you  you mean my friendship is going to be of no use to you asked joan  he raised his eyes and fixed them on her with a pleading doglike look  for gods sake dont take even that away from me he said  unless you want me to go to pieces altogether  a crust does just keep one alive one cant help thinking what a fine strong chap one might be if one wasnt always hungry  she felt so sorry for him  he looked such a boy with the angry tears in his clear blue eyes and that little childish quivering of the kind strong sulky mouth  she rose and took his head between her hands and turned his face towards her  she had meant to scold him but changed her mind and laid his head against her breast and held it there  he clung to her as a troubled child might with his arms clasped round her and his head against her breast  and a mist rose up before her and strange commanding voices seemed calling to her  he could not see her face  she watched it herself with dim half consciousness as it changed before her in the tawdry mirror above the mantelpiece half longing that he might look up and see it half terrified lest he should  with an effort that seemed to turn her into stone she regained command over herself  i must go now she said in a harsh voice and he released her  im afraid im an awful nuisance to you he said  i get these moods at times  youre not angry with me  no she answered with a smile  but it will hurt me if you fail remember that  she turned down the embankment after leaving the house  she always found the river strong and restful  so it was not only bad women that needed to be afraid of themselveseven to the most highclass young woman with letters after her name and altruistic interests even to her also the longing for the lovers clasp  flossie had been right  mother nature was not to be flouted of her childrennot even of her new daughters to them likewise the family trait  she would have run away if she could leaving him to guess at her real reasonif he were smart enough  but that would have meant excuses and explanations all round  she was writing a daily column of notes for greyson now in addition to the weekly letter from clorinda and mrs denton having compromised with her first dreams was delegating to joan more and more of her work  she wrote to mrs phillips that she was feeling unwell and would be unable to lunch with them on the sunday as had been arranged  mrs phillips much disappointed suggested wednesday but it seemed on wednesday she was no better  and so it drifted on for about a fortnight without her finding the courage to come to any decision and then one morning turning the corner into abingdon street she felt a slight pull at her sleeve and hilda was beside her the child had shown an uncanny intuition in not knocking at the door joan had been fearing that and would have sent down word that she was out  but it had to be faced  are you never coming again asked the child  of course answered joan when im better  im not very well just now  its the weather i suppose  the child turned her head as they walked and looked at her  joan felt herself smarting under that look but persisted  im very much run down she said  i may have to go away  you promised to help him said the child  i cant if im ill retorted joan  besides i am helping him  there are other ways of helping people than by wasting their time talking to them  he wants you said the child  its your being there that helps him  joan stopped and turned  did he send you she asked  no the child answered  mama had a headache this morning and i slipped out  youre not keeping your promise  palace yard save for a statuesque policeman was empty  how do you know that my being with him helps him asked joan  you know things when you love anybody explained the child  you feel them  you will come again soon  joan did not answer  youre frightened the child continued in a passionate low voice  you think that people will talk about you and look down upon you  you oughtnt to think about yourself  you ought to think only about him and his work  nothing else matters  i am thinking about him and his work joan answered  her hand sought hildas and held it  there are things you dont understand  men and women cant help each other in the way you think  they may try to and mean no harm in the beginning but the harm comes and then not only the woman but the man also suffers and his work is spoilt and his life ruined  the small hot hand clasped joans convulsively  but he wont be able to do his work if you keep away and never come back to him she persisted  oh i know it  it all depends upon you  he wants you  and i want him if thats any consolation to you joan answered with a short laugh  it wasnt much of a confession  the child was cute enough to have found that out for herself  only you see i cant have him  and theres an end of it  they had reached the abbey  joan turned and they retraced their steps slowly  i shall be going away soon for a little while she said  the talk had helped her to decision  when i come back i will come and see you all and you must all come and see me now and then  i expect i shall have a flat of my own  my father may be coming to live with me  goodbye  do all you can to help him  she stooped and kissed the child straining her to her almost fiercely but the childs lips were cold  she did not look back  miss greyson was sympathetic towards her desire for a longish holiday and wonderfully helpful and mrs denton also approved and to joans surprise kissed her mrs denton was not given to kissing  she wired to her father and got his reply the same evening  he would be at her rooms on the day she had fixed with his travelling bag and at her ladyships orders  with love and many thanks he had added  she waited till the day before starting to run round and say goodbye to the phillipses  she felt it would be unwise to try and get out of doing that  both phillips and hilda she was thankful were out and she and mrs phillips had tea alone together  the talk was difficult so far as joan was concerned  if the woman had been possessed of ordinary intuition she might have arrived at the truth  joan almost wished she would  it would make her own future task the easier  but mrs phillips it was clear was going to be no help to her  for her fathers sake she made pretence of eagerness but as the sea widened between her and the harbour lights it seemed as if a part of herself were being torn away from her  they travelled leisurely through holland and the rhine land and that helped a little the new scenes and interests and in switzerland they discovered a delightful little village in an upland valley with just one small hotel and decided to stay there for a while so as to give themselves time to get their letters  they took long walks and climbs returning tired and hungry looking forward to their dinner and the evening talk with the few other guests on the veranda  the days passed restfully in that hidden valley  the great white mountains closed her in  they seemed so strong and clean  it was on the morning they were leaving that a telegram was put into her hands  mrs phillips was ill at lodgings in folkestone  she hoped that joan on her way back would come to see her  she showed the telegram to her father  do you mind dad if we go straight back she asked  no dear he answered if you wish it  i would like to go back she said     chapter xiii   mrs phillips was sitting up in an easy chair near the heavilycurtained windows when joan arrived  it was a pleasant little house in the old part of the town and looked out upon the harbour  she was startlingly thin by comparison with what she had been but her face was still painted  phillips would run down by the afternoon train whenever he could get away  she never knew when he was coming so she explained and she could not bear the idea of his finding her old and ugly  she had fought against his wish that she should go into a nursing home and joan who in the course of her work upon the nursing times had acquired some knowledge of them as a whole was inclined to agree with her  she was quite comfortable where she was  the landlady according to her account was a dear  she had sent the nurse out for a walk on getting joans wire so that they could have a cosy chat  she didnt really want much attendance  it was her heart  it got feeble now and then and she had to keep very still that was all  joan told how her father had suffered for years from much the same complaint  so long as you were careful there was no danger  she must take things easily and not excite herself  mrs phillips acquiesced  its turning me into a lazybones she said with a smile  i can sit here by the hour just watching the bustle  i was always one for a bit of life  the landlady entered with joans tea  joan took an instinctive dislike to her  she was a large flashy woman wearing a quantity of cheap jewellery  her familiarity had about it something almost threatening joan waited till she heard the womans heavy tread descending the stairs before she expressed her opinion  i think she only means to be cheerful explained mrs phillips  shes quite a good sort when you know her  the subject seemed in some way to trouble her and joan dropped it  they watched the loading of a steamer while joan drank her tea  he will come this afternoon i fancy said mrs phillips  i seem to feel it  he will be able to see you home  joan started  she had been thinking about phillips wondering what she should say to him when they met  what does he think she asked about your illness  oh it worries him of course poor dear mrs phillips answered  you see ive always been such a goahead as a rule  but i think hes getting more hopeful  as i tell him ill be all right by the autumn  it was that spell of hot weather that knocked me over  joan was still looking out of the window  she didnt quite know what to say  the womans altered appearance had shocked her  suddenly she felt a touch upon her hand  youll look after him if anything does happen wont you  the womans eyes were pleading with her  they seemed to have grown larger  you know what i mean dear dont you she continued  it will be such a comfort to me to know that its all right  in answer the tears sprang to joans eyes  she knelt down and put her arms about the woman  dont be so silly she cried  theres nothing going to happen  youre going to get fat and well again and live to see him prime minister  i am getting thin aint i she said  i always wanted to be thin they both laughed  but i shant see him that even if i do live she went on  hell never be that without you  and id be so proud to think that he would i shouldnt mind going then she added  joan did not answer  there seemed no words that would come  you will promise wont you she persisted in a whisper  its only in casejust that i neednt worry myself  joan looked up  there was something in the eyes looking down upon her that seemed to be compelling her  if youll promise to try and get better she answered  mrs phillips stooped and kissed her  of course dear she said perhaps i shall now that my mind is easier  phillips came as mrs phillips had predicted  he was surprised at seeing joan  he had not thought she could get back so soon  he brought an evening paper with him  it contained a paragraph to the effect that mrs phillips wife of the rt hon robert phillips mp was progressing favourably and hoped soon to be sufficiently recovered to return to her london residence  it was the first time she had had a paragraph all to herself headed with her name  she flushed with pleasure and joan noticed that after reading it again she folded the paper up small and slipped it into her pocket  the nurse came in from her walk a little later and took joan downstairs with her  she ought not to talk to more than one person at a time the nurse explained with a shake of the head  she was a quiet businesslike woman  she would not express a definite opinion  its her mental state that is the trouble was all that she would say she ought to be getting better  but she doesnt  youre not a christian scientist by any chance she asked joan suddenly  no answered joan  surely youre not one  i dont know answered the woman  i believe that would do her more good than anything else  if she would listen to it  she seems to have lost all willpower  the nurse left her and the landlady came in to lay the table  she understood that joan would be dining with mr phillips  there was no train till the eightforty  she kept looking at joan as she moved about the room  joan was afraid she would begin to talk but she must have felt joans antagonism for she remained silent  once their eyes met and the woman leered at her  phillips came down looking more cheerful  he had detected improvement in mrs phillips  she was more hopeful in herself  they talked in low tones during the meal as people do whose thoughts are elsewhere  it happened quite suddenly phillips explained  they had come down a few days after the rising of parliament  there had been a spell of hot weather but nothing remarkable  the first attack had occurred about three weeks ago  it was just after hilda had gone back to school  he wasnt sure whether he ought to send for hilda or not  her mother didnt want him tonot just yet  of course if she got worse he would have to  what did joan thinkdid she think there was any real danger  joan could not say  so much depended upon the general state of health there was the case of her own father  of course she would always be subject to attacks  but this one would have warned her to be careful  phillips thought that living out of town might be better for her in the futuresomewhere in surrey where he could easily get up and down  he could sleep himself at the club on nights when he had to be late  they talked without looking at one another  they did not speak about themselves  mrs phillips was in bed when joan went up to say goodbye  youll come again soon she asked and joan promised  youve made me so happy she whispered  the nurse was in the room  they discussed politics in the train  phillips had found more support for his crusade against carleton than he had expected  he was going to open the attack at once thus forestalling carletons opposition to his land scheme  it isnt going to be the daily this and the daily that and the weekly the other all combined to down me  im going to tell the people that its carleton and only carletoncarleton here carleton there carleton everywhere against them  im going to drag him out into the open and make him put up his own fists  joan undertook to sound greyson  she was sure greyson would support him in his balanced gentlemanly way that could nevertheless be quite deadly  they grew less and less afraid of looking at one another as they felt that darkened room further and further behind them  they parted at charing cross  joan would write  they agreed it would be better to choose separate days for their visits to folkestone  she ran against madge in the morning and invited herself to tea  her father had returned to liverpool and her own rooms for some reason depressed her  flossie was there with young halliday  they were both off the next morning to his peoples place in devonshire from where they were going to get married and had come to say goodbye  flossie put sam in the passage and drewto the door  have you seen her she asked  how is she  oh shes changed a good deal answered joan  but i think shell get over it all right if shes careful  i shall hope for the best answered flossie  poor old soul shes had a good time  dont send me a present and then i neednt send you onewhen your time comes  its a silly custom  besides ive nowhere to put it  shall be in a ship for the next six months  will let you know when were back  she gave joan a hug and a kiss and was gone  joan joined madge in the kitchen where she was toasting buns  i suppose shes satisfied herself that hes brainy she laughed  oh brains arent everything answered madge  some of the worst rotters the world has ever been cursed with have been brainy enoughmen and women  we make too much fuss about brains just as once upon a time we did about mere brute strength thinking that was all that was needed to make a man great  brain is only muscle translated into civilization thats not going to save us  youve been thinking joan accused her  whats put all that into your head  madge laughed  mixing with so many brainy people perhaps she suggested and wondering whats become of their souls  be good sweet child  and let who can be clever joan quoted  would that be your text  madge finished buttering her buns  kant wasnt it she answered who marvelled chiefly at two things the starry firmament above him and the moral law within him  and theyre one and the same if hed only thought it out  its rather big to be good  they carried their tea into the sittingroom  do you really think shell get over it asked madge  or is it one of those things one has to say  i think she could answered joan if she would pull herself together its her lack of willpower thats the trouble  madge did not reply immediately  she was watching the rooks settling down for the night in the elm trees just beyond the window  there seemed to be much need of coming and going of much cawing  i met her pretty often during those months that helen lavery was running her round she said at length  it always seemed to me to have a touch of the heroic that absurd effort she was making to qualify herself so that she might be of use to him  i can see her doing something quite big if she thought it would help him  the cawing of the rooks grew fainter  one by one they folded their wings  neither spoke for a while  later on they talked about the coming election  if the party got back phillips would go to the board of trade  it would afford him a better platform for the introduction of his land scheme  what do you gather is the general opinion joan asked  that he will succeed  the general opinion seems to be that his star is in the ascendant madge answered with a smile that all things are working together for his good  its rather a useful atmosphere to have about one that  it breeds friendship and support  joan looked at her watch  she had an article to finish  madge stood on tiptoe and kissed her  dont think me unsympathetic she said  no one will rejoice more than i shall if god sees fit to call you to good work  but i cant help letting fall my little tear of fellowship with the weeping  and mind your ps and qs she added  youre in a difficult position and not all the eyes watching you are friendly  joan bore the germ of worry in her breast as she crossed the grays inn garden  it was a hard law that of the world knowing only winners and losers  of course the woman was to be pitied  no one could feel more sorry for her than joan herself  but what had madge exactly meant by those words that she could see her doing something really big if she thought it would help him  there was no doubt about her affection for him  it was almost doglike  and the child also  there must be something quite exceptional about him to have won the devotion of two such opposite beings  especially hilda  it would be hard to imagine any lengths to which hildas blind idolatry would not lead her  she ran down twice to folkestone during the following week  her visits made her mind easier  mrs phillips seemed so placid so contented there was no suggestion of suffering either mental or physical  she dined with the greysons the sunday after and mooted the question of the coming fight with carleton  greyson thought phillips would find plenty of journalistic backing  the concentration of the press into the hands of a few conscienceless schemers was threatening to reduce the journalist to a mere hireling and the betterclass men were becoming seriously alarmed  he found in his desk the report of a speech made by a wellknown leader writer at a recent dinner of the press club  the man had risen to respond to the toast of his own health and had taken the opportunity to unpack his heart  i am paid a thousand a year so greyson read to them for keeping my own opinions out of my paper  some of you perhaps earn more and others less but youre getting it for writing what youre told  if i were to be so foolish as to express my honest opinion id be on the street the next morning looking for another job  the business of the journalist the man had continued is to destroy the truth to lie to pervert to vilify to fawn at the feet of mammon to sell his soul for his daily bread  we are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes  we are the jumpingjacks  they pull the strings and we dance  our talents our possibilities our lives are the property of other men  we tried to pretend it was only one of jacks little jokes explained greyson as he folded up the cutting but it wouldnt work  it was too near the truth  i dont see what you are going to do commented mary  so long as men are not afraid to sell their souls there will always be a devils market for them  greyson did not so much mind there being a devils market provided he could be assured of an honest market alongside so that a man could take his choice  what he feared was the devils steady encroachment that could only end by the closing of the independent market altogether  his remedy was the introduction of the american trust law forbidding any one man being interested in more than a limited number of journals  but whats the difference demanded joan between a man owning one paper with a circulation of say six millions or owning six with a circulation of a million apiece  by concentrating all his energies on one a man with carletons organizing genius might easily establish a single journal that would cover the whole field  just all the difference answered greyson between pooh bah as chancellor of the exchequer or lord high admiral or chief executioner whichever he preferred to be and pooh bah as all the officers of state rolled into one  pooh bah may be a very able statesman entitled to exert his legitimate influence  but after all his opinion is only the opinion of one old gentleman with possible prejudices and preconceived convictions  the mikadoor the people according to localitywould like to hear the views of others of his ministers  he finds that the lord chancellor and the lord chief justice and the groom of the bedchamber and the attorneygeneralthe whole entire cabinet in short are unanimously of the same opinion as pooh bah  he doesnt know its only pooh bah speaking from different corners of the stage  the consensus of opinion convinces him  one statesman however eminent might err in judgment  but half a score of statesmen all of one mind one must accept their verdict  mary smiled  but why shouldnt the good newspaper proprietor hurry up and become a multiproprietor she suggested  why dont you persuade lord sutcliffe to buy up three or four papers before theyre all gone  because i dont want the devil to get hold of him answered greyson  youve got to face this unalterable law he continued  that power derived from worldly sources can only be employed for worldly purposes the power conferred by popularity by wealth by that ability to make use of other men that we term organizationsooner or later the man who wields that power becomes the devils servant  so long as kingship was merely a force struggling against anarchy it was a holy weapon  as it grew in power so it degenerated into an instrument of tyranny  the church so long as it remained a scattered body of meek lowly men did the lords work  enthroned at rome it thundered its edicts against human thought  the press is in danger of following precisely the same history  when it wrote in fear of the pillory and of the jail it fought for liberty  now it has become the fourth estate it fawnsas jack swinton said of itat the feet of mammon  my proprietor good fellow allows me to cultivate my plot amid the wilderness for other purposes than those of quick returns  if he were to become a competitor with the carletons and the bloomfields he would have to look upon it as a business proposition  the devil would take him up on to the high mountain and point out to him the kingdom of huge circulations and vast profits whispering to him all this will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me  i dont want the dear good fellow to be tempted  is it impossible then to combine duty and success questioned joan  the combination sometimes happens by chance admitted greyson  but its dangerous to seek it  it is so easy to persuade ourselves that its our duty to succeed  but we must succeed to be of use urged mary  must gods servants always remain powerless  powerless to rule  powerful only to serve he answered  powerful as christ was powerful not as caesar was powerfulpowerful as those who have suffered and have failed leaders of forlorn hopespowerful as those who have struggled on despised and vilified not as those of whom all men speak wellpowerful as those who have fought lone battles and have died not knowing their own victory  it is those that serve not those that rule shall conquer  joan had never known him quite so serious  generally there was a touch of irony in his talk a suggestion of aloofness that had often irritated her  i wish you would always be yourself as you are now she said and never pose  do i pose he asked raising his eyebrows  that shows how far it has gone she told him that you dont even know it  you pretend to be a philosopher  but youre really a man  he laughed  it isnt always a pose he explained  its some mens way of saying thy will be done  ask phillips to come and see me he said  i can be of more help if i know exactly his views  he walked with her to the bus  they passed a corner house that he had more than once pointed out to her  it had belonged years ago to a well known artist who had worked out a wonderful scheme of decoration in the drawingroom  a board was up announcing that the house was for sale  a gas lamp exactly opposite threw a flood of light upon the huge white lettering  joan stopped  why its the house you are always talking about she said  are you thinking of taking it  i did go over it he answered  but it would be rather absurd for just mary and me  she looked up phillips at the house and gave him greysons message  he had just returned from folkestone and was worried  she was so much better last week he explained  but it never lasts  poor old girl he added  i believe shed have been happier if id always remained plain bob phillips  joan had promised to go down on the friday but finding on the thursday morning that it would be difficult decided to run down that afternoon instead  she thought at first of sending a wire  but in mrs phillipss state of health telegrams were perhaps to be avoided  it could make no difference  the front door of the little house was standing half open she called down the kitchen stairs to the landlady but received no answer  the woman had probably run out on some short errand  she went up the stairs softly  the bedroom door she knew would be open  mrs phillips had a feeling against being shut off as she called it  she meant to tap lightly and walk straight in as usual  but what she saw through the opening caused her to pause  mrs phillips was sitting up in bed with her box of cosmetics in front of her  she was sensitive of anyone seeing her makeup and joan knowing this drew back a step  but for some reason she couldnt help watching  mrs phillips dipped a brush into one of the compartments and then remained with it in her hand as if hesitating  suddenly she stuck out her tongue and passed the brush over it  at least so it seemed to joan  it was only a side view of mrs phillipss face that she was obtaining and she may have been mistaken  it might have been the lips  the woman gave a little gasp and sat still for a moment  then putting away the brush she closed the box and slipped it under the pillow  joan felt her knees trembling  a cold creeping fear was taking possession of her  why she could not understand  she must have been mistaken  people dont makeup their tongues  it must have been the lips  and even if notif the woman had licked the brush  it was a silly trick people do  perhaps she liked the taste  she pulled herself together and tapped at the door  mrs phillips gave a little start at seeing her but was glad that she had come  phillips had not been down for two days and she had been feeling lonesome  she persisted in talking more than joan felt was good for her  she was feeling so much better she explained  joan was relieved when the nurse came back from her walk and insisted on her lying down  she dropped to sleep while joan and the nurse were having their tea  joan went back by the early train  she met some people at the station that she knew and travelled up with them  that picture of mrs phillipss tongue just showing beyond the line of mrs phillipss cheek remained at the back of her mind but it was not until she was alone in her own rooms that she dared let her thoughts return to it  the suggestion that was forcing itself into her brain was monstrousunthinkable  that never possessed of any surplus vitality and suffering from the added lassitude of illness the woman should have become indifferentwilling to let a life that to her was full of fears and difficulties slip peacefully away from her that was possible  but that she should exercise thought and ingenuitythat she should have reasoned the thing out and deliberately laid her plans calculating at every point on their success it was inconceivable  besides what could have put the idea into her head  it was laughable the presumption that she was a finished actress capable of deceiving everyone about her  if she had had an inkling of the truth joan with every nerve on the alert almost hoping for it would have detected it she had talked with her alone the day before she had left england and the woman had been full of hopes and projects for the future  that picture of mrs phillips propped up against the pillows with her makeup box upon her knees was still before her when she went to bed  all night long it haunted her whether thinking or dreaming of it she could not tell  suddenly she sat up with a stifled cry  it seemed as if a flash of light had been turned upon her almost blinding her  hilda  why had she never thought of it  the whole thing was so obvious you ought not to think about yourself  you ought to think only of him and of his work  nothing else matters  if she could say that to joan what might she not have said to her mother who so clearly she divined to be the incubusthe drag upon her fathers career  she could hear the childs dry passionate tonescould see mrs phillipss flabby cheeks grow whitethe frightened staring eyes  where her father was concerned the child had neither conscience nor compassion  she had waited her time  it was a few days after hildas return to school that mrs phillips had been first taken ill  she flung herself from the bed and drew the blind  a chill grey light penetrated the room  it was a little before five  she would go round to phillips wake him up  he must be told  with her hat in her hands she paused  no  that would not do  phillips must never know  they must keep the secret to themselves  she would go down and see the woman reason with her insist  she went into the other room  it was lighter there  the abc was standing in its usual place upon her desk  there was a train to folkestone at sixfifteen  she had plenty of time  it would be wise to have a cup of tea and something to eat  there would be no sense in arriving there with a headache  she would want her brain clear  it was halfpast five when she sat down with her tea in front of her  it was only ten minutes walk to charing crosssay a quarter of an hour she might pick up a cab  she grew calmer as she ate and drank  her reason seemed to be returning to her  there was no such violent hurry hadnt she better think things over in the clear daylight  the woman had been ill now for nearly six weeks a few hoursa day or twocould make no difference  it might alarm the poor creature her unexpected appearance at such an unusual hourcause a relapse  suppose she had been mistaken  hadnt she better make a few inquiries firstfeel her way  one did harm more often than good acting on impulse  after all had she the right to interfere  oughtnt the thing to be thought over as a whole  mightnt there be arguments worth considering against her interference  her brain was too much in a whirl  hadnt she better wait till she could collect and arrange her thoughts  the silver clock upon her desk struck six  it had been a gift from her father when she was at girton  it never obtruded  its voice was a faint musical chime that she need not hear unless she cared to listen  she turned and looked at it  it seemed to be a little face looking back at her out of its two round blinkless eyes  for the first time during all the years that it had watched beside her she heard its quick impatient tick  she sat motionless staring at it  the problem in some way had simplified itself into a contest between herself demanding time to think and the little insistent clock shouting to her to act upon blind impulse  if she could remain motionless for another five minutes she would have won  the ticking of the little clock was filling the room  the thing seemed to have become aliveto be threatening to burst its heart  but the thin delicate indicator moved on  suddenly its ticking ceased  it had become again a piece of lifeless mechanism  the hands pointed to six minutes past  joan took off her hat and laid it aside  she must think the whole thing over quietly     chapter xiv   she could help him  without her he would fail  the woman herself saw that and wished it  why should she hesitate  it was not as if she had only herself to consider  the fatethe happiness of millions was at stake  he looked to her for aidfor guidance  it must have been intended  all roads had led to it  her going to the house  she remembered now it was the first door at which she had knocked  her footsteps had surely been directed  her meeting with mrs phillips in madges rooms and that invitation to dinner coinciding with that crisis in his life  it was she who had persuaded him to accept  but for her he would have doubted wavered let his opportunities slip by  he had confessed it to her  and she had promised him  he needed her  the words she had spoken to madge not dreaming then of their swift application  they came back to her  god has called me  he girded his sword upon me  what right had she to leave it rusting in its scabbard turning aside from the pathway pointed out to her because of one weak useless life crouching in her way  it was not as if she were being asked to do evil herself that good might come  the decision had been taken out of her hands  all she had to do was to remain quiescent not interfering awaiting her orders  her business was with her own part not with anothers  to be willing to sacrifice oneself that was at the root of all service  sometimes it was ones own duty sometimes that of another  must one never go forward because another steps out of ones way voluntarily  besides she might have been mistaken  that picture ever before her of the woman pausing with the brush above her tonguethat little stilled gasp  it may have been but a phantasm born of her own fevered imagination  she clung to that desperately  it was the task that had been entrusted to her  how could he hope to succeed without her  with her he would be all powerfulaccomplish the end for which he had been sent into the world  society counts for so much in england  what public man had ever won through without its assistance  as greyson had said it is the dinnertable that rules  she could win it over to his side  that mission to paris that she had undertaken for mrs denton that had brought her into contact with diplomatists politicians the leaders and the rulers the bearers of names known and honoured in history  they had accepted her as one of themselves  she had influenced them swayed them  that afternoon at folks studio where all eyes had followed her where famous men and women had waited to attract her notice had hung upon her words  even at school at college she had always commanded willing homage  as greyson had once told her it was herselfher personality that was her greatest asset  was it to be utterly wasted  there were hundreds of impersonal sexless women equipped for nothing else with pens as keen if not keener than hers  that was not the talent with which she had been entrustedfor which she would have to account  it was her beauty her power to charm to draw after herto compel by the mere exercise of her will  hitherto beauty had been content to barter itself for mere coin of the realmfor ease and luxury and pleasure  she only asked to be allowed to spend it in service  as his wife she could use it to fine ends  by herself she was helpless  one must take the world as one finds it  it gives the unmated woman no opportunity to employ the special gifts with which god has endowed herexcept for evil  as the wife of a rising statesman she could be a force for progress  she could become another madame roland gather round her all that was best of english social life give back to it its lost position in the vanguard of thought  she could strengthen him give him courage  without her he would always remain the mere fighter doubtful of himself  the confidence the inspiration necessary for leadership she alone could bring to him  each by themselves was incomplete  together they would be the whole  they would build the city of their dreams  she seemed to have become a wandering spirit rather than a living being she had no sense of time or place  once she had started hearing herself laugh  she was seated at a table and was talking  and then she had passed back into forgetfulness  now from somewhere she was gazing downward  roofs domes and towers lay stretched before her emerging from a sea of shadows  she held out her arms towards them and the tears came to her eyes  the poor tired people were calling to her to join with him to help them  should she fail themturn deaf ears to the myriad because of pity for one useless feeble life  she had been fashioned to be his helpmate as surely as if she had been made of the same bone  nature was at one with god  spirit and body both yearned for him  it was not positionpower for herself that she craved the marriage marketif that had been her desire it had always been open to her  she had the gold that buys these things  wealth ambition they had been offered to herspread out temptingly before her eyes  they were always within her means if ever she chose to purchase them  it was this man alone to whom she had ever felt drawnthis man of the people with that suggestion about him of something primitive untamed causing her always in his presence that faint compelling thrill of fear who stirred her blood as none of the polished men of her own class had ever done  his kind strong ugly face it moved beside her its fearless tender eyes now pleading now commanding  he needed her  she heard his passionate low voice as she had heard it in the little garden above meudon because you wont be there and without you i can do nothing  what right had this poor wornout shadow to stand between them to the end  had love and life no claims but only weakness  she had taken all had given nothing  it was but reparation she was making  why stop her  she was alone in a maze of narrow silent streets that ended always in a high blank wall  it seemed impossible to get away from this blank wall whatever way she turned she was always coming back to it  what was she to do  drag the woman back to life against her willlead her back to him to be a chain about his feet until the end  then leave him to fight the battle alone  and herself  all her world had been watching and would know  she had counted her chickens before they were dead  she had set her cap at the man reckoning him already widowed and his wife had come to life and snatched it from her head  she could hear the laughterthe half amused half contemptuous pity for her rotten bad luck  she would be their standing jest till she was forgotten  what would life leave to her  a lonely lodging and a pot of ink that she would come to hate the smell of  she could never marry  it would be but her body that she could give to any other man  not even for the sake of her dreams could she bring herself to that  it might have been possible before but not now  she could have won the victory over herself but for hope that had kindled the smouldering embers of her passion into flame  what cunning devil had flung open this door showing her all her hearts desire merely that she should be called upon to slam it to in her own face  a fierce anger blazed up in her brain  why should she listen  why had reason been given to us if we were not to use itweigh good and evil in the balance and decide for ourselves where lay the nobler gain  were we to be led hither and thither like blind children  what was rightwhat wrong but what our own godgiven judgment told us  was it wrong of the woman to perform this act of selfrenunciation yielding up all things to love  no it was greatheroic of her  it would be her cross of victory her crown  if the gift were noble so also it could not be ignoble to accept it  to reject it would be to dishonour it  she would accept it  the wonder of it should cast out her doubts and fears  she would seek to make herself worthy of it  consecrate it with her steadfastness her devotion  she thought it ended  but yet she sat there motionless  what was plucking at her sleevestill holding her  unknowing she had entered a small garden  it formed a passage between two streets and was left open day and night  it was but a narrow strip of rank grass and withered shrubs with an asphalte pathway widening to a circle in the centre where stood a gas lamp and two seats facing one another  and suddenly it came to her that this was her garden of gethsemane and a dull laugh broke from her that she could not help  it was such a ridiculous apology for gethsemane  there was not a corner in which one could possibly pray  only these two iron seats one each side of the gaunt gas lamp that glared down upon them  even the withered shrubs were fenced off behind a railing  a ragged figure sprawled upon the bench opposite to her  it snored gently and its breath came laden with the odour of cheap whisky  but it was her gethsemane the best that fate had been able to do for her  it was here that her choice would be made  she felt that  and there rose before her the vision of that other garden of gethsemane with below it the soft lights of the city shining through the trees and above clear against the starlit sky the cold dark cross  it was only a little cross hers by comparison  she could see that they seemed to be standing side by side  but then she was only a womanlittle more than a girl  and her courage was so small  she thought he ought to know that  for her it was quite a big cross  she wondered if he had been listening to all her arguments  there was really a good deal of sense in some of them  perhaps he would understand  not all his prayer had come down to us  he too had put up a fight for life  he too was young  for him also life must have seemed but just beginning  perhaps he too had felt that his duty still lay among the peopleteaching guiding healing them  to him too life must have been sweet with its noble work its loving comradeship  even from him the words had to be wrung thy will not mine be done  she whispered them at last  not bravely at all  feebly haltingly with a little sob her forehead pressed against the cold iron seat as if that could help her  she thought that even then god might reconsider itsee her point of view  perhaps he would send her a sign  the ragged figure on the bench opposite opened its eyes stared at her then went to sleep again  a prowling cat paused to rub itself against her foot but meeting no response passed on  through an open window somewhere near filtered the sound of a childs low whimpering  it was daylight when she awoke  she was cold and her limbs ached  slowly her senses came back to her  the seat opposite was vacant  the gas lamp showed but a faint blue point of flame  her dress was torn her boots soiled and muddy  strands of her hair had escaped from underneath her hat  she looked at her watch  fortunately it was still early  she would be able to let herself in before anyone was up  it was but a little way she wondered while rearranging her hair what day it was  she would find out when she got home from the newspaper  in the street she paused a moment and looked back through the railings it seemed even still more sordid in the daylight the sooty grass and the withered shrubs and the asphalte pathway strewn with dirty paper  and again a laugh she could not help broke from her  her garden of gethsemane  she sent a brief letter round to phillips and a telegram to the nurse preparing them for what she meant to do  she had just time to pack a small trunk and catch the morning train  at folkestone she drove first to a house where she herself had once lodged and fixed things to her satisfaction  the nurse was waiting for her in the downstairs room and opened the door to her  she was opposed to joans interference  but joan had come prepared for that  let me have a talk with her she said  i think ive found out what it is that is causing all the trouble  the nurse shot her a swift glance  im glad of that she said dryly she let joan go upstairs  mrs phillips was asleep  joan seated herself beside the bed and waited she had not yet made herself up for the day and the dyed hair was hidden beneath a white closefitting cap  the pale thin face with its closed eyes looked strangely young  suddenly the thin hands clasped and her lips moved as if she were praying in her sleep  perhaps she also was dreaming of gethsemane  it must be quite a crowded garden if only we could see it  after a while her eyes opened  joan drew her chair nearer and slipped her arm in under her and their eyes met  youre not playing the game whispered joan shaking her head  i only promised on condition that you would try to get well  the woman made no attempt to deny  something told her that joan had learned her secret  she glanced towards the door  joan had closed it  dont drag me back she whispered  its all finished  she raised herself up and put her arms about joans neck  it was hard at first and i hated you  and then it came to me that this was what i had been wanting to do all my lifesomething to help him that nobody else could do  dont take it from me  i know whispered joan  ive been there too  i knew you were doing it though i didnt quite know howtill the other day  i wouldnt think  i wanted to pretend that i didnt  i know all you can say  ive been listening to it  it was right of you to want to give it all up to me for his sake  but it would be wrong of me to take it  i dont quite see why  i cant explain it  but i mustnt  so you see it would be no good  but im so useless pleaded the woman  i said that answered joan  i wanted to do it and i talked and talked so hard  i said everything i could think of  but that was the only answer i mustnt do it  they remained for a while with their arms round one another  it struck joan as curious even at the time that all feeling of superiority had gone out of her  they might have been two puzzled children that had met one another on a path that neither knew  but joan was the stronger character  i want you to give me up that box she said and to come away with me where i can be with you and take care of you until you are well  mrs phillips made yet another effort  have you thought about him she asked  joan answered with a faint smile  oh yes she said  i didnt forget that argument in case it hadnt occurred to the lord  perhaps she added the helpmate theory was intended to apply only to our bodies  there was nothing said about our souls  perhaps god doesnt have to work in pairs  perhaps we were meant to stand alone  mrs phillipss thin hands were playing nervously with the bed clothes there still seemed something that she had to say  as if joan hadnt thought of everything  her eyes were fixed upon the narrow strip of light between the window curtains  you dont think you could dear she whispered if i didnt do anything wicked any more  but just let things take their course  you see dear she went on her face still turned away i thought it all finished  it will be hard for me to go back to him knowing as i do now that he doesnt want me  i shall always feel that i am in his way and hilda she added after a pause she will hate me  joan looked at the white patient face and was silent  what would be the use of senseless contradiction  the woman knew  it would only seem an added stab of mockery  she knelt beside the bed and took the thin hands in hers  i think god must want you very badly she said or he wouldnt have laid so heavy a cross upon you  you will come  the woman did not answer in words  the big tears were rolling down her cheeks  there was no paint to mingle with and mar them  she drew the little metal box from under the pillow and gave it into joans hands  joan crept out softly from the room  the nurse was standing by the window  she turned sharply on joans entrance  joan slipped the box into her hands  the nurse raised the lid  what a fool ive been she said  i never thought of that  she held out a large strong hand and gave joan a longish grip  youre right she said we must get her out of this house at once  forgive me  phillips had been called up north and wired that he would not be able to get down till the wednesday evening  joan met him at the station  she wont be expecting you just yet she explained  we might have a little walk  she waited till they had reached a quiet road leading to the hills  you will find her changed she said  mentally i mean  though she will try not to show it  she was dying for your saketo set you free hilda seems to have had a talk with her and to have spared her no part of the truth  her great love for you made the sacrifice possible and even welcome  it was the one gift she had in her hands  she was giving it gladly proudly  so far as she was concerned it would have been kinder to let her make an end of it  but during the last few days i have come to the conclusion there is a law within us that we may not argue with she is coming back to life knowing you no longer want her that she is only in the way  perhaps you may be able to think of something to say or do that will lessen her martyrdom  i cant  they had paused where a group of trees threw a blot of shadow across the moonlit road  you mean she was killing herself he asked  quite cleverly  so as to avoid all danger of after discovery that might have hurt us she answered  they walked in silence and coming to a road that led back into the town he turned down it  she had the feeling she was following him without his knowing it  a cab was standing outside the gate of a house having just discharged its fare  he seemed to have suddenly recollected her  do you mind he said  we shall get there so much quicker  you go she said  ill stroll on quietly  youre sure he said  i would rather she answered  it struck her that he was relieved  he gave the man the address speaking hurriedly and jumped in  she had gone on  she heard the closing of the door behind her and the next moment the cab passed her  she did not see him again that night  they met in the morning at breakfast  a curious strangeness to each other seemed to have grown up between them as if they had known one another long ago and had half forgotten  when they had finished she rose to leave but he asked her to stop and after the table had been cleared he walked up and down the room while she sat sideways on the window seat from where she could watch the little ships moving to and fro across the horizon like painted figures in a show  i had a long talk with nan last night he said  and trying to explain it to her i came a little nearer to understanding it myself  my love for you would have been strong enough to ruin both of us  i see that now  it would have dominated every other thought in me  it would have swallowed up my dreams  it would have been blind unscrupulous married to you i should have aimed only at success  it would not have been your fault  you would not have known  about mere birth i should never have troubled myself  ive met daughters of a hundred earlsmore or less clever jolly little women i could have chucked under the chin and have been chummy with  nature creates her own ranks and puts her ban upon misalliances  every time i took you in my arms i should have felt that you had stepped down from your proper order to mate yourself with me and that it was up to me to make the sacrifice good to you by giving you powerposition  already within the last few weeks when it looked as if this thing was going to be possible i have been thinking against my will of a compromise with carleton that would give me his support  this coming election was beginning to have terrors for me that i have never before felt  the thought of defeathaving to go back to comparative poverty to comparative obscurity with you as my wife was growing into a nightmare  i should have wanted wealth fame victory for your saketo see you honoured courted envied finely dressed and finely housedgrateful to me for having won for you these things  it wasnt honest healthy lovethe love that unites that makes a man willing to take as well as to give that i felt for you it was worship that separates a man from a woman that puts fear between them  it isnt good that man should worship a woman  he cant serve god and woman their interests are liable to clash  nans my helpmatejust a loving woman that the lord brought to me and gave me when i was alonethat i still love  i didnt know it till last night  she will never stand in my way  i havent to put her against my duty  she will leave me free to obey the voice that calls to me  and no man can hear that voice but himself  he had been speaking in a clear selfconfident tone as if at last he saw his road before him to the end and felt that nothing else mattered but that he should go forward hopefully unfalteringly  now he paused and his eyes wandered  but the lines about his strong mouth deepened  perhaps i am not of the stuff that conquerors are made he went on perhaps if i were i should be thinking differently  it comes to me sometimes that i may be one of those intended only to prepare the waythat for me there may be only the endless struggle  i may have to face unpopularity abuse failure  she wont mind  nor would you he added turning to her suddenly for the first time i know that  but i should be afraidfor you  she had listened to him without interrupting and even now she did not speak for a while  it was hard not to  she wanted to tell him that he was all wrongat least so far as she was concerned  it was not the conqueror she loved in him it was the fighter  not in the hour of triumph but in the hour of despair she would have yearned to put her arms about him unpopularity abuse failure it was against the fear of such that she would have guarded him  yes she had dreamed of leadership influence command  but it was the leadership of the valiant few against the hosts of the oppressors that she claimed  wealth honours  would she have given up a life of ease shut herself off from society if these had been her standards  mesalliance  had the male animal no instinct telling it when it was loved with all a womans being so that any other union would be her degradation  it was better for him he should think as he did  she rose and held out her hand  i will stay with her for a little while she said  till i feel there is no more need  then i must get back to work  he looked into her eyes holding her hand and she felt his body trembling  she knew he was about to speak and held up a warning hand  thats all my lad she said with a smile  my love to you and god speed you  mrs phillips progressed slowly but steadily  life was returning to her but it was not the same  out of those days there had come to her a gentle dignity a strengthening and refining  the face now pale and drawn had lost its foolishness  under the thin white hair and in spite of its deep lines it had grown younger  a great patience a child like thoughtfulness had come into the quiet eyes  she was sitting by the window her hands folded  joan had been reading to her and the chapter finished she had closed the book and her thoughts had been wandering  mrs phillipss voice recalled them  do you remember that day my dear she said when we went furnishing together  and i would have all the wrong things  and you let me  yes answered joan with a laugh  they were pretty awful some of them  i was just wondering she went on  it was a pity wasnt it  i was silly and began to cry  i expect that was it joan confessed  it interferes with our reason at times  it was only a little thing of course that she answered  but ive been thinking it must be that thats at the bottom of it all and that is why god lets there be weak thingschildren and little animals and men and women in pain that we feel sorry for so that people like you and robert and so many others are willing to give up all your lives to helping them  and that is what he wants  perhaps god cannot help there being weak things answered joan perhaps he too is sorry for them  it comes to the same thing doesnt it dear she answered  they are there anyhow  and that is how he knows those who are willing to serve him by their being pitiful  they fell into a silence  joan found herself dreaming  yes it was true  it must have been the beginning of all things  man pitiless deaf blind groping in the darkness knowing not even himself and to her vision far off out of the mist he shaped himself before her that dim first standardbearer of the lord the man who first felt pity  savage brutish dumblonely there amid the desolation staring down at some hurt creature man or beast it mattered not his dull eyes troubled with a strange new pain he understood not  and suddenly as he stooped there must have come a great light into his eyes  man had heard gods voice across the deep and had made answer     chapter xv   the years that followedtill like some shipwrecked swimmer to whom returning light reveals the land she felt new life and hopes come back to heralways remained in her memory vague confused a jumble of events thoughts feelings without sequence or connection  she had gone down to liverpool intending to persuade her father to leave the control of the works to arthur and to come and live with her in london but had left without broaching the subject  there were nights when she would trapse the streets till she would almost fall exhausted rather than face the solitude awaiting her in her own rooms  but so also there were moods when like some stricken animal her instinct was to shun all living things  at such times his presence for all his loving patience would have been as a knife in her wound  besides he would always be there when escape from herself for a while became an absolute necessity  more and more she had come to regard him as her comforter not from anything he ever said or did  rather it seemed to her because that with him she felt no need of words  the works since arthur had shared the management had gradually been regaining their position and he had urged her to let him increase her allowance  it will give you greater freedom he had suggested with fine assumption of propounding a mere business proposition enabling you to choose your work entirely for its own sake  i have always wanted to take a hand in helping things on  it will come to just the same your doing it for me  she had suppressed a smile and had accepted  thanks dad she had answered  it will be nice having you as my backer  her admiration of the independent woman had undergone some modification since she had come in contact with her  woman was intended to be dependent upon man  it was the part appointed to him in the social scheme  woman had hers no less important  earning her own living did not improve her  it was one of the drawbacks of civilization that so many had to do it of necessity  it developed her on the wrong linesagainst her nature  this cry of the unsexed that woman must always be the paid servant instead of the helper of manpaid for being mother paid for being wife  why not carry it to its logical conclusion and insist that she should be paid for her embraces  that she should share in mans labour in his hopes that was the true comradeship  what mattered it who held the pursestrings  her room was always kept ready for her  often she would lie there watching the moonlight creep across the floor and a curious feeling would come to her of being something wandering incomplete  she would see as through a mist the passionate restless child with the rebellious eyes to whom the room had once belonged and later the strangely self possessed girl with that impalpable veil of mystery around her who would stand with folded hands there by the window seeming always to be listening  and she too had passed away  the tears would come into her eyes and she would stretch out yearning arms towards their shadowy forms  but they would only turn upon her eyes that saw not and would fade away  in the daytime when arthur and her father were at the works she would move through the high square stifflyfurnished rooms or about the great formal garden with its ordered walks and level lawns  and as with knowledge we come to love some old stern face our childish eyes had thought forbidding and would not have it changed there came to her with the years a growing fondness for the old plain brickbuilt house generations of allways had lived and died there men and women somewhat narrow unsympathetic a little hard of understanding but at least earnest sincere seeking to do their duty in their solid unimaginative way  perhaps there were other ways besides those of speech and pen perhaps one did better keeping to ones own people the very qualities that separated us from them being intended for their need  what mattered the colours so that one followed the flag  somewhere all roads would meet  arthur had to be in london generally once or twice a month and it came to be accepted that he should always call upon her and take her out she had lost the selfsufficiency that had made roaming about london by herself a pleasurable adventure and a newlyborn fear of what people were saying and thinking about her made her shy even of the few friends she still clung to so that his visits grew to be of the nature of childish treats to which she found herself looking forwardcounting the days  also she came to be dependent upon him for the keeping alight within her of that little kindly fire of selfconceit at which we warm our hands in wintry days  it is not good that a young woman should remain for long a stranger to her mirrorabove her frocks indifferent to the angle of her hat  she had met the women superior to feminine vanities  handsome enough some of them must once have been now sunk in slovenliness uncleanliness in disrespect to womanhood  it would not be fair to him  the worshipper has his rights  the goddess must remember always that she is a goddessmust pull herself together and behave as such appearing upon her pedestal becomingly attired seeing to it that in all things she is at her best not allowing private grief to render her neglectful of this duty  she had not told him of the phillips episode  but she felt instinctively that he knew  it was always a little mysterious to her his perception in matters pertaining to herself  i want your love she said to him one day  it helps me  i used to think it was selfish of me to take it knowing i could never return itnot that love  but i no longer feel that now  your love seems to me a fountain from which i can drink without hurting you  i should love to be with you always he answered if you wished it you wont forget your promise  she remembered it then  no she answered with a smile  i shall keep watch  perhaps i shall be worthy of it by that time  she had lost her faith in journalism as a drum for the rousing of the people against wrong  its beat had led too often to the tricksters booth to the cheapjacks rostrum  it had lost its rallying power  the popular press had made the newspaper a byword for falsehood  even its supporters while reading it because it pandered to their passions tickled their vices and flattered their ignorance despised and disbelieved it  here and there an honest journal advocated a reform pleaded for the sweeping away of an injustice  the public shrugged its shoulders  another newspaper stunt  a bid for popularity for notoriety with its consequent financial kudos  she still continued to write for greyson but felt she was labouring for the doomed  lord sutcliffe had died suddenly and his holding in the evening gazette had passed to his nephew a gentleman more interested in big game shooting than in politics  greysons support of phillips had brought him within the net of carletons operations and negotiations for purchase had already been commenced  she knew that sooner or later greyson would be offered the alternative of either changing his opinions or of going  and she knew that he would go  her work for mrs denton was less likely to be interfered with  it appealed only to the few and aimed at informing and explaining rather than directly converting  useful enough work in its way no doubt but to put heart into it seemed to require longer views than is given to the eyes of youth  besides her pen was no longer able to absorb her attention to keep her mind from wandering  the solitude of her desk gave her the feeling of a prison  her body made perpetual claims upon her as though it were some restless fretful child dragging her out into the streets without knowing where it wanted to go discontented with everything it did then hurrying her back to fling itself upon a chair weary but still dissatisfied  if only she could do something  she was sick of thinking  these physical activities into which women were throwing themselves where one used ones body as well as ones brainhastened to appointments gathered round noisy tables met fellow human beings argued with them walked with them laughing and talking forced ones way through crowds cheered shouted stood up on platforms before a sea of faces roused applause filling and emptying ones lungs met interruptions with swift flash of wit or anger faced opposition dangerfelt ones blood surging through ones veins felt ones nerves quivering with excitement felt the delirious thrill of passion felt the mad joy of the loosened animal  she threw herself into the suffrage movement  it satisfied her for a while  she had the rare gift of public speaking and enjoyed her triumphs  she was temperate reasonable persuasive rather than aggressive feeling her audience as she went never losing touch with them  she had the magnetism that comes of sympathy  medical students who came intending to tell her to go home and mind the baby remained to wonder if man really was the undoubted sovereign of the world born to look upon woman as his willing subject to wonder whether under some unwritten whispered law it might not be the other way about  perhaps she had the rightwith or without the babyto move about the kingdom express her wishes for its care and management  possibly his doubts may not have been brought about solely by the force and logic of her arguments  possibly the voice of nature is not altogether out of place in discussions upon humanitys affairs  she wanted votes for women  but she wanted them cleanwon without dishonour  these monkey tricksthis apish fury and impatience suppose it did hasten by a few months more or less the coming of the inevitable  suppose by unlawful methods one could succeed in dragging a reform a little prematurely from the womb of time did not one endanger the childs health  of what value was womans influence on public affairs going to be if she was to boast that she had won the right to exercise it by unscrupulousness and brutality  they were to be found at every corner the reformers who could not reform themselves  the believers in universal brotherhood who hated half the people  the denouncers of tyranny demanding lampposts for their opponents  the bloodthirsty preachers of peace  the moralists who had persuaded themselves that every wrong was justified provided one were fighting for the right  the deaf shouters for justice  the excellent intentioned men and women labouring for reforms that could only be hoped for when greed and prejudice had yielded place to reason and who sought to bring about their ends by appeals to passion and selfinterest  and the insincere the selfseekers the selfadvertisers  those who were in the business for even coarser profit  the limelight lovers who would always say and do the clever the unexpected thing rather than the useful and the helpful thing to whom paradox was more than principle  ought there not to be a school for reformers a training college where could be inculcated selfexamination patience temperance subordination to duty with lectures on the fundamental laws within which all progress must be accomplished outside which lay confusion and explosions with lectures on history showing how improvements had been brought about and how failure had been invited thus avoiding much waste of reforming zeal with lectures on the properties and tendencies of human nature forbidding the attempt to treat it as a sum in rule of three  there were the others  the men and women not in the limelight  the lone scattered men and women who saw no flag but pitys ragged skirt who heard no drum but the worlds low cry of pain who fought with feeble hands against the wrong around them who with aching heart and troubled eyes laboured to make kinder the little space about them  the great army of the nameless reformers uncheered unparagraphed unhonoured  the unknown sowers of the seed  would the reapers of the harvest remember them  beyond giving up her visits to the house she had made no attempt to avoid meeting phillips and at public functions and at mutual friends they sometimes found themselves near to one another  it surprised her that she could see him talk to him and even be alone with him without its troubling her  he seemed to belong to a part of her that lay dead and buriedsomething belonging to her that she had thrust away with her own hands that she knew would never come back to her  she was still interested in his work and keen to help him  it was going to be a stiff fight  he himself in spite of carletons opposition had been returned with an increased majority but the party as a whole had suffered loss especially in the counties  the struggle centred round the agricultural labourer  if he could be won over the government would go ahead with phillipss scheme  otherwise there was danger of its being shelved  the difficulty was the old problem of how to get at the men of the scattered villages the lonely cottages  the only papers that they ever saw were those chiefly of the carleton group that the farmers and the gentry took care should come within their reach that were handed to them at the end of their days work as a kindly gift given to the school children to take home with them supplied in ample numbers to all the little inns and publichouses  in all these phillips was held up as their arch enemy his proposal explained as a device to lower their wages decrease their chances of employment and rob them of the produce of their gardens and allotments  no arguments were used  a daily stream of abuse misrepresentation and deliberate lies set forth under flaming headlines served their simple purpose  the one weekly paper that had got itself established among them that their fathers had always taken that dimly they had come to look upon as their one friend carleton had at last succeeded in purchasing  when that too pictured phillipss plan as a diabolical intent to take from them even the little that they had and give it to the loafing socialist and the bloated foreigner no room for doubt was left to them  he had organized volunteer cycle companies of speakers from the towns young workingmen and women and students to go out on summer evenings and hold meetings on the village greens  they were winning their way but it was slow work  and carleton was countering their efforts by a hired opposition that followed them from place to place and whose interruptions were made use of to represent the whole campaign as a fiasco  hes clever laughed phillips  id enjoy the fight if id only myself to think of and life wasnt so short  the laugh died away and a shadow fell upon his face  if i could get a few of the big landlords to come in on my side he continued it would make all the difference in the world  theyre sensible men some of them and the whole thing could be carried out without injury to any legitimate interest  i could make them see that if i could only get them quietly into a corner  but theyre frightened of me he added with a shrug of his broad shoulders and i dont seem to know how to tackle them  those drawingrooms  might not something of the sort be possible  not perhaps the sumptuous salon of her imagination thronged with the fair and famous suitably attired  something perhaps more homely more immediately attainable  some of the women dressed perhaps a little dowdily not all of them young and beautiful  the men wise perhaps rather than persistently witty a few of them prosy maybe a trifle ponderous but solid and influential  mrs dentons great empty house in gower street  a central situation and near to the tube  lords and ladies had once ruffled there trod a measure on its spacious floors filled its echoing stone hall with their greetings and their partings the gaping sconces where their linkboys had extinguished their torches still capped its grim iron railings  seated in the great sombre library joan hazarded the suggestion  mrs denton might almost have been waiting for it  it would be quite easy  a little opening of long fastened windows a lighting of chill grates a little mending of motheaten curtains a sweeping away of longgathered dust and cobwebs  mrs denton knew just the right people  they might be induced to bring their sons and daughtersit might be their grandchildren youth being there to welcome them  for joan of course would play her part  the lonely woman touched her lightly on the hand  there shot a pleading look from the old stern eyes  you will have to imagine yourself my daughter she said  you are taller but the colouring was the same  you wont mind will you  the right people did come mrs denton being a personage that a landed gentry rendered jumpy by the perpetual explosion of new ideas under their very feet and casting about eagerly for friends could not afford to snub  a kindly simple folk quite intelligent some of them as phillips had surmised  mrs denton made no mystery of why she had invited them  why should all questions be left to the politicians and the journalists  why should not the people interested take a hand meet and talk over these little matters with quiet voices and attentive ears amid surroundings where the unwritten law would restrain ladies and gentlemen from addressing other ladies and gentlemen as bloodsuckers or anarchists as grinders of the faces of the poor or as oilytongued rogues arguments not really conducive to mutual understanding and the bridging over of differences  the latest russian dancer the last new musical revue the marvellous things that can happen at golf the curious hands that one picks up at bridge the eternal fox the sacred bird excellent material for ninetenths of our conversation  but the remaining tenth  would it be such excruciatingly bad form for us to be intelligent occasionally say on one or two fridays during the season mrs denton wrapped it up tactfully but that was her daring suggestion  it took them aback at first  there were people who did this sort of thing  people of no class who called themselves names and took up things  but for people of social standing to talk about serious subjectsexcept perhaps in bed to ones wife  it sounded so unenglish  with the elders it was sense of duty that prevailed  that at all events was english  the country must be saved  to their sons and daughters it was the originality the novelty that gradually appealed mrs dentons fridays became a new sensation  it came to be the chic and proper thing to appear at them in shades of mauve or purple  a pushing little woman in hanover street designed the denton bodice with hanging sleeves and squarecut neck  the younger men inclined towards a coat shaped to the waist with a roll collar  joan sighed  it looked as if the word had been passed round to treat the whole thing as a joke  mrs denton took a different view  nothing better could have happened she was of opinion  it means that their hearts are in it  the stone hall was still vibrating to the voices of the last departed guests  joan was seated on a footstool before the fire in front of mrs dentons chair  its the thing that gives me greatest hope she continued  the childishness of men and women  it means that the world is still young still teachable  but theyre so slow at their lessons grumbled joan  one repeats it and repeats it and then when one feels that surely now at least one has drummed it into their heads one finds they have forgotten all that one has ever said  not always forgotten answered mrs denton mislaid it may be for the moment  an indian student the son of an old rajah called on me a little while ago  he was going back to organize a system of education among his people  my father heard you speak when you were over in india he told me  he has always been thinking about it  thirty years ago it must have been that i undertook that mission to india  i had always looked back upon it as one of my many failures  but why leave it to his son argued joan  why couldnt the old man have set about it himself instead of wasting thirty precious years  i should have preferred it myself agreed mrs denton  i remember when i was a very little girl my mother longing for a tree upon the lawn underneath which she could sit  i found an acorn and planted it just in the right spot  i thought i would surprise her  i happened to be in the neighbourhood last summer and i walked over  there was such a nice old lady sitting under it knitting stockings  so you see it wasnt wasted  i wouldnt mind the waiting answered joan if it were not for the sorrow and the suffering that i see all round me  i want to get rid of it right away now  i could be patient for myself but not for others  the little old lady straightened herself  there came a hardening of the thin firm mouth  and those that have gone before she demanded  those that have won the ground from where we are fighting  had they no need of patience  was the cry never wrung from their lips how long oh lord how long  is it for us to lay aside the sword that they bequeath us because we cannot hope any more than they to see the faroff victory  fifty years i have fought and what a few years hence will my closing eyes still see but the banners of the foe still waving fresh armies pouring to his standard  she flung back her head and the grim mouth broke into a smile  but ive won she said  im dying further forward  ive helped advance the line  she put out her hands and drew joan to her  let me think of you she said as taking my place pushing the outposts a little further on  joan did not meet hilda again till the child had grown into a womanpractically speaking  she had always been years older than her age  it was at a reception given in the foreign office  joans dress had been trodden on and torn  she had struggled out of the crowd into an empty room and was examining the damage somewhat ruefully when she heard a voice behind her proffering help  it was a hard cold voice that yet sounded familiar and she turned  there was no forgetting those deep burning eyes though the face had changed  the thin red lips still remained its one touch of colour but the unhealthy whiteness of the skin had given place to a delicate pallor and the features that had been indistinct had shaped themselves in fine firm lines  it was a beautiful arresting face marred only by the sullen callousness of the dark clouded eyes  joan was glad of the assistance  hilda produced pins  i always come prepared to these scrimmages she explained  ive got some hazeline in my bag  they havent kicked you have they  no laughed joan  at least i dont think so  they do sometimes answered hilda if you happen to be in the way near the feeding troughs  if theyd only put all the refreshments into one room one could avoid it  but they will scatter them about so that one never knows for certain whether one is in the danger zone or not  i hate a mob  why do you come asked joan  oh i answered the girl  i go everywhere where theres a chance of picking up a swell husband  theyve got to come to these shows they cant help themselves  one never knows what incident may give one ones opportunity  joan shot a glance  the girl was evidently serious  you think it would prove a useful alliance she suggested  it would help undoubtedly the girl answered  i dont see any other way of getting hold of them  joan seated herself on one of the chairs ranged round the walls and drew the girl down beside her  through the closed door the mingled voices of the foreign secretarys guests sounded curiously like the buzzing of flies  its quite easy said joan with your beauty  especially if youre not going to be particular  but isnt there danger of your devotion to your father leading you too far  a marriage founded on a lieno matter for what purposemustnt it degrade a womansmirch her soul for all time  we have a right to give up the things that belong to ourselves but not the things that belong to god our truth our sincerity our cleanliness of mind and body the things that he may one day want of us it led you into evil once before  dont think im judging you  i was no better than you  i argued just as you must have done  something stopped me just in time  that was the only difference between us  the girl turned her dark eyes full upon joan  what did stop you she demanded  does it matter what we call it answered joan  it was a voice  it told me to do it answered the girl  did no other voice speak to you asked joan  yes answered the girl  the voice of weakness  there came a fierce anger into the dark eyes  why did you listen to it she demanded  all would have been easy if you hadnt  you mean answered joan quietly that if i had let your mother die and had married your father that he and i would have loved each other to the end that i should have helped him and encouraged him in all things so that his success would have been certain  is that the argument  didnt you love him asked the girl staring  wouldnt you have helped him  i cant tell answered joan  i should have meant to  many men and women have loved and have meant to help each other all their lives and with the years have drifted asunder coming even to be against one another  we change and our thoughts change slight differences of temperament grow into barriers between us unguessed antagonisms widen into gulfs  accidents come into our lives  a friend was telling me the other day of a woman who practically proposed to and married a musical genius purely and solely to be of use to him  she earned quite a big income drawing fashions and her idea was to relieve him of the necessity of doing potboilers for a living so that he might devote his whole time to his real work  and a few weeks after they were married she ran the point of a lead pencil through her eye and it set up inflammation of her brain  and now all the poor fellow has to think of is how to make enough to pay for her keep at a private lunatic asylum  i dont mean to be flippant  its the very absurdity of it all that makes the mystery of lifethat renders it so hopeless for us to attempt to find our way through it by our own judgment  it is like the ants making all their clever laborious plans knowing nothing of chickens and the gardeners spade  that is why we have to cling to the life we can order for ourselvesthe life within us  truth justice pity  they are the strong things the eternal things the things weve got to sacrifice ourselves forserve with our bodies and our souls  dont think me a prig she pleaded  im talking as if i knew all about it  i dont really  i grope in the dark and now and thenat least so it seems to mei catch a glint of light  we are powerless in ourselves  it is only god working through us that enables us to be of any use  all we can do is to keep ourselves kind and clean and free from self waiting for him to come to us  the girl rose  i must be getting back she said  dad will be wondering where ive got to  she paused with the door in her hand and a faint smile played round the thin red lips  tell me she said  what is god  a labourer together with man according to saint paul joan answered  the girl turned and went  joan watched her as she descended the great staircase  she moved with a curious gliding motion pausing at times for the people to make way for her     chapter xvi   it was a summers evening joan had dropped in at the greysons and had found mary alone francis not having yet returned from a bachelor dinner at his uncles who was some big pot in the navy  they sat in the twilight facing the open french windows through which one caught a glimpse of the park  a great stillness seemed to be around them  the sale and purchase of the evening gazette had been completed a few days before  greyson had been offered the alternative of gradually and gracefully changing his opinions or getting out and had of course chosen dismissal  he was taking a holiday as mary explained with a short laugh  he had some shares in it himself hadnt he joan asked  oh just enough to be of no use mary answered  carleton was rather decent so far as that part of it was concerned and insisted on paying him a fair price  the market value would have been much less and he wanted to be out of it  joan remained silent  it made her mad that a man could be suddenly robbed of fifteen years labour the weapon that his heart and brain had made keen wrested from his hand by a legal process and turned against the very principles for which all his life he had been fighting  im almost more sorry for myself than for him said mary making a whimsical grimace  he will start something else so soon as hes got over his first soreness but im too old to dream of another child  he came in a little later and seating himself between them filled and lighted his pipe  looking back joan remembered that curiously none of them had spoken  mary had turned at the sound of his key in the door she seemed to be watching him intently but it was too dark to notice her expression  he pulled at his pipe till it was well alight and then removed it  its war he said  the words made no immediate impression upon joan  there had been rumours threatenings and alarms newspaper talk  but so there had been before  it would come one day the world war that one felt was gathering in the air that would burst like a second deluge on the nations  but it would not be in our time it was too big  a way out would be found  is there no hope asked mary  yes he answered  the hope that a miracle may happen  the navys got its orders  and suddenlyas years before in a paris music hallthere leapt to life within joans brain a little impish creature that took possession of her she hoped the miracle would not happen  the little impish creature within her brain was marching up and down beating a drum  she wished he would stop a minute  someone was trying to talk to her telling her she ought to be tremendously shocked and grieved  heor she or whatever it was that was trying to talk to her appeared concerned about reason and pity and universal brotherhood and civilizations clockthings like that  but the little impish drummer was making such a din she couldnt properly hear  later on perhaps he would get tired and then she would be able to listen to this humane and sensible person whoever it might be  mary argued that england could and should keep out of it but greyson was convinced it would be impossible not to say dishonourable a sentiment that won the enthusiastic approval of the little drummer in joans brain he played rule britannia and god save the king the marseillaise and the russian national hymn all at the same time  he would have included deutschland uber alles if joan hadnt made a supreme effort and stopped him  evidently a sporting little devil  he took himself off into a corner after a time where he played quietly to himself and joan was able to join in the conversation  greyson spoke with an enthusiasm that was unusual to him  so many of our wars had been mean warswars for the wrong sordid wars for territory for gold mines wars against the weak at the bidding of our traders our financiers  shouldering the white mans burden we called it  wars for the right of selling opium wars to perpetuate the vile rule of the turk because it happened to serve our commercial interests  this time we were out to play the knight to save the smaller peoples to rescue our once sweet enemy fair france  russia was the disturbing thought it somewhat discounted the knighterrant idea riding stirrup to stirrup beside that barbarian horseman  but there were possibilities about russia  idealism lay hid within that sleeping brain  it would be a holy war for the kingdom of the peoples  with germany freed from the monster of blood and iron that was crushing out her soul with russia awakened to life we would build the united states of europe  even his voice was changed  joan could almost fancy it was some excited schoolboy that was talking  mary had been clasping and unclasping her hands a habit of hers when troubled  could good ever come out of evil  that was her doubt  did war ever do anything but sow the seeds of future violence substitute one injustice for another change wrong for wrong  did it ever do anything but add to the worlds sum of evil making gods task the heavier  suddenly while speaking she fell into a passionate fit of weeping  she went on through her tears  it will be terrible she said  it will last longer than you say every nation will be drawn into it  there will be no voice left to speak for reason  every day we shall grow more brutalized more pitiless  it will degrade us crush the soul out of us  blood and iron  it will become our god too the god of all the world  you say we are going into it with clean hands this time  how long will they keep clean  the people who only live for making money how long do you think they will remain silent  what has been all the talk of the last ten years but of capturing german trade  we shall be told that we owe it to our dead to make a profit out of them that otherwise they will have died in vain who will care for the people but to use them for killing one anotherto hound them on like dogs  in every country nothing but greed and hatred will be preached  horrible men and women will write to the papers crying out for more blood more cruelty  everything that can make for anger and revenge will be screamed from every newspaper  every plea for humanity will be jeered at as sickly sentimentality  every man and woman who remembers the ideals with which we started will be shrieked at as a traitor  the people who are doing well out of it they will get hold of the press appeal to the passions of the mob  nobody else will be allowed to speak  it always has been so in war  it always will be  this will be no exception merely because its bigger  every country will be given over to savagery  there will be no appeal against it  the whole world will sink back into the beast  she ended by rising abruptly and wishing them goodnight  her outburst had silenced joans impish drummer for the time  he appeared to be nervous and depressed but bucked up again on the way to the bus  greyson walked with her as usual  they took the long way round by the outer circle  poor mary he said  i should not have talked before her if i had thought  her horror of war is almost physical  she will not even read about them  it has the same effect upon her as stories of cruelty  but theres truth in a good deal that she says he added  war can bring out all that is best in a people but also it brings out the worst we shall have to take care that the ideals are not lost sight of  i wish this wretched business of the paper hadnt come just at this time said joan just when your voice is most needed  couldnt you get enough money together to start something quickly she continued the idea suddenly coming to her  i think i could help you it wouldnt matter its being something small to begin with  so long as it was entirely your own and couldnt be taken away from you  youd soon work it up  thanks he answered  i may ask you to later on  but just now  he paused  of course  for war you wanted men to fight  she had been thinking of them in the lump hurrying masses such as one sees on cinema screens blurred but picturesque  of course when you came to think of it they would have to be made up of individualsgallanthearted boyish sort of men who would pass through doors one at a time into little rooms give their name and address to a soldier man seated at a big deal table  later on one would say goodbye to them on crowded platforms wave a handkerchief  not all of them would come back  you cant make omelettes without breaking eggs she told herself  it annoyed her that silly saying having come into her mind  she could see them lying there with their white faces to the night  surely she might have thought of some remark less idiotic to make to herself at such a time  he was explaining to her things about the air service  it seemed he had had experience in flyingsome relation of his with whom he had spent a holiday last summer  it would mean his getting out quickly  he seemed quite eager to be gone  isnt it rather dangerous work she asked  she felt it was a footling question even as she asked it  her brain had become stodgy  nothing like as dangerous as being in the infantry he answered  and that would be my only other alternative  besides i get out of the drilling  he laughed  i should hate being shouted at and ordered about by a husky old sergeant  they neither spoke again till they came to the bridge from the other side of which the busses started  i may not see you again before i go he said  look after mary  i shall try to persuade her to go down to her aunt in hampshire  its rather a bit of luck as it turns out the paper being finished with  i shouldnt have quite known what to do  he had stopped at the corner  they were still beneath the shadow of the trees  quite unconsciously she put her face up and as if it had always been the custom at their partings he drew her to him and kissed her though it really was for the first time  she walked home instead of taking the bus  she wanted to think  a day or two would decide the question  she determined that if the miracle did not happen she would go down to liverpool  her father was on the committee of one of the great hospitals and she knew one or two of the matrons  she would want to be doing somethingto get out to the front if possible  maybe her desire to serve was not altogether free from curiosityfrom the craving for adventure  theres a spice of the man even in the best of women  her conscience plagued her when she thought of mrs denton  for some time now they had been very close together and the old lady had come to depend upon her  she waited till all doubt was ended before calling to say goodbye  mrs denton was seated before an old bureau that had long stood locked in a corner of the library  the drawers were open and books and papers were scattered about  joan told her plans  youll be able to get along without me for a little while she asked doubtfully  mrs denton laughed  i havent much more to do she answered  just tidying up as you see and two or three halffinished things i shall try to complete  after that ill perhaps take a rest  she took from among the litter a faded photograph and handed it to joan odd she said  ive just turned it out  it represented a long thin line of eminently respectable ladies and gentlemen in early victorian costume  the men in pegtop trousers and silk stocks the women in crinolines and poke bonnets  among them holding the hand of a benevolentlooking stoutish gentleman was a mere girl  the terminating frills of a white unmentionable garment showed beneath her skirts  she wore a porkpie hat with a feather in it  my first public appearance explained mrs denton  i teased my father into taking me with him  we represented great britain and ireland  i suppose im the only one left  i shouldnt have recognized you laughed joan  what was the occasion  the great international peace congress at paris explained mrs denton just after the crimean war  it made quite a stir at the time  the emperor opened our proceedings in person and the pope and the archbishop of canterbury both sent us their blessing  we had a copy of the speeches presented to us on leaving in every known language in europe bound in vellum  im hoping to find it  and the press was enthusiastic  there were to be acts of parliament courts of arbitration international laws diplomatic treaties  a subcommittee was appointed to prepare a special set of prayers and a palace of peace was to be erected  there was only one thing we forgot and that was the foundation  i may not be here she continued when the new plans are submitted tell them not to forget the foundation this time  tell them to teach the children  joan dined at a popular restaurant that evening  she fancied it might cheer her up  but the noisy patriotism of the overfed crowd only irritated her  these elderly flabby men these fleshy women who would form the spectators who would loll on their cushioned seats protected from the sun munching contentedly from their wellprovided baskets while listening to the dying groans rising upwards from the drenched arena  she glanced from one podgy thumb to another and a feeling of nausea crept over her  suddenly the band struck up god save the king  three commonplace enough young men seated at a table near to her laid down their napkins and stood up  yes there was something to be said for war she felt as she looked at their boyish faces transfigured  not for them business as usual the capture of german trade  other visions those young eyes were seeing  the little imp within her brain had seized his drum again follow meso he seemed to beati teach men courage duty the laying down of self  i open the gates of honour  i make heroes out of dust isnt it worth my price  a figure was loitering the other side of the street when she reached home  she thought she somehow recognized it and crossed over  it was mckean smoking his everlasting pipe  success having demanded some such change he had migrated to the albany and she had not seen him for some time  he had come to have a last look at the housein case it might happen to be the last  he was off to scotland the next morning where he intended to join up  but are you sure its your particular duty suggested joan  im told youve become a household word both in germany and france  if we really are out to end war and establish the brotherhood of nations the work you are doing is of more importance than even the killing of germans  it isnt as if there wouldnt be enough without you  to tell the truth he answered thats exactly what ive been saying to myself  i shant be any good  i dont see myself sticking a bayonet into even a german  unless he happened to be abnormally clumsy  i tried to shoot a rabbit once  i might have done it if the little beggar instead of running away hadnt turned and looked at me  i should keep out of it if i were you laughed joan  i cant he answered  im too great a coward  an odd reason for enlisting thought joan  i couldnt face it he went on the way people would be looking at me in trains and omnibuses the things people would say of me the things i should imagine they were saying what my valet would be thinking of me oh im ashamed enough of myself  its the artistic temperament i suppose  we must always be admired praised  were not the stuff that martyrs are made of  we must for ever be kowtowing to the cackling geese around us  were so terrified lest they should hiss us  the street was empty  they were pacing it slowly up and down  ive always been a coward he continued  i fell in love with you the first day i met you on the stairs  but i dared not tell you  you didnt give me that impression answered joan  she had always found it difficult to know when to take him seriously and when not  i was so afraid you would find it out he explained  you thought i would take advantage of it she suggested  one can never be sure of a woman he answered  and it would have been so difficult  there was a girl down in scotland one of the village girls  it wasnt anything really  we had just been children together but they all thought i had gone away to make my fortune so as to come back and marry hereven my mother  it would have looked so mean if after getting on i had married a fine london lady  i could never have gone home again  but you havent married heror have you asked joan  no he answered  she wrote me a beautiful letter that i shall always keep begging me to forgive her and hoping i might be happy  she had married a young farmer and was going out to canada  my mother will never allow her name to be mentioned in our house  they had reached the end of the street again  joan held out her hand with a laugh  thanks for the compliment she said  though i notice you wait till youre going away before telling me  but quite seriously she added give it a little more thoughtthe enlisting i mean  the world isnt too rich in kind influences  it needs men like you  come pull yourself together and show a little pluck  she laughed  ill try he promised but it wont be any use i shall drift about the streets seeking to put heart into myself but all the while my footsteps will be bearing me nearer and nearer to the recruiting office and outside the door some girl in the crowd will smile approval or some old fool will pat me on the shoulder and i shall sneak in and it will close behind me  it must be fine to have courage  he wrote her two days later from ayr giving her the name of his regiment and again some six months later from flanders  but there would have been no sense in her replying to that last  she lingered in the street by herself a little time after he had turned the corner  it had been a house of sorrow and disappointment to her but so also she had dreamed her dreams there seen her visions  she had never made much headway with her landlord and her landlady a worthy couple who had proved most excellent servants but who prided themselves to use their own expression on knowing their place and keeping themselves to themselves  joan had given them notice that morning and had been surprised at the womans bursting into tears  i felt it just the same when young mr mckean left us she explained with apologies  he had been with us five years  he was like you miss so unpracticable  id got used to looking after him  mary greyson called on her in the morning while she was still at breakfast  she had come from seeing francis off by an early train from euston  he had sent joan a ring  he is so afraid you may not be able to wear itthat it will not fit you said mary but i told him i was sure it would  joan held our her hand for the letter  i was afraid he had forgotten it she answered with a smile  she placed the ring on her finger and held out her hand  i might have been measured for it she said  i wonder how he knew  you left a glove behind you the first day you ever came to our house mary explained  and i kept it  she was following his wishes and going down into the country  they did not meet again until after the war  madge dropped in on her during the week and brought flossie with her flossies husband sam had departed for the navy and niel singleton who had offered and been rejected for the army had joined a red cross unit  madge herself was taking up canteen work  joan rather expected flossie to be in favour of the war and madge against it  instead of which it turned out the other way round  it seemed difficult to forecast opinion in this matter  madge thought that england in particular had been too much given up to luxury and pleasure  there had been too much idleness and empty laughter hitchicoo dances and women undressing themselves upon the stage  even the working classes seemed to think of nothing else but cinemas and beer  she dreamed of a united kingdom purified by suffering cleansed by tears its people drawn together by memory of common sacrifice class antagonism buried in the grave where dukes son and cooks son would lie side by side of a newborn europe rising from the ashes of the old  with germany beaten her lust of war burnt out her hideous doctrine of force proved to be false the world would breathe a freer air  passion and hatred would fall from mans eyes  the people would see one another and join hands  flossie was sceptical  why hasnt it done it before she wanted to know  good lord  theres been enough of it  why didnt we all kiss and be friends after the napoleonic wars she demanded instead of getting up peterloo massacres and anticorn law riots and breaking the duke of wellingtons windows  all this talk of downing militarism she continued  its like trying to do away with the other sort of disorderly house  you dont stamp out a vice by chivying it round the corner  when men and women have become decent there will be no more disorderly houses  but it wont come before  suppose we do knock militarism out of germany like we did out of france not so very long ago  it will only slip round the corner into russia or japan  come and settle over here as likely as not especially if we have a few victories and get to fancy ourselves  madge was of opinion that the world would have had enough of war  not armies but whole peoples would be involved this time  the lesson would be driven home  oh yes we shall have had enough of it agreed flossie by the time weve paid up  theres no doubt of that  what about our children  ive just left young frank strutting all over the house and flourishing a paper knife  and the servants have had to bar the kitchen door to prevent his bursting in every five minutes and attacking them  whats he going to say when i tell him later on that his father and myself have had all the war we want and have decided there shall be no more  the old folks have had their fun  why shouldnt i have mine  that will be his argument  you cant do it she concluded unless you are prepared to keep half the worlds literature away from the children scrap half your music edit your museums and your picture galleries bowdlerize your old testament and rewrite your histories  and then youll have to be careful for twentyfour hours a day that they never see a dogfight  madge still held to her hope  god would make a wind of reason to pass over the earth  he would not smite again his people  i wish poor dear sam could have been kept out of it said flossie  she wiped her eyes and finished her tea  joan had arranged to leave on the monday  she ran down to see mary stopperton on the saturday afternoon  mr stopperton had died the year before and mary had been a little hurt divining insincerity in the condolences offered to her by most of her friends  you didnt know him dear she had said to joan  all his faults were on the outside  she did not want to talk about the war  perhaps its wrong of me she said  but it makes me so sad  and i can do nothing  she had been busy at her machine when joan had entered and a pile of delicate white work lay folded on a chair beside her  what are you making asked joan  the little withered face lighted up  guess she said as she unfolded and displayed a tiny garment  i so love making them she said  i say to myself it will all come right  god will send more and more of his christ babies till at last there will be thousands and thousands of them everywhere and their love will change the world  her bright eyes had caught sight of the ring upon joans hand  she touched it with her little fragile fingers  you will let me make one for you dearie wont you she said  i feel sure it will be a little christ baby  arthur was still away when she arrived home  he had gone to norway on business  her father was afraid he would find it difficult to get back telegraphic communication had been stopped and they had had no news of him  her father was worried  a big government contract had come in while many of his best men had left to enlist  ive fixed you up all right at the hospital he said  it was good of you to think of coming home  dont go away for a bit  it was the first time he had asked anything of her  another fortnight passed before they heard from arthur and then he wrote them both from hull  he would be somewhere in the north sea mine sweeping when they read his letters  he had hoped to get a day or two to run across and say goodbye but the need for men was pressing and he had not liked to plead excuses  the boat by which he had managed to leave bergen had gone down  he and a few others had been picked up but the sights that he had seen were haunting him  he felt sure his uncle would agree that he ought to be helping and this was work for england he could do with all his heart  he hoped he was not leaving his uncle in the lurch but he did not think the war would last long and he would soon be back  dear lad said her father he would take the most dangerous work that he could find  but i wish he hadnt been quite so impulsive  he could have been of more use helping me with this war office contract  i suppose he never got my letter telling him about it  in his letter to joan he went further  he had received his uncles letter so he confided to her  perhaps she would think him a crank but he couldnt help it  he hated this killing business this making of machinery for slaughtering men in bulk like they killed pigs in chicago out on the free sweet sea helping to keep it clean from mans abominations he would be away from it all  she saw the vision of him that night as leaning from her window she looked out beyond the pines the little lonely ship amid the waste of waters his beautiful almost womanish face and the gentle dreamy eyes with their haunting suggestion of a shadow  her little drummer played less and less frequently to her as the months passed by  it didnt seem to be the war he had looked forward to  the illustrated papers continued to picture it as a sort of glorified picnic where smiling young men lolled luxuriously in cosy dugouts reading their favourite paper  by curious coincidence it generally happened to be the journal publishing the photograph  occasionally it appeared they came across the enemy who then put up both hands and shouted kamerad  but the weary wounded men she talked to told another story  she grew impatient of the fighters with their mouths the savage old baldheads heroically prepared to sacrifice the last young man the sleek purring women who talked childish nonsense about killing every man woman and child in germany but quite meant it the shrieking journalists who had decided that their place was the home front the pressspurred mobs the spy hunters chasing terrified old men and sobbing children through the streets  it was a relief to enter the quiet ward and close the door behind her  the campfollowers the traders and pedlars the balladmongers and the mountebanks the ghoulish sightseers  war brought out all that was worst in them  but the givers of their blood the lads who suffered who had made the sacrifice war had taught them chivalry manhood  she heard no revilings of hatred and revenge from those drawn lips  patience humour forgiveness they had learnt from war  they told her kindly stories even of hans and fritz  the little drummer in her brain would creep out of his corner play to her softly while she moved about among them  one day she received a letter from folk  he had come to london at the request of the french government to consult with english artists on a matter he must not mention  he would not have the time he told her to run down to liverpool  could she get a couple of days leave and dine with him in london  she found him in the uniform of a french colonel  he had quite a military bearing and seemed pleased with himself  he kissed her hand and then held her out at arms length  its wonderful how like you are to your mother he said i wish i were as young as i feel  she had written him at the beginning of the war telling him of her wish to get out to the front and he thought that now he might be able to help her  but perhaps youve changed your mind he said  it isnt quite as pretty as its painted  i want to she answered  it isnt all curiosity  i think its time for women to insist on seeing war with their own eyes not trust any longer to the pictures you men paint  she smiled  but ive got to give it up she added  i cant leave dad  they were sitting in the hall of the hotel  it was the dressing hour and the place was almost empty  he shot a swift glance at her  arthur is still away she explained and i feel that he wants me  i should be worrying myself thinking of him all alone with no one to look after him  its the mother instinct i suppose  it always has hampered woman  she laughed  dear old boy he said  he was watching her with a little smile  im glad hes got some luck at last  they dined in the great restaurant belonging to the hotel  he was still vastly pleased with himself as he marched up the crowded room with joan upon his arm  he held himself upright and talked and laughed perhaps louder than an elderly gentleman should  swaggering old beggar he must have overheard a young sub mutter as they passed  but he did not seem to mind it  they lingered over the meal  folk was a brilliant talker  most of the men whose names were filling the newspapers had sat to him at one time or another  he made them seem quite human  joan was surprised at the time  come up to my rooms will you he asked  theres something i want to say to you  and then ill walk back with you  she was staying at a small hotel off jermyn street  he sat her down by the fire and went into the next room  he had a letter in his hand when he returned  joan noticed that the envelope was written upon across the corner but she was not near enough to distinguish the handwriting  he placed it on the mantelpiece and sat down opposite her  so you have come to love the dear old chap he said  i have always loved him joan answered  it was he didnt love me for a time as i thought  but i know now that he does  he was silent for a few moments and then he leant across and took her hands in his  i am going he said where there is just the possibility of an accident one never knows  i wanted to be sure that all was well with you  he was looking at the ring upon her hand  a soldier boy he asked  yes she answered  if he comes back  there was a little catch in her voice  i know hell come back he said  i wont tell you why i am so sure perhaps you wouldnt believe  he was still holding her hands looking into her eyes  tell me he said did you see your mother before she died  did she speak to you  no joan answered  i was too late  she had died the night before  i hardly recognized her when i saw her  she looked so sweet and young  she loved you very dearly he said  better than herself  all those years of sorrow they came to her because of that  i thought it foolish of her at the time but now i know she was wise  i want you always to love and honour her  i wouldnt ask you if it wasnt right  she looked at him and smiled  its quite easy she answered  i always see her as she lay there with all the sorrow gone from her  she looked so beautiful and kind  he rose and took the letter from where he had placed it on the mantelpiece  he stooped and held it out above the fire and a little flame leaped up and seemed to take it from his hand  they neither spoke during the short walk between the two hotels  but at the door she turned and held out her hands to him  thank you she said for being so kindand wise  i shall always love and honour her  he kissed her promising to take care of himself  she ran against phillips the next day at one of the big stores where she was shopping  he had obtained a commission early in the war and was now a captain  he had just come back from the front on leave  the alternative had not appealed to him of being one of those responsible for sending other men to death while remaining himself in security and comfort  its a matter of temperament he said  somebodys got to stop behind and do the patriotic speechifying  im glad i didnt  especially after what ive seen  he had lost interest in politics  theres something bigger coming he said  here everything seems to be going on much the same but over there you feel it  something growing silently out of all this blood and mud  i find myself wondering what the men are staring at but when i look theres nothing as far as my field glasses will reach but waste and desolation  and it isnt only on the faces of our own men  its in the eyes of the prisoners too  as if they saw something  a funny ending to the war if the people began to think  mrs phillips was running a convalescent home in folkestone he told her and had even made a speech  hilda was doing relief work among the ruined villages of france  its a new world we shall be called upon to build he said  we must pay more heed to the foundation this time  she seldom discussed the war with her father  at the beginning he had dreamed with greyson of a short and glorious campaign that should weld all classes together and after which we should forgive our enemies and shape with them a better world  but as the months went by he appeared to grow indifferent and joan who got about twelve hours a day of it outside welcomed other subjects  it surprised her when one evening after dinner he introduced it himself  what are you going to do when its over he asked her  you wont give up the fight will you whatever happens  she had not known till then that he had been taking any interest in her work  no she answered with a laugh no matter what happens i shall always want to be in it  good lad he said patting her on the shoulder  it will be an ugly world that will come out of all this hate and anger  the lord will want all the help that he can get  and you dont forget our compact do you he continued that i am to be your backer  i want to be in it too  she shot a glance at him  he was looking at the portrait of that old ironside allway who had fought and died to make a nobler england as he had dreamed  a grim unprepossessing gentleman unless the artist had done him much injustice with high narrow forehead and puzzled staring eyes  she took the cigarette from her lips and her voice trembled a little  i want you to be something more to me than that sir she said  i want to feel that im an allway fighting for the things weve always had at heart  ill try and be worthy of the name  her hand stole out to him across the table but she kept her face away from him  until she felt his grasp grow tight and then she turned and their eyes met  youll be the last of the name he said  something tells me that  im glad youre a fighter  i always prayed my child might be a fighter  arthur had not been home since the beginning of the war  twice he had written them to expect him but the little fleet of mine sweepers had been hard pressed and on both occasions his leave had been stopped at the last moment  one afternoon he turned up unexpectedly at the hospital  it was a few weeks after the conscription act had been passed  joan took him into her room at the end of the ward from where through the open door she could still keep watch  they spoke in low tones  its done you good said joan  you look every inch the jolly jack tar  he was hard and tanned and his eyes were marvellously bright  yes he said i love the sea  its clean and strong  a fear was creeping over her  why have you come back she asked  he hesitated keeping his eyes upon the ground  i dont suppose you will agree with me he said  somehow i felt i had to  a conscientious objector  she might have guessed it  a conchy as they would call him in the press all the spiteful screamers who had never risked a scratch themselves denouncing him as a coward  the local dogberrys of the tribunals would fire off their little stock of gibes and platitudes upon him propound with owlish solemnity the new christianity abuse him and condemn him without listening to him jeering mobs would follow him through the streets  more than once of late she had encountered such crowds made up of shrieking girls and foul mouthed men surging round some whitefaced youngster while the welldressed passersby looked on and grinned  she came to him and stood over him with her hands upon his shoulders  must you dear she said  cant you reconcile it to yourselfto go on with your work of mercy of saving poor folks lives  he raised his eyes to hers  the shadow that to her fancy had always rested there seemed to have departed  a light had come to them  there are more important things than saving mens bodies  you think that dont you he asked  yes she answered  i wont try to hold you back dear if you think you can do that  he caught her hands and held them  i wanted to be a coward he said to keep out of the fight  i thought of the shame of the petty persecutionsthat even you might despise me but i couldnt  i was always seeing his face before me with his beautiful tender eyes and the blood drops on his brow  it is he alone can save the world  it is perishing for want of love and by a little suffering i might be able to help him  and then one nighti suppose it was a piece of driftwoodthere rose up out of the sea a little cross that seemed to call to me to stretch out my hand and grasp it and gird it to my side  he had risen  dont you see he said  it is only by suffering that one can help him  it is the sword that he has chosenby which one day he will conquer the world  and this is such a splendid opportunity to fight for him  it would be like deserting him on the eve of a great battle  she looked into his eager hopeful eyes  yes it had always been soit always would be to the end  not priests and prophets but ever that little scattered band of glad sufferers for his sake would be his army his weapon still the cross till the victory should be won  she glanced through the open door to where the poor broken fellows she always thought of as her boys lay so patient and then held out her hand to him with a smile though the tears were in her eyes  so youre like all the rest of them lad she said  its for king and country  good luck to you  after the war was over and the men released from their long terms of solitary confinement came back to life injured in mind and body she was almost glad he had escaped  but at the time it filled her soul with darkness  it was one noonday  he had been down to the tribunal and his case had been again adjourned  she was returning from a lecture and crossing a street in the neighbourhood of the docks found herself suddenly faced by an oncoming crowd  it was yelping and snarling curiously suggestive of a pack of hungry wolves  a couple of young soldiers were standing back against a wall  better not go on nurse said one of them  its some poor devil of a conchy i expect  must have a damned sight more pluck than i should  it was the fear that had been haunting her  she did not know how white she had turned  i think it is someone i know she said  wont you help me  the crowd gave way to them and they had all but reached him  he was hatless and bespattered but his tender eyes had neither fear nor anger in them  she reached out her arms and called to him  another step and she would have been beside him but at the moment a slim laughing girl darted in front of him and slipped her foot between his legs and he went down  she heard the joyous yell and the shrill laughter as she struggled wildly to force her way to him  and then for a moment there was a space and a man with bent body and clenched hands was rushing forward as if upon a football field and there came a little sickening thud and then the crowd closed in again  her strength was gone and she could only wait  more soldiers had come up and were using their fists freely and gradually the crowd retired still snarling and they lifted him up and brought him to her  theres a chemists shop in the next street  wed better take him there suggested the one who had first spoken to her  and she thanked them and followed them  they made a bed for him with their coats upon the floor and some of them kept guard outside the shop while one putting aside the frightened useless little chemist waited upon her bringing things needful while she cleansed the foulness from his smooth young face and washed the matted blood from his fair hair and closed the lids upon his tender eyes and stooping kissed the cold quiet lips  there had been whispered talk among the men and when she rose the one who had first spoken to her came forward  he was nervous and stood stiffly  beg pardon nurse he said but weve sent for a stretcher as the police dont seem in any hurry  would you like us to take him  or would it upset him do you think if he knew  thank you she answered  he would think it kind of you i know  she had the feeling that he was being borne by comrades     chapter xvii   it was from a small operating hospital in a village of the argonne that she first saw the war with her own eyes  her father had wished her to go  arthurs death had stirred in him the old puritan blood with its record of long battle for liberty of conscience  if war claimed to be master of a mans soul then the new warfare must be against war  he remembered the saying of a frenchwoman who had been through the francoprussian war  joan on her return from paris some years before had told him of her repeating her words but of course it would not do to tell the truth the old lady had said or we should have our children growing up to hate war  ill be lonely and anxious till you come back he said  but that will have to be my part of the fight  she had written to folk  no female nurses were supposed to be allowed within the battle zone but under pressure of shortage the french staff were relaxing the rule and folk had pledged himself to her discretion i am not doing you any kindness he had written  you will have to share the common hardships and privations and the danger is real  if i didnt feel instinctively that underneath your mask of sweet reasonableness you are one of the most obstinate young women god ever made and that without me you would probably get yourself into a still worse hole id have refused  and then followed a list of the things she was to be sure to take with her including a pound or two of keatings insect powder and a hint that it might save her trouble if she had her hair cut short  there was but one other woman at the hospital  it had been a farmhouse the man and both sons had been killed during the first year of the war and the woman had asked to be allowed to stay on  her name was madame lelanne  she was useful by reason of her great physical strength  she could take up a man as he lay and carry him on her outstretched arms  it was an expressionless face with dull slowmoving eyes that never changed  she and joan shared a small grenier in one of the barns  joan had brought with her a camp bedstead but the woman wrapping a blanket round her would creep into a hole she had made for herself among the hay  she never took off her clothes except the great woodensoled boots so far as joan could discover  the medical staff consisted of a dr poujoulet and two assistants  the authorities were always promising to send him more help but it never arrived  one of the assistants a monsieur dubos a little man with a remarkably big beard was a chemist who at the outbreak of the war had been on the verge as he made sure of an important discovery in connection with colour photography  almost the first question he asked joan was could she speak german  finding that she could he had hurried her across the yard into a small hut where patients who had borne their operation successfully awaited their turn to be moved down to one of the convalescent hospitals at the base  among them was a german prisoner an elderly man belonging to the landwehr in private life a photographer he also had been making experiments in the direction of colour photography  chance had revealed to the two men their common interest and they had been exchanging notes  the german talked a little french but not sufficient and on the day of joans arrival they had reached an impasse that was maddening to both of them  joan found herself up against technical terms that rendered her task difficult but fortunately had brought a dictionary with her and was able to make them understand one another  but she had to be firm with both of them allowing them only ten minutes together at a time  the little frenchman would kneel by the bedside holding the german at an angle where he could talk with least danger to his wound  it seemed that each was the very man the other had been waiting all his life to meet  they shed tears on one anothers neck when they parted making all arrangements to write to one another  and you will come and stay with me persisted the little frenchman when this affair is finishedhe made an impatient gesture with his hands  my wife takes much interest  she will be delighted  and the big german again embracing the little frenchman had promised and had sent his compliments to madame  the other was a young priest  he wore the regulation red cross uniform but kept his cassock hanging on a peg behind his bed  he had pretty frequent occasion to take it down  these small emergency hospitals within range of the guns were reserved for only dangerous cases men whose wounds would not permit of their being carried further and there never was much more than a sporting chance of saving them  they were always glad to find there was a priest among the staff  often it was the first question they would ask on being lifted out of the ambulance  even those who professed to no religion seemed comforted by the idea  he went by the title of monsieur le pretre joan never learned his name  it was he who had laid out the little cemetery on the opposite side of the village street  it had once been an orchard and some of the trees were still standing  in the centre rising out of a pile of rockwork he had placed a crucifix that had been found upon the roadside and had surrounded it with flowers  it formed the one bright spot of colour in the village and at night time when all other sounds were hushed the iron wreaths upon its little crosses swaying against one another in the wind would make a low clear tinkling music  joan would sometimes lie awake listening to it  in some way she could not explain it always brought the thought of children to her mind  the doctor himself was a broadshouldered bulletheaded man clean shaven with closecropped bristly hair  he had curiously square hands with short squat fingers  he had been head surgeon in one of the paris hospitals and had been assigned his present post because of his marvellous quickness with the knife  the hospital was the nearest to a hill of great strategical importance and the fighting in the neighbourhood was almost continuous  often a single ambulance would bring in three or four cases each one demanding instant attention  dr poujoulet with his hairy arms bare to the shoulder would polish them off one after another with hardly a moments rest between not allowing time even for the washing of the table  joan would have to summon all her nerve to keep herself from collapsing  at times the need for haste was such that it was impossible to wait for the anaesthetic to take effect  the one redeeming feature was the extraordinary heroism of the men though occasionally there was nothing for it but to call in the orderlies to hold some poor fellow down and to deafen ones ears  one day after a successful operation she was tending a young sergeant he was a wellbuilt handsome man with skin as white as a womans  he watched her with curious indifference in his eyes as she busied herself trying to make him comfortable and did nothing to help her  has mamselle ever seen a bull fight he asked her  no she answered  ive seen all the horror and cruelty i want to for the rest of my life  ah he said you would understand if you had  when one of the horses goes down gored his entrails lying out upon the sand you know what they do dont you  they put a rope round him and drag him groaning into the shambles behind  and once there kind people like you and monsieur le medecin tend him and wash him and put his entrails back and sew him up again  he thinks it so kind of themthe first time  but the second he understands  he will be sent back into the arena to be ripped up again and again after that  this is the third time i have been wounded and as soon as youve all patched me up and ive got my breath again theyll send me back into it  mamselle will forgive my not feeling grateful to her  he gave a short laugh that brought the blood into his mouth  the village consisted of one long straggling street following the course of a small stream between two lines of hills  it was on one of the great lines of communication and troops and war material passed through it going and coming in almost endless procession  it served also as a camp of rest  companies from the trenches would arrive there generally towards the evening weary listless dulleyed many of them staggering like overdriven cattle beneath their mass of burdens  they would fling their accoutrements from them and stand in silent groups till the sergeants and corporals returned to lead them to the barns and outhouses that had been assigned to them the houses still habitable being mostly reserved for the officers  like those of most french villages they were drab plastercovered buildings without gardens but some of them were covered with vines hiding their ugliness and the village as a whole with its groups here and there of fine sycamore trees and its great stone fountain in the centre was picturesque enough  it had twice changed hands and a part of it was in ruins  from one or two of the more solidly built houses merely the front had fallen leaving the rooms just as they had always been the furniture in its accustomed place the pictures on the walls  they suggested dolls houses standing open  one wondered when the giant child would come along and close them up  the iron spire of the little church had been hit twice  it stood above the village twisted into the form of a note of interrogation  in the churchyard many of the graves had been ripped open  bones and skulls lay scattered about among the shattered tombstones  but save for a couple of holes in the roof the body was still intact and every afternoon a faint timidsounding bell called a few villagers and a sprinkling of soldiers to mass  most of the inhabitants had fled but the farmers and shopkeepers had remained  at intervals the german batteries searching round with apparent aimlessness would drop a score or so of shells about the neighbourhood but the peasant with an indifference that was almost animal would still follow his oxdrawn plough the old bent crone muttering curses still ply the hoe  the proprietors of the tiny epiceries must have been rapidly making their fortunes considering the prices that they charged the unfortunate poilu dreaming of some small luxury out of his five sous a day  but as one of them a stout smiling lady explained to joan with a gesture it is not often that one has a war  joan had gone out in september and for a while the weather was pleasant the men wrapped up in their greatcoats would sleep for preference under the great sycamore trees  through open doorways she would catch glimpses of picturesque groups of eager cardplayers crowded round a flickering candle  from the darkness there would steal the sound of flute or zither of voices singing  occasionally it would be some strident ditty of the paris musichalls but more often it was sad and plaintive  but early in october the rains commenced and the stream became a roaring torrent and a clammy mist lay like a white river between the wooded hills  mud that seemed to be the one word with which to describe modern war mud everywhere  mud ankledeep upon the roads mud into which you sank up to your knees the moment you stepped off it tents and huts to which you waded through the mud avoiding the slimy gangways on which you slipped and fell mudbespattered men mudbespattered horses little donkeys looking as if they had been sculptured out of mud struggling up and down the light railways that every now and then would disappear and be lost beneath the mud guns and wagons groaning through the mud lorries and ambulances that in the darkness had swerved from the straight course overturned and lying abandoned in the mud motorcyclists ploughing swift furrows through the mud rolling it back in liquid streams each side of them staff cars rushing screaming through the mud followed by a rushing fountain of mud serried ranks of muddy men stamping through the mud with steady rhythm moving through a rain of mud rising upward from the ground long lines of motorbuses filled with a mass of muddy humanity packed shoulder to shoulder rumbling ever through the endless mud  men sitting by the roadside in the mud gnawing at unsavoury food men squatting by the ditches examining their sores washing their bleeding feet in the muddy water replacing the muddy rags about their wounds  a world without colour  no other colour to be seen beneath the sky but mud  the very buttons on the mens coats painted to make them look like mud  mud and dirt  dirty faces dirty hands dirty clothes dirty food dirty beds dirty interiors from which there was never time to wash the mud dirty linen hanging up to dry beneath which dirty children played while dirty women scolded  filth and desolation all around  shattered farmsteads half buried in the mud shattered gardens trampled into mud  a weary land of foulness breeding foulness tangled wire the only harvest of the fields mile after mile of gaping holes filled with muddy water stinking carcases of dead horses birds of prey clinging to broken fences flapping their great wings  a land where man died and vermin increased and multiplied  vermin on your body vermin in your head vermin in your food vermin waiting for you in your bed vermin the only thing that throve the only thing that looked at you with bright eyes vermin the only thing to which the joy of life had still been left  joan had found a liking gradually growing up in her for the quickmoving curttongued doctor  she had dismissed him at first as a mere butcher his brutal haste his indifference apparently to the suffering he was causing his great strong hairy hands with their squat fingers his cold grey eyes  but she learnt as time went by that his callousness was a thing that he put on at the same time that he tied his white apron round his waist and rolled up his sleeves  she was resting after a morning of grim work on a bench outside the hospital struggling with clenched quivering hands against a craving to fling herself upon the ground and sob  and he had found her there and had sat down beside her  so you wanted to see it with your own eyes he said  he laid his hand upon her shoulder and she had some difficulty in not catching hold of him and clinging to him  she was feeling absurdly womanish just at that moment  yes she answered  and im glad that i did it she added defiantly  so am i he said  tell your children what you have seen  tell other women  its you women that make war he continued  oh i dont mean that you do it on purpose but its in your blood  it comes from the days when to live it was needful to kill  when a man who was swift and strong to kill was the only thing that could save a woman and her brood  every other man that crept towards them through the grass was an enemy and her only hope was that her man might kill him while she watched and waited  and later came the tribe and instead of the one man creeping through the grass the everlasting warfare was against all other tribes  so you loved only the men ever ready and willing to fight lest you and your children should be carried into slavery then it was the only way  you brought up your boys to be fighters  you told them stories of their gallant sires  you sang to them the songs of battle the glory of killing and of conquering  you have never unlearnt the lesson  man has learnt comradeshipwould have travelled further but for you  but woman is still primitive  she would still have her man the hater and the killer  to the woman the world has never changed  tell the other women he said  open their eyes  tell them of their sons that you have seen dead and dying in the foolish quarrel for which there was no need  tell them of the foulness of the cruelty of the senselessness of it all  set the women against war  that is the only way to end it  it was a morning or two later that knocking at the door of her loft he asked her if she would care to come with him to the trenches  he had brought an outfit for her which he handed to her with a grin  she had followed folks advice and had cut her hair and when she appeared before him for inspection in trousers and overcoat the collar turned up about her neck and reaching to her helmet he had laughingly pronounced the experiment safe  a motor carried them to where the road ended and from there a little onehorse ambulance took them on to almost the last trees of the forest there was no life to be seen anywhere  during the last mile they had passed through a continuous double line of graves here and there a group of tiny crosses keeping one another company others standing singly looking strangely lonesome amid the tornup earth and shattered trees but even these had ceased  death itself seemed to have been frightened away from this terrorhaunted desert  looking down she could see thin wreaths of smoke rising from the ground  from underneath her feet there came a low faint ceaseless murmur  quick said the doctor  he pushed her in front of him and she almost fell down a flight of mudcovered steps that led into the earth  she found herself in a long low gallery lighted by a dim oil lamp suspended from the blackened roof  a shelf ran along one side of it covered with straw  three men lay there  the straw was soaked with their blood  they had been brought in the night before by the stretcher bearers  a young surgeon was rearranging their splints and bandages and redressing their wounds  they would lie there for another hour or so and then start for their twenty kilometre drive over shellridden roads to one or another of the great hospitals at the base  while she was there two more cases were brought in  the doctor gave but a glance at the first one and then made a sign and the bearers passed on with him to the further end of the gallery  he seemed to understand for he gave a low despairing cry and the tears sprang to his eyes  he was but a boy the other had a foot torn off  one of the orderlies gave him two round pieces of wood to hold in his hands while the young surgeon cut away the hanging flesh and bound up the stump  the doctor had been whispering to one of the bearers  he had the face of an old man but his shoulders were broad and he looked sturdy  he nodded and beckoned joan to follow him up the slippery steps  it is breakfast time he explained as they emerged into the air  we leave each other alone for half an houreven the snipers  but we must be careful  she followed in his footsteps stooping so low that her hands could have touched the ground  they had to be sure that they did not step off the narrow track marked with white stones lest they should be drowned in the mud  they passed the head of a dead horse  it looked as if it had been cut off and laid there the body was below it in the mud  they spoke in whispers and joan at first had made an effort to disguise her voice  but her conductor had smiled  they shall be called the brothers and the sisters of the lord he had said  mademoiselle is brave for her brothers sake  he was a priest  there were many priests among the stretcherbearers  crouching close to the ground behind the spreading roots of a giant oak she raised her eyes  before her lay a sea of smooth soft mud nearly a mile wide  from the centre rose a solitary tree from which all had been shot away but two bare branches like outstretched arms above the silence beyond the hills rose again  there was something unearthly in the silence that seemed to brood above that sea of mud  the old priest told her of the living men french and german who had stood there day and night sunk in it up to their waists screaming hour after hour and waving their arms sinking into it lower and lower none able to help them until at last only their screaming heads were left and after a time these too would disappear and the silence come again  she saw the ditches like long graves dug for the living where the weary listless men stood kneedeep in mud hoping for wounds that would relieve them from the ghastly monotony of their existence the holes of muddy water where the dead things lay to which they crept out in the night to wash a little of the filth from their clammy bodies and their stinking clothes the holes dug out of the mud in which they ate and slept and lived year after year till brain and heart and soul seemed to have died out of them and they remembered with an effort that they once were men        after a time the care of the convalescents passed almost entirely into joans hands madame lelanne being told off to assist her  by dint of much persistence she had succeeded in getting the leaky roof repaired and in place of the smoky stove that had long been her despair she had one night procured a fine calorifere by the simple process of stealing it  madame lelanne had heard about it from the gossips  it had been brought to a lonely house at the end of the village by a major of engineers  he had returned to the trenches the day before and the place for the time being was empty  the thieves were never discovered  the sentry was positive that no one had passed him but two women one of them carrying a baby  madame lelanne had dressed it up in a childs cloak and hood and had carried it in her arms  as it must have weighed nearly a couple of hundredweight suspicion had not attached to them  space did not allow of any separation broken frenchmen and broken germans would often lie side by side  joan would wonder with a grim smile to herself what the patriotic press of the different countries would have thought had they been there to have overheard the conversations  neither france nor germany appeared to be the enemy but a thing called they a mysterious power that worked its will upon them both from a place they always spoke of as back there  one day the talk fell on courage  a young french soldier was holding forth when joan entered the hut  it makes me laugh he was saying all this newspaper talk  every nation properly led fights bravely  it is the male instinct  women go into hysterics about it because it has not been given them  i have the croix de guerre with all three leaves and i havent half the courage of my dog who weighs twelve kilos and would face a regiment by himself why a game cock has got more than the best of us  its the man who doesnt think who cant think who has the most couragewho imagines nothing but just goes forward with his head down like a bull  there is of course a real courage  when you are by yourself and have to do something in cold blood  but the courage required for rushing forward shouting and yelling with a lot of other fellowswhy it would take a hundred times more pluck to turn back  they know that chimed in the man lying next to him or they would not drug us  why when we stormed la haye i knew nothing until an uglylooking german spat a pint of blood into my face and woke me up  a middleaged sergeant who had a wound in the stomach and was sitting up in his bed looked across  there was a line of germans came upon us he said at bras  i thought i must be suffering from a nightmare when i saw them  they had thrown away their rifles and had all joined hands they came dancing towards us just like a row of ballet girls  they were shrieking and laughing and they never attempted to do anything  we just waited until they were close up and then shot them down  it was like killing a lot of kids who had come to have a game with us  the one i potted got his arms round me before he coughed himself out calling me his liebe elsa and wanting to kiss me  lord  you can guess how the boche inkslingers spread themselves over that business sonderbar colossal  unvergessliche helden  poor devils  theyll give us ginger before it is over said another  he had had both his lips torn away and appeared to be always laughing  stuff it into us as if we were horses at a fair  that will make us run forward right enough  oh come struck in a youngster who was lying perfectly flat face downwards on his bed it was the position in which he could breathe easiest  he raised his head a couple of inches and twisted it round so as to get his mouth free  it isnt as bad as all that  why the thirty third swarmed into fort malmaison of their own accord though twas like jumping into a boiling furnace and held it for three days against pretty nearly a division  there werent a dozen of them left when we relieved them  they had no ammunition left  theyd just been filling up the gaps with their bodies  and they wouldnt go back even then  we had to drag them away  they shant pass they shant passthats all they kept saying  his voice had sunk to a thin whisper  a young officer was lying in a corner behind a screen  he leant forward and pushed it aside  oh give the devil his due you fellows he said  war isnt a pretty game but it does make for courage  we all know that  and things even finer than mere fighting pluck  there was a man in my company a jacques decrusy  he was just a stupid peasant lad  we were crowded into one end of the trench about a score of us  the rest of it had fallen in and we couldnt move  and a bomb dropped into the middle of us and the same instant that it touched the ground decrusy threw himself flat down upon it and took the whole of it into his body  there was nothing left of him but scraps  but the rest of us got off  nobody had drugged him to do that  there isnt one of us who was in that trench that will not be a better man to the end of his days remembering how jacques decrusy gave his life for ours  ill grant you all that sir answered the young soldier who had first spoken  he had long delicate hands and eager restless eyes  war does bring out heroism  so does pestilence and famine  read defoes account of the plague of london  how men and women left their safe homes to serve in the pesthouses knowing that sooner or later they were doomed read of the mothers in india who die of slow starvation never allowing a morsel of food to pass their lips so that they may save up their own small daily portion to add it to their childrens  why dont we pray to god not to withhold from us his precious medicine of pestilence and famine  so is shipwreck a fine school for courage  look at the chance it gives the captain to set a fine example  and the engineers who stick to their post with the water pouring in upon them  we dont reconcile ourselves to shipwrecks as a necessary school for sailors  we do our best to lessen them  so did persecution bring out heroism  it made saints and martyrs  why have we done away with it  if this game of killing and being killed is the fine school for virtue it is made out to be then all our efforts towards law and order have been a mistake  we never ought to have emerged from the jungle  he took a notebook from under his pillow and commenced to scribble  an oldlooking man spoke  he lay with his arms folded across his breast addressing apparently the smoky rafters  he was a russian a teacher of languages in paris at the outbreak of the war and had joined the french army  it is not only courage he said that war brings out  it brings out vile things too  oh im not thinking merely of the boches  thats the cant of every nation that all the heroism is on one side and all the brutality on the other  take men from anywhere and some of them will be devils  war gives them their opportunity brings out the beast  can you wonder at it  you teach a man to plunge a bayonet into the writhing flesh of a fellow human being and twist it round and round and jamb it further in while the blood is spurting from him like a fountain  what are you making of him but a beast  a mans got to be a beast before he can bring himself to do it  i have seen things done by our own men in cold blood the horror of which will haunt my memory until i die  but of course we hush it up when it happens to be our own people  he ceased speaking  no one seemed inclined to break the silence  they remained confused in her memory these talks among the wounded men in the low dimly lighted hut that had become her world  at times it was but two men speaking to one another in whispers at others every creaking bed would be drawn into the argument  one topic that never lost its interest was who made wars  who hounded the people into them and kept them there tearing at one anothers throats  they never settled it  god knows i didnt want it speaking personally said a german prisoner one day with a laugh  i had been working at a printing business sixteen hours a day for seven years  it was just beginning to pay me and now my wife writes me that she has had to shut the place up and sell the machinery to keep them all from starving  but couldnt you have done anything to stop it demanded a frenchman lying next to him  all your millions of socialists what were they up to  what went wrong with the internationale the universal brotherhood of labour and all that tralala  the german laughed again  oh they know their business he answered you have your glass of beer and go to bed and when you wake up in the morning you find that war has been declared and you keep your mouth shutunless you want to be shot for a traitor  not that it would have made much difference he added  i admit that  the ground had been too well prepared  england was envious of our trade  king edward had been plotting our destruction  our papers were full of translations from yours talking about la revanche  we were told that you had been lending money to russia to enable her to build railways and that when they were complete france and russia would fall upon us suddenly  the fatherland in danger  it may be lies or it may not what is one to do what would you have doneeven if you could have done anything  hes right said a dreamyeyed looking man laying down the book he had been reading  we should have done just the same  my country right or wrong  after all it is an ideal  a dark blackbearded man raised himself painfully upon his elbow  he was a tailor in the rue parnesse and prided himself on a decided resemblance to victor hugo  its a noble ideal he said  la patrie  the great mother  right or wrong who shall dare to harm her  yes if it was she who rose up in her majesty and called to us  he laughed  what does it mean in reality germania italia la france britannia  half a score of pompous old muddlers with their fat wives egging them on sons of the fools before them talkers who have wormed themselves into power by making frothy speeches and fine promises  my country he laughed again  look at them  cant you see their swelling paunches and their flabby faces half a score of ambitious politicians gouty old financiers baldheaded old toffs with their waxed moustaches and false teeth  thats what we mean when we talk about my country a pack of selfish soulless muddle headed old men  and whether theyre right or whether theyre wrong our duty is to fight at their biddingto bleed for them to die for them that they may grow more sleek and prosperous  he sank back on his pillow with another laugh  sometimes they agreed it was the newspapers that made warthat fanned every trivial difference into a vital question of national honourthat whenever there was any fear of peace restoked the fires of hatred with their neverfailing stories of atrocities  at other times they decided it was the capitalists the traders scenting profit for themselves  some held it was the politicians dreaming of going down to history as richelieus or as bismarcks  a popular theory was that cause for war was always discovered by the ruling classes whenever there seemed danger that the workers were getting out of hand  in war you put the common people back in their place revived in them the habits of submission and obedience  napoleon the little it was argued had started the war of 1870 with that idea  russia had welcomed the present war as an answer to the revolution that was threatening czardom  others contended it was the great munition industries aided by the military party the officers impatient for opportunities of advancement the strategists eager to put their theories to the test  a few of the more philosophical shrugged their shoulders  it was the thing itself that sooner or later was bound to go off of its own accord  half every countrys energy half every countrys time and money was spent in piling up explosives  in every country envy and hatred of every other country was preached as a religion  they called it patriotism  sooner or later the spark fell  a wizened little man had been listening to it all one day  he had a curiously ratlike face with round red twinkling eyes and a long pointed nose that twitched as he talked  ill tell you who makes all the wars he said  its you and me my dears we make the wars  we love them  thats why we open our mouths and swallow all the twaddle that the papers give us and cheer the fine blackcoated gentlemen when they tell us its our sacred duty to kill germans or italians or russians or anybody else  we are just crazy to kill something it doesnt matter what  if its to be germans we shout a berlin and if its to be russians we cheer for liberty  i was in paris at the time of the fashoda trouble  how we hissed the english in the cafes  and how they glared back at us  they were just as eager to kill us  who makes a dog fight  why the dog  anybody can do it  who could make us fight each other if we didnt want to  not all the kings horses and all the kings men  no my dears its we make the wars  you and me my dears  there came a day in early spring  all night long the guns had never ceased  it sounded like the tireless barking of ten thousand giant dogs behind the hills the whole horizon like a fiery circle was ringed with flashing light  shapeless forms bent beneath burdens passed in endless procession through the village  masses of rushing men swept like shadowy phantoms through the fitfullyillumined darkness  beneath that everlasting barking joan would hear now the piercing wail of a child now a clap of thunder that for the moment would drown all other sounds followed by a faint low rumbling crash like the shooting of coals into a cellar  the wounded on their beds lay with wideopen terrified eyes moving feverishly from side to side  at dawn the order came that the hospital was to be evacuated  the ambulances were already waiting in the street  joan flew up the ladder to her loft the other side of the yard  madame lelanne was already there  she had thrown a few things into a bundle and her foot was again upon the ladder when it seemed to her that someone struck her hurling her back upon the floor and the house the other side of the yard rose up into the air and then fell quite slowly and a cloud of dust hid it from her sight  madame lelanne must have carried her down the ladder  she was standing in the yard and the dust was choking her  across the street beyond the ruins of the hospital swarms of men were running about like ants when their nest has been disturbed  some were running this way and some that  and then they would turn and run back again making dancing movements round one another and jostling one another  the guns had ceased and instead it sounded as if all the babies in the world were playing with their rattles  suddenly madame lelanne reappeared out of the dust and seizing joan dragged her through a dark opening and down a flight of steps and then left her  she was in a great vaulted cellar  a faint light crept in through a grated window at the other end  there was a long table against the wall and in front of it a bench  she staggered to it and sat down leaning against the damp wall  the place was very silent  suddenly she began to laugh  she tried to stop herself but couldnt  and then she heard footsteps descending and her memory came back to her with a rush  they were german footsteps she felt sure by the sound they were so slow and heavy  they should not find her in hysterics anyhow  she fixed her teeth into the wooden table in front of her and held on to it with clenched hands  she had recovered herself before the footsteps had finished their descent  with a relief that made it difficult for her not to begin laughing again she found it was madame lelanne and monsieur dubos  they were carrying something between them she hardly recognized dubos at first  his beard was gone and a line of flaming scars had taken its place  they laid their burden on the table it was one of the wounded men from the hut  they told her they were bringing down two more  the hut itself had not been hit but the roof had been torn off by the force of the explosion and the others had been killed by the falling beams  joan wanted to return with them but madame lelanne had assumed an air of authority and told her she would be more useful where she was  from the top of the steps they threw down bundles of straw on which they laid the wounded men and joan tended them while madame lelanne and the little chemist went up and down continuously before evening the place considering all things was fairly habitable madame lelanne brought down the great stove from the hut and breaking a pane of glass in the barred window they fixed it up with its chimney and lighted it  from time to time the turmoil above them would break out again the rattling and sometimes a dull rumbling as of rushing water but only a faint murmur of it penetrated into the cellar  towards night it became quiet again  how long joan remained there she was never quite sure  there was little difference between day and night  after it had been quiet for an hour or so madame lelanne would go out to return a little later with a wounded man upon her back and when one died she would throw him across her shoulder and disappear again up the steps  sometimes it was a frenchman and sometimes a german she brought in  one gathered that the fight for the village still continued  there was but little they could do for them beyond dressing their wounds and easing their pain  joan and the little chemist took it in turns to relieve one another  if madame lelanne ever slept it was when she would sit in the shadow behind the stove her hands upon her knees  dubos had been in the house when it had fallen madame lelanne had discovered him pinned against a wall underneath a great oak beam that had withstood the falling debris  his beard had been burnt off but otherwise he had been unharmed  she seemed to be living in a dream  she could not shake from her the feeling that it was not bodies but souls that she was tending  the men themselves gave colour to this fancy of hers  stripped of their poor stained tattered uniforms they were neither french nor germans  friend or foe it was already but a memory  often awakening out of a sleep they would look across at one another and smile as to a comrade  a great peace seemed to have entered there  faint murmurs as from some distant troubled world would steal at times into the silence  it brought a pang of pity but it did not drive away the quiet that dwelt there  once someone who must have known the place and had descended the steps softly sat there among them and talked with them  joan could not remember seeing him enter  perhaps unknowing she had fallen to sleep for a few minutes  madame lelanne was seated by the stove her great coarse hands upon her knees her patient dull slowmoving eyes fixed upon the speakers face  dubos was half standing half resting against the table his arms folded upon his breast  the wounded men had raised themselves upon the straw and were listening  some leant upon their elbows some sat with their hands clasped round their knees and one with head bent down remained with his face hidden in his hands  the speaker sat a little way apart  the light from the oil lamp suspended from the ceiling fell upon his face  he wore a peasants blouse  it seemed to her a face she knew  possibly she had passed him in the village street and had looked at him without remembering  it was his eyes that for long years afterwards still haunted her  she did not notice at the time what language he was speaking  but there were none who did not understand him  you think of god as of a great king he said a ruler who orders all things who could change all things in the twinkling of an eye  you see the cruelty and the wrong around you  and you say to yourselves he has ordered it  if he would he could have willed it differently  so that in your hearts you are angry with him  how could it be otherwise  what father loving his children would see them suffer wrong when by stretching out a hand he could protect them turn their tears to gladness  what father would see his children doing evil to one another and not check them would see them following ways leading to their destruction and not pluck them back  if god has ordered all things why has he created evil making his creatures weak and sinful  does a father lay snares for his children leading them into temptation delivering them unto evil  there is no god apart from man  god is a spirit  his dwellingplace is in mans heart  we are his fellowlabourers  it is through man that he shall one day rule the world  god is knocking at your heart but you will not open to him  you have filled your hearts with love of self  there is no room for him to enter in  god whispers to you be pitiful  be merciful  be just  but you answer him if i am pitiful i lose my time and money  if i am merciful i forego advantage to myself  if i am just i lessen my own profit and another passes me in the race  and yet in your inmost thoughts you know that you are wrong that love of self brings you no peace  who is happier than the lover thinking only how to serve  who is the more joyous he who sits alone at the table or he who shares his meal with a friend  it is more blessed to give than to receive  how can you doubt it  for what do you toil and strive but that you may give to your children to your loved ones reaping the harvest of their good  who among you is the more honoured  the miser or the giver he who heaps up riches for himself or he who labours for others  who is the true soldier  he who has put away self  his own ease and comfort even his own needs his own safety they are but as a feather in the balance when weighed against his love for his comrades for his country  the true soldier is not afraid to love  he gives his life for his friend  do you jeer at him  do you say he is a fool for his pains no it is his honour his glory  god is love  why are you afraid to let him in  hate knocks also at your door and to him you open wide  why are you afraid of love  all things are created by love  hate can but destroy  why choose you death instead of life  god pleads to you  he is waiting for your help  and one answered him  we are but poor men he said  what can we do  of what use are such as we  the young man looked at him and smiled  you can ask that he said you a soldier  does the soldier say i am of no use  i am but a poor man of no account  who has need of such as i  god has need of all  there is none that shall not help to win the victory  it is with his life the soldier serves  who were they whose teaching moved the world more than it has ever yet been moved by the teaching of the wisest  they were men of little knowledge of but little learning poor and lowly  it was with their lives they taught  cast out self and god shall enter in and you shall be one with god for there is none so lowly that he may not become the temple of god there is none so great that he shall be greater than this  the speaker ceased  there came a faint sound at which she turned her head and when she looked again he was gone  the wounded men had heard it also  dubos had moved forward  madame lelanne had risen  it came again the thin faint shrill of a distant bugle  footsteps were descending the stairs  french soldiers laughing shouting were crowding round them     chapter xviii   her father met her at waterloo  he had business in london and they stayed on for a few days  reading between the lines of his later letters she had felt that all was not well with him  his old heart trouble had come back and she noticed that he walked to meet her very slowly  it would be all right now that she had returned he explained he had been worrying himself about her  mrs denton had died  she had left joan her library together with her wonderful collection of note books  she had brought them all uptodate and indexed them  they would be invaluable to francis when he started the new paper upon which they had determined  he was still in the hospital at breganze near to where his machine had been shot down  she had tried to get to him but it would have meant endless delays and she had been anxious about her father  the italian surgeons were very proud of him he wrote  they had had him xrayed before and after and beyond a slight lameness which gave him he thought a touch of distinction there was no flaw that the most careful scrutiny would be likely to detect  any day now he expected to be discharged  mary had married an old sweetheart  she had grown restless in the country with nothing to do and at the suggestion of some friends had gone to bristol to help in a childrens hospital and there they had met once more  neil singleton after serving two years in a cholera hospital at baghdad had died of the flu in dover twentyfours hours after landing  madge was in palestine  she had been appointed secretary to a committee for the establishment of native schools  she expected to be there for some years she wrote  the work was interesting and appealed to her  flossie phoned her from paddington station the second day and by luck she happened to be in  flossie had just come up from devonshire  sam had got through and she was on her way to meet him at hull  she had heard of joans arrival in london from one of carletons illustrated dailies  she brought the paper with her  they had used the old photograph that once had adorned each week the sunday post  joan hardly recognized herself in the serene selfconfident young woman who seemed to be looking down upon a world at her feet  the world was strong and cruel she had discovered and joans but small and weak  one had to pretend that one was not afraid of it  flossie had joined every society she could hear of that was working for the league of nations  her hope was that it would get itself established before young frank grew up  not that i really believe it will she confessed  a draw might have disgusted us all with fighting  as it is half the world is dancing at victory balls exhibiting captured guns on every village green and hanging fathers helmet above the mantelpiece while the other half is nursing its revenge  young frank only cares for life because he is looking forward to one day driving a tank  ive made up my mind to burn sams uniform but i expect it will end in my wrapping it up in lavender and hiding it away in a drawer  and then there will be all the books and plays  no selfrespecting heroine for the next ten years will dream of marrying anyone but a soldier  joan laughed  difficult to get anything else just at present she said  its the soldiers im looking to for help  i dont think the men who have been there will want their sons to go  its the women im afraid of  flossie caught sight of the clock and jumped up  who was it said that woman would be the last thing man would civilize she asked  it sounds like meredith suggested joan  i am not quite sure  well hes wrong anyhow retorted flossie  its no good our waiting for man  he is too much afraid of us to be of any real help to us  we shall have to do it ourselves  she gave joan a hug and was gone  phillips was still abroad with the army of occupation  he had tried to get out of it but had not succeeded  he held it to be gaolers work and the sight of the starving populace was stirring in him a fierce anger  he would not put up again for parliament  he was thinking of going back to his old work upon the union  parliament is played out he had written her  kings and aristocracies have served their purpose and have gone and now the ruling classes as they call themselves must be content to hear the bell toll for them also  parliament was never anything more than an instrument in their hands and never can be  what happens  once in every five years you wake the people up tell them the time has come for them to exercise their heavenordained privilege of putting a cross against the names of some seven hundred gentlemen who have kindly expressed their willingness to rule over them  after that you send the people back to sleep and for the next five years these seven hundred gentlemen consulting no one but themselves rule over the country as absolutely as ever a caesar ruled over rome  what sort of democracy is that  even a labour governmentsupposing that in spite of the press it did win throughwhat would be its fate  separated from its base imprisoned within those traditionhaunted walls it would lose touch with the people would become in its turn a mere oligarchy  if the people are ever to govern they must keep their hand firmly upon the machine not remain content with pulling a lever and then being shown the door  she had sent a note by messenger to mary stopperton to say she was coming  mary had looked very fragile the last time she had seen her just before leaving for france and she had felt a fear  mary had answered in her neat thin quavering writing asking her to come early in the morning  sometimes she was a little tired and had to lie down again  she had been waiting for joan  she had a present for her  the morning promised to be fair and she decided to walk by way of the embankment  the great river with its deep strong patience had always been a friend to her  it was sunday and the city was still sleeping  the pale december sun rose above the mist as she reached the corner of westminster bridge turning the river into silver and flooding the silent streets with a soft white tender light  the tower of chelsea church brought back to her remembrance of the wheezy old clergyman who had preached there that sunday evening that now seemed so long ago when her footsteps had first taken her that way by chance always she had intended making inquiries and discovering his name  why had she never done so  it would surely have been easy  he was someone she had known as a child  she had become quite convinced of that  she could see his face close to hers as if he had lifted her up in his arms and was smiling at her  but pride and power had looked out of his eyes then  it was earlier than the time she had fixed in her own mind and pausing with her elbows resting on the granite parapet she watched the ceaseless waters returning to the sea bearing their burden of impurities  all roads lead to calvary  it was curious how the words had dwelt with her till gradually they had become a part of her creed  she remembered how at first they had seemed to her a threat chilling her with fear  they had grown to be a promise a hope held out to all  the road to calvary it was the road to life  by the giving up of self we gained god  and suddenly a great peace came to her  one was not alone in the fight god was with us the great comrade  the evil and the cruelty all round her she was no longer afraid of it  god was coming  beyond the menace of the passing day black with the wars foul aftermath of evil dreams and hatreds she saw the breaking of the distant dawn  the devil should not always triumph  god was gathering his labourers  god was conquering  unceasing through the ages gods voice had crept round man seeking entry  through the long darkness of that dim beginning when man knew no law but self unceasing god had striven until at last one here and there emerging from the brute had heardhad listened to the voice of love and pity and in that hour unknowing had built to god a temple in the wilderness  labourers together with god  the mighty host of those who through the ages had heard the voice of god and had made answer  the men and women in all lands who had made room in their hearts for god  still nameless scattered unknown to one another still powerless as yet against the worlds foul law of hate they should continue to increase and multiply until one day they should speak with gods voice and should be heard  and a new world should be created  god  the tireless spirit of eternal creation the spirit of love  what else was it that out of formlessness had shaped the spheres had planned the orbits of the suns  the law of gravity we named it  what was it but another name for love the yearning of like for like the calling to one another of the stars  what else but love had made the worlds had gathered together the waters had fashioned the dry land  the cohesion of elements so we explained it  the clinging of like to like  the brotherhood of the atoms  god  the eternal creator  out of matter lifeless void he had moulded his worlds had ordered his endless firmament  it was finished  the greater task remained the universe of mind of soul  out of man it should be created  god in man and man in god made in like image fellow labourers together with one another together they should build it  out of the senseless strife and discord above the chaos and the tumult should be heard the new command let there be love  the striking of the old church clock recalled her to herself  but she had only a few minutes walk before her  mary had given up her church work  it included the cleaning and she had found it beyond her failing strength  but she still lived in the tiny cottage behind its long strip of garden  the door yielded to joans touch it was seldom fast closed and knowing marys ways she entered without knocking and pushed it to behind her leaving it still ajar  and as she did so it seemed to her that someone passing breathed upon her lips a little kiss and for a while she did not move  then treading softly she looked into the room  it welcomed her as always with its smile of cosy neatness  the spotless curtains that were marys pride the gay flowers in the window to which she had given childrens names the few poor pieces of furniture polished with much loving labour the shining grate the foolish china dogs and the little china house between them on the mantelpiece  the fire was burning brightly and the kettle was singing on the hob  marys work was finished  she sat upright in her straightbacked chair before the table her eyes half closed  it seemed so odd to see those little workworn hands idle upon her lap  joans present lay on the table near to her as if she had just folded it and placed it there the little cap and the fine robe of lawn as if for a kings child  joan had never thought that death could be so beautiful  it was as if some friend had looked in at the door and seeing her so tired had taken the work gently from her hands and had folded them upon her lap and she had yielded with a smile  joan heard a faint rustle and looked up  a woman had entered  it was the girl she had met there on a christmas day a miss ensor  joan had met her once or twice since then  she was still in the chorus  neither of them spoke for a few minutes  i have been expecting every morning to find her gone said the girl  i think she only waited to finish this  she gently unfolded the fine lawn robe and they saw the delicate insertion and the wonderful embroidery  i asked her once said the girl why she wasted so much work on them they were mostly only for poor people  one never knows dearie she answered with that childish smile of hers  it may be for a little christ  they would not let less loving hands come near her        her father had completed his business and both were glad to leave london  she had a sense of something sinister foreboding casting its shadow on the sordid unclean streets the neglected buildings falling into disrepair  a lurking savagery a halfveiled enmity seemed to be stealing among the people  the towns mad lust for pleasure its fierce unjoyous laughter its desire ever to be in crowds as if afraid of itself its orgies of eating and drinking its animallike indifference to the misery and death that lay but a little way beyond its own horizon she dared not remember history  perhaps it would pass  the long slow journey tried her fathers strength and assuming an authority to which he yielded obedience tempered by grumbling joan sent him to bed and would not let him come down till christmas day  the big square house was on the outskirts of the town where it was quiet and in the afternoon they walked in the garden sheltered behind its high brick wall  he told her of what had been done at the works  arthurs plan had succeeded  it might not be the last word but at least it was on the road to the right end  the men had been brought into it and shared the management  and the disasters predicted had proved groundless  you wont be able to indulge in all your mad schemes he laughed but therell be enough to help on a few  and you will be among friends arthur told me he had explained it to you and that you had agreed  yes she answered  it was the last time he came to see me in london and i could not help feeling a bit jealous  he was doing things while i was writing and talking  but i was glad he was an allway  it will be known as the allway scheme  new ways will date from it  she had thought it time for him to return indoors but he pleaded for a visit to his beloved roses  he prided himself on being always able to pick roses on christmas day  this young man of yours he asked what is he like  oh just a christian gentleman she answered  you will love him when you know him  he laughed  and this new journal of his he asked  its got to be published in london hasnt it  she gave a slight start for in their letters to one another they had been discussing this very point  no she answered it could be circulated just as well from say birmingham or manchester  he was choosing his roses  they held their petals wrapped tight round them trying to keep the cold from their brave hearts  in the warmth they would open out and be gay until the end  not liverpool he suggested  or even liverpool she laughed  they looked at one another and then beyond the sheltering evergreens and the wide lawns to where the great square house seemed to be listening  its an ugly old thing he said  no it isnt she contradicted  its simple and big and kind  i always used to feel it disapproved of me  i believe it has come to love me in its solemn old brick way  it was built by kent in seventeenforty for your greatgreat grandfather he explained  he was regarding it more affectionately solid respectability was the dream then  i think thats why i love it she said for its dear oldfashioned ways  we will teach it the new dreams too  it will be so shocked at first  they dined in state in the great diningroom  i was going to buy you a present he grumbled  but you wouldnt let me get up  i want to give you something quite expensive dad she said  ive had my eye on it for years  she slipped her hand in his  i want you to give me that dream of yours that you built for my mother and that all went wrong  they call it allways folly and it makes me so mad  i want to make it all come true may i try        it was there that he came to her  she stood beneath the withered trees beside the shattered fountain  the sadfaced ghosts peeped out at her from the broken windows of the little silent houses  she wondered later why she had not been surprised to see him  but at the time it seemed to be in the order of things that she should look up and find him there  she went to him with outstretched arms  im so glad youve come she said  i was just wanting you  they sat on the stone step of the fountain where they were sheltered from the wind and she buttoned his long coat about him  do you think you will go on doing it he asked with a laugh  im so afraid she answered gravely  that i shall come to love you too much the home the children and you  i shall have none left over  there is an old hindoo proverb he said that when a man and woman love they dig a fountain down to god  this poor little chokedup thing he said against which we are sitting its for want of men and women drawing water of children dabbling their hands in it and making themselves all wet that it has run dry  she took his hands in hers to keep them warm  the nursing habit seemed to have taken root in her  i see your argument she said  the more i love you the deeper will be the fountain  so that the more love i want to come to me the more i must love you  dont you see it for yourself he demanded  she broke into a little laugh  perhaps you are right she admitted  perhaps that is why he made us male and female to teach us to love  a robin broke into a song of triumph  he had seen the sadfaced ghosts steal silently away
