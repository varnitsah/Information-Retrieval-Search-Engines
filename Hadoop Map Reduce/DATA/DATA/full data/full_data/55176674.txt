champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day after all the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp  now few of us know the real life of the stage people if we did the profession might be more overcrowded than it is we look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiorityand we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our looking glasses  latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light it seems to have been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalians and diamondhungry loreleis they are businesslike folk students and ascetics with childer and homes and libraries owning real estate and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas rent coal ice and wardmen  whether the old or the new report of the sockandbuskiners be the true one is a surmise that has no place here i offer you merely this little story of two strollers and for proof of its truth i can show you only the dark patch above the castiron of the stageentrance door of keetors old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumblatchand where i last saw cherry whisking through like a swallow into her nest on time to the minute as usual to dress for her act  the vaudeville team of hart  cherry was an inspiration bob hart had been roaming through the eastern and western circuits for four years with a mixedup act comprising a monologue three lightning changes with songs a couple of imitations of celebrated imitators and a buckandwing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bassviol player in more than one housethan which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of good work  the greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage in order to give himself this pleasure he will often forsake the sunniest broadway corner between thirtyfourth and fortyfourth to attend a matinée offering by his less gifted brothers once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of thespian musclesthe audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other  one afternoon bob hart presented his solvent serious wellknown vaudevillian face at the boxoffice window of a rival attraction and got his d h coupon for an orchestra seat  a b c and d glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into oblivion each plunging mr hart deeper into gloom others of the audience shrieked squirmed whistled and applauded but bob hart all the mustard and a whole show in himself sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball  but when h came on the mustard suddenly sat up straight h was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of winona cherry in character songs and impersonations there were scarcely more than two bites to cherry but she delivered the merchandise tied with a pink cord and charged to the old mans account she first showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log schoolhouse besides cipherin and nouns especially when the teacher kept me in vanishing with a quick flirt of gingham apronstrings she reappeared in considerably less than a trice as a fluffy parisienneso near does art bring the old red mill to the moulin rouge and then  but you know the rest and so did bob hart but he saw somebody else he thought he saw that cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed exactly to fit the part of helen grimes in the sketch he had written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk of course bob hart as well as every other normal actor grocer newspaper man professor curb broker and farmer has a play tucked away somewhere they tuck em in trays of trunks trunks of trees desks haymows pigeonholes inside pockets safedeposit vaults handboxes and coal cellars waiting for mr frohman to call they belong among the fiftyseven different kinds  but bob harts sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar he called it mice will play he had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it waiting to find a partner who fitted his conception of helen grimes and here was helen herself with all the innocent abandon the youth the sprightliness and the flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded  after the act was over hart found the manager in the box office and got cherrys address at five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the west forties and sent up his professional card  by daylight in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt with her hair curbed and her sister of charity eyes winona cherry might have been playing the part of prudence wise the deacons daughter in the great unwritten new england drama not yet entitled anything  i know your act mr hart she said after she had looked over his card carefully what did you wish to see me about  i saw you work last night said hart ive written a sketch that ive been saving up its for two and i think you can do the other part i thought id see you about it  come in the parlor said miss cherry ive been wishing for something of the sort i think id like to act instead of doing turns  bob hart drew his cherished mice will play from his pocket and read it to her  read it again please said miss cherry  and then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol and by completely changing the lines and business of helen grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her hart yielded to all her strictures without argument she had at once put her finger on the sketchs weaker points that was her womans intuition that he had lacked at the end of their talk hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum  mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the fortyfourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and ive seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now  two hundred answered hart  i get one hundred for mine said cherry thats about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but theres something else i love betterthats a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard  now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch ill do it and i believe we can make it go and theres something else i want to say theres no nonsense in my makeup im on the level and im on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices im going to save my money to keep me when im past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me  if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it im in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that im on the stage for what i can cart away from it every payday in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap its kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i dont know what an allnight restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and ive got money in five savings banks  miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones youre in on your own terms ive got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my makeup box when i dream of nights i always see a fiveroom bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry  not any said cherry what im going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary ive been earning ive figured out that in ten years id have an income of about 50 a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little businesssay trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more  well said hart youve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldnt fix themselves for the wet days to come if theyd save their money instead of blowing it im glad youve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up  the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart  cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistolput the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement  they rehearsed it by the oldfashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch  yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real 32caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the private secretary and confidential prospective soninlaw of her father arapahoe grimes quartermilliondollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagansett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em  well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or notsomething along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian  there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the managers orders  there was another girl in the sketcha fifth avenue society swellesswho was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy clubman on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic statejack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amaganof the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course  and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one nightso helen informs us in a stageferryboat whisper over the footlightswhile only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had 647000 in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak  gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe dont you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girlwho doesnt come on the stageand can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much  but wait heres the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop 647000 and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoidfever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then  they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didnt the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the dénouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends  helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the boxoffice manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadnt left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage doorman unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility  goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thiefand worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate  with that out she whips of course the trusty 32caliber  but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall livethat will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart  and she does it and theres no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bulletthe actual bulletgoes through the face of the photographand then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the walland lo the panel slides and there is the missing 647000 in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold its great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time  of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadnt taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a halfnelsonand there you are  after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a tryout at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears  after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out  that night at 1130 bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boardinghouse door  mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes weve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can  right said bob its business with me youve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention  come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful ive got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mineand all on business principles   mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeksrather neat for a vaudeville sketchand then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity  sam packard manager of one of keetors new york houses said of hart  cherry  as square and hightoned a little team as ever came over the circuit its a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i dont expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession  and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story  at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the topnotch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savingsdeposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them  i tell you these things to assure you even if you cant believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitionsjust the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the countpan into the princefire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform  but listen  at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob harts neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner  the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart  cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell  the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am bty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily  no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlorfloor practitioner on your block and youll be all right excuse me ive got a serious case outside to look after  after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart  cherry and was their peripatetic friend  bob said vincente in his serious way im glad its no worse the little lady is wild about you  who asked hart  cherry said the juggler we didnt know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away its taking the manager and three girls to hold her  it was an accident of course said hart cherrys all right she wasnt feeling in good trim or she couldnt have done it theres no hard feelings shes strictly business the doctor says ill be on the job again in three days dont let her worry  man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherrys crying her heart out for youcalling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you  whats the matter with her asked hart with wideopen eyes the sketchll go on again in three days im not hurt bad the doctor says she wont lose out half a weeks salary i know it was an accident whats the matter with her  you seem to be blind or a sort of a fool said vincente the girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt whats the matter with you is she nothing to you i wish you could hear her call you  loves me asked bob hart rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay cherry loves me why its impossible  i wish you could see her and hear her said griggs  but man said bob hart sitting up its impossible its impossible i tell you i never dreamed of such a thing  no human being said the tramp juggler could mistake it shes wild for love of you how have you been so blind  but my god said bob hart rising to his feet its too late its too late i tell you sam its too late it cant be you must be wrong its impossible theres some mistake  shes crying for you said the tramp juggler for love of you shes fighting three and calling your name so loud they dont dare to raise the curtain wake up man  for love of me said bob hart with staring eyes dont i tell you its too late its too late man why cherry and i have been married two years      ii  the gold that glittered   a story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito it bores you and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it all is not gold that glitters but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid  where broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by george the veracious is the little rialto here stand the actors of that quarter and this is their shibboleth nit says i to frohman you cant touch me for a kopeck less than twofifty per and out i walks  westward and southward from the thespian glare are one or two streets where a spanishamerican colony has huddled for a little tropical warmth in the nipping north the centre of life in this precinct is el refugio a café and restaurant that caters to the volatile exiles from the south up from chili bolivia colombia the rolling republics of central america and the ireful islands of the western indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed señores who are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their several countries hither they come to lay counterplots to bide their time to solicit funds to enlist filibusterers to smuggle out arms and ammunitions to play the game at long taw in el refugio they find the atmosphere in which they thrive  in the restaurant of el refugio are served compounds delightful to the palate of the man from capricorn or cancer altruism must halt the story thus long on diner weary of the culinary subterfuges of the gallic chef hie thee to el refugio there only will you find a fishbluefish shad or pompano from the gulfbaked after the

origin do not say that garlic is in the fish at el refugio it is not otherwise than as if the spirit of garlic flitting past has wafted one kiss that lingers in the parsleycrowned dish as haunting as those kisses in life by hopeless fancy feigned on lips that are for others and then when conchito the waiter brings you a plate of brown frijoles and a carafe of wine that has never stood still between oporto and el refugioah dios  one day a hamburgamerican liner deposited upon pier no 55 gen perrico ximenes villablanca falcon a passenger from cartagena the general was between a claybank and a bay in complexion had a 42inch waist and stood 5 feet 4 with his du barry heels he had the mustache of a shootinggallery proprietor he wore the full dress of a texas congressman and had the important aspect of an uninstructed delegate  gen falcon had enough english under his hat to enable him to inquire his way to the street in which el refugio stood when he reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a respectable redbrick house that read hotel español in the window was a card in spanish aqui se habla español the general entered sure of a congenial port  in the cozy office was mrs obrien the proprietress she had blondoh unimpeachably blond hair for the rest she was amiability and ran largely to inches around gen falcon brushed the floor with his broadbrimmed hat and emitted a quantity of spanish the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping their way down the string of a bunch  spanish or dago asked mrs obrien pleasantly  i am a colombian madam said the general proudly i speak the spanish the advisement in your window say the spanish he is spoken here how is that  well youve been speaking it aint you said the madam im sure i cant  at the hotel español general falcon engaged rooms and established himself at dusk he sauntered out upon the streets to view the wonders of this roaring city of the north as he walked he thought of the wonderful golden hair of mme obrien it is here said the general to himself no doubt in his own language that one shall find the most beautiful señoras in the world i have not in my colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair but no it is not for the general falcon to think of beauty it is my country that claims my devotion  at the corner of broadway and the little rialto the general became involved the street cars bewildered him and the fender of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges a cab driver missed him an inch with a hub and poured barbarous execrations upon his head he scrambled to the sidewalk and skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanutroaster puffed a hot scream in his ear válgame dios what devils city is this  as the general fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two hunters one was bully mcguire whose system of sport required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eightinch piece of lead pipe the other nimrod of the asphalt was spider kelley a sportsman with more refined methods  in pouncing upon their selfevident prey mr kelley was a shade the quicker his elbow fended accurately the onslaught of mr mcguire  gwan he commanded harshly i saw it first mcguire slunk away awed by superior intelligence  pardon me said mr kelley to the general but you got balled up in the shuffle didnt you let me assist you he picked up the generals hat and brushed the dust from it  the ways of mr kelley could not but succeed the general bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets welcomed his deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart  i have a desire said the general to return to the hotel of obrien in which i am stop caramba señor there is a loudness and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this nueva york  mr kelleys politeness would not suffer the distinguished colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied at the door of the hotel español they paused a little lower down on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated sign of el refugio mr kelley to whom few streets were unfamiliar knew the place exteriorly as a dago joint all foreigners mr kelley classed under the two heads of dagoes and frenchmen he proposed to the general that they repair thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid foundation  an hour later found general falcon and mr kelley seated at a table in the conspirators corner of el refugio bottles and glasses were between them for the tenth time the general confided the secret of his mission to the estados unidos he was here he declared to purchase arms2000 stands of winchester riflesfor the colombian revolutionists he had drafts in his pocket drawn by the cartagena bank on its new york correspondent for 25000 at other tables other revolutionists were shouting their political secrets to their fellowplotters but none was as loud as the general he pounded the table he hallooed for some wine he roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one and not to be hinted at to a living soul mr kelley himself was stirred to sympathetic enthusiasm he grasped the generals hand across the table  monseer he said earnestly i dont know where this country of yours is but im for it i guess it must be a branch of the united states though for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us columbia too sometimes its a lucky thing for you that you butted into me tonight im the only man in new york that can get this gun deal through for you the secretary of war of the united states is me best friend hes in the city now and ill see him for you tomorrow in the meantime monseer you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket ill call for you tomorrow and take you to see him say that aint the district of columbia youre talking about is it concluded mr kelley with a sudden qualm you cant capture that with no 2000 gunsits been tried with more  no no no exclaimed the general it is the republic of colombiait is a grreat republic on the top side of america of the south yes yes  all right said mr kelley reassured now suppose we trek along home and go byby ill write to the secretary tonight and make a date with him its a ticklish job to get guns out of new york mcclusky himself cant do it  they parted at the door of the hotel español the general rolled his eyes at the moon and sighed  it is a great country your nueva york he said truly the cars in the streets devastate one and the engine that cooks the nuts terribly makes a squeak in the ear but ah señor kelleythe señoras with hair of much goldness and admirable fatnessthey are magnificas muy magnificas  kelley went to the nearest telephone booth and called up mccrarys café far up on broadway he asked for jimmy dunn  is that jimmy dunn asked kelley  yes came the answer  youre a liar sang back kelley joyfully youre the secretary of war wait there till i come up ive got the finest thing down here in the way of a fish you ever baited for its a coloradomaduro with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of psyche rubbering in the brook ill be up on the next car  jimmy dunn was an a m of crookdom he was an artist in the confidence line he never saw a bludgeon in his life and he scorned knockout drops in fact he would have set nothing before an intended victim but the purest of drinks if it had been possible to procure such a thing in new york it was the ambition of spider kelley to elevate himself into jimmys class  these two gentlemen held a conference that night at mccrarys kelley explained  hes as easy as a gumshoe hes from the island of colombia where theres a strike or a feud or something going on and theyve sent him up here to buy 2000 winchesters to arbitrate the thing with he showed me two drafts for 10000 each and one for 5000 on a bank here s truth jimmy i felt real mad with him because he didnt have it in thousanddollar bills and hand it to me on a silver waiter now weve got to wait till he goes to the bank and gets the money for us  they talked it over for two hours and then dunn said bring him to no  broadway at four oclock tomorrow afternoon  in due time kelley called at the hotel español for the general he found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with mrs obrien  the secretary of war is waitin for us said kelley  the general tore himself away with an effort  ay señor he said with a sigh duty makes a call but señor the señoras of your estados unidoshow beauties for exemplification take you la madame obrienque magnifica she is one goddessone junowhat you call one oxeyed juno  now mr kelley was a wit and better men have been shriveled by the fire of their own imagination  sure he said with a grin but you mean a peroxide juno dont you  mrs obrien heard and lifted an auriferous head her businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form of mr kelley except in street cars one should never be unnecessarily rude to a lady  when the gallant colombian and his escort arrived at the broadway address they were held in an anteroom for half an hour and then admitted into a wellequipped office where a distinguished looking man with a smooth face wrote at a desk general falcon was presented to the secretary of war of the united states and his mission made known by his old friend mr kelley  ahcolombia said the secretary significantly when he was made to understand im afraid there will be a little difficulty in that case the president and i differ in our sympathies there he prefers the established government while i the secretary gave the general a mysterious but encouraging smile you of course know general falcon that since the tammany war an act of congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and ammunition exported from this country to pass through the war department now if i can do anything for you i will be glad to do so to oblige my old friend mr kelley but it must be in absolute secrecy as the president as i have said does not regard favorably the efforts of your revolutionary party in colombia i will have my orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse  the secretary struck a bell and an orderly with the letters a d t on his cap stepped promptly into the room  bring me schedule b of the small arms inventory said the secretary  the orderly quickly returned with a printed paper the secretary studied it closely  i find he said that in warehouse 9 of government stores there is shipment of 2000 stands of winchester rifles that were ordered by the sultan of morocco who forgot to send the cash with his order our rule is that legaltender money must be paid down at the time of purchase my dear kelley your friend general falcon shall have this lot of arms if he desires it at the manufacturers price and you will forgive me i am sure if i curtail our interview i am expecting the japanese minister and charles murphy every moment  as one result of this interview the general was deeply grateful to his esteemed friend mr kelley as another the nimble secretary of war was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty rifle cases and filling them with bricks which were then stored in a warehouse rented for that purpose as still another when the general returned to the hotel español mrs obrien went up to him plucked a thread from his lapel and said  say señor i dont want to butt in but what does that monkeyfaced cateyed rubbernecked tin horn tough want with you  sangre de mi vida exclaimed the general impossible it is that you speak of my good friend señor kelley  come into the summer garden said mrs obrien i want to have a talk with you  let us suppose that an hour has elapsed  and you say said the general that for the sum of 18000 can be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one year with this garden so lovelyso resembling unto the patios of my cara colombia  and dirt cheap at that sighed the lady  ah dios breathed general falcon what to me is war and politics this spot is one paradise my country it have other brave heroes to continue the fighting what to me should be glory and the shooting of mans ah no it is here i have found one angel let us buy the hotel español and you shall be mine and the money shall not be waste on guns  mrs obrien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of the colombian patriot  oh señor she sighed happily aint you terrible  two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms to the general the boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the rented warehouse and the secretary of war sat upon them waiting for his friend kelley to fetch the victim  mr kelley hurried at the hour to the hotel español he found the general behind the desk adding up accounts  i have decide said the general to buy not guns i have today buy the insides of this hotel and there shall be marrying of the general perrico ximenes villablanca falcon with la madame obrien  mr kelley almost strangled  say you old baldheaded bottle of shoe polish he spluttered youre a swindlerthats what you are youve bought a boarding house with money belonging to your infernal country wherever it is  ah said the general footing up a column that is what you call politics war and revolution they are not nice yes it is not best that one shall always follow minerva no it is of quite desirable to keep hotels and be with that junothat oxeyed juno ah what hair of the gold it is that she have  mr kelley choked again  ah senor kelley said the general feelingly and finally is it that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that madame obrien she make      iii  babes in the jungle   montague silver the finest street man and art grafter in the west says to me once in little rock if you ever lose your mind billy and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men go to new york in the west a sucker is born every minute but in new york they appear in chunks of roeyou cant count em  two years afterward i found that i couldnt remember the names of the russian admirals and i noticed some gray hairs over my left ear so i knew the time had arrived for me to take silvers advice  i struck new york about noon one day and took a walk up broadway and i run against silver himself all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery leaning against a hotel and rubbing the halfmoons on his nails with a silk handkerchief  paresis or superannuated i asks him  hello billy says silver im glad to see you yes it seemed to me that the west was accumulating a little too much wiseness ive been saving new york for dessert i know its a lowdown trick to take things from these people they only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon id hate for my mother to know i was skinning these weakminded ones she raised me better  is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting i asks  well no says silver you neednt back epidermis to win today ive only been here a month but im ready to begin and the members of willie manhattans sunday school class each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation may as well send their photos to the evening daily  ive been studying the town says silver and reading the papers every day and i know it as well as the cat in the city hall knows an osullivan people here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them come up in my room and ill tell you well work the town together billy for the sake of old times  silver takes me up in a hotel he has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about  theres more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds says silver than there is of cooking rice in charleston s c theyll bite at anything the brains of most of em commute the wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have why didnt a man the other day sell j p morgan an oil portrait of rockefeller jr for andrea del sartos celebrated painting of the young saint john  you see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner billy thats gold mining stock i started out one day to sell that but i quit it in two hours why got arrested for blocking the street people fought to buy it i sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the stationhouse and then i took it off the market i dont want people to give me their money i want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt i want em to guess the missing letter in chicgo or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money  now theres another little scheme that worked so easy i had to quit it you see that bottle of blue ink on the table i tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told em i was admiral deweys nephew they offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand but i didnt know my uncles first name it shows though what an easy town it is as for burglars they wont go in a house now unless theres a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on em theyre slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and i guess taking the town from end to end its a plain case of assault and battery  monty says i when silver had slacked up you may have manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative but i doubt it ive only been in town two hours but it dont dawn upon me that its ours with a cherry in it there aint enough rus in urbe about it to suit me id be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms they dont look easy to me  youve got it billy says silver all emigrants have it new yorks bigger than little rock or europe and it frightens a foreigner youll be all right i tell you i feel like slapping the people here because they dont send me all their money in laundry baskets with germicide sprinkled over it i hate to go down on the street to get it who wears the diamonds in this town why winnie the wiretappers wife and bella the buncosteerers bride new yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy the only thing that bothers me is i know ill break the cigars in my vest pocket when i get my clothes all full of twenties  i hope you are right monty says i but i wish all the same i had been satisfied with a small business in little rock the crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for 200 at the county bank the people here appear to possess instincts of selfpreservation and illiberality i fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game  dont worry says silver ive got this jayvilleneartarrytown correctly estimated as sure as north river is the hudson and east river aint a river why there are people living in four blocks of broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives a good live hustling western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either jeromes clemency or lawsons displeasure  hyperbole aside says i do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the salvation army or having a fit on miss helen goulds doorsteps  dozens of em says silver how much capital have you got billy  a thousand i told him  ive got 1200 says he well pool and do a big piece of business theres so many ways we can make a million that i dont know how to begin  the next morning silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy  were to meet j p morgan this afternoon says he a man i know in the hotel wants to introduce us hes a friend of his he says he likes to meet people from the west  that sounds nice and plausible says i id like to know mr morgan  it wont hurt us a bit says silver to get acquainted with a few finance kings i kind of like the social way new york has with strangers  the man silver knew was named klein at three oclock klein brought his wall street friend to see us in silvers room mr morgan looked some like his pictures and he had a turkish towel wrapped around his left foot and he walked with a cane  mr silver and mr pescud says klein it sounds superfluous says he to mention the name of the greatest financial  cut it out klein says mr morgan im glad to know you gents i take great interest in the west klein tells me youre from little rock i think ive a railroad or two out there somewhere if either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker i  now pierpont cuts in klein you forget  excuse me gents says morgan since ive had the gout so bad i sometimes play a social game of cards at my house neither of you never knew oneeyed peters did you while you was around little rock he lived in seattle new mexico  before we could answer mr morgan hammers on the floor with his cane and begins to walk up and down swearing in a loud tone of voice  they have been pounding your stocks today on the street pierpont asks klein smiling  stocks no roars mr morgan its that picture i sent an agent to europe to buy i just thought about it he cabled me today that it aint to be found in all italy id pay 50000 tomorrow for that pictureyes 75000 i give the agent a la carte in purchasing it i cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a de vinchy to  why mr morgan says klein i thought you owned all of the de vinchy paintings  what is the picture like mr morgan asks silver it must be as big as the side of the flatiron building  im afraid your art education is on the bum mr silver says morgan the picture is 27 inches by 42 and it is called loves idle hour it represents a number of cloak models doing the twostep on the bank of a purple river the cablegram said it might have been brought to this country my collection will never be complete without that picture well so long gents us financiers must keep early hours  mr morgan and klein went away together in a cab me and silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was and silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like mr morgan and i said i thought it would be rather imprudent myself klein proposes a stroll after dinner and me and him and silver walks down toward seventh avenue to see the sights klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window and we all go in while he buys em  after we got back to the hotel and klein had gone silver jumps at me and waves his hands  did you see it says he did you see it billy  what i asks  why that picture that morgan wants its hanging in that pawnshop behind the desk i didnt say anything because klein was there its the article sure as you live the girls are as natural as paint can make them all measuring 36 and 25 and 42 skirts if they had any skirts and theyre doing a buckandwing on the bank of a river with the blues what did mr morgan say hed give for it oh dont make me tell you they cant know what it is in that pawnshop  when the pawnshop opened the next morning me and silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our sunday suit to buy a drink we sauntered inside and began to look at watchchains  thats a violent specimen of a chromo youve got up there remarked silver casual to the pawnbroker but i kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting would an offer of 225 for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail  the pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watchchains  that picture says he was pledged a year ago by an italian gentleman i loaned him 500 on it it is called loves idle hour and it is by leonardo de vinchy two days ago the legal time expired and it became an unredeemed pledge here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now  at the end of half an hour me and silver paid the pawnbroker 2000 and walked out with the picture silver got into a cab with it and started for morgans office i goes to the hotel and waits for him in two hours silver comes back  did you see mr morgan i asks how much did he pay you for it  silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover  i never exactly saw mr morgan he says because mr morgans been in europe for a month but whats worrying me billy is this the department stores have all got that same picture on sale framed for 348 and they charge 350 for the frame alonethats what i cant understand      iv  the day resurgent   i can see the artist bite the end of his pencil and frown when it comes to drawing his easter picture for his legitimate pictorial conceptions of figures pertinent to the festival are but four in number  first comes easter pagan goddess of spring here his fancy may have free play a beautiful maiden with decorative hair and the proper number of toes will fill the bill miss clarice st vavasour the wellknown model will pose for it in the lethergogallagher or whatever it was that trilby called it  secondthe melancholy lady with upturned eyes in a framework of lilies this is magazinecovery but reliable  thirdmiss manhattan in the fifth avenue easter sunday parade  fourthmaggie murphy with a new red feather in her old straw hat happy and selfconscious in the grand street turnout  of course the rabbits do not count nor the easter eggs since the higher criticism has hardboiled them  the limited field of its pictorial possibilities proves that easter of all our festival days is the most vague and shifting in our conception it belongs to all religions although the pagans invented it going back still further to the first spring we can see eve choosing with pride a new green leaf from the tree ficus carica  now the object of this critical and learned preamble is to set forth the theorem that easter is neither a date a season a festival a holiday nor an occasion what it is you shall find out if you follow in the footsteps of danny mccree  easter sunday dawned as it should bright and early in its place on the calendar between saturday and monday at 524 the sun rose and at 1030 danny followed its example he went into the kitchen and washed his face at the sink his mother was frying bacon she looked at his hard smooth knowing countenance as he juggled with the round cake of soap and thought of his father when she first saw him stopping a hot grounder between second and third twentytwo years before on a vacant lot in harlem where the la paloma apartment house now stands in the front room of the flat dannys father sat by an open window smoking his pipe with his dishevelled gray hair tossed about by the breeze he still clung to his pipe although his sight had been taken from him two years before by a precocious blast of giant powder that went off without permission very few blind men care for smoking for the reason that they cannot see the smoke now could you enjoy having the news read to you from an evening newspaper unless you could see the colors of the headlines  tis easter day said mrs mccree  scramble mine said danny  after breakfast he dressed himself in the sabbath morning costume of the canal street importing house dray chauffeurfrock coat striped trousers patent leathers gilded trace chain across front of vest and wing collar rolledbrim derby and butterfly bow from schonsteins between fourteenth street and tonys fruit stand saturday night sale  youll be goin out this day of course danny said old man mccree a little wistfully tis a kind of holiday they say well its fine spring weather i can feel it in the air  why should i not be going out demanded danny in his grumpiest chest tones should i stay in am i as good as a horse one day of rest my team has a week who earns the money for the rent and the breakfast youve just eat id like to know answer me that  all right lad said the old man im not complainin while me two eyes was good there was nothin better to my mind than a sunday out theres a smell of turf and burnin brush comin in the windy i have me tobaccy a good fine day and rist to ye lad times i wish your mother had larned to read so i might hear the rest about the hippopotamusbut let that be  now what is this foolishness he talks of hippopotamuses asked danny of his mother as he passed through the kitchen have you been taking him to the zoo and for what  i have not said mrs mccree he sets by the windy all day tis little recreation a blind man among the poor gets at all im thinkin they wander in their minds at times one day he talks of grease without stoppin for the most of an hour i looks to see if theres lard burnin in the fryin pan there is not he says i do not understand tis weary days sundays and holidays and all for a blind man danny there was no better nor stronger than him when he had his two eyes tis a fine day son injoy yeself aginst the morning there will be cold supper at six  have you heard any talk of a hippopotamus asked danny of mike the janitor as he went out the door downstairs  i have not said mike pulling his shirtsleeves higher but tis the only subject in the animal natural and illegal lists of outrages that ive not been complained to about these two days see the landlord or else move out if ye like have ye hippopotamuses in the lease no then  it was the old man who spoke of it said danny likely theres nothing in it  danny walked up the street to the avenue and then struck northward into the heart of the district where eastermodern easter in new bright raimentleads the pascal march out of towering brown churches came the blithe music of anthems from the choirs the broad sidewalks were moving parterres of living flowersso it seemed when your eye looked upon the easter girl  gentlemen frockcoated silkhatted gardeniaed sustained the background of the tradition children carried lilies in their hands the windows of the brownstone mansions were packed with the most opulent creations of flora the sister of the lady of the lilies  around a corner whitegloved pinkgilled and tightly buttoned walked corrigan the cop shield to the curb danny knew him  why corrigan he asked is easter i know it comes the first time youre full after the moon rises on the seventeenth of marchbut why is it a proper and religious ceremony or does the governor appoint it out of politics  tis an annual celebration said corrigan with the judicial air of the third deputy police commissioner peculiar to new york it extends up to harlem sometimes they has the reserves out at one hundred and twentyfifth street in my opinion tis not political  thanks said danny and saydid you ever hear a man complain of hippopotamuses when not specially in drink i mean  nothing larger than sea turtles said corrigan reflecting and there was wood alcohol in that  danny wandered the double heavy incumbency of enjoying simultaneously a sunday and a festival day was his  the sorrows of the handtoiler fit him easily they are worn so often that they hang with the picturesque lines of the best tailormade garments that is why wellfed artists of pencil and pen find in the griefs of the common people their most striking models but when the philistine would disport himself the grimness of melpomene herself attends upon his capers therefore danny set his jaw hard at easter and took his pleasure sadly  the family entrance of dugans café was feasible so danny yielded to the vernal season as far as a glass of bock seated in a dark linoleumed humid back room his heart and mind still groped after the mysterious meaning of the springtime jubilee  say tim he said to the waiter why do they have easter  skiddoo said tim closing a sophisticated eye is that a new one all right tony pastors for you last night i guess i give it up whats the answertwo apples or a yard and a half  from dugans danny turned back eastward the april sun seemed to stir in him a vague feeling that he could not construe he made a wrong diagnosis and decided that it was katy conlon  a block from her house on avenue a he met her going to church they pumped hands on the corner  gee but you look dumpish and dressed up said katy whats wrong come away with me to church and be cheerful  whats doing at church asked danny  why its easter sunday silly i waited till after eleven expectin you might come around to go  what does this easter stand for katy asked danny gloomily nobody seems to know  nobody as blind as you said katy with spirit you havent even looked at my new hat and skirt why its when all the girls put on new spring clothes silly are you coming to church with me  i will said danny if this easter is pulled off there they ought to be able to give some excuse for it not that the hat aint a beauty the green roses are great  at church the preacher did some expounding with no pounding he spoke rapidly for he was in a hurry to get home to his early sabbath dinner but he knew his business there was one word that controlled his themeresurrection not a new creation but a new life arising out of the old the congregation had heard it often before but there was a wonderful hat a combination of sweet peas and lavender in the sixth pew from the pulpit it attracted much attention  after church danny lingered on a corner while katy waited with pique in her skyblue eyes  are you coming along to the house she asked but dont mind me ill get there all right you seem to be studyin a lot about something all right will i see you at any time specially mr mccree  ill be around wednesday night as usual said danny turning and crossing the street  katy walked away with the green roses dangling indignantly danny stopped two blocks away he stood still with his hands in his pockets at the curb on the corner his face was that of a graven image deep in his soul something stirred so small so fine so keen and leavening that his hard fibres did not recognize it it was something more tender than the april day more subtle than the call of the senses purer and deeperrooted than the love of womanfor had he not turned away from green roses and eyes that had kept him chained for a year and danny did not know what it was the preacher who was in a hurry to go to his dinner had told him but danny had had no libretto with which to follow the drowsy intonation but the preacher spoke the truth  suddenly danny slapped his leg and gave forth a hoarse yell of delight  hippopotamus he shouted to an elevated road pillar well how is that for a bum guess why blast my skylights i know what he was driving at now  hippopotamus wouldnt that send you to the bronx its been a year since he heard it and he didnt miss it so very far we quit at 469 b c and this comes next well a wooden man wouldnt have guessed what he was trying to get out of him  danny caught a crosstown car and went up to the rear flat that his labor supported  old man mccree was still sitting by the window his extinct pipe lay on the sill  will that be you lad he asked  danny flared into the rage of a strong man who is surprised at the outset of committing a good deed  who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house he snapped viciously have i no right to come in  yere a faithful lad said old man mccree with a sigh is it evening yet  danny reached up on a shelf and took down a thick book labeled in gilt letters the history of greece dust was on it half an inch thick he laid it on the table and found a place in it marked by a strip of paper and then he gave a short roar at the top of his voice and said  was it the hippopotamus you wanted to be read to about then  did i hear ye open the book said old man mccree many and weary be the months since my lad has read it to me i dinno but i took a great likings to them greeks ye left off at a place tis a fine day outside lad be out and take rest from your work i have gotten used to me chair by the windy and me pipe  pelpeloponnesus was the place where we left off and not hippopotamus said danny the war began there it kept something doing for thirty years the headlines says that a guy named philip of macedon in 338 b c got to be boss of greece by getting the decision at the battle of chercheronoea ill read it  with his hand to his ear rapt in the peloponnesian war old man mccree sat for an hour listening  then he got up and felt his way to the door of the kitchen mrs mccree was slicing cold meat she looked up tears were running from old man mccrees eyes  do you hear our lad readin to me he said there is none finer in the land my two eyes have come back to me again  after supper he said to danny tis a happy day this easter and now ye will be off to see katy in the evening well enough  who pays the rent and buys the food that is eaten in this house said danny angrily have i no right to stay in it after supper there is yet to come the reading of the battle of corinth 146 b c when the kingdom as they say became an inintegral portion of the roman empire am i nothing in this house      v  the fifth wheel   the ranks of the bed line moved closer together for it was cold they were alluvial deposit of the stream of life lodged in the delta of fifth avenue and broadway the bed liners stamped their freezing feet looked at the empty benches in madison square whence jack frost had evicted them and muttered to one another in a confusion of tongues the flatiron building with its impious cloudpiercing architecture looming mistily above them on the opposite delta might well have stood for the tower of babel whence these polyglot idlers had been called by the winged walking delegate of the lord  standing on a pine box a head higher than his flock of goats the preacher exhorted whatever transient and shifting audience the north wind doled out to him it was a slave market fifteen cents bought you a man you deeded him to morpheus and the recording angel gave you credit  the preacher was incredibly earnest and unwearied he had looked over the list of things one may do for ones fellow man and had assumed for himself the task of putting to bed all who might apply at his soap box on the nights of wednesday and sunday that left but five nights for other philanthropists to handle and had they done their part as well this wicked city might have become a vast arcadian dormitory where all might snooze and snore the happy hours away letting problem plays and the rent man and business go to the deuce  the hour of eight was but a little while past sightseers in a small dark mass of pay ore were gathered in the shadow of general worths monument now and then shyly ostentatiously carelessly or with conscientious exactness one would step forward and bestow upon the preacher small bills or silver then a lieutenant of scandinavian coloring and enthusiasm would march away to a lodging house with a squad of the redeemed all the while the preacher exhorted the crowd in terms beautifully devoid of eloquencesplendid with the deadly accusative monotony of truth before the picture of the bed liners fades you must hear one phrase of the preachersthe one that formed his theme that night it is worthy of being stenciled on all the white ribbons in the world  no man ever learned to be a drunkard on fivecent whisky  think of it tippler it covers the ground from the sprouting rye to the potters field  a cleanprofiled erect young man in the rear rank of the bedless emulated the terrapin drawing his head far down into the shell of his coat collar it was a wellcut tweed coat and the trousers still showed signs of having flattened themselves beneath the compelling goose but conscientiously i must warn the milliners apprentice who reads this expecting a reginald montressor in straits to peruse no further the young man was no other than thomas mcquade excoachman discharged for drunkenness one month before and now reduced to the grimy ranks of the onenight bed seekers  if you live in smaller new york you must know the van smuythe family carriage drawn by the two 1500pound 100 to 1shot bays the carriage is shaped like a bathtub in each end of it reclines an old lady van smuythe holding a black sunshade the size of a new years eve feather tickler before his downfall thomas mcquade drove the van smuythe bays and was himself driven by annie the van smuythe ladys maid but it is one of the saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any cupidworshiper and thomass physical troubles were not few therefore his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost ladys maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain nonexistent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying dancing crawling and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the bed line army nearly four weeks of straight whisky and a diet limited to crackers bologna and pickles often guarantees a psychozoological sequel thus desperate freezing angry beset by phantoms as he was he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse  the bed liner standing at his right was a young man of about his own age shabby but neat  whats the diagnosis of your case freddy asked thomas with the freemasonic familiarity of the damnedbooze thats mine you dont look like a panhandler neither am i a month ago i was pushing the lines over the backs of the finest team of percheron buffaloes that ever made their mile down fifth avenue in 285 and look at me now say how do you come to be at this bed bargaincounter rummage sale  the other young man seemed to welcome the advances of the airy excoachman  no said he mine isnt exactly a case of drink unless we allow that cupid is a bartender i married unwisely according to the opinion of my unforgiving relatives ive been out of work for a year because i dont know how to work and ive been sick in bellevue and other hospitals for months my wife and kid had to go back to her mother i was turned out of the hospital yesterday and i havent a cent thats my tale of woe  tough luck said thomas a man alone can pull through all right but i hate to see the women and kids get the worst of it  just then there hummed up fifth avenue a motor car so splendid so red so smoothly running so craftily demolishing the speed regulations that it drew the attention even of the listless bed liners suspended and pinioned on its left side was an extra tire  when opposite the unfortunate company the fastenings of this tire became loosed it fell to the asphalt bounded and rolled rapidly in the wake of the flying car  thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preachers goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire swung it over his shoulder and was trotting smartly after the car on both sides of the avenue people were shouting whistling and waving canes at the red car pointing to the enterprising thomas coming up with the lost tire  one dollar thomas had estimated was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered and save his pride  two blocks away the car had stopped there was a little brown muffled chauffeur driving and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat  thomas proffered the captured tire with his best excoachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations  but the look was not so construed the sealskinned gentleman received the tire placed it inside the car gazed intently at the excoachman and muttered to himself inscrutable words  strangestrange said he once or twice even i myself have fancied that the chaldean chiroscope has availed could it be possible  then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful thomas  sir i thank you for your kind rescue of my tire and i would ask you if i may a question do you know the family of van smuythes living in washington square north  oughtnt i to replied thomas i lived there wish i did yet  the sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car  step in please he said you have been expected  thomas mcquade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation a seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the bed line but after the laprobe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind  maybe the guy hasnt got any change was his diagnosis lots of these swell rounders dont lug about any ready money guess hell dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug anyhow its a cinch that ive got that openair bed convention beat to a finish  submerged in his greatcoat the mysterious automobilist seemed himself to marvel at the surprises of life wonderful amazing strange he repeated to himself constantly  when the car had well entered the crosstown seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of highstooped brownstonefront houses  be kind enough to enter my house with me said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted hes going to dig up sure reflected thomas following him inside  there was a dim light in the hall his host conducted him through a door to the left closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness suddenly a luminous globe strangely decorated shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales  the walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures at the rear end of the room were draped portières of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars the furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles the excoachmans feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts there were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery  thomas mcquade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye with the other he looked for his imposing conductorto find that he had disappeared  bgee muttered thomas this listens like a spook shop shouldnt wonder if it aint one of these moravian nights adventures that you read about wonder what became of the furry guy  suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow  with a frightborn imprecation thomas seized a bronze statuette of hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl the owl and his perch went over with a crash with the sound there was a click and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling the gold portières parted and closed and the mysterious automobilist entered the room he was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste a vandyke beard of glossy golden brown rather long and wavy hair smoothly parted and large magnetic orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance if you can conceive a russian grand duke in a rajahs throneroom advancing to greet a visiting emperor you will gather something of the majesty of his manner but thomas mcquade was too near his d ts to be mindful of his ps and qs when he viewed this silken polished and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists  say doc said he resentfully thats a hot bird you keep on tap i hope i didnt break anything but ive nearly got the williwalloos and when he threw them 32candlepower lamps of his on me i took a snapshot at him with that little brass flatiron girl that stood on the sideboard  that is merely a mechanical toy said the gentleman with a wave of his hand may i ask you to be seated while i explain why i brought you to my house perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so so i will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the van smuythe family of washington square north  any silver missing asked thomas tartly any joolry displaced of course i know em any of the old ladies sunshades disappeared well i know em and then what  the grand duke rubbed his white hands together softly  wonderful he murmured wonderful shall i come to believe in the chaldean chiroscope myself let me assure you he continued that there is nothing for you to fear instead i think i can promise you that very good fortune awaits you we will see  do they want me back asked thomas with something of his old professional pride in his voice ill promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if theyll try me again but how did you get wise doc bgee its the swellest employment agency i was ever in with its flashlight owls and so forth  with an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes he went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur who still waited with the car returning to the mysterious apartment he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor bed liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued a servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine and thomas felt the glamour of arabia envelop him thus half an hour sped quickly and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the grand duke to his feet with another soft petition for a brief absence  two women well muffled against the cold were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy double portières here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other on a goldinlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer triangular instrument or toy apparently of gold standing on little wheels  the taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak she was fifty with a wrinkled and sad face the other young and plump took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done  you sent for me professor cherubusco said the elder woman wearily i hope you have something more definite than usual to say ive about lost the little faith i had in your art i would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it  madam said the professor with his princeliest smile the true art cannot fail to find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time we have not succeeded i admit with the cards the crystal the stars the magic formulæ of zarazin nor the oracle of po but we have at last discovered the true psychic route the chaldean chiroscope has been successful in our search  the professors voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words the elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest  why there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it she said what do you mean  the words were these said professor cherubusco rising to his full magnificent height by the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come  i havent seen many chariots said the lady but i never saw one with five wheels  progress said the professorprogress in science and mechanics has accomplished itthough to be exact we may speak of it only as an extra tire progress in occult art has advanced in proportion madam i repeat that the chaldean chiroscope has succeeded i can not only answer the question that you have propounded but i can produce before your eyes the proof thereof  and now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise  o professor she cried anxiouslywhenwhere has he been found do not keep me in suspense  i beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes said professor cherubusco and i think i can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true art  thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side  are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor he asked with his courteous royal smile  do i look bughouse answered thomas enough of the footback life for me but will they have me again the old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle  my dear young man said the other she has been searching for you everywhere  great said thomas im on the job that team of dropsical dromedaries they call horses is a handicap for a firstclass coachman like myself but ill take the job back sure doc theyre good people to be with  and now a change came oer the suave countenance of the caliph of bagdad he looked keenly and suspiciously at the excoachman  may i ask what your name is he said shortly  youve been looking for me said thomas and dont know my name youre a funny kind of sleuth you must be one of the central office gumshoers im thomas mcquade of course and ive been chauffeur of the van smuythe elephant team for a year they fired me a month ago forwell doc you saw what i did to your old owl i went broke on booze and when i saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon i was standing in that squad of hoboes at the worth monument waiting for a free bed now whats the prize for the best answer to all this  to his intense surprise thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged without a word of explanation to the front door this was opened and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy disillusionizing humiliating impact of the stupendous arabians shoe  as soon as the excoachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward broadway  crazy guy was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist just wanted to have some fun kiddin i guess he might have dug up a dollar anyhow now ive got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep  when thomas reached the end of his twomile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten he took the proper place of a newcomer at the left end of the rear rank in a file in front of him was the young man who had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child  sorry to see you back again said the young man turning to speak to him i hoped you had struck something better than this  me said thomas oh i just took a run around the block to keep warm i see the public aint lending to the lord very fast tonight  in this kind of weather said the young man charity avails itself of the proverb and both begins and ends at home  and the preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to providence and man those of the bed liners whose windpipes still registered above 32 degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in  in the middle of the second verse thomas saw a sturdy girl with windtossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk annie he yelled and ran toward her  you fool you fool she cried weeping and laughing and hanging upon his neck why did you do it  the stuff explained thomas briefly you know but subsequently nit not a drop he led her to the curb how did you happen to see me  i came to find you said annie holding tight to his sleeve oh you big fool professor cherubusco told us that we might find you here  professor ch dont know the guy what saloon does he work in  hes a clairvoyant thomas the greatest in the world he found you with the chaldean telescope he said  hes a liar said thomas i never had it he never saw me have anybodys telescope  and he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something  annie said thoms solicitously youre giving me the wheels now if i had a chariot id have gone to bed in it long ago and without any singing and preaching for a nightcap either  listen you big fool the missis says shell take you back i begged her to but you must behave and you can go up to the house tonight and your old room over the stable is ready  great said thomas earnestly you are it annie but when did these stunts happen  tonight at professor cherubuscos he sent his automobile for the missis and she took me along ive been there with her before  whats the professors line  hes a clearvoyant and a witch the missis consults him he knows everything but he hasnt done the missis any good yet though shes paid him hundreds of dollars but he told us that the stars told him we could find you here  whats the old lady want this cherrybuster to do  thats a family secret said annie and now youve asked enough questions come on home you big fool  they had moved but a little way up the street when thomas stopped  got any dough with you annie he asked  annie looked at him sharply  oh i know what that look means said thomas youre wrong not another drop but theres a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there thats in bad shape hes the right kind and hes got wives or kids or something and hes on the sick list no booze if you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed id like it  annies fingers began to wiggle in her purse  sure ive got money said she lots of it twelve dollars and then she added with womans ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence bring him here and let me see him first  thomas went on his mission the wan bed liner came readily enough as the two drew near annie looked up from her purse and screamed  mr walter ohmr walter  is that you annie said the young man meekly  oh mr walterand the missis hunting high and low for you  does mother want to see me he asked with a flush coming out on his pale cheek  shes been hunting for you high and low sure she wants to see you she wants you to come home shes tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything and then she took up clearvoyants youll go right home wont you mr walter  gladly if she wants me said the young man three years is a long time i suppose ill have to walk up though unless the street cars are giving free rides i used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage have they got them yet  they have said thomas feelingly and theyll have em ten years from now the life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and fortynine years im the coachman just got my reappointment five minutes ago lets all ride up in a surface carthat iserif annie will pay the fares  on the broadway car annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor  seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around said thomas sarcastically  in that purse said annie decidedly is exactly 1185 i shall take every cent of it tomorrow and give it to professor cherubusco the greatest man in the world  well said thomas i guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does im glad his spooks told him where you could find me if youll give me his address some day ill go up there myself and shake his hand  presently thomas moved tentatively in his seat and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows  say annie said he confidentially maybe its one of the last dreams of booze but ive a kind of a recollection of riding in an automobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights he fed me on biscuits and hot air and then kicked me down the front steps if it was the d ts why am i so sore  shut up you fool said annie  if i could find that funny guys house said thomas in conclusion id go up there some day and punch his nose for him      vi  the poet and the peasant   the other day a poet friend of mine who has lived in close communion with nature all his life wrote a poem and took it to an editor  it was a living pastoral full of the genuine breath of the fields the song of birds and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams  when the poet called again to see about it with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart it was handed back to him with the comment  too artificial  several of us met over spaghetti and dutchess county chianti and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls  and there we dug a pit for the editor with us was conant a wellarrived writer of fictiona man who had trod on asphalt all his life and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains  conant wrote a poem and called it the doe and the brook it was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with amaryllis only as far as the florists windows and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter conant signed this poem and we sent it to the same editor  but this has very little to do with the story  just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem on the next morning a being stumbled off the west shore ferryboat and loped slowly up fortysecond street  the invader was a young man with light blue eyes a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphans afterward discovered to be the earls daughter in one of mr blaneys plays his trousers were corduroy his coat shortsleeved with buttons in the middle of his back one bootleg was outside the corduroys you looked expectantly though in vain at his straw hat for ear holes its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor in his hand was a valisedescription of it is an impossible task a boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it and above one ear in his hair was a wisp of haythe rustics letter of credit his badge of innocence the last clinging touch of the garden of eden lingering to shame the goldbrick men  knowingly smilingly the city crowds passed him by they saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings at this they ceased to smile and even to look at him it had been done so often a few glanced at the antique valise to see what coney attraction or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory but for the most part he was ignored even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars  at eighth avenue stood bunco harry with his dyed mustache and shiny goodnatured eyes harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part he edged up to the countryman who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window and shook his head  too thick pal he said criticallytoo thick by a couple of inches i dont know what your lay is but youve got the properties too thick that hay nowwhy they dont even allow that on proctors circuit any more  i dont understand you mister said the green one im not lookin for any circus ive just run down from ulster county to look at the town bein that the hayins over with gosh but its a whopper i thought poughkeepsie was some punkins but this here town is five times as big  oh well said bunco harry raising his eyebrows i didnt mean to butt in you dont have to tell i thought you ought to tone down a little so i tried to put you wise wish you success at your graft whatever it is come and have a drink anyhow  i wouldnt mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other  they went to a café frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks  im glad i come across you mister said haylocks howd you like to play a game or two of sevenup ive got the keerds  he fished them out of noahs valisea rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields  bunco harry laughed loud and briefly  not for me sport he said firmly i dont go against that makeup of yours for a cent but i still say youve overdone it the reubs havent dressed like that since 79 i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a keywinding watch with that layout  oh you neednt think i aint got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table  got that for my share of grandmothers farm he announced theres 950 in that roll thought id come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into  bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes  ive seen worse he said critically but youll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that  whats his line asked two or three shiftyeyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed  the queer i guess said harry or else hes one of jeromes men or some guy with a new graft hes too much hayseed maybe that hisi wonder nowoh no it couldnt have been real money  haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion  haylocks swung his valise across the bar  keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar ill be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for theres 950 inside of it though maybe you wouldnt think so to look at me  somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coattail buttons flopping in the middle of his back  divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another  honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you dont think id fall to that do you anybody can see he aint no jay one of mcadoos comeon squad i guess hes a shine if he made himself up there aint no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if hes got ninefifty in that valise its a ninetyeight cent waterbury thats stopped at ten minutes to ten  when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it  haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellowbacks from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy  son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me im mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess youll get a nickel if youll hurry up  a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsys face  aw watchertink gwan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey aint no farm clothes yer got on gwan wit yer stage money  on a corner lounged a keeneyed steerer for a gamblinghouse he saw haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous  mister said the rural one ive heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got 950 in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about 9 or 10 im goin to have some sport and then maybe ill buy out a business of some kind  the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail  cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldnt get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories let it be skiddoo for yours nay i know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace  rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference  its my clothes said he durned if it aint they think im a hayseed and wont have nothin to do with me nobody never made fun of this hat in ulster county i guess if you want folks to notice you in new york you must dress up like they do  so haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the bulge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows and messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on broadway within the lights of long acre  at 9 oclock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom ulster county would have foresworn bright tan were his shoes his hat the latest block his light gray trousers were deeply creased a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant english walking coat his collar might have graced a laundry window his blond hair was trimmed close the wisp of hay was gone  for an instant he stood resplendent with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures and then he turned down the gay bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire  but in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision a stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel  the juiciest jay ive seen in six months said the man with gray eyes come along  it was halfpast eleven when a man galloped into the west fortyseventh street police station with the story of his wrongs  nine hundred and fifty dollars he gasped all my share of grandmothers farm  the desk sergeant wrung from him the name jabez bulltongue of locust valley farm ulster county and then began to take descriptions of the strongarm gentlemen  when conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown  when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show  thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual  the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or dont write poetry       vii  the robe of peace   mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence  johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the élite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society  especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the bestdressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his especial passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging  bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and wellbalanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those casesmore numerous in late yearswhere men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness  in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary touristbeguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation  it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen windswept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great everechoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth  at three oclock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you nowthe one on this side with his hand at his waistif that isnt johnny bellchambers then i never saw him  gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion  what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely cant be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is ive heard him say things when a fourinhand didnt seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for courtmartial before any church  its bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or im pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuffcolored bathrobe i cant get it straight in my mind lets ask the jolly old boy thats doing the honors  brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it  eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl  permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smoothshaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and wellgroomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garmenta long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse  glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasnt expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all societys an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire toercontemplation anderprayer and hymns and those things  oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully dont be afraid that ill pass around the plate i go through these thingumbobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules im brother ambrose here you know im given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows thats rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isnt it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now  its the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devili mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man  peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowdll go wild to see you this isnt in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory youll get catarrh here johnnyand my god you havent any socks on  bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled  you fellows dont understand he said soothingly its nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straighthanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained  at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again  and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour      viii  the girl and the graft   the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp  now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york im not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i dont find any  while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little secondhand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the otherhis hall bedroom in eighteenth streetwhere he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the waters edge on the dresser lay a bluedsteel colts fortyfive and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnakestory class a chambermaid with a roomcleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colts yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellowhued roll  i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it  ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they dont amount to much in special lines of graft because theyre all so busy in general lines what why they have to whos got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eves daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum dont fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against hes the lowgrade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five shes salted she cant put in crushers and costly machinery hed notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out 1000 to the ton the dryeyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers  you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union  well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but its this way suppose youre a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers  you come home at night and bring a 9000000 diamond brooch to the lady whos staked you for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if its backed she comes up and kisses you youve waited for it you get it all right its graft  but im telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color  on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worththat is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern  i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i hadbut let me lay my eyes on that dealer again  vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a hightoned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places  i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsies school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunters guide he wasnt afraid of hurting the waiters feelings  mr pogue he explains to me i am using you  go on says i i hope you dont wake up  and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didnt have but a million so he couldnt attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automobiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgamfilled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over  ever try the reporters i asked him  last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was 12480  get anything out of that i asks  that reminds me says he add 850 for pepsin yes i got indigestion  how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast  something of that sort tonight says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room  the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but dont kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful  at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me  suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says ia column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you  ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i wont wear pink pants at a cotillon  i wouldnt ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffeminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi  we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and 80 she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vicepresident of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of fivedollar notes with 250 scrawled on the band  the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all décolletée and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man cant get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes  shes a stunner says vaucross when he saw her theyll give her a twocolumn cut sure  this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love lettersthe worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are deadevery day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for 100000 for breach of promise  miss artemisia was to get 10000 if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect  sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldnt keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading  say you shed say what do you call thisletter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blyewouldnt that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a courtroom with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sign yourself mamas own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy  after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one anothers hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop cranmer or the brooklyn bridge or cheeseonsalad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects  they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a processserver walked in and handed vaucross the papers at his table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a fivecent cigar for i knew the 10000 was as good as ours  about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clingingyes sir clingingto his arm and they tells me theyd been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left  and thats why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for selfpreservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines  what was in the bundle that they left i asked with my usual curiosity  why said ferguson there was a scalpers railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucrosss old pants      ix  the call of the tame   when the inauguration was accomplishedthe proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough ridersit is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal exwarriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broadbrimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribes stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet  out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddys gentlemen of the royal bearhounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz  the daily cyclone of sixth avenues rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightningflash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision  the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbriers first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway  the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue fourinhand factory tied the low turneddown collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the opendayandnightexceptsunday restaurants the outcurve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the halfclosed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldomwinking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a days ridethese brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle readerjust like those the madison square post office mail carriers wear when they go up to bronx park on sunday afternoons  suddenly greenbrier nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle seized upon a man dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that sent him reeling against a wall  the victim recovered his hat with the angry look of a new yorker who has suffered an outrage and intends to write to the trib about it but he looked at his assailant and knew that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the west which greets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists and receives its enemies in decorum and order such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands  god in the mountains cried greenbrier holding fast to the foreleg of his cull can this be longhorn merritt  the other man wasoh look on broadway any day for the patternbusiness manlatest rolledbrim derbygood barber business digestion and tailor  greenbrier nye he exclaimed grasping the hand that had smitten him my dear fellow so glad to see you how did you come tooh to be surethe inaugural ceremoniesi remember you joined the rough riders you must come and have luncheon with me of course  greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size shape and color of a mcclellan saddle  longy he said in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic what have they been doing to you you act just like a citizen they done made you into an inmate of the city directory you never made no such johnny branch execration of yourself as that out on the gila come and have lunching with me you never defined grub by any such terms of reproach in them days  ive been living in new york seven years said merritt its been eight since we punched cows together in old man garcias outfit well lets go to a café anyhow it sounds good to hear it called grub again  they picked their way through the crowd to a hotel and drifted as by a natural law to the bar  speak up

that pass whiskey straightand theyre on you  merritt smiled and paid  they lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the café merritt dexterously diverted his friends choice that hovered over ham and eggs to a purée of celery a salmon cutlet a partridge pie and a desirable salad  on the day said greenbrier grieved and thunderous when i cant hold but one drink before eating when i meet a friend i aint seen in eight years at a 2 by 4 table in a thirtycent town at 1 oclock on the third day of the week i want nine broncos to kick me forty times over a 640acre section

miss sally walker god made you perpendicular and suitable to ride straddle and use cuss words in the original wherefore you have suffered his handiwork to elapse by removing yourself to new york and putting on little shoes tied with strings and making faces when you talk ive seen you rope and tie a steer in 42 12 if you was to see one now youd write to the police commissioner about it and these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate your system withthese little essences of cowslip with acorns in em and paregoric flipthey aint anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood i hate to see you this way  well mr greenbrier said merritt with apology in his tone in a way you are right sometimes i do feel like i was being raised on the bottle but i tell you new york is comfortablecomfortable theres something about itthe sights and the crowds and the way it changes every day and the very air of it that seems to tie a onemilelong stake rope around a mans neck with the other end fastened somewhere about thirtyfourth street i dont know what it is  god knows said greenbrier sadly and i know the east has gobbled you up you was venison and now youre veal you put me in mind of a japonica in a window youve been signed sealed and diskivered requiescat in hoc signo you make me thirsty  a green chartreuse here said merritt to the waiter  whiskey straight sighed greenbrier and theyre on

greenbrier if i hadnt seen you once bluff three bluffers from mazatzal city with an empty gun in phoenix  greenbriers voice died away in pure grief  cigars he called harshly to the waiter to hide his emotion  a pack of turkish cigarettes for mine said merritt  theyre on you chanted greenbrier struggling to conceal his contempt  at seven they dined in the wheretodinewell column  that evening a galaxy had assembled there bright shone the lights oer fair women and brlet it go anyhowbrave men the orchestra played charmingly hardly had a tip from a diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness the more beer you contributed to it the more meyerbeer it gave you which is reciprocity  merritt put forth exertions on the dinner greenbrier was his old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail  i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but id prefer whiskey straight theyre on you  right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items  lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon whats this horse with the heaves i pass but look along heres truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see  the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list  this medoc isnt bad he suggested  youre the doc said greenbrier id rather have whiskey straight its on you  greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself  how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt  fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river  when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him  you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes its a comfortable town its different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll theyre worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his manelook at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe id  gyarsong he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant  the waiter dived toward the table  two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier  merritt looked at him and smiled significantly  theyre on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling      x  the unknown quantity   the poet longfellowor was it confucius the inventor

would conduct you into the presence of the elusive seductive pursued satisfying mysterious x  not long before the beginning of this century septimus kinsolving an old new yorker invented an idea he originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from wheat futures perceiving that the flour crop was short and that the stock exchange was having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat mr kinsolving cornered the flour market  the result was that when you or my landlady before the war she never had to turn her hand to anything southerners accommodated bought a fivecent loaf of bread you laid down an additional two cents which went to mr kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity  a second result was that mr kinsolving quit the game with 2000000 proferrakeoff  mr kinsolvings son dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in breadstuffs was made dan came home during vacation and found the old gentleman in a red dressinggown reading little dorrit on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in washington square he had retired from business with enough extra twocent pieces from bread buyers to reach if laid side by side fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the public debt of paraguay  dan shook hands with his father and hurried over to greenwich village to see his old highschool friend kenwitz dan had always admired kenwitz kenwitz was pale curlyhaired intense serious mathematical studious altruistic socialistic and the natural foe of oligarchies kenwitz had foregone college and was learning watchmaking in his fathers jewelry store dan was smiling jovial easytempered and tolerant alike of kings and ragpickers the two foregathered joyously being opposites and then dan went back to college and kenwitz to his mainspringsand to his private library in the rear of the jewelry shop  four years later dan came back to washington square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolvings elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue  kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic  i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dads collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to 2000000 ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner youve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum  but since i came back and found out how dad made his money ive been thinking id like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but id like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means  kenwitzs big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dans arm with the grip of a friend and a judge  you cant do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of illgotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you cant do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies its too late to remedy the evil you cant pay them back  of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldnt hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change theres an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they havei never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dads cash back where it came from id feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldnt mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all of that money i can  there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically  easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i dont want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter its the bread shorts i want to cover ken  the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly  do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked  i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions  if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldnt repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done  back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal  not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boynes business failed and he lost his 1000 capitalall he had in the world  dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist  i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery  write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for 50000 boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum  stick to the instance said dan i havent noticed any insurance companies on my charity list  draw your next check for 100000 went on kenwitz boynes son fell into bad ways after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense  back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesnt need to stand in the bread line  the last item of the instance iscome and i will show you said kenwitz rising  the socialistic watchmaker was happy he was a millionairebaiter by nature and a pessimist by trade kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and corruption and that your brandnew watch needed cleaning and a new ratchetwheel  he conducted kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged povertyhaunted varick street up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led the penitent offspring of the octopus he knocked on a door and a clear voice called to them to enter  in that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine she nodded to kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance one little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient tuscans shield she flashed a rippling smile at kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry  kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heartthrobbing silence thus they came into the presence of the last item of the instance  how many this week miss mary asked the watchmaker a mountain of coarse gray shirts lay upon the floor  nearly thirty dozen said the young woman cheerfully ive made almost 4 im improving mr kenwitz i hardly know what to do with so much money her eyes turned brightly soft in the direction of dan a little pink spot came out on her round pale cheek  kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven  miss boyne he said let me present mr kinsolving the son of the man who put bread up five years ago he thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where inconvenienced by that act  the smile left the young womans face she rose and pointed her forefinger toward the door this time she looked kinsolving straight in the eye but it was not a look that gave delight  the two men went down varick street kenwitz letting all his pessimism and rancor and hatred of the octopus come to the surface gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an acrid torrent of words dan appeared to be listening and then turned to kenwitz and shook hands with him warmly  im obliged to you ken old man he said vaguelya thousand times obliged  mein gott you are crazy cried the watchmaker dropping his spectacles for the first time in years  two months afterward kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower broadway with a pair of goldrimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor  a lady was giving an order to a clerk as kenwitz passed her  these loaves are ten cents said the clerk  i always get them at eight cents uptown said the lady you need not fill the order i will drive by there on my way home  the voice was familiar the watchmaker paused  mr kenwitz cried the lady heartily how do you do  kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside  why miss boyne he began  mrs kinsolving she corrected dan and i were married a month ago      xi  the things the play   being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes i got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses  one of the numbers was a violin solo by a strikinglooking man not much past forty but with very gray thick hair not being afflicted with a taste for music i let the system of noises drift past my ears while i regarded the man  there was a story about that chap a month or two ago said the reporter they gave me the assignment it was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order the old man seems to like the funny touch i give to local happenings oh yes im working on a farce comedy now well i went down to the house and got all the details but i certainly fell down on that job i went back and turned in a comic writeup of an east side funeral instead why oh i couldnt seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks somehow maybe you could make a oneact tragedy out of it for a curtainraiser ill give you the details  after the performance my friend the reporter recited to me the facts over the würzburger  i see no reason said i when he had concluded why that shouldnt make a rattling good funny story those three people couldnt have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre im really afraid that all the stage is a world anyhow and all the players men and women the things the play is the way i quote mr shakespeare  try it said the reporter  i will said i and i did to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper   there stands a house near abingdon square on the ground floor there has been for twentyfive years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold  one night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store the widow mayo owned the house and store her daughter helen was married to frank barry john delaney was best man helen was eighteen and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a wholesale female murderess story from butte mont but after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of prominent beauties and belles of the lower west side  frank barry and john delaney were prominent young beaux of the same side and bosom friends whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up one who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this that is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet both had made a great race for helens hand when frank won john shook his hand and congratulated himhonestly he did  after the ceremony helen ran upstairs to put on her hat she was getting married in a traveling dress she and frank were going to old point comfort for a week downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cavedwellers were waiting with their hands full of old congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy  then there was a rattle of the fireescape and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated john delaney with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one entreating her to flee or fly with him to the riviera or the bronx or any old place where there are italian skies and dolce far niente  it would have carried blaney off his feet to see helen repulse him with blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way  in a few moments she had him going the manliness that had possessed him departed he bowed low and said something about irresistible impulse and forever carry in his heart the memory ofand she suggested that he catch the first fireescape going down  i will away said john delaney to the furthermost parts of the earth i cannot remain near you and know that you are anothers i will to africa and there amid other scenes strive to for  for goodness sake get out said helen somebody might come in  he knelt upon one knee and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss  girls was this choice boon of the great little god cupid ever vouchsafed youto have the fellow you want hard and fast and have the one you dont want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of africa and love which in spite of everything shall forever bloom an amaranth in his heart to know your power and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state to send the unlucky one brokenhearted to foreign climes while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles that your nails are well manicuredsay girls its galluptiousdont ever let it get by you  and then of coursehow did you guess itthe door opened and in stalked the bridegroom jealous of slowtying bonnet strings  the farewell kiss was imprinted upon helens hand and out of the window and down the fireescape sprang john delaney africa bound  a little slow music if you pleasefaint violin just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the cello imagine the scene frank whitehot with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him helen rushing and clinging to him trying to explain he catches her wrists and tears them from his shouldersonce twice thrice he sways her this way and thatthe stage manager will show you howand throws her from him to the floor a huddled crushed moaning thing never he cries will he look upon her face again and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests  and now because it is the thing instead of the play the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry die grow gray rich poor happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again  mrs barry inherited the shop and the house at thirtyeight she could have bested many an eighteenyearold at a beauty show on points and general results only a few people remembered her wedding comedy but she made of it no secret she did not pack it in lavender or moth balls nor did she sell it to a magazine  one day a middleaged moneymaking lawyer who bought his legal cap and ink of her asked her across the counter to marry him  im really much obliged to you said helen cheerfully but i married another man twenty years ago he was more a goose than a man but i think i love him yet i have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid  the lawyer bowed over the counter with oldtime grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand helen sighed parting salutes however romantic may be overdone here she was at thirtyeight beautiful and admired and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus worse still in the last one she had lost a customer too  business languished and she hung out a room to let card two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants roomers came and went regretfully for the house of mrs barry was the abode of neatness comfort and taste  one day came ramonti the violinist and engaged the front room above the discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise  ramonti with his still youthful face his dark eyebrows his short pointed foreign brown beard his distinguished head of gray hair and his artists temperamentrevealed in his light gay and sympathetic mannerwas a welcome tenant in the old house near abingdon square  helen lived on the floor above the store the architecture of it was singular and quaint the hall was large and almost square up one side of it and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above this hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined there she kept her desk and wrote her business letters and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there describing to mrs barry the wonders of paris where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler  next comes lodger no 2 a handsome melancholy man in the early 40s with a brown mysterious beard and strangely pleading haunting eyes he too found the society of helen a desirable thing with the eyes of romeo and othellos tongue he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo  from the first helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man his voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youths romance this feeling grew and she gave way to it and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance and then with a womans reasoning oh yes they do sometimes she leaped over common syllogisms and theory and logic and was sure that her husband had come back to her for she saw in his eyes love which no woman can mistake and a thousand tons of regret and remorse which aroused pity which is perilously near to love requited which is the sine qua non in the house that jack built  but she made no sign a husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar there must be expiation explanation and possibly execration a little purgatory and then maybe if he were properly humble he might be trusted with a harp and crown and so she made no sign that she knew or suspected  and my friend the reporter could see nothing funny in this sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring hilarious brilliant joshing story ofbut i will not knock a brotherlet us go on with the story  one evening ramonti stopped in helens hallofficereceptionroom and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist his words were a bright flame of the divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined  but before you give me an answer he went on before she could accuse him of suddenness i must tell you that ramonti is the only name i have to offer you my manager gave me that i do not know who i am or where i came from my first recollection is of opening my eyes in a hospital i was a young man and i had been there for weeks my life before that is a blank to me they told me that i was found lying in the street with a wound on my head and was brought there in an ambulance they thought i must have fallen and struck my head upon the stones there was nothing to show who i was i have never been able to remember after i was discharged from the hospital i took up the violin i have had success mrs barryi do not know your name except thati love you the first time i saw you i realized that you were the one woman in the world for meandoh a lot of stuff like that  helen felt young again first a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all over her and then she looked ramonti in the eyes and a tremendous throb went through her heart she hadnt expected that throb it took her by surprise the musician had become a big factor in her life and she hadnt been aware of it  mr ramonti she said sorrowfully this was not on the stage remember it was in the old home near abingdon square im awfully sorry but im a married woman  and then she told him the sad story of her life as a heroine must do sooner or later either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter  ramonti took her hand bowed low and kissed it and went up to his room  helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand well she might three suitors had kissed it mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away  in an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes helen was in the willow rocker knitting a useless thing in cottonwool he ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat sitting across the table from her he also poured out his narrative of love and then he said helen do you not remember me i think i have seen it in your eyes can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years i wronged you deeplyi was afraid to come back to youbut my love overpowered my reason can you will you forgive me  helen stood up the mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp  there she stood and i pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray  for she stood with a divided heart the fresh unforgettable virginal love for her bridegroom was hers the treasured sacred honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul she leaned to that pure feeling honor and faith and sweet abiding romance bound her to it but the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something elsea later fuller nearer influence and so the old fought against the new  and while she hesitated from the room above came the soft racking petitionary music of a violin the hag music bewitches some of the noblest the daws may peck upon ones sleeve without injury but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck  this music and the musician called her and at her side honor and the old love held her back  forgive me he pleaded  twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love she declared with a purgatorial touch  how could i tell he begged i will conceal nothing from you that night when he left i followed him i was mad with jealousy on a dark street i struck him down he did not rise i examined him his head had struck a stone i did not intend to kill him i was mad with love and jealousy i hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away although you married him helen  who are you cried the woman with wideopen eyes snatching her hand away  dont you remember me helenthe one who has always loved you best i am john delaney if you can forgive  but she was gone leaping stumbling hurrying flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten but who had known her for his in each of his two existences and as she climbed up she sobbed cried and sang frank frank frank  three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls and my friend the reporter couldnt see anything funny in it      xii  a ramble in aphasia   my wife and i parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner she left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door there she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership and bade me to take care of my cold i had no cold next came her kiss of partingthe level kiss of domesticity flavored with young hyson there was no fear of the extemporaneous of variety spicing her infinite custom with the deft touch of long malpractice she dabbed awry my wellset scarf pin and then as i closed the door i heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea  when i set out i had no thought or premonition of what was to occur the attack came suddenly  for many weeks i had been toiling almost night and day at a famous railroad law case that i won triumphantly but a few days previously in fact i had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years once or twice good doctor volney my friend and physician had warned me  if you dont slacken up bellford he said youll go suddenly to pieces either your nerves or your brain will give way tell me does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasiaof some man lost wandering nameless with his past and his identity blotted outand all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry  i always thought said i that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters  doctor volney shook his head  the disease exists he said you need a change or a rest courtroom office and homethere is the only route you travel for recreation youread law books better take warning in time  on thursday nights i said defensively my wife and i play cribbage on sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother that law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established  that morning as i walked i was thinking of doctor volneys words i was feeling as well as i usually didpossibly in better spirits than usual   i woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach i leaned my head against the seat and tried to think after a long time i said to myself i must have a name of some sort i searched my pockets not a card not a letter not a paper or monogram could i find but i found in my coat pocket nearly 3000 in bills of large denomination i must be some one of course i repeated to myself and began again to consider  the car was well crowded with men among whom i told myself there must have been some common interest for they intermingled freely and seemed in the best good humor and spirits one of thema stout spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloestook the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper in the intervals between his periods of reading we conversed as travelers will on current affairs i found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit at least to my memory by and by my companion said  you are one of us of course fine lot of men the west sends in this time im glad they held the convention in new york ive never been east before my names r p bolderbolder  son of hickory grove missouri  though unprepared i rose to the emergency as men will when put to it now must i hold a christening and be at once babe parson and parent my senses came to the rescue of my slower brain the insistent odor of drugs from my companion supplied one idea a glance at his newspaper where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement assisted me further  my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas  i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention  are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly  they are this car came through from the west and theyre your oldtime druggists toonone of your patent tabletandgranule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we aint above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker ive got an idea to spring on this conventionnew ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tartones poison you know and the others harmless its easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves thats wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea  it seems to me a very good one i said  all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up well make some of these eastern orangephosphateandmassagecream professors that think theyre the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets  if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles ofer  tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash  shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly  now theres another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you preferthe magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix  theermagnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word  mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles  give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes  heres another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i dont believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memorydont know his own name and wont even recognize the strawberry mark on his wifes left shoulder aphasia tut why cant they stay at home and forget  i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following      denver june 12elwyn c bellford a prominent lawyer is    mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all    efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a wellknown    citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and    lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the    most extensive private library in the state on the day of his    disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no    one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford    was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to    find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all    exists to his strange disappearance it may be found in the fact    that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important    law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it    is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort    is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man   it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home  oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder its larks theyre after theres too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when its all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me  thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy  we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancya sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetterswhatever they had beenwere stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a mans learning and experience  i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage  the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money  ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy  i endeavored to give color to my rôle  there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimony and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf  gentleman to threefourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room  the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past  it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the citys guest or its victim  the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world fullfledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roofgardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables dhôte to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a tollgate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles  sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with highborn life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked lovemaking clerks and shopgirls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadwayglistening opulent wily varying desirable broadwaygrowing upon one like an opium habit  one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity  hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didnt know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh  you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me  the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerks desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks  you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men  i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate oldfashioned one on lower fifth avenue  there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught  mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice  i turned quickly to see a lady seated alonea lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend  you were about to pass me she said accusingly dont tell me you do not know me why should we not shake handsat least once in fifteen years  i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a crème de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight  are you sure you know me i asked  no she said smiling i was never sure of that  what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas  what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightlyyou havent changed much elwyn  i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely  yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you havent forgotten you havent forgotten for a year or a day or an hour i told you you never could  i poked my straw anxiously in the crème de menthe  im sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten ive forgotten everything  she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face  ive heard of you at times she went on youre quite a big lawyer out westdenver isnt it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars  she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time  would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations  not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail  tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerlya thing i have wanted to know for many yearsjust from a womans curiosity of coursehave you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white rosesat white roses wet with rain and dew  i took a sip of crème de menthe  it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it  the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the soundit was a laugh of happinessyes and of contentand of misery i tried to look away from her  you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie  i gazed dully into the ferns  my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest  a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed  i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of thethe roses and other things  goodby mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage  i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side   mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here  certainly i answered  he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually goodlooking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face  bellford old man he said cordially im glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now youll go back with us and be yourself again in no time  i smiled ironically  i have been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life  before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again dont break my heart i am your wifecall my name oncejust once i could see you dead rather than this way  i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly  madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention  the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm  what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned  he led her to the door  go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think notonly a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him  the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall  i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained  very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby  let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer  i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens ones self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer  your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was overapplication to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife  she is what i would call a finelooking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair  she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him  i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but dont you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself  i am robert volneydoctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old mantry to remember  whats the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly  sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went  will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked  old friend said he ill do everything in my power and will have done everything that science can do to cure you  very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence nowprofessional confidence  of course said doctor volney  i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre tablea cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then i laid myself upon the couch again  it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly im rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shingood old docit was glorious      xiii  a municipal report        the cities are full of pride        challenging each to each      this from her mountainside        that from her burthened beach                                r kipling    fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville   tennessee there are just three big cities in the united states   that are story citiesnew york of course new orleans and   best of the lot san franciscofrank norris   east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail  of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romancewhat could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally     nashvillea city port of delivery and the capital of the   state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the   n c  st l and the l  n railroads  this city is regarded   as the most important educational centre in the south   i stepped off the train at 8 pm having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives i must as a substitution hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe  take a london fog 30 parts malaria 10 parts gas leaks 20 parts dewdrops gathered in a brick yard at sunrise 25 parts odor of honeysuckle 15 parts mix  the mixture will give you an approximate conception of a nashville drizzle it is not so fragrant as a mothball nor as thick as peasoup but tis enoughtwill serve  i went to a hotel in a tumbril it required strong selfsuppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated  i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah  the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means 20000 worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l  n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern courtesy the service as slow as the progress of a snail and as goodhumored as rip van winkle the food was worth traveling a thousand miles for there is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers en brochette  at dinner i asked a negro waiter if there was anything doing in town he pondered gravely for a minute and then replied well boss i dont really reckon theres anything at all doin after sundown  sundown had been accomplished it had been drowned in the drizzle long before so that spectacle was denied me but i went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there     it is built on undulating grounds and the streets are lighted   by electricity at a cost of 32470 per annum   as i left the hotel there was a race riot down upon me charged a company of freedmen or arabs or zulus armed withno i saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips and i saw dimly a caravan of black clumsy vehicles and at the reassuring shouts kyar you anywhere in the town boss fuh fifty cents i reasoned that i was merely a fare instead of a victim  i walked through long streets all leading uphill i wondered how those streets ever came down again perhaps they didnt until they were graded on a few of the main streets i saw lights in stores here and there saw street cars go by conveying worthy burghers hither and yon saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation and heard a burst of semilively laughter issuing from a sodawater and icecream parlor the streets other than main seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace and domesticity in many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades in a few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music there was indeed little doing i wished i had come before sundown so i returned to my hotel     in november 1864 the confederate general hood advanced against   nashville where he shut up a national force under general thomas   the latter then sallied forth and defeated the confederates in a   terrible conflict   all my life i have heard of admired and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the south in its peaceful conflicts in the tobaccochewing regions but in my hotel a surprise awaited me there were twelve bright new imposing capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby tall enough to be called urns and so widemouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant but although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging the enemy had not suffered bright new imposing capacious untouched they stood but shades of jefferson brick the tile floorthe beautiful tile floor i could not avoid thinking of the battle of nashville and trying to draw as is my foolish habit some deductions about hereditary marksmanship  here i first saw major by misplaced courtesy wentworth caswell i knew him for a type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him a rat has no geographical habitat my old friend a tennyson said as he so well said almost everything     prophet curse me the blabbing lip   and curse me the british vermin the rat   let us regard the word british as interchangeable ad lib a rat is a rat  this man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten where he had buried a bone he had a face of great acreage red pulpy and with a kind of sleepy massiveness like that of buddha he possessed one single virtuehe was very smoothly shaven the mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble i think that if he had not used his razor that day i would have repulsed his advances and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder  i happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when major caswell opened fire upon it i had been observant enough to perceive that the attacking force was using gatlings instead of squirrel rifles so i sidestepped so promptly that the major seized the opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant he had the blabbing lip in four minutes he had become my friend and had dragged me to the bar  i desire to interpolate here that i am a southerner but i am not one by profession or trade i eschew the string tie the slouch hat the prince albert the number of bales of cotton destroyed by sherman and plug chewing when the orchestra plays dixie i do not cheer i slide a little lower on the leathercornered seat and well order another würzburger and wish that longstreet hadbut whats the use  major caswell banged the bar with his fist and the first gun at fort sumter reechoed when he fired the last one at appomattox i began to hope but then he began on family trees and demonstrated that adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod  by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money  when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we dont seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally  why no said i after some reflection i dont see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates  well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it isill look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night  after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten oclock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange  a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town     nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing   centres of the country  it is the fifth boot and shoe market   in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing   city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods   grocery and drug business   i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair  adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one oclock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty  at nine oclock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle cæsar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles and had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that josephs coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the storythe story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville  once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the longmissing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a halfdollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine  this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones  step right in suh aint a speck of dust in itjus got back from a funeral suh  i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair  i want to go to 861 jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorillalike arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss  what is it to you i asked a little sharply  nothin suh jus nothin only its a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is cleanjes got back from a funeral suh  a mile and a half it must have been to our journeys end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses     the city has an area of 10 square miles 181 miles of streets   of which 137 miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost   2000000 with 77 miles of mains   eightsixtyone jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that 861 was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside  when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it  its two dollars suh he said  hows that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town  its two dollars suh he repeated obstinately its a long ways from the hotel  it is within the city limits and well within them i argued dont think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger cant you tell people from other people when you see em  the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern genlman to wear  then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably  his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished  boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh im obleeged to have two dollars i aint demandin it now suh after i know whar yous from im jus sayin that i has to have two dollars tonight and business is mighty po  peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance  you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police  for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew  i gave him two onedollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper righthand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability  enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate  the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it closethe trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold  azalea adair fifty years old whitehaired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queens received me  the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted whitepine bookshelves a cracked marbletop table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there  azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her learning was not broad but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope she had been educated at home and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made while she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the halfcalf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too muchoh so much too muchof real life  i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichords and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three oclock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition  your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen     it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with   the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity   of more than 2000 barrels   azalea adair seemed to reflect  i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isnt it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out ones window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the worldi mean the building of the tower of babelresult in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review  of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more colorermore drama and movement anderromance in some cities than in others  on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wingsprint and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face coveredwith rice powder in san franciscos chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards  some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders  you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake  she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes  azalea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper righthand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negrothere was no doubt about it  go up to mr bakers store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of teathe kind he always sends meand ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me  impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shrieki was sure it was hersfilled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry mans voice mingled with the girls further squeals and unintelligible words  azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the mans voice then something like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair  this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps tomorrow mr baker will be able to supply me  i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning streetcar lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adairs name but tomorrow would do  that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accompliceafter the fact if that is the correct legal termto a murder  as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the polychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is cleanjus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any  and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de genlman what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh  i am going out to 861 again tomorrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here ill let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill  i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied  i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasnt much money to speak of has she  for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver  she aint gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has resoces suh she has resoces  i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i  dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss  i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word  the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer  just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a longlost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies  with an air of producing millions he drew two onedollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper righthand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other  i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hackdrivers trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep  king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to 861 he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready  azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair without much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffeecolored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave grayhaired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro  uncle cæsar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back dont driverun i want you to get back sometime this week  it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the landpirates steeds after uncle cæsar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do  it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle cæsar who was once owned by her family  mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell  i thought she was miss adair i said  married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support  when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased  by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old cæsars grandfather was a king in congo cæsar himself has royal ways as you may have observed  as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle cæsars voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea  yes cæsar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle cæsar drove me back to the hotel  here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts  at about six oclock i went out for a stroll uncle cæsar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the cityhacks puffickly clean suhjus got back from a funeral  and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining buttonthe button of yellow hornwas gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle cæsar  about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i wedged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence  the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battlethe details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kindlooking man said after much thought when cas was about foteen he was one of the best spellers in school  while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip  at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners  in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by some of these noaccount niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person  i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fiftycent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below  i wonder whats doing in buffalo      xiv  psyche and the pskyscraper   if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellowmen 300 feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station  man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hodcarriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb  from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse those mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountainit is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city  it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orions summer belt  but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned 6 per week and ate tencent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at 630 and worked till 9 and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldnt look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper  two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a toolbox of the d p w and was stuck like a swallows nest against a corner of a downtown skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer  joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her  i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine aint very big but  oh aint it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamakers was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year  daisy passed joes corner every morning and evening  hello twobyfour was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum  aint much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever youll take us dont you think you might before long  storea fine scorn was expressed by daisys uptilted nosesardine box waitin for me you say gee youd have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe  i wouldnt mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary  daisys existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joes picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimesbut her next thought would always be of joes funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter  daisys other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suitcase knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and musclemaking properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten 256 shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twomblys second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway postoffice messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat  the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bariron 5 x 2 34 inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road  thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hairoily shoppingdistrictatthreeintheafternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldnt have been room in his store to draw it if he had  one saturday afternoon about four oclock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joes booth dabster wore a silk hat andwell daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat  mr dabsters going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there  hm said joe  the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her  its windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise  sure thing im all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe aint you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful overstocked  daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her  your quarters are somewhat limited mrerer remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about 340 by 100 feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added  is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths  a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below  what are they she asked trembling she had never been on a height like this before  and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space  bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of 340 feetmere crawling insects going to and fro at random  oh they aint anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenlytheyre folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up  walk over this way said dabster  he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky  i dont like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down  but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the halfnelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum at the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted  you dont carry me with you said daisy say i think its awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say im afraid up here  the philosopher smiled fatuously  the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there  daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above  yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is 66000000 miles from the sun  fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come frombrooklyn susie price in our storeher brother sent her a ticket to go to san franciscothats only three thousand miles  the philosopher smiled indulgently  our world he said is 91000000 miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are 211000 times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirtysix years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteenfoot telescope we can see 43000000 stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes 2700 years to reach us each of these stars  youre lyin cried daisy angrily youre tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down  she stamped her foot  arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heartexpounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed  out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed  take me down she cried vehemently youyou mental arithmetic  dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wildeyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop  outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him  joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove  the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms  oh joe ive been up on the skyscraper aint it cozy and warm and homelike in here im ready for you joe whenever you want me      xv  a bird of bagdad   without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg  quiggs restaurant is in fourth avenuethat street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenueborn and bred in the bowerystaggers northward full of good resolutions  where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its highborn sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broadwaisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hostshooray but now come the silent and terrible mountainsbuildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littells living age and g w m reynolds novels in the windows and nextpoor fourth avenuethe street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques  let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of deadandgone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jackolanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering homebound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tralala remained  not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialtonot after the echoing drumbeats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirtyfourth and is never seen again  near the sad scene of the thoroughfares dissolution stood the modest restaurant of quigg it stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling redbrick front its show window heaped with oranges tomatoes layer cakes pies canned asparagusits papiermâché lobster and two maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuceif you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the japanese advanceto sit there with one eye on your

quiggs title came through his mother one of her ancestors was a margravine of saxony his father was a tammany brave on account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the city hall so he opened a restaurant he was a man full of thought and reading the business gave him a living though he gave it little attention one side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure the other gave him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure by day he was quigg the restaurateur by night he was the margravethe caliphthe prince of bohemiagoing about the city in search of the odd the mysterious the inexplicable the recondite  one night at 9 at which hour the restaurant closed quigg set forth upon his quest there was a mingling of the foreign the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his shorttrimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city in his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards written upon without which he never stirred out of doors each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee others entitled their bearer to one two three or more days of full meals a few were for single regular meals a very few were in effect meal tickets good for a week  of riches and power margrave quigg had none but he had a caliphs heartit may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of harun al rashids perhaps some of the gold pieces in bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had quiggs beef stew among the fishermen and oneeyed calenders of manhattan  continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him or of distress that he might aid quigg became aware of a fastgathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street with each motion of the generous ones hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy traffic was suspended a policeman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on  the margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart he made his way swiftly to the young mans side and took his arm come with me at once he said in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear  pinched remarked the young man looking up at him with expressionless eyes pinched by a painless dentist take me away flatty and give me gas some lay eggs and some lay none when is a hen  still deeply seized by some inward grief but tractable he allowed quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park  there seated on a bench he upon whom a corner of the great caliphs mantle has descended spake with kindness and discretion seeking to know what evil had come upon the other disturbing his soul and driving him to such illconsidered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores  i was doing the monte cristo act as adapted by pompton n j wasnt i asked the young man  you were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after said the margrave  thats it you buy all the beer you can hold and then you throw chicken feed to oh curse that word chicken and hens feathers roosters eggs and everything connected with it  young sir said the margrave kindly but with dignity though i do not ask your confidence i invite it i know the world and i know humanity man is my study though i do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bountythrough a veil of theory and ignorance it is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellowmen you may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler the caliph harun al rashid whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress in my humble way i walk in his footsteps i seek for romance and adventure in city streetsnot in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces to me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in mens hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population in your strange behavior this evening i fancy a story lurks i read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift i observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair i repeati invite your confidence i am not without some power to alleviate and advise will you not trust me  gee how you talk exclaimed the young man a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes youve got the astor library skinned to a synopsis of preceding

ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones  i must confess sir that during the eight years that i

rocking the table with giant glee dot is right you gome at mine house at 8 oclock to der party      xvi  compliments of the season   there are no more christmas stories to write fiction is exhausted and newspaper items the next best are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life therefore for seasonable diversion we are reduced to very questionable sourcesfacts and philosophy we will begin withwhichever you choose to call it  children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rattrap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs  now comes the facts in the case of the ragdoll the tatterdemalion and the twentyfifth of december  on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her ragdoll there were many servants in the millionaires palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamondstudded automobiles and pony phaetons  the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the ragdoll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the childs mother who was all formthat is nearly all as you shall see  the child cried inconsolably and grew holloweyed knockkneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stopwatches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stopwatches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the ragdoll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the poolrooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawnbrokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot hollywreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in ballsthree high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the ragdoll or your heart  if doctor watsons investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaires wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the ragdoll in the childs heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the ragdoll but the bone well when dogs find bones theydone it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flips forefeet look watson earthdried earth between the toes of course the dogbut sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene  the millionaires palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn closemowed as a south ireland mans face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasaunce trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the ragdoll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard or fipun notes to toss to the sergeant then lets get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readersthe christmas heart of the thing  fuzzy was drunknot riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck  fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the kitchen door the bitter round of eleemosynary bedswithshowerbathattachment the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great citiesthese formed the chapters of his history  fuzzy walked toward the river down the street that bounded one side of the millionaires house and grounds he saw a leg of betsy the lost ragdoll protruding like the clue to a lilliputian murder mystery from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence he dragged forth the maltreated infant tucked it under his arm and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear well for betsy that she had no ears and well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black for the faces of fuzzy and the scotch terrier were those of brothers and the heart of no ragdoll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters  though you may not know it grogans saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which fuzzy traveled in grogans christmas cheer was already rampant  fuzzy entered with his doll he fancied that as a mummer at the feast of saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup  he set betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments as one entertaining his lady friend the loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it and roared the bartender gave fuzzy a drink oh many of us carry ragdolls  one for the lady suggested fuzzy impudently and tucked another contribution to art beneath his waistcoat  he began to see possibilities in betsy his firstnight had been a success visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him  in a group near the stove sat pigeon mccarthy black riley and oneear mike well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river they passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves the item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed one hundred dollars reward to earn it one must return the ragdoll lost strayed or stolen from the millionaires mansion it seemed that grief still ravaged unchecked in the bosom of the too faithful child flip the terrier capered and shook his absurd whisker before her powerless to distract she wailed for her betsy in the faces of walking talking mamaing and eyeclosing french mabelles and violettes the advertisement was a last resort  black riley came from behind the stove and approached fuzzy in his onesided parabolic way  the christmas mummer flushed with success had tucked betsy under his arm and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere  say bo said black riley to him where did you cop out dat doll  this doll asked fuzzy touching betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to why this doll was presented to me by the emperor of beloochistan i have seven hundred others in my country home in newport this doll  cheese the funny business said riley you swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill wherebut never mind dat you want to take fifty cents for de rags and take it quick me brothers kid at home might be wantin to play wid it heywhat  he produced the coin  fuzzy laughed a gurgling insolent alcoholic laugh in his face go to the office of sarah bernhardts manager and propose to him that she be released from a nights performance to entertain the tackytown lyceum and literary coterie you will hear the duplicate of fuzzys laugh  black riley gauged fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does his hand was itching to play the roman and wrest the rag sabine from the extemporaneous merryandrew who was entertaining an angel unaware but he refrained fuzzy was fat and solid and big three inches of wellnourished corporeity defended from the winter winds by dingy linen intervened between his vest and trousers countless small circular wrinkles running around his coatsleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle his small blue eyes bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness looked upon you kindly yet without abashment he was whiskerly whiskyly fleshily formidable so black riley temporized  wotll you take for it den he asked  money said fuzzy with husky firmness cannot buy her  he was intoxicated with the artists first sweet cup of attainment to set a fadedblue earthstained ragdoll on a bar to hold mimic converse with it and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honorcould base coin buy him from such achievements you will perceive that fuzzy had the temperament  fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sealion in search of other cafés to conquer  though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent lights were beginning to spangle the city like popcorn bursting in a deep skillet christmas eve impatiently expected was peeping over the brink of the hour millions had prepared for its celebration towns would be painted red you yourself have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the saturnalians  pigeon mccarthy black riley and oneear mike held a hasty converse outside grogans they were narrowchested pallid striplings not fighters in the open but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of turks fuzzy in a pitched battle could have eaten the three of them in a goasyouplease encounter he was already doomed  they overtook him just as he and betsy were entering costigans casino they deflected him and shoved the newspaper under his nose fuzzy could readand more  boys said he you are certainly damn true friends give me a week to think it over  the soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty  the boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow  a cool hundred said fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily  boys said he you are true friends ill go up and claim the reward the show business is not what it used to be  night was falling more surely the three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the millionaires house there fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously  you are a pack of puttyfaced beaglehounds he roared go away  they went awaya little way  in pigeon mccarthys pocket was a section of oneinch gaspipe eight inches long in one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug onehalf of it was packed tight with solder black riley carried a slungshot being a conventional thug oneear mike relied upon a pair of brass knucksan heirloom in the family  why fetch and carry said black riley when some one will do it for ye let him bring it out to us heywhat  we can chuck him in the river said pigeon mccarthy with a stone tied to his feet  youse guys make me tired said oneear mike sadly aint progress ever appealed to none of yez sprinkle a little gasoline on im and drop im on the drivewell  fuzzy entered the millionaires gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion the three goblins came up to the gate and lingeredone on each side of it one beyond the roadway they fingered their cold metal and leather confident  fuzzy rang the doorbell smiling foolishly and dreamily an atavistic instinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove but he wore no gloves so his left hand dropped embarrassed  the particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first sight of fuzzy but a second glance took in his passport his card of admission his surety of welcomethe lost ragdoll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm  fuzzy was admitted into a great hall dim with the glow from unseen lights the hireling went away and returned with a maid and the child the doll was restored to the mourning one she clasped her lost darling to her breast and then with the inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair fuzzy wriggled himself into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding intellect of the young the child bawled and was dragged away hugging her betsy close  there came the secretary pale poised polished gliding in pumps and worshipping pomp and ceremony he counted out into fuzzys hand ten tendollar bills then dropped his eye upon the door transferred it to james its custodian indicated the obnoxious earner of the reward with the other and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions  james gathered fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front door  when the money touched fuzzys dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette it was his it had been given him itand oh what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his minds eye he had tumbled to the foot of the ladder he was hungry homeless friendless ragged cold drifting and he held in his hand the key to a paradise of the mudhoney that he craved the fairy doll had waved a wand with her ragstuffed hand and now wherever he might go the enchanted palaces with shining footrests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to him  he followed james to the door  he paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass into the vestibule  beyond the wroughtiron gates in the dark highway black riley and his two pals casually strolled fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the ragdoll theirs  fuzzy stopped at the millionaires door and bethought himself like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind he was quite drunk mind you and the present was beginning to fade those wreaths and festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gaywhere had he seen such things before somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter andand some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before some one singing and playing a harp of course it was christmasfuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that  and then he went out of the present and there came back to him out of some impossible vanished and irrevocable past a little purewhite transient forgotten ghostthe spirit of noblesse oblige upon a gentleman certain things devolve  james opened the outer door a stream of light went down the graveled walk to the iron gate black riley mccarthy and oneear mike saw and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer about the gate  with a more imperious gesture than jamess master had ever used or could ever use fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door upon a gentleman certain things devolve especially at the christmas season  it is custcustomary he said to james the flustered when a gentleman calls on christmas eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house you undstand i shall not move shtep till i pass complments season with lady the house undstand  there was an argument james lost fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house unpleasantly i did not say he was a gentleman he was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost  a sterling silver bell rang james went back to answer it leaving fuzzy in the hall james explained somewhere to some one  then he came and conducted fuzzy into the library  the lady entered a moment later she was more beautiful and holy than any picture that fuzzy had seen she smiled and said something about a doll fuzzy didnt understand that he remembered nothing about a doll  a footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a stamped sterlingsilver waiter the lady took one the other was handed to fuzzy  as his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one brief moment he straightened himself and time so disobliging to most of us turned backward to accommodate fuzzy  forgotten christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent kris kringle were rising in the fumes of grogans whisky what had the millionaires mansion to do with a long wainscoted virginia hall where the riders were grouped around a silver punchbowl drinking the ancient toast of the house and why should the patter of the cab horses hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping under the shelter of the west veranda and what had fuzzy to do with any of it  the lady looking at him over her glass let her condescending smile fade away like a false dawn her eyes turned serious she saw something beneath the rags and scotch terrier whiskers that she did not understand but it did not matter  fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly  ppardon lady he said but couldnt leave without exchangin compments sheason with lady th house gainst princples genleman do sho  and then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the house when men wore lace ruffles and powder  the blessings of another year  fuzzys memory failed him the lady prompted  be upon this hearth  the guest stammered fuzzy  and upon her who continued the lady with a leading smile  oh cut it out said fuzzy illmanneredly i cant remember drink hearty  fuzzy had shot his arrow they drank the lady smiled again the smile of her caste james enveloped and reconducted him toward the front door the harp music still softly drifted through the house  outside black riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the gate  i wonder said the lady to herself musing whobut there were so many who came i wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low  fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door the lady called james  james stalked back obsequiously leaving fuzzy waiting unsteadily with his brief spark of the divine fire gone  outside black riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of gaspipe  you will conduct this gentleman said the lady downstairs then tell louis to get out the mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go      xvii  a night in new arabia   the great city of bagdadonthesubway is caliphridden its palaces bazaars khans and byways are thronged with al rashids in divers disguises seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity you can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune you will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celerycrowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press  so then fearfully through the harunhaunted streets creep the oneeyed calenders the little hunchback and the barbers sixth brother hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans  entertainment for many arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of commanders of the faithful until dawn you might sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie rocefeler who sent the forty thieves to soak up the oil plant of ali baba of the good caliph karnegghe who gave away palaces of the seven voyages of sailbad the sinner who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands of the fisherman and the bottle of the barmecides boarding house of aladdins rise to wealth by means of his wonderful gasmeter  but now there being ten sultans to one sheherazade she is held too valuable to be in fear of the bowstring in consequence the art of narrative languishes and as the lesser caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits too often comes the report from arabian headquarters that the captive refused to talk  this reticence then in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their philanthropyscourged world must in a degree account for the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale which shall be called  the story of the caliph who alleviated his conscience  old jacob spraggins mixed for himself some scotch and lithia water at his 1200 oak sideboard inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition for immediately afterward he struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room  by the coke ovens of hell it must be that ten thousand dollars if i can get that squared itll do the trick  thus by the commonest artifice of the trade having gained your interest the action of the story will now be suspended leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before  when old jacob was young jacob he was a breaker boy in a pennsylvania coal mine i dont know what a breaker boy is but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinnerpail to have his picture taken for magazine articles anyhow jacob was one but instead of dying of overwork at nine and leaving his helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers reserve fund he hitched up his galluses put a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then and at fortyfive was worth 20000000  there now its over hardly had time to yawn did you ive seen biographies thatbut let us dissemble  i want you to consider jacob spraggins esq after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career the stages meant are first humble origin second deserved promotion third stockholder fourth capitalist fifth trust magnate sixth rich malefactor seventh caliph eighth x the eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics  at fiftyfive jacob retired from active business the income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal iron real estate oil railroads manufactories and corporations but none of it touched jacobs hands in a raw state it was a sterilized increment carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary jacob built a threemilliondollar palace on a corner lot fronting on nabob avenue city of new bagdad and began to feel the mantle of the late h a rashid descending upon him eventually jacob slipped the mantle under his collar tied it in a neat fourinhand and became a licensed harrier of our mesopotamian proletariat  when a mans income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders he begins to think about his souls salvation now the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten the capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth the trust magnate estimates it the rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the p d  q the caliph merely smiles and talks about hammerstein and the musical lasses there is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a wheretodinewell tavern between a magnate and his wife the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure 3000000 higher than did her future divorcé oh well i myself heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had after all we are all humancount tolstoi r fitzsimmons peter pan and the rest of us  dont lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers  there will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon  when jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the zoo he decided upon organized charity he had his secretary send a check for one million to the universal benevolent association of the globe you may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through but that is neither here nor there the association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the 24th ult with enclosure as stated separated by a double line but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of oddities of the days news in an evening paper jacob spraggins read that one jasper spargyous had donated 100000 to the u b a of g a camel may have a stomach for each day in the week but i dare not venture to accord him whiskers for fear of the great displeasure at washington but if he have whiskers surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the k of h the right is reserved to reject any and all bids signed s peter secretary and gatekeeper  next jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a 200000 laboratory the college did not maintain a scientific course but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead which was no diversion of funds so far as jacob ever discovered  the faculty met and invited jacob to come over and take his a b c degree before sending the invitation they smiled cut out the c added the proper punctuation marks and all was well  while walking on the campus before being capped and gowned jacob saw two professors strolling nearby their voices long adapted to indoor acoustics undesignedly reached his ear  there goes the latest chevalier dindustrie said one of them to buy a sleeping powder from us he gets his degree tomorrow  in foro conscientiæ said the other lets eave arf a brick at im  jacob ignored the latin but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him there was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought that was before the passage of the pure food and drugs act  jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale  if i could see folks made happier he said to himselfif i could see em myself and hear em express their gratitude for what i done for em it would make me feel better this donatin funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine  so jacob followed his nose which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest  the very thing said jacob i will charter two river steamboats pack them full of these unfortunate children andsay ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream and give them a delightful outing up the sound the sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than i can work it off my mind  jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a drop letters here sign over it hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barbers pole and a stack of ash cans words came out of the postoffice slitsmooth husky words with gloves on em but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment  say sport do you know where you are at well dis is mike ogradys district youre buttin intosee mikes got de stomachache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhoodsee and if deres any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here mikes money pays for emsee dont you butt in or somethingll be handed to you youse d settlers and reformers with your social ologies and

to scrap wit mike ogrady for de santa claus belt in dis district  clearly that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted so caliph spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the east side to keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity presented the y m c a of his native town with a 10000 collection of butterflies and sent a check to the famine sufferers in china big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamondfilled teeth for all their gods but none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliphs heart he tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters 10 and 20 bills he got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed he sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman and bought for her the star part in a new comedy he might have gotten rid of 50000 more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to write letters to her but she lost the suit for lack of evidence while his capital still kept piling up and his optikos needleorum camelibusor rich mans diseasewas unrelieved  in caliph spragginss 3000000 home lived his sister henrietta who used to cook for the coal miners in a twentyfivecent eating house in coketown pa and who now would have offered john mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake and his daughter celia nineteen back from boardingschool and from being polished off by private instructors in the restaurant languages and those études and things  celia is the heroine lest the artists delineation of her charms on this very page humbug your fancy take from me her authorized description she was a nicelooking awkward loud rather bashful brownhaired girl with a sallow complexion bright eyes and a perpetual smile she had a wholesome spragginsinherited love for plain food loose clothing and the society of the lower classes she had too much health and youth to feel the burden of wealth she had a wide mouth that kept the peppermintpepsin tablets rattling like hail from the slotmachine wherever she went and she could whistle hornpipes keep this picture in mind and let the artist do his worst  celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocers young man the receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked so he did not notice the transfer a horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly newlaid eggs out of the wagon  young lady reader you would have liked that grocers young man yourself but you wouldnt have given him your heart because you are saving it for a ridingmaster or a shoemanufacturer with a torpid liver or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at palm beach oh i know about it so i am glad the grocers young man was for celia and not for you  the grocers young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders he wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head and his hair was strawcolored and curly and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to deliverywagon horses he slung imported a1 fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered at boardinghouses and when he picked up his whip your mind instantly recalled mr tackett and his air with the buttonless foils  tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house the grocers wagon came about ten in the morning for three days celia watched the driver when he came finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of pomona ceres and the canning factories then she consulted annette  to be explicit annette mccorkle the second housemaid who deserves a paragraph herself annette fletcherized large numbers of romantic novels which she obtained at a free public library branch donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business she was celias sidekicker and chum though aunt henrietta didnt know it you may hazard a bean or two  oh canarybird seed exclaimed annette aint it a corkin situation you a heiress and fallin in love with him on sight hes a sweet boy too and above his business but he aint susceptible like the common run of grocers assistants he never pays no attention to me  he will to me said celia  riches began annette unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting  oh youre not so beautiful said celia with her wide disarming smile neither am i but he shant know that theres any money mixed up with my looks such as they are thats fair now i want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron annette  oh marshmallows cried annette i see aint it lovely its just like lurline the lefthanded or a buttonhole makers wrongs ill bet hell turn out to be a count  there was a long hallway or passageway as they call it in the land of the colonels with one side latticed running along the rear of the house the grocers young man went through this to deliver his goods one morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes sallow complexion and wide smiling mouth wearing a maids cap and apron but as he was cumbered with a basket of early drumhead lettuce and trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive queen olives he saw no more than that she was one of the maids  but on his way out he came up behind her and she was whistling fishers hornpipe so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their cases for shame  the grocers young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it hung on his collar button behind  thats out o sight kid said he  my name is celia if you please said the whistler dazzling him with a threeinch smile  thats all right im thomas mcleod what part of the house do you work in  im thethe second parlor maid  do you know the falling waters  no said celia we dont know anybody we got rich too quickthat is mr spraggins did  ill make you acquainted said thomas mcleod its a strathspeythe first cousin to a hornpipe  if celias whistling put the piccolos out of commission thomas mcleods surely made the biggest flutes hunt their holes he could actually whistle bass  when he stopped celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon and ride with him clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferryboat of the charon line  ill be around tomorrow at 1015 said thomas with some spinach and a case of carbonic  ill practice that whatyoumaycallit said celia i can whistle a fine second  the processes of courtship are personal and do not belong to general literature they should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements of iron tonics and in the secret bylaws of the womans auxiliary of the ancient order of the rat trap but genteel writing may contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of the xray or of park policemen  a day came when thomas mcleod and celia lingered at the end of the latticed passage  sixteen a week isnt much said thomas letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades  celia looked through the latticework and whistled a dead march shopping with aunt henrietta the day before she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs  maybe ill get a raise next month said thomas ill be around tomorrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap  all right said celia annettes married cousin pays only 20 a month for a flat in the bronx  never for a moment did she count on the spraggins money she knew aunt henriettas invincible pride of caste and pas mightiness as a colossus of cash and she understood that if she chose thomas she and her grocers young man might go whistle for a living  another day came thomas violating the dignity of nabob avenue with the devils dream whistled keenly between his teeth  raised to eighteen a week yesterday he said been pricing flats around morningside you want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap old girl  oh tommy said celia with her broadest smile wont that be enough i got betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding i guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to  and tell no lie said thomas  and i can sweep and polish and dustof course a parlor maid learns that and we could whistle duets of evenings  the old man said hed raise me to twenty at christmas if bryan couldnt think of any harder name to call a republican than a postponer said the grocers young man  i can sew said celia and i know that you must make the gas companys man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter and i know how to put up quince jam and window curtains  bully youre all right cele yes i believe we can pull it off on eighteen  as he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running swiftly to the gate  and oh tommy i forgot she called softly i believe i could make your neckties  forget it said thomas decisively  and another thing she continued sliced cucumbers at night will drive away cockroaches  and sleep too you bet said mr mcleod yes i believe if i have a delivery to make on the west side this afternoon ill look in at a furniture store i know over there  it was just as the wagon dashed away that old jacob spraggins struck the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember which justifies the reflection that some stories as well as life and puppies thrown into wells move around in circles painfully but briefly we must shed light on jacobs words  the foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty a poor coaldigger ever hear of a rich one had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried to raise corn not a nubbin jacob whose nose was a diviningrod told him there was a vein of coal beneath he bought the land from the miner for 125 and sold it a month afterward for 10000 luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself into a black coat opening in the back as soon as he heard the news  and so for forty years afterward we find jacob illuminated with the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner respite and nepenthe might be his  and now must come swift action for we have here some four thousand words and not a tear shed and never a pistol joke safe nor bottle cracked  old jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs if any existed of the old miner hugh mcleod  get the point of course i know as well as you do that thomas is going to be the heir i might have concealed the name but why always hold back your mystery till the end i say let it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to  after the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollarsi mean milesthey cornered thomas at the grocery and got his confession that hugh mcleod had been his grandfather and that there were no other heirs they arranged a meeting for him and old jacob one morning in one of their offices  jacob liked the young man very much he liked the way he looked straight at him when he talked and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rosecolored vase on the centretable  there was a slight flaw in jacobs system of restitution he did not consider that the act to be perfect should include confession so he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his conscience  well sir said thomas this sounds to me like an illustrated postcard from south boston with were having a good time here written on it i dont know the game is this ten thousand dollars money or do i have to save so many coupons to get it  old jacob counted out to him twenty fivehundreddollar bills  that was better he thought than a check thomas put them thoughtfully into his pocket  grandfathers best thanks he said to the party who sends it  jacob talked on asking him about his work how he spent his leisure time and what his ambitions were the more he saw and heard of thomas the better he liked him he had not met many young men in bagdad so frank and wholesome  i would like to have you visit my house he said i might help you in investing or laying out your money i am a very wealthy man i have a daughter about grown and i would like for you to know her there are not many young men i would care to have call on her  im obliged said thomas im not much at making calls its generally the side entrance for mine and besides im engaged to a girl that has the delaware peach crop killed in the blossom shes a parlor maid in a house where i deliver goods she wont be working there much longer though say dont forget to give your friend my grandfathers best regards youll excuse me now my wagons outside with a lot of green stuff thats got to be delivered see you again sir  at eleven thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the spraggins mansion thomas was only twentytwo so as he came back he took out the handful of fivehundreddollar bills and waved them carelessly annette took a pair of eyes as big as creamed onion to the cook  i told you he was a count she said after relating he never would carry on with me  but you say he showed money said the cook  hundreds of thousands said annette carried around loose in his pockets and he never would look at me  it was paid to me today thomas was explaining to celia outside it came from my grandfathers estate say cele whats the use of waiting now im going to quit the job tonight why cant we get married next week  tommy said celia im no parlor maid ive been fooling you im miss spragginscelia spraggins the newspapers say ill be worth forty million dollars some day  thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known him  i suppose then said he i suppose then youll not be marrying me next week but you can whistle  no said celia ill not be marrying you next week my father would never let me marry a grocers clerk but ill marry you tonight tommy if you say so  old jacob spraggins came home at 930 p m in his motor car the make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully i am giving you unsubsidized fiction had it been a street car i could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had jacob called for his daughter he had bought a ruby necklace for her and wanted to hear her say what a kind thoughtful dear old dad he was  there was a brief search in the house for her and then came annette glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics  oh sir said she wondering if she should kneel miss celias just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young man to be married i couldnt stop her sir they went in a cab  what young man roared old jacob  a millionaire if you please sira rich nobleman in disguise he carries his money with him and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us sir he never did seem to take to me  jacob rushed out in time to catch his car the chauffeur had been delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind  here gaston or mike or whatever you call yourself scoot around the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab if you do run it down  there was a cab in sight a block away gaston or mike with his eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette picked up the trail neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it  what tell you doin yelled the cabman  pa shrieked celia  grandfathers remorseful friends agent said thomas wonder whats on his conscience now  a thousand thunders said gaston or mike i have no other match  young man said old jacob severely how about that parlor maid you were engaged to   a couple of years afterward old jacob went into the office of his private secretary  the amalgamated missionary society solicits a contribution of 30000 toward the conversion of the koreans said the secretary  pass em up said jacob  the university of plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of 50000 that you bestowed upon it is past due  tell em its been cut out  the scientific society of clam cove long island asks for 10000 to buy alcohol to preserve specimens  waste basket  the society for providing healthful recreation for working girls wants 20000 from you to lay out a golf course  tell em to see an undertaker  cut em all out went on jacob ive quit being a good thing i need every dollar i can scrape or save i want you to write to the directors of every company that im interested in and recommend a 10 per cent cut in salaries and sayi noticed half a cake of soap lying in a corner of the hall as i came in i want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste ive got no money to throw away and sayweve got vinegar pretty well in hand havent we  the globe spice  seasons company said secretary controls the market at present  raise vinegar two cents a gallon notify all our branches  suddenly jacob spragginss plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin he walked over to the secretarys desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger  bit it he said darned if he didnt and he aint had the tooth three weeksjaky mcleod my celias kid hell be worth a hundred millions by the time hes twentyone if i can pile it up for him  as he was leaving old jacob turned at the door and said  better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two ill be back in an hour and sign the letters   the true history of the caliph harun al rashid relates that toward the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his arabian nights rambles happy are we in these days of enlightenment when the only death warrant

the big downtown restaurants it is in what the papers call the financial district each day from 12 oclock to 2 hinkles was full of hungry customersmessenger boys stenographers brokers owners of mining stock promoters inventors with patents pendingand also people with money  the cashiership at hinkles was no sinecure hinkle egged and toasted and griddlecaked and coffeed a good many customers and he lunched as good a word as dined many more it might be said that hinkles breakfast crowd was a contingent but his luncheon patronage amounted to a horde  miss merriam sat on a stool at a desk inclosed on three sides by a strong high fencing of woven brass wire through an arched opening at the bottom you thrust your waiters check and the money while your heart went pitapat  for miss merriam was lovely and capable she could take 45 cents out of a 2 bill and refuse an offer of marriage before you couldnextlost your chanceplease dont shove she could keep cool and collected while she collected your check give you the correct change win your heart indicate the toothpick stand and rate you to a quarter of a cent better than bradstreet could to a thousand in less time than it takes to pepper

the other fellow is responsible for the slang  every male patron of hinkles from the a d t boys up to the curbstone brokers adored miss merriam when they paid their checks they wooed her with every wile known to cupids art between the meshes of the brass railing went smiles winks compliments tender vows invitations to dinner sighs languishing looks and merry banter that was wafted pointedly back by the gifted miss merriam  there is no coign of vantage more effective than the position of young lady cashier she sits there easily queen of the court of commerce she is duchess of dollars and devoirs countess of compliments and coin leading lady of love and luncheon you take from her a smile and a canadian dime and you go your way uncomplaining you count the cheery word or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures and you pocket the change for a five uncomputed perhaps the brassbound inaccessibility multiplies her charmsanyhow she is a shirtwaisted angel immaculate trim manicured seductive brighteyed ready alertpsyche circe and ate in one separating you from your circulating medium after your sirloin medium  the young men who broke bread at hinkles never settled with the cashier without an exchange of badinage and open compliment many of them went to greater lengths and dropped promissory hints of theatre tickets and chocolates the older men spoke plainly of orange blossoms generally withering the tentative petals by afterallusions to harlem flats one broker who had been squeezed by copper proposed to miss merriam more regularly than he ate  during a

mcramsey and carried him into hinkles restaurant when the aged but indestructible banker opened his eyes he saw a beautiful vision bending over him with a pitiful tender smile bathing his forehead with beef tea and chafing his hands with something frappé out of a chafingdish mr mcramsey sighed lost a vest button gazed with deep gratitude upon his fair preserveress and then recovered consciousness  to the seaside library all who are anticipating a romance banker mcramsey had an aged and respected wife and his sentiments toward miss merriam were fatherly he talked to her for half an hour with interestnot the kind that went with his talks during business hours the next day he brought mrs mcramsey down to see her the old couple were childlessthey had only a married daughter living in brooklyn  to make a short story shorter the beautiful cashier won the hearts of the good old couple they came to hinkles again and again they invited her to their oldfashioned but splendid home in one of the east seventies miss merriams winning loveliness her sweet frankness and impulsive heart took them by storm they said a hundred times that miss merriam reminded them so much of their lost daughter the brooklyn matron née ramsey had the figure of buddha and a face like the ideal of an art photographer miss merriam was a combination of curves smiles rose leaves pearls satin and hairtonic posters enough of the fatuity of parents  a month after the worthy couple became acquainted with miss merriam she stood before hinkle one afternoon and resigned her cashiership  theyre going to adopt me she told the bereft restaurateur theyre funny old people but regular dears and the swell home they have got say hinkle there isnt any use of talkingim on the à la carte to wear brown duds

well that was the evening the baby was sick of course  at the bazaar the mcramseys were prominent miss merermcramsey was exquisitely beautiful the earl of hitesbury had been very attentive to her

broadway hotel and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal coquette which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in twentysixth street safely forded the spring freshet of vehicles in fifth avenue and meandered along the walks of budding madison square  the lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral the color motif was greenthe presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation  the callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris a poisonous green reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the summer and autumn the bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a fortycent dinner the sky above was of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with true and sue and coo the one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted benchesa shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last years fastblack cravenette raincoat but to the citybred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece  and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editors mind  editor westbrooks spirit was contented and serene the april number of the

enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city  while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor wasdaweshackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scarcely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby  while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered  he was a fiction writer and one of westbrooks old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrooks the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawes capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon ones trunk under eightbranched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented  its maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a fivecourse marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert im hungry  as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrooks sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months  why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the others changed appearance  sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i cant come to yours looking as i do oh sit downyou wont be disgraced those halfplucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porchclimber they wont know you are only an editor  smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield  dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream  i have just began the editor  oh i know dont finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my officeboy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldnt read the keep off the grass signs  how goes the writing asked the editor  look at me said dawe for your answer now dont put on that embarrassed friendlybuthonest look and ask me why i dont get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver im in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and ill force you fellows to admit it yet ill make you change the spelling of regrets to cheque before im done with you  editor westbrook gazed through his noseglasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expressionthe copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor  have you read the last story i sent youthe alarum of the soul asked dawe  carefully i hesitated over that story shack really i did it had some good points i was writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you i regret  never mind the regrets said dawe grimly theres neither salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first  the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterizationthe best you have done constructionalmost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except  i can write english cant i interrupted dawe  i have always told you said the editor that you had a style  then the trouble is  same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i dont know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every dénouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky selfaddressed envelopes at your door  oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively youve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps goldenhaired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of anothers vengeance  editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency  i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones  not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly ill tell you what shed say in real life shed say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord its one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the policestation why wasnt somebody looking after her id like to know for gods sake get out of my way or ill never get ready not that hatthe brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy shes usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how im upset  thats the way shed talk continued dawe people in real life dont fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply cant do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more thats all  shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips  i never did said dawe did you  well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say  so can i said dawe  and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof  my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a subconscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotiona sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value  and in the name of the seven sacred saddleblankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe  from life answered the editor triumphantly  the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent  on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother  punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe wats he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst genlemen that comes in the square to set and think  editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure  tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down  when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fiancée has been shot by a burglar he saysi do not recall the exact words but  i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a thirtytwo bullet make a big hole its kind of hard luck aint it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side  and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words arelet me see  she says interposed the author well what do you think of that  absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anticlimaxplunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy  wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts highfalutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse  the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information  say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed  it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not  if i could prove to you that i am right  im sorry shack but im afraid i havent time to argue any further just now  i dont want to argue said dawe i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one  how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone  listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of truetolife fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines ive fought for it for three years and im down to my last dollar with two months rent due  i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to  four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million  you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory  i will if youll give me about half an hour of your time ill prove to you that i am right ill prove it by louise  your wife exclaimed westbrook how  well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louise has always been she thinks im the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctors signature shes been fonder and more faithful than ever since ive been cast for the neglected genius part  indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and well have one of those informal chafingdish suppers that we used to enjoy so much  later said dawe when i get another shirt and now ill tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfastif you can call tea and oatmeal breakfastlouise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eightyninth street she said she would return at three oclock she is always on time to a minute it is now  dawe glanced toward the editors watch pocket  twentyseven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his timepiece  we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the diningroom concealed by the portières in that note ill say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the needs of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct oneyours or mine  oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawes feelings played upon in such a manner  brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do its for her benefit as well as mine ive got to get a market for my stories in some way it wont hurt louise shes healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninetyeightcent watch itll last for only a minute and then ill step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook  editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guineapigs to go around  the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to the south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis  a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly overdecorated façade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latchkey into the door of one of the front flats  when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished  get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello whats this heres a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning  he picked up an envelope that lay on the centretable and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard      dear shackleford      by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and    still agoing ive got a place in the chorus of the occidental    opera co and we start on the road today at twelve oclock i    didnt want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own    living im not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she    said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg    and dictionary and shes not coming back either weve been    practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope    you will be successful and get along all right goodbye     louise   dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice  my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heavens fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting bywords of traitors and fiends  editor westbrooks glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips  say shack aint that a hell of a note wouldnt that knock you off your perch shack aint it hell now shackaint it       xx  past one at rooneys   only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin  so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mikes for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemys movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mikes that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two of the dry dock gang minding their ps and qs so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel  but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooneys where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom  overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a deweylike swiftness got an eightinch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanuss simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy  the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen  raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a birds eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no im not telling you his name ill settle with um meself wowouch easy boys yes ill attend to his case meself im not making any complaint  at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later hell maybe not croak said brick and he wont tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up its unhandy just now because tim corrigans in europe for a weeks end with kings hell be back on the kaiser williams next friday youll have to duck out of sight till then timll fix it up all right for us when he comes back  this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooneys one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career  until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm  it was on thursday evening that corks seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a footrail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him  at halfpast twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish crosstown street looking up at the name rooneys picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a secondstory window he had heard of the place as a tough hangout with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the café  here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about halffilled with rooneys guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a songsongs full of mr johnsons and babes and coonshistorical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twentyeighth street  for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twentynine he has wellingtons nose dantes chin the cheekbones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbetts foot work and the poise of an elevenyearold east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swelldressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooneys to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouthdrink and ragtime and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooneys visible plaid waistcoat rooneys is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooneys ladies may smoke  mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrowbrimmed derby to the back of his brickdust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the selfconscious joyless laughter the wineborn warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of wellclothed and frankeyed beneficiaries of rooneys removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau despagneall these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulets high rear room  a girl alone entered rooneys glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two thingseither to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on  her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable topgallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled  instantly the doom of each was sealed  the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coatsofarms or shaws plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated creatures such as the dove the bluetailed dingbat and the tendollaraweek clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice  with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love  have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references  no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully imerely dropped in fora slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home  cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine  say said the girl blazing upon him with lowvoiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what  she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright under her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt  beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didnt mean anything sure its no harm to smoke maudy  rooneys said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it aint a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name aint maudy if you please its ruby delamere  thats a swell handle said cork approvingly mines mcmanuscorereddie mcmanus  oh you cant help that laughed ruby dont apologize  cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooneys wall the girls ubiquitous eyes took in the movement  i know its late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one aint rooneys all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice ive been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they wont let you smoke there of course i just dropped in here on my way home for a puff aint it all right in here if it aint i wont come any more  its a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere said cork im not wise to this particular joint but anyhow you dont want to have your picture taken in it for a present to your sunday school teacher have one more beer and then say i take you home  but i dont know you said the girl with fine scrupulosity i dont accept the company of gentlemen i aint acquainted with my aunt never would allow that  why said cork mcmanus pulling his ear im the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin a lady you bet youll find me all right ruby and ill give you a tip as to who i am my governor is one of the hottest crossbuns of the wall street push morgans cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out the window me well im in trainin down the street the old mans goin to put a seat on the stock exchange in my stockin my next birthday but it all sounds like a lemon to me what i like is golf and yachtin anderwell say a corkin fast tenround bout between welterweights with walkin gloves  i guess you can walk to the door with me said the girl hesitatingly but with a certain pleased flutter still i never heard anything extra good about wall street brokers or sports who go to prize fights either aint you got any other recommendations  i think youre the swellest looker ive had my lamps on in little old new york said cork impressively  thatll be about enough of that now aint you the kidder she modified her chiding words by a deep long beaming smileembellished look at her cavalier well drink our beer before we go ha  a waiter sang the tobacco smoke grew denser drifting and rising in spirals waves tilted layers cumulus clouds cataracts and suspended fogs like some fifth element created from the ribs of the ancient four laughter and chat grew louder stimulated by rooneys liquids and rooneys gallant hospitality to lady nicotine  one oclock struck downstairs there was a sound of closing and locking doors frank pulled down the green shades of the front windows carefully rooney went below in the dark hall and stood at the front door his cigarette cached in the hollow of his hand thenceforth whoever might seek admittance must present a countenance familiar to rooneys hawks eyethe countenance of a true sport  cork mcmanus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly with their elbows on the table their glasses of beer were pushed to one side scarcely touched with the foam on them sunken to a thin white scum since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of rooneys had become renovated and spiced not by any addition to the list of distractions but because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones the flattest glass of beer acquired the tang of illegality the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and order the harmless and genial company became outlaws defying authority and rule for after the stroke of one in such places as rooneys where neither bed nor board is to be had drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million it is the law  say said cork mcmanus almost covering the table with his eloquent chest and elbows was that dead straight about you workin in the bookbindery and livin at homeand just happenin in hereandand all that spiel you gave me  sure it was answered the girl with spirit why what do you think do you suppose id lie to you go down to the shop and ask em i handed it to you on the level  on the dead level said cork thats the way i want it because  because what  i throw up my hands said cork youve got me goin youre the girl ive been lookin for will you keep company with me ruby  would you like me toeddie  surest thing but i wanted a straight story aboutabout yourself you know when a fellow had a girla steady girlshes got to be all right you know shes got to be straight goods  youll find ill be straight goods eddie  of course you will i believe what you told me but you cant blame me for wantin to find out you dont see many girls smokin cigarettes in places like rooneys after midnight that are like you  the girl flushed a little and lowered her eyes i see that now she said meekly i didnt know how bad it looked but i wont do it any more and ill go straight home every night and stay there and ill give up cigarettes if you say so eddieill cut em out from this minute on  corks air became judicial proprietary condemnatory yet sympathetic a lady can smoke he decided slowly at times and places why because its bein a lady that helps her pull it off  im going to quit theres nothing to it said the girl she flicked the stub of her cigarette to the floor  at times and places repeated cork when i call round for you of evenins well hunt out a dark bench in stuyvesant square and have a puff or two but no more rooneys at one oclocksee  eddie do you really like me the girl searched his hard but frank features eagerly with anxious eyes  on the dead level  when are you coming to see mewhere i live  thursdayday after tomorrow evenin that suit you  fine ill be ready for you come about seven walk to the door with me tonight and ill show you where i live dont forget now and dont you go to see any other girls before then mister i bet you will though  on the dead level said cork you make em all look like ragdolls to me honest you do i know when im suited on the dead level i do  against the front door downstairs repeated heavy blows were delivered the loud crashes resounded in the room above only a triphammer or a policemans foot could have been the author of those sounds rooney jumped like a bullfrog to a corner of the room turned off the electric lights and hurried swiftly below the room was left utterly dark except for the winking red glow of cigars and cigarettes a second volley of crashes came up from the assaulted door a little rustling murmuring panic moved among the besieged guests frank cool smooth reassuring could be seen in the rosy glow of the burning tobacco going from table to table  all keep still was his caution dont talk or make any noise everything will be all right now dont feel the slightest alarm well take care of you all  ruby felt across the table until corks firm hand closed upon hers are you afraid eddie she whispered are you afraid youll get a free ride  nothin doin in the teethchatterin line said cork i guess rooneys been slow with his envelope dont you worry girly ill look out for you all right  yet mr mcmanuss ease was only skin and muscledeep with the police looking everywhere for buck malones assailant and with corrigan still on the ocean wave he felt that to be caught in a police raid would mean an ended career for him he wished he had remained in the high rear room of the true capulet reading the pink extras  rooney seemed to have opened the front door below and engaged the police in conference in the dark hall the wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway frank made a wireless news station of himself at the upper door suddenly he closed the door hurried to the extreme rear of the room and lighted a dim gas jet  this way everybody he called sharply in a hurry but no noise please  the guests crowded in confusion to the rear rooneys lieutenant swung open a panel in the wall overlooking the back yard revealing a ladder already placed for the escape  down and out everybody he commanded ladies first less talking please dont crowd theres no danger  among the last cork and ruby waited their turn at the open panel suddenly she swept him aside and clung to his arm fiercely  before we go out she whispered in his earbefore anything happens tell me again eddie do you ldo you really like me  on the dead level said cork holding her close with one arm when it comes to you im all in  when they turned they found they were lost and in darkness the last of the fleeing customers had descended half way across the yard they bore the ladder stumbling giggling hurrying to place it against an adjoining low building over the roof of which their only route to safety  we may as well sit down said cork grimly maybe rooney will stand the cops off anyhow  they sat at a table and their hands came together again  a number of men then entered the dark room feeling their way about one of them rooney himself found the switch and turned on the electric light the other man was a cop of the old régimea big cop a thick cop a fuming abrupt copnot a pretty cop he went up to the pair at the table and sneered familiarly at the girl  what are youse doin in here he asked  dropped in for a smoke said cork mildly  had any drinks  not later than one oclock  get outquick ordered the cop then sit down he countermanded  he took off corks hat roughly and scrutinized him shrewdly your names mcmanus  bad guess said cork its peterson  cork mcmanus or something like that said the cop you put a knife into a man in dutch mikes saloon a week ago  aw forget it said cork who perceived a shade of doubt in the officers tones youve got my mug mixed with somebody elses  have i well youll come to the station with me anyhow and be looked over the description fits you all right the cop twisted his fingers under corks collar come on he ordered roughly  cork glanced at ruby she was pale and her thin nostrils quivered her quick eye danced from one mans face to the other as they spoke or moved what hard luck cork was thinkingcorrigan on the briny and ruby met and lost almost within an hour somebody at the police station would recognize him without a doubt hard luck  but suddenly the girl sprang up and hurled herself with both arms extended against the cop his hold on corks collar was loosened and he stumbled back two or three paces  dont go so fast maguire she cried in shrill fury keep your hands off my man you know me and you know im givin you good advice dont you touch him again hes not the guy you are lookin forill stand for

red and white by turns because ive known him a year hes mine oughtnt i to know and what am i doin here with him thats easy  she stooped low and reached down somewhere into a swirl of flirted draperies heliotrope and black an elastic snapped she threw on the table toward cork a folded wad of bills the money slowly straightened itself with little leisurely jerks  take that jimmy and lets go said the girl im declarin the usual dividends maguire she said to the officer you had your usual fivedollar graft at the usual corner at ten  a lie said the cop turning purple you go on my beat again and ill

carefully into his pocket and said come on fanny lets have some chop suey before we go home  clear out quick both of you or ill  the cops bluster trailed away into inconsequentiality  at the corner of the street the two halted cork handed back the money without a word the girl took it and slipped it slowly into her handbag her expression was the same she had worn when she entered rooneys that nightshe looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder  i guess i might as well say goodbye here she said dully you wont want to see me again of course will youshake handsmr mcmanus  i mightnt have got wise if you hadnt give the snap away said cork why did you do it  youd have been pinched if i hadnt thats why aint that reason enough then she began to cry honest eddie i was goin to be the best girl in the world i hated to be what i am i hated men i was ready almost to die when i saw you and you seemed different from everybody else and when i found you liked me too why i thought id make you believe i was good and i was goin to be good when you asked to come to my house and see me why id have died rather than do anything wrong after that but whats the use of talking about it ill say goodby if you will mr mcmanus  cork was pulling at his ear i knifed malone said he i was the one the cop wanted  oh thats all right said the girl listlessly it didnt make any difference about that  that was all hot air about wall street i dont do nothin but hang out with a tough gang on the east side  that was all right too repeated the girl it didnt make any difference  cork straightened himself and pulled his hat down low i could get a job at obriens he said aloud but to himself  goodby said the girl  come on said cork taking her arm i know a place  two blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little park  what house is this she asked drawing back why are you going in there  a street lamp shone brightly in front there was a brass nameplate at one side of the closed front doors cork drew her firmly up the steps read that said he  she looked at the name on the plate and gave a cry between a moan and a scream no no no eddie oh my god no i wont let you do thatnot now let me go you shant do that you cantyou musnt not after you know no no come away quick oh my god please eddie come  half fainting she reeled and was caught in the bend of his arm corks right hand felt for the electric button and pressed it long  another cophow quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wingcame along saw them and ran up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly  shell be all right in a minute said cork its a straight deal  reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the doorplate with true detective cunning  correct said cork on the dead level were goin to get married      xxi  the venturers   let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison dêtre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subjectlet us call it whats around the corner  omne mundus in duas partes divisum estmen who wear rubbers and pay polltaxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways  fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenanceperfect because vague and dreambornthat we see in our teacups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast  the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracketsawed and citydirectoried citizens let us light our pipes chide the children and the cat arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of chance   did you ever hear that story about the man from the west asked billinger in the little darkoak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the powhatan club  doubtless said john reginald forster rising and leaving the room  forster got his straw hat straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed from the checkroom boy and walked out of the air as hamlet says billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere a man in order to get on good terms with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money by using the compound word this is a vice versa case  forsters favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of chance he was a venturer by nature but convention birth tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the maintraveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that its true interest is to be in whats around the corner  forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her  at the end of an hours stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the places cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo  fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the city where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous american something might happen there out of the routinehe might come upon a subject without a predicate a road without an end a question without an answer a cause without an effect a gulf stream in lifes salt ocean he had not dressed for evening he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves  so john reginald forster began to search his clothes for money because the more cheaply you dine the more surely must you pay all of the thirteen pockets large and small of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny his bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the old ironsides trust company but  forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement he looked like any business man of thirty or so neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car but there was no car line on that avenue so his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion but as he was a consistent seeker after whats around the corner instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a halfembarrassed smile upon the others grin of amusement  all in asked the intruder drawing nearer  seems so said forster now i thought there was a dollar in  oh i know said the other man with a laugh but there wasnt ive just been through the same process myself as i was coming around the corner i found in an upper vest pocketi dont know how they got thereexactly two pennies you know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy  you havent dined then asked forster  i have not but i would like to now ill make you a proposition you look like a man who would take up one your clothes look neat and respectable excuse personalities i think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter also suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together we will choose from the menu like millionairesor if you prefer like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once when we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the houses displeasure and vengeance my name is ives i think we have lived in the same station of lifebefore our money took wings  youre on said forster joyfully  here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of chanceanyhow it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table dhôte  the two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to forster  match for which of us gives the order he said  forster lost  ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born forster listening gave his admiring approval of the order  i am a man said ives during the oysters who has made a lifetime search after the tobecontinuedinournext i am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize nor yet am i like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake what i want is to encounter an adventure to which i can predict no conclusion it is the breath of existence to me to dare fate in its blindest manifestations the world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end i am like the clerk in the circumlocution office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information he wanted to know you know was the kick he made to his fellowclerks well i dont want to know i dont want to reason i dont want to guessi want to bet my hand without seeing it  i understand said forster delightedly ive often wanted the way i feel put into words youve done it i want to take chances on whats coming suppose we have a bottle of moselle with the next course  agreed said ives im glad you catch my idea it will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser if it does not weary you we will pursue the theme only a few times have i met a true venturerone who does not ask a schedule and map from fate when he begins a journey but as the world becomes more civilized and wiser the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee in the elizabethan days you could assault the watch wring knockers from doors and have a jolly setto with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and get away with it nowadays if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you  i knowi know said forster nodding approval  i returned to new york today continued ives from a three years ramble around the globe things are not much better abroad than they are at home the whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions the only thing that interests me greatly is a premise ive tried shooting big game in africa i know what an express rifle will do at so many yards and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet i enjoy it about as much as i did when i was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard  i knowi know said forster  there might be something in aeroplanes went on ives reflectively ive tried ballooning but it seems to be merely a cutanddried affair of wind and ballast  women suggested forster with a smile  three months ago said ives i was pottering around in one of the bazaars in constantinople i noticed a lady veiled of course but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths with her was an attendanta big nubian as black as coal after a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand i looked at it when i got a chance on it was scrawled hastily in pencil the arched gate of the nightingale garden at nine tonight does that appear to you to be an interesting premise mr forster  i made inquiries and learned that the nightingale garden was the property of an old turka grand vizier or something of the sort of course i prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine the same nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time and i went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady we had quite an extended chat she was myrtle thompson a lady journalist who was writing up the turkish harems for a chicago newspaper she said she noticed the new york cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if i couldnt work something into the metropolitan papers about it  i see said forster i see  ive canoed through canada said ives down many rapids and over many falls but i didnt seem to get what i wanted out of it because i knew there were only two possible outcomesi would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level ive played all games at cards but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages ive made acquaintances on trains ive answered advertisements ive rung strange doorbells ive taken every chance that presented itself but there has always been the conventional endingthe logical conclusion to the premise  i know repeated forster ive felt it all but ive had few chances to take my chance at chances is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city there seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop i wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom  the sun has risen said ives on the arabian nights there are no more caliphs the fishermans vase is turned to a vacuum bottle warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for fortyeight hours life moves by rote science has killed adventure there are no more opportunities such as columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had the only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain  well said forster my experience has been the limited one of a city man i havent seen the world as you have but it seems that we view it with the same opinion but i tell you i am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard there may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented perhaps after all the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the round table who rode abroad with a retinue and king arthurs certified checks in the lining of their helmets and now if youve finished your coffee suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of fate what have i up  heads called ives  heads it is said forster lifting his hand i lose we forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape i suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend i will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off i thank you for an evening out of the ordinary mr ives and wish we might have others  if my memory is not at fault said ives laughing the nearest police station is in macdougal street i have enjoyed the dinner too let me assure you  forster crooked his finger for the waiter victor with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism glided to the table and laid the card face downward by the losers cup forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care ives leaned back comfortably in his chair  excuse me said forster but i thought you were going to ring grimes about that theatre party for thursday night had you forgotten about it  oh said ives settling himself more comfortably i can do that later on get me a glass of water waiter  want to be in at the death do you asked forster  i hope you dont object said ives pleadingly never in my life have i seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner  all right said forster calmly you are entitled to see a christian die in the arena as your poussecafé  victor came with the glass of water and remained with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector  forster hesitated for fifteen seconds and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check the waiter bowed and took it away  the fact is said forster with a little embarrassed laugh i doubt whether im what they call a game sport which means the same as a soldier of fortune ill have to make a confession ive been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year i always sign my checks and then with a note of appreciation in his voice it was firstrate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew i had no money and that you might be scooped in too  i guess ill confess too said ives with a grin i own the hotel i dont run it of course but i always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when i happen to stray into town  he called a waiter and said is mr gilmore still behind the desk all right tell him that mr ives is here and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired  another venture cut short by the inevitable said forster is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number but lets hold to our subject just for a minute or two if you will it isnt often that i meet a man who understands the flaws i pick in existence i am engaged to be married a month from today  i reserve comment said ives  right i am going to add to the assertion i am devotedly fond of the lady but i cant decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for alaska its the same idea you know that we were discussingit does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned everybody knows the routineyou get a kiss flavored with ceylon tea after breakfast you go to the office you come back home and dress for dinnertheatre twice a weekbillsmoping around most evenings trying to make conversationa little quarrel occasionallymaybe sometimes a big one and a separationor else a settling down into a middleaged contentment which is worst of all  i know said ives nodding wisely  its the dead certainty of the thing went on forster that keeps me in doubt therell nevermore be anything around the corner  nothing after the little church said ives i know  understand said forster that i am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady i may say that i love her truly and deeply but there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable i do not know what i want but i know that i want it im talking like an idiot i suppose but im sure of what i mean  i understand you said ives with a slow smile well i think i will be going up to my rooms now if you would dine with me here one evening soon mr forster id be glad  thursday suggested forster  at seven if its convenient answered ives  seven goes assented forster  at halfpast eight ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct west seventies his card admitted him to the reception room of an oldfashioned house into which the spirits of fortune chance and adventure had never dared to enter on the walls were the whistler etchings the steel engravings by ohwhatshisname the stilllife paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life and the greuze head it was a household there was even brass andirons on a table was an album halfmorocco with oxidizedsilver protections on the corners of the lids a clock on the mantel ticked loudly with a warning click at five minutes to nine ives looked at it curiously remembering a timepiece in his grandmothers home that gave such a warning  and then down the stairs and into the room came mary marsden she was twentyfour and i leave her to your imagination but i must say this muchyouth and health and simplicity and courage and greenishviolet eyes are beautiful and she had all these she gave ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship  you cant think what a pleasure it is she said to have you drop in once every three years or so  for half an hour they talked i confess that i cannot repeat the conversation you will find it in books in the circulating library when that part of it was over mary said  and did you find what you wanted while you were abroad  what i wanted said ives  yes you know you were always queer even as a boy you wouldnt play marbles or baseball or any game with rules you wanted to dive in water where you didnt know whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep and when you grew up you were just the same weve often talked about your peculiar ways  i suppose i am an incorrigible said ives i am opposed to the doctrine of predestination to the rule of three gravitation taxation and everything of the kind life has always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters  mary laughed merrily  bob ames told us once she said of a funny thing you did it was when you and he were on a train in the south and you got off at a town where you hadnt intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it  i remember said ives that next station has been the thing ive always tried to get away from  i know it said mary and youve been very foolish i hope you didnt find what you wanted not to find or get off at the station where there wasnt any or whatever it was you expected wouldnt happen to you during the three years youve been away  there was something i wanted before i went away said ives  mary looked in his eyes clearly with a slight but perfectly sweet smile  there was she said you wanted me and you could have had me as you very well know  without replying ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room there had been no change in it since last he had been in it three years before he vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then the contents of that room were as fixed in their way as the everlasting hills no change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay that silvermounted album would occupy that corner of that table those pictures would hang on the walls those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together the brass andirons were monuments to order and stability here and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come one going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt he would find what he left and leave what he found the veiled lady chance would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door  and before him sat the lady who belonged in the room cool and sweet and unchangeable she was she offered no surprises if one should pass his life with her though she might grow whitehaired and wrinkled he would never perceive the change three years he had been away from her and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself he was sure that she had once cared for him it was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away thus his thoughts ran  i am going to be married soon said mary  on the next thursday afternoon forster came hurriedly to ives hotel  old man said he well have to put that dinner off for a year or so im going abroad the steamer sails at four that was a great talk we had the other night and it decided me im going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on both you and methe terrible dread of knowing whats going to happen ive done one thing that hurts my conscience a little but i know its best for both of us ive written to the lady to whom i was engaged and explained everythingtold her plainly why i was leavingthat the monotony of matrimony would never do for me dont you think i was right  it is not for me to say answered ives go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it will bring the element of chance into your life weve got to decide these things for ourselves but i tell you one thing forster ive found the way ive found out the biggest hazard in the worlda game of chance that never is concluded a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit it will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin because he will never knownot until his last day and not then will he know it is a voyage without a rudder or compass and you must be captain and crew and keep watch every day and night yourself with no one to relieve you i have found the venture dont bother yourself about leaving mary marsden forster i married her yesterday at noon      xxii  the duel   the gods lying beside their nectar on lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff perceive a difference in cities although it would seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small anthills without special characteristics yet it is not so studying the habits of ants from so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace but doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns and it will be no news to them nor perhaps to many mortals that in one particularity new york stands unique among the cities of the world this shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his sabbathslippered feet on another chair and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free with these i love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings  new york city is inhabited by 4000000 mysterious strangers thus beating bird centre by three millions and half a dozen nines they came here in various ways and for many reasonshendrik hudson the art schools green goods the stork the annual dressmakers convention the pennsylvania railroad love of money the stage cheap excursion rates brains personal column ads heavy walking shoes ambition freight trainsall these have had a hand in making up the population  but every man jack when he first sets foot on the stones of manhattan has got to fight he has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins there is no resting between rounds for there are no rounds it is slugging from the first it is a fight to a finish  your opponent is the city you must do battle with it from the time the ferryboat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you it is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a weeks lodging  the battle is to decide whether you shall become a new yorker or turn the rankest outlander and philistine you must be one or the other you cannot remain neutral you must be for or againstlover or enemybosom friend or outcast and oh the city is a general in the ring not only by blows does it seek to subdue you it woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren it is a combination of delilah green chartreuse beethoven chloral and john l in his best days  in other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please you may live in chicago until your hair whitens and be a citizen and still prate of beans if boston mothered you and without rebuke you may become a civic pillar in any other town but knickerbockers and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings comparing them with the architecture of colonel telfairs residence in jackson miss whence you hail and you will not be set upon but in new york you must be either a new yorker or an invader of a modern troy concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism and this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of william and jack  they came out of the west together where they had been friends they came to dig their fortunes out of the big city  father knickerbocker met them at the ferry giving one a righthander on the nose and the other an uppercut with his left just to let them know that the fight was on  william was for business jack was for art both were young and ambitious so they countered and clinched i think they were from nebraska or possibly missouri or minnesota anyhow they were out for success and scraps and scads and they tackled the city like two lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the city hall  four years afterward william and jack met at luncheon the business man blew in like a march wind hurled his silk hat at a waiter dropped into the chair that was pushed under him seized the bill of fare and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod after the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes  billy he said youre done for the city has gobbled you up it has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand you are so nearly like ten thousand men i have seen today that you couldnt be picked out from them if it werent for your laundry marks  camembert finished william whats that oh youve still got your hammer out for new york have you well little old noisyvilleonthesubway is good enough for me its giving me mine and say i used to think the west was the whole round worldonly slightly flattened at the poles whenever bryan ran i used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense and hang my hat on the horizon and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the east but id never seen new york then jack me for it from the rathskellers up sixth avenue is the west to me now have you heard this fellow crusoe sing the desert isle for him i say but my wife made me go give me may irwin or e s willard any time  poor billy said the artist delicately fingering a cigarette you remember when we were on our way to the east how we talked about this great wonderful city and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us we were going to be just the same fellows we had always been and never let it master us it has downed you old man you have changed from a maverick into a butterick  dont see exactly what you are driving at said william i dont wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions like i used to do at home you talk about being cut to a patternwell aint the pattern all right when youre in rome youve got to do as the dagoes do this town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations according to the railroad schedule ive got in mind chicago and saint jo and paris france are asterisk stopswhich means you wave a red flag and get on every other tuesday i like this little suburb of tarrytownonthehudson theres something or somebody doing all the time im clearing 8000 a year selling automatic pumps and im living like kingsup why yesterday i was introduced to john w gates i took an auto ride with a wine agents sister i saw two men run over by a street car and i seen edna may play in the evening talk about the west why the other night i woke everybody up in the hotel hollering i dreamed i was walking on a board sidewalk in oshkosh what have you got against this town jack theres only one thing in it that i dont care for and thats a ferryboat  the artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall this town said he is a leech it drains the blood of the country whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel abandoning the figure of the leech it is a juggernaut a moloch a monster to which the innocence the genius and the beauty of the land must pay tribute hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan youve lost billy it shall never conquer me i hate it as one hates sin or pestilence orthe color work in a tencent magazine i despise its very vastness and power it has the poorest millionaires the littlest great men the lowest skyscrapers the dolefulest pleasures of any town i ever saw it has caught you old man but i will never run beside its chariot wheels it glosses itself as the chinaman glosses his collars give me the domestic finish i could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients claiming culture it is the crudest asseverating its preeminence it is the basest denying all outside values and virtue it is the narrowest give me the pure and the open heart of the west country i would go back there tomorrow if i could  dont you like this filet mignon said william shucks now whats the use to knock the town its the greatest ever i couldnt sell one automatic pump between harrisburg and tommy okeefes saloon in sacramento where i sell twenty here and have you seen sara bernhardt in andrew mack yet  the towns got you billy said jack  all right said william im going to buy a cottage on lake ronkonkoma next summer  at midnight jack raised his window and sat close to it he caught his breath at what he saw though he had seen and felt it a hundred times  far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream the irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams some were mountainous some lay in long desert cañons such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city but into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights and out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the citys soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body there arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know there below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich despoil elevate cast down nurture or kill thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood  there was a knock on his door a telegram had come for him it came from the west and these were its words    come back and the answer will be yes                                     dolly  he kept the boy waiting ten minutes and then wrote the reply impossible to leave here at present then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again  after all it isnt a story but i wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city so i went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him what he said was please dont bother me i have christmas presents to buy  so there it rests and you will have to decide for yourself      xxiii  what you want   night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as bagdadonthesubway and with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to arabia alone in different masquerade the streets bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend the late mr h a rashid they wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than h a saw in old bagdad but they were about the same people underneath with the eye of faith you could have seen the little hunchback sinbad the sailor fitbad the tailor the beautiful persian the oneeyed calenders ali baba and forty robbers on every block and the barber and his six brothers and all the old arabian gang easily  but let us revenue to our lamb chops  old tom crowley was a caliph he had 42000000 in preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges in these times to be called a caliph you must have money the oldstyle caliph business as conducted by mr rashid is not safe if you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a turkish bath or a side street and inquire into his private and personal affairs the police courtll get you  old tom was tired of clubs theatres dinners friends music money and everything thats what makes a caliphyou must get to despise everything that money can buy and then go out and try to want something that you cant pay for  ill take a little trot around town all by myself thought old tom and try if i can stir up anything new lets seeit seems ive read about a king or a cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go about with false whiskers on making persian dates with folks he hadnt been introduced to that dont listen like a bad idea i certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones i do know that old cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon em and give em goldsequins i think it wasand make em marry or got em good government jobs now id like something of that sort my money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where i got it yes i guess ill do a little cardiff business tonight and see how it goes  plainly dressed old tom crowley left his madison avenue palace and walked westward and then south as he stepped to the sidewalk fate who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread and a young man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock and then put on his coat  james turner worked in one of those little hatcleaning establishments on sixth avenue in which a fire alarm rings when you push the door open and where they clean your hat while you waittwo days james stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done overlooking your mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger i will give you a modified description of him weight 118 complexion hair and brain light height five feet six age about twentythree dressed in a 10 suit of greenishblue serge pockets containing two keys and sixtythree cents in change  but do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a general alarm that james was either lost or a dead one  allons  james stood all day at his work his feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them all day long they burned and smarted causing him much suffering and inconvenience but he was earning twelve dollars per week which he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not  james turner had his own conception of what happiness was just as you and i have ours your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motorcars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger a rattlesnake and an owl go into their common prairie home one by one  james turners idea of bliss was different but it was his he would go directly to his boardinghouse when his days work was done after his supper of small steak bessemer potatoes stooed not stewed apples and infusion of chicory he would ascend to his fifthfloorback hall room then he would take off his shoes and socks place the soles of his burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed and read clark russells sea yarns the delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting soles was his nightly joy his favorite novels never palled upon him the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole intellectual passion no millionaire was ever happier than james turner taking his ease  when james left the hatcleaning shop he walked three blocks out of his way home to look over the goods of a secondhand bookstall on the sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a papercovered volume of clark russell at half price  while he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the markeddown miscellany of castoff literature old tom the caliph sauntered by his discerning eye made keen by twenty years experience in the manufacture of laundry soap save the wrappers recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar a worthy object of his caliphanous mood he descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence his first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative  james turner looked up coldly with sartor resartus in one hand and a mad marriage in the other  beat it said he i dont want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in hankipoo new jersey run along now and play with your teddy bear  young man said the caliph ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner i observe that you are of a studious disposition learning is one of the finest things in the world i never had any of it worth mentioning but i admire to see it in others i come from the west where we imagine nothing but facts maybe i couldnt understand the poetry and allusions in them books you are picking over but i like to see somebody else seem to know what they mean im worth about 40000000 and im getting richer every day i made the height of it manufacturing aunt pattys silver soap i invented the art of making it i experimented for three years before i got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly and after i had taken some 9000000 out of the soap business i made the rest in corn and wheat futures now you seem to have the literary and scholarly turn of character and ill tell you what ill do ill pay for your education at the finest college in the world ill pay the expense of your rummaging over europe and the art galleries and finally set you up in a good business you neednt make it soap if you have any objections i see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor and you cant afford to turn down the offer well when do you want to begin  the hat cleaner turned upon old tom the eye of the big city which is an eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion of judgment suspended as high as haman was hung of selfpreservation of challenge curiosity defiance cynicism and strange as you may think it of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden when one walks among the stranger bands for in new bagdad one in order to survive must suspect whosoever sits dwells drinks rides walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair house booth seat path or room  say mike said james turner whats your line anywayshoe laces im not buying anything you better put an egg in your shoe and beat it before incidents occur to you you cant work off any fountain pens gold spectacles you found on the street or trust company certificate house clearings on me say do i look like id climbed down one of them missing fireescapes at helicon hall whats vitiating you anyhow  son said the caliph in his most harunish tones as i said im worth 40000000 i dont want to have it all put in my coffin when i die i want to do some good with it i seen you handling over these here volumes of literature and i thought id keep you ive give the missionary societies 2000000 but what did i get out of it nothing but a receipt from the secretary now you are just the kind of young man id like to take up and see what money could make of him  volumes of clark russell were hard to find that evening at the old book shop and james turners smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his temper humble hat cleaner though he was he had a spirit equal to any caliphs  say you old faker he said angrily be on your way i dont know what your game is unless you want change for a bogus 40000000 bill well i dont carry that much around with me but i do carry a pretty fair lefthanded punch that youll get if you dont move on  you are a blamed impudent little gutter pup said the caliph  then james delivered his selfpraised punch old tom seized him by the collar and kicked him thrice the hat cleaner rallied and clinched two bookstands were overturned and the books sent flying a copy came up took an arm of each and marched them to the nearest station house fighting and disorderly conduct said the cop to the sergeant  three hundred dollars bail said the sergeant at once asseveratingly and inquiringly  sixtythree cents said james turner with a harsh laugh  the caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change amounting to four dollars  i am worth he said forty million dollars but  lock em up ordered the sergeant  in his cell james turner laid himself on his cot ruminating maybe hes got the money and maybe he aint but if he has or he aint what does he want to go round butting into other folkss business for when a man knows what he wants and can get it its the same as 40000000 to him  then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face  he removed his socks drew his cot close to the door stretched himself out luxuriously and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door something hard and bulky under the blankets of his cot gave one shoulder discomfort he reached under and drew out a papercovered volume by clark russell called a sailors sweetheart he gave a great sigh of contentment  presently to his cell came the doorman and said  say kid that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems to have been the goods after all he phoned to his friends and hes out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a pullman car pillow he wants to bail you and for you to come out and see him  tell him i aint in said james turner
