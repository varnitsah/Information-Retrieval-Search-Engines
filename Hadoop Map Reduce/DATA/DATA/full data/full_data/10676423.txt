10676423	pictures from italy      the readers passport    if the readers of this volume will be so kind as to take their credentials for the different places which are the subject of its authors reminiscences from the author himself perhaps they may visit them in fancy the more agreeably and with a better understanding of what they are to expect  many books have been written upon italy affording many means of studying the history of that interesting country and the innumerable associations entwined about it  i make but little reference to that stock of information not at all regarding it as a necessary consequence of my having had recourse to the storehouse for my own benefit that i should reproduce its easily accessible contents before the eyes of my readers  neither will there be found in these pages any grave examination into the government or misgovernment of any portion of the country no visitor of that beautiful land can fail to have a strong conviction on the subject but as i chose when residing there a foreigner to abstain from the discussion of any such questions with any order of italians so i would rather not enter on the inquiry now  during my twelve months occupation of a house at genoa i never found that authorities constitutionally jealous were distrustful of me and i should be sorry to give them occasion to regret their free courtesy either to myself or any of my countrymen  there is probably not a famous picture or statue in all italy but could be easily buried under a mountain of printed paper devoted to dissertations on it  i do not therefore though an earnest admirer of painting and sculpture expatiate at any length on famous pictures and statues  this book is a series of faint reflectionsmere shadows in the waterof places to which the imaginations of most people are attracted in a greater or less degree on which mine had dwelt for years and which have some interest for all  the greater part of the descriptions were written on the spot and sent home from time to time in private letters  i do not mention the circumstance as an excuse for any defects they may present for it would be none but as a guarantee to the reader that they were at least penned in the fulness of the subject and with the liveliest impressions of novelty and freshness  if they have ever a fanciful and idle air perhaps the reader will suppose them written in the shade of a sunny day in the midst of the objects of which they treat and will like them none the worse for having such influences of the country upon them  i hope i am not likely to be misunderstood by professors of the roman catholic faith on account of anything contained in these pages  i have done my best in one of my former productions to do justice to them and i trust in this they will do justice to me when i mention any exhibition that impressed me as absurd or disagreeable i do not seek to connect it or recognise it as necessarily connected with any essentials of their creed  when i treat of the ceremonies of the holy week i merely treat of their effect and do not challenge the good and learned dr wisemans interpretation of their meaning  when i hint a dislike of nunneries for young girls who abjure the world before they have ever proved or known it or doubt the ex officio sanctity of all priests and friars i do no more than many conscientious catholics both abroad and at home  i have likened these pictures to shadows in the water and would fain hope that i have nowhere stirred the water so roughly as to mar the shadows  i could never desire to be on better terms with all my friends than now when distant mountains rise once more in my path  for i need not hesitate to avow that bent on correcting a brief mistake i made not long ago in disturbing the old relations between myself and my readers and departing for a moment from my old pursuits i am about to resume them joyfully in switzerland where during another year of absence i can at once work out the themes i have now in my mind without interruption and while i keep my english audience within speaking distance extend my knowledge of a noble country inexpressibly attractive to me 1  this book is made as accessible as possible because it would be a great pleasure to me if i could hope through its means to compare impressions with some among the multitudes who will hereafter visit the scenes described with interest and delight  and i have only now in passport wise to sketch my readers portrait which i hope may be thus supposititiously traced for either sex  complexion           fair eyes                 very cheerful nose                 not supercilious mouth                smiling visage               beaming general expression   extremely agreeable    chapter igoing through france    on a fine sunday morning in the midsummer time and weather of eighteen hundred and fortyfour it was my good friend when dont be alarmed not when two travellers might have been observed slowly making their way over that picturesque and broken ground by which the first chapter of a middle aged novel is usually attained but when an english travellingcarriage of considerable proportions fresh from the shady halls of the pantechnicon near belgrave square london was observed by a very small french soldier for i saw him look at it to issue from the gate of the hotel meurice in the rue rivoli at paris  i am no more bound to explain why the english family travelling by this carriage inside and out should be starting for italy on a sunday morning of all good days in the week than i am to assign a reason for all the little men in france being soldiers and all the big men postilions which is the invariable rule  but they had some sort of reason for what they did i have no doubt and their reason for being there at all was as you know that they were going to live in fair genoa for a year and that the head of the family purposed in that space of time to stroll about wherever his restless humour carried him  and it would have been small comfort to me to have explained to the population of paris generally that i was that head and chief and not the radiant embodiment of good humour who sat beside me in the person of a french courierbest of servants and most beaming of men  truth to say he looked a great deal more patriarchal than i who in the shadow of his portly presence dwindled down to no account at all  there was of course very little in the aspect of parisas we rattled near the dismal morgue and over the pont neufto reproach us for our sunday travelling  the wineshops every second house were driving a roaring trade awnings were spreading and chairs and tables arranging outside the cafes preparatory to the eating of ices and drinking of cool liquids later in the day shoe blacks were busy on the bridges shops were open carts and waggons clattered to and fro the narrow uphill funnellike streets across the river were so many dense perspectives of crowd and bustle particoloured nightcaps tobaccopipes blouses large boots and shaggy heads of hair nothing at that hour denoted a day of rest unless it were the appearance here and there of a family pleasureparty crammed into a bulky old lumbering cab or of some contemplative holidaymaker in the freest and easiest dishabille leaning out of a low garret window watching the drying of his newly polished shoes on the little parapet outside if a gentleman or the airing of her stockings in the sun if a lady with calm anticipation  once clear of the nevertobeforgottenorforgiven pavement which surrounds paris the first three days of travelling towards marseilles are quiet and monotonous enough  to sens  to avallon to chalons  a sketch of one days proceedings is a sketch of all three and here it is  we have four horses and one postilion who has a very long whip and drives his team something like the courier of saint petersburgh in the circle at astleys or franconis  only he sits his own horse instead of standing on him  the immense jackboots worn by these postilions are sometimes a century or two old and are so ludicrously disproportionate to the wearers foot that the spur which is put where his own heel comes is generally halfway up the leg of the boots  the man often comes out of the stable yard with his whip in his hand and his shoes on and brings out in both hands one boot at a time which he plants on the ground by the side of his horse with great gravity until everything is ready  when it isand oh heaven the noise they make about it he gets into the boots shoes and all or is hoisted into them by a couple of friends adjusts the rope harness embossed by the labours of innumerable pigeons in the stables makes all the horses kick and plunge cracks his whip like a madman shouts en route hi and away we go  he is sure to have a contest with his horse before we have gone very far and then he calls him a thief and a brigand and a pig and what not and beats him about the head as if he were made of wood  there is little more than one variety in the appearance of the country for the first two days  from a dreary plain to an interminable avenue and from an interminable avenue to a dreary plain again  plenty of vines there are in the open fields but of a short low kind and not trained in festoons but about straight sticks  beggars innumerable there are everywhere but an extraordinarily scanty population and fewer children than i ever encountered  i dont believe we saw a hundred children between paris and chalons  queer old towns drawbridged and walled  with odd little towers at the angles like grotesque faces as if the wall had put a mask on and were staring down into the moat other strange little towers in gardens and fields and down lanes and in farmyards  all alone and always round with a peaked roof and never used for any purpose at all ruinous buildings of all sorts sometimes an hotel de ville sometimes a guardhouse sometimes a dwellinghouse sometimes a chateau with a rank garden prolific in dandelion and watched over by extinguishertopped turrets and blinkeyed little casements are the standard objects repeated over and over again  sometimes we pass a village inn with a crumbling wall belonging to it and a perfect town of out houses and painted over the gateway stabling for sixty horses as indeed there might be stabling for sixty score were there any horses to be stabled there or anybody resting there or anything stirring about the place but a dangling bush indicative of the wine inside  which flutters idly in the wind in lazy keeping with everything else and certainly is never in a green old age though always so old as to be dropping to pieces  and all day long strange little narrow waggons in strings of six or eight bringing cheese from switzerland and frequently in charge the whole line of one man or even boyand he very often asleep in the foremost cartcome jingling past  the horses drowsily ringing the bells upon their harness and looking as if they thought no doubt they do their great blue woolly furniture of immense weight and thickness with a pair of grotesque horns growing out of the collar very much too warm for the midsummer weather  then there is the diligence twice or thrice aday with the dusty outsides in blue frocks like butchers and the insides in white nightcaps and its cabriolet head on the roof nodding and shaking like an idiots head and its youngfrance passengers staring out of window with beards down to their waists and blue spectacles awfully shading their warlike eyes and very big sticks clenched in their national grasp  also the malle poste with only a couple of passengers tearing along at a real good daredevil pace and out of sight in no time  steady old cures come jolting past now and then in such ramshackle rusty musty clattering coaches as no englishman would believe in and bony women dawdle about in solitary places holding cows by ropes while they feed or digging and hoeing or doing fieldwork of a more laborious kind or representing real shepherdesses with their flocksto obtain an adequate idea of which pursuit and its followers in any country it is only necessary to take any pastoral poem or picture and imagine to yourself whatever is most exquisitely and widely unlike the descriptions therein contained  you have been travelling along stupidly enough as you generally do in the last stage of the day and the ninetysix bells upon the horsestwentyfour apiecehave been ringing sleepily in your ears for half an hour or so and it has become a very jogtrot monotonous tiresome sort of business and you have been thinking deeply about the dinner you will have at the next stage when down at the end of the long avenue of trees through which you are travelling the first indication of a town appears in the shape of some straggling cottages  and the carriage begins to rattle and roll over a horribly uneven pavement  as if the equipage were a great firework and the mere sight of a smoking cottage chimney had lighted it instantly it begins to crack and splutter as if the very devil were in it  crack crack crack

crick crick and here we are in the yard of the hotel de lecu dor used up gone out smoking spent exhausted but sometimes making a false start unexpectedly with nothing coming of itlike a firework to the last  the landlady of the hotel de lecu dor is here and the landlord of the hotel de lecu dor is here and the femme de chambre of the hotel de lecu dor is here and a gentleman in a glazed cap with a red beard like a bosom friend who is staying at the hotel de lecu dor is here and monsieur le cure is walking up and down in a corner of the yard by himself with a shovel hat upon his head and a black gown on his back and a book in one hand and an umbrella in the other and everybody except monsieur le cure is openmouthed and openeyed for the opening of the carriagedoor the landlord of the hotel de lecu dor dotes to that extent upon the courier that he can hardly wait for his coming down from the box but embraces his very legs and bootheels as he descends  my courier  my brave courier  my friend  my brother  the landlady loves him the femme de chambre blesses him the garcon worships him  the courier asks if his letter has been received  it has it has  are the rooms prepared  they are they are  the best rooms for my noble courier  the rooms of state for my gallant courier the whole house is at the service of my best of friends  he keeps his hand upon the carriagedoor and asks some other question to enhance the expectation  he carries a green leathern purse outside his coat suspended by a belt  the idlers look at it one touches it  it is full of fivefranc pieces  murmurs of admiration are heard among the boys  the landlord falls upon the couriers neck and folds him to his breast  he is so much fatter than he was he says  he looks so rosy and so well  the door is opened  breathless expectation  the lady of the family gets out  ah sweet lady  beautiful lady  the sister of the lady of the family gets out  great heaven maamselle is charming  first little boy gets out  ah what a beautiful little boy  first little girl gets out  oh but this is an enchanting child  second little girl gets out  the landlady yielding to the finest impulse of our common nature catches her up in her arms second little boy gets out  oh the sweet boy  oh the tender little family  the baby is handed out  angelic baby  the baby has topped everything  all the rapture is expended on the baby then the two nurses tumble out and the enthusiasm swelling into madness the whole family are swept upstairs as on a cloud while the idlers press about the carriage and look into it and walk round it and touch it  for it is something to touch a carriage that has held so many people  it is a legacy to leave ones children  the rooms are on the first floor except the nursery for the night which is a great rambling chamber with four or five beds in it through a dark passage up two steps down four past a pump across a balcony and next door to the stable  the other sleeping apartments are large and lofty each with two small bedsteads tastefully hung like the windows with red and white drapery  the sittingroom is famous  dinner is already laid in it for three and the napkins are folded in cockedhat fashion  the floors are of red tile  there are no carpets and not much furniture to speak of but there is abundance of lookingglass and there are large vases under glass shades filled with artificial flowers and there are plenty of clocks  the whole party are in motion  the brave courier in particular is everywhere  looking after the beds having wine poured down his throat by his dear brother the landlord and picking up green cucumbersalways cucumbers heaven knows where he gets themwith which he walks about one in each hand like truncheons  dinner is announced  there is very thin soup there are very large loavesone apiece a fish four dishes afterwards some poultry afterwards a dessert afterwards and no lack of wine  there is not much in the dishes but they are very good and always ready instantly  when it is nearly dark the brave courier having eaten the two cucumbers sliced up in the contents of a pretty large decanter of oil and another of vinegar emerges from his retreat below and proposes a visit to the cathedral whose massive tower frowns down upon the courtyard of the inn  off we go and very solemn and grand it is in the dim light  so dim at last that the polite old lanthornjawed sacristan has a feeble little bit of candle in his hand to grope among the tombs withand looks among the grim columns very like a lost ghost who is searching for his own  underneath the balcony when we return the inferior servants of the inn are supping in the open air at a great table the dish a stew of meat and vegetables smoking hot and served in the iron cauldron it was boiled in  they have a pitcher of thin wine and are very merry merrier than the gentleman with the red beard who is playing billiards in the light room on the left of the yard where shadows with cues in their hands and cigars in their mouths cross and recross the window constantly  still the thin cure walks up and down alone with his book and umbrella  and there he walks and there the billiardballs rattle long after we are fast asleep  we are astir at six next morning  it is a delightful day shaming yesterdays mud upon the carriage if anything could shame a carriage in a land where carriages are never cleaned  everybody is brisk and as we finish breakfast the horses come jingling into the yard from the posthouse  everything taken out of the carriage is put back again  the brave courier announces that all is ready after walking into every room and looking all round it to be certain that nothing is left behind  everybody gets in  everybody connected with the hotel de lecu dor is again enchanted  the brave courier runs into the house for a parcel containing cold fowl sliced ham bread and biscuits for lunch hands it into the coach and runs back again  what has he got in his hand now  more cucumbers  no  a long strip of paper  its the bill  the brave courier has two belts on this morning  one supporting the purse  another a mighty good sort of leathern bottle filled to the throat with the best light bordeaux wine in the house  he never pays the bill till this bottle is full  then he disputes it  he disputes it now violently  he is still the landlords brother but by another father or mother  he is not so nearly related to him as he was last night  the landlord scratches his head  the brave courier points to certain figures in the bill and intimates that if they remain there the hotel de lecu dor is thenceforth and for ever an hotel de lecu de cuivre  the landlord goes into a little countinghouse  the brave courier follows forces the bill and a pen into his hand and talks more rapidly than ever  the landlord takes the pen  the courier smiles  the landlord makes an alteration  the courier cuts a joke  the landlord is affectionate but not weakly so  he bears it like a man  he shakes hands with his brave brother but he dont hug him  still he loves his brother for he knows that he will be returning that way one of these fine days with another family and he foresees that his heart will yearn towards him again  the brave courier traverses all round the carriage once looks at the drag inspects the wheels jumps up gives the word and away we go  it is market morning  the market is held in the little square outside in front of the cathedral  it is crowded with men and women in blue in red in green in white with canvassed stalls and fluttering merchandise  the country people are grouped about with their clean baskets before them  here the lacesellers there the butter and eggsellers there the fruitsellers there the shoemakers  the whole place looks as if it were the stage of some great theatre and the curtain had just run up for a picturesque ballet  and there is the cathedral to boot  scene like  all grim and swarthy and mouldering and cold  just splashing the pavement in one place with faint purple drops as the morning sun entering by a little window on the eastern side struggles through some stained glass panes on the western  in five minutes we have passed the iron cross with a little ragged kneelingplace of turf before it in the outskirts of the town and are again upon the road    chapter iilyons the rhone and the goblin of avignon    chalons is a fair restingplace in right of its good inn on the bank of the river and the little steamboats gay with green and red paint that come and go upon it  which make up a pleasant and refreshing scene after the dusty roads  but unless you would like to dwell on an enormous plain with jagged rows of irregular poplars on it that look in the distance like so many combs with broken teeth  and unless you would like to pass your life without the possibility of going uphill or going up anything but stairs you would hardly approve of chalons as a place of residence  you would probably like it better however than lyons  which you may reach if you will in one of the beforementioned steamboats in eight hours  what a city lyons is  talk about people feeling at certain unlucky times as if they had tumbled from the clouds  here is a whole town that is tumbled anyhow out of the sky having been first caught up like other stones that tumble down from that region out of fens and barren places dismal to behold  the two great streets through which the two great rivers dash and all the little streets whose name is legion were scorching blistering and sweltering  the houses high and vast dirty to excess rotten as old cheeses and as thickly peopled  all up the hills that hem the city in these houses swarm and the mites inside were lolling out of the windows and drying their ragged clothes on poles and crawling in and out at the doors and coming out to pant and gasp upon the pavement and creeping in and out among huge piles and bales of fusty musty stifling goods and living or rather not dying till their time should come in an exhausted receiver  every manufacturing town melted into one would hardly convey an impression of lyons as it presented itself to me  for all the undrained unscavengered qualities of a foreign town seemed grafted there upon the native miseries of a manufacturing one and it bears such fruit as i would go some miles out of my way to avoid encountering again  in the cool of the evening  or rather in the faded heat of the day  we went to see the cathedral where divers old women and a few dogs were engaged in contemplation  there was no difference in point of cleanliness between its stone pavement and that of the streets and there was a wax saint in a little box like a berth aboard ship with a glass front to it whom madame tussaud would have nothing to say to on any terms and which even westminster abbey might be ashamed of  if you would know all about the architecture of this church or any other its dates dimensions endowments and history is it not written in mr murrays guide book and may you not read it there with thanks to him as i did  for this reason i should abstain from mentioning the curious clock in lyons cathedral if it were not for a small mistake i made in connection with that piece of mechanism  the keeper of the church was very anxious it should be shown partly for the honour of the establishment and the town and partly perhaps because of his deriving a percentage from the additional consideration  however that may be it was set in motion and thereupon a host of little doors flew open and innumerable little figures staggered out of them and jerked themselves back again with that special unsteadiness of purpose and hitching in the gait which usually attaches to figures that are moved by clockwork  meanwhile the sacristan stood explaining these wonders and pointing them out severally with a wand  there was a centre puppet of the virgin mary and close to her a small pigeonhole out of which another and a very illlooking puppet made one of the most sudden plunges i ever saw accomplished  instantly flopping back again at sight of her and banging his little door violently after him  taking this to be emblematic of the victory over sin and death and not at all unwilling to show that i perfectly understood the subject in anticipation of the showman i rashly said aha  the evil spirit to be sure  he is very soon disposed of  pardon monsieur said the sacristan with a polite motion of his hand towards the little door as if introducing somebodythe angel gabriel  soon after daybreak next morning we were steaming down the arrowy rhone at the rate of twenty miles an hour in a very dirty vessel full of merchandise and with only three or four other passengers for our companions  among whom the most remarkable was a silly old meekfaced garliceating immeasurably polite chevalier with a dirty scrap of red ribbon hanging at his buttonhole as if he had tied it there to remind himself of something as tom noddy in the farce ties knots in his pockethandkerchief  for the last two days we had seen great sullen hills the first indications of the alps lowering in the distance  now we were rushing on beside them  sometimes close beside them  sometimes with an intervening slope covered with vineyards  villages and small towns hanging in midair with great woods of olives seen through the light open towers of their churches and clouds moving slowly on upon the steep acclivity behind them ruined castles perched on every eminence and scattered houses in the clefts and gullies of the hills made it very beautiful  the great height of these too making the buildings look so tiny that they had all the charm of elegant models their excessive whiteness as contrasted with the brown rocks or the sombre deep dull heavy green of the olivetree and the puny size and little slow walk of the lilliputian men and women on the bank made a charming picture there were ferries out of number too bridges the famous pont desprit with i dont know how many arches towns where memorable wines are made vallence where napoleon studied and the noble river bringing at every winding turn new beauties into view  there lay before us that same afternoon the broken bridge of avignon and all the city baking in the sun yet with an under donepiecrust battlemented wall that never will be brown though it bake for centuries  the grapes were hanging in clusters in the streets and the brilliant oleander was in full bloom everywhere  the streets are old and very narrow but tolerably clean and shaded by awnings stretched from house to house  bright stuffs and handkerchiefs curiosities ancient frames of carved wood old chairs ghostly tables saints virgins angels and staring daubs of portraits being exposed for sale beneath it was very quaint and lively  all this was much set off too by the glimpses one caught through a rusty gate standing ajar of quiet sleepy courtyards having stately old houses within as silent as tombs  it was all very like one of the descriptions in the arabian nights  the three one eyed calenders might have knocked at any one of those doors till the street rang again and the porter who persisted in asking questionsthe man who had the delicious purchases put into his basket in the morningmight have opened it quite naturally  after breakfast next morning we sallied forth to see the lions such a delicious breeze was blowing in from the north as made the walk delightful  though the pavementstones and stones of the walls and houses were far too hot to have a hand laid on them comfortably  we went first of all up a rocky height to the cathedral  where mass was performing to an auditory very like that of lyons namely several old women a baby and a very selfpossessed dog who had marked out for himself a little course or platform for exercise beginning at the altarrails and ending at the door up and down which constitutional walk he trotted during the service as methodically and calmly as any old gentleman out of doors  it is a bare old church and the paintings in the roof are sadly defaced by time and damp weather but the sun was shining in splendidly through the red curtains of the windows and glittering on the altar furniture and it looked as bright and cheerful as need be  going apart in this church to see some painting which was being executed in fresco by a french artist and his pupil i was led to observe more closely than i might otherwise have done a great number of votive offerings with which the walls of the different chapels were profusely hung  i will not say decorated for they were very roughly and comically got up most likely by poor sign painters who eke out their living in that way  they were all little pictures  each representing some sickness or calamity from which the person placing it there had escaped through the interposition of his or her patron saint or of the madonna and i may refer to them as good specimens of the class generally  they are abundant in italy  in a grotesque squareness of outline and impossibility of perspective they are not unlike the woodcuts in old books but they were oilpaintings and the artist like the painter of the primrose family had not been sparing of his colours  in one a lady was having a toe amputatedan operation which a saintly personage had sailed into the room upon a couch to superintend in another a lady was lying in bed tucked up very tight and prim and staring with much composure at a tripod with a slopbasin on it the usual form of washingstand and the only piece of furniture besides the bedstead in her chamber  one would never have supposed her to be labouring under any complaint beyond the inconvenience of being miraculously wide awake if the painter had not hit upon the idea of putting all her family on their knees in one corner with their legs sticking out behind them on the floor like boottrees  above whom the virgin on a kind of blue divan promised to restore the patient  in another case a lady was in the very act of being run over immediately outside the city walls by a sort of pianoforte van  but the madonna was there again whether the supernatural appearance had startled the horse a bay griffin or whether it was invisible to him i dont know but he was galloping away ding dong without the smallest reverence or compunction  on every picture ex voto was painted in yellow capitals in the sky  though votive offerings were not unknown in pagan temples and are evidently among the many compromises made between the false religion and the true when the true was in its infancy i could wish that all the other compromises were as harmless  gratitude and devotion are christian qualities and a grateful humble christian spirit may dictate the observance  hard by the cathedral stands the ancient palace of the popes of which one portion is now a common jail and another a noisy barrack  while gloomy suites of state apartments shut up and deserted mock their own old state and glory like the embalmed bodies of kings  but we neither went there to see state rooms nor soldiers quarters nor a common jail though we dropped some money into a prisoners box outside whilst the prisoners themselves looked through the iron bars high up and watched us eagerly  we went to see the ruins of the dreadful rooms in which the inquisition used to sit  a little old swarthy woman with a pair of flashing black eyes proof that the world hadnt conjured down the devil within her though it had had between sixty and seventy years to do it in came out of the barrack cabaret of which she was the keeper with some large keys in her hands and marshalled us the way that we should go  how she told us on the way that she was a government officer concierge du palais a apostolique and had been for i dont know how many years and how she had shown these dungeons to princes and how she was the best of dungeon demonstrators and how she had resided in the palace from an infanthad been born there if i recollect righti neednt relate  but such a fierce little rapid sparkling energetic shedevil i never beheld  she was alight and flaming all the time  her action was violent in the extreme  she never spoke without stopping expressly for the purpose  she stamped her feet clutched us by the arms flung herself into attitudes hammered against walls with her keys for mere emphasis  now whispered as if the inquisition were there still  now shrieked as if she were on the rack herself and had a mysterious haglike way with her forefinger when approaching the remains of some new horrorlooking back and walking stealthily and making horrible grimacesthat might alone have qualified her to walk up and down a sick mans counterpane to the exclusion of all other figures through a whole fever  passing through the courtyard among groups of idle soldiers we turned off by a gate which this shegoblin unlocked for our admission and locked again behind us  and entered a narrow court rendered narrower by fallen stones and heaps of rubbish part of it choking up the mouth of a ruined subterranean passage that once communicated or is said to have done so with another castle on the opposite bank of the river  close to this courtyard is a dungeonwe stood within it in another minutein the dismal tower des oubliettes where rienzi was imprisoned fastened by an iron chain to the very wall that stands there now but shut out from the sky which now looks down into it  a few steps brought us to the cachots in which the prisoners of the inquisition were confined for fortyeight hours after their capture without food or drink that their constancy might be shaken even before they were confronted with their gloomy judges  the day has not got in there yet  they are still small cells shut in by four unyielding close hard walls still profoundly dark still massively doored and fastened as of old  goblin looking back as i have described went softly on into a vaulted chamber now used as a storeroom  once the chapel of the holy office  the place where the tribunal sat was plain  the platform might have been removed but yesterday  conceive the parable of the good samaritan having been painted on the wall of one of these inquisition chambers  but it was and may be traced there yet  high up in the jealous wall are niches where the faltering replies of the accused were heard and noted down  many of them had been brought out of the very cell we had just looked into so awfully along the same stone passage  we had trodden in their very footsteps  i am gazing round me with the horror that the place inspires when goblin clutches me by the wrist and lays not her skinny finger but the handle of a key upon her lip  she invites me with a jerk to follow her  i do so  she leads me out into a room adjoininga rugged room with a funnelshaped contracting roof open at the top to the bright day  i ask her what it is  she folds her arms leers hideously and stares  i ask again  she glances round to see that all the little company are there sits down upon a mound of stones throws up her arms and yells out like a fiend la salle de la question  the chamber of torture  and the roof was made of that shape to stifle the victims cries  oh goblin goblin let us think of this awhile in silence  peace goblin  sit with your short arms crossed on your short legs upon that heap of stones for only five minutes and then flame out again  minutes  seconds are not marked upon the palace clock when with her eyes flashing fire goblin is up in the middle of the chamber describing with her sunburnt arms a wheel of heavy blows  thus it ran round cries goblin  mash mash mash  an endless routine of heavy hammers  mash mash mash upon the sufferers limbs see the stone trough says goblin  for the water torture  gurgle swill bloat burst for the redeemers honour  suck the bloody rag deep down into your unbelieving body heretic at every breath you draw  and when the executioner plucks it out reeking with the smaller mysteries of gods own image know us for his chosen servants true believers in the sermon on the mount elect disciples of him who never did a miracle but to heal  who never struck a man with palsy blindness deafness dumbness madness any one affliction of mankind and never stretched his blessed hand out but to give relief and ease  see cries goblin  there the furnace was  there they made the irons redhot  those holes supported the sharp stake on which the tortured persons hung poised  dangling with their whole weight from the roof  but and goblin whispers this monsieur has heard of this tower  yes  let monsieur look down then  a cold air laden with an earthy smell falls upon the face of monsieur for she has opened while speaking a trapdoor in the wall  monsieur looks in  downward to the bottom upward to the top of a steep dark lofty tower  very dismal very dark very cold  the executioner of the inquisition says goblin edging in her head to look down also flung those who were past all further torturing down here  but look does monsieur see the black stains on the wall  a glance over his shoulder at goblins keen eye shows monsieurand would without the aid of the directing keywhere they are  what are they  blood  in october 1791 when the revolution was at its height here sixty persons  men and women and priests says goblin priests were murdered and hurled the dying and the dead into this dreadful pit where a quantity of quicklime was tumbled down upon their bodies  those ghastly tokens of the massacre were soon no more but while one stone of the strong building in which the deed was done remains upon another there they will lie in the memories of men as plain to see as the splashing of their blood upon the wall is now  was it a portion of the great scheme of retribution that the cruel deed should be committed in this place  that a part of the atrocities and monstrous institutions which had been for scores of years at work to change mens nature should in its last service tempt them with the ready means of gratifying their furious and beastly rage  should enable them to show themselves in the height of their frenzy no worse than a great solemn legal establishment in the height of its power  no worse  much better they used the tower of the forgotten in the name of libertytheir liberty an earthborn creature nursed in the black mud of the bastile moats and dungeons and necessarily betraying many evidences of its unwholesome bringingupbut the inquisition used it in the name of heaven  goblins finger is lifted and she steals out again into the chapel of the holy office  she stops at a certain part of the flooring  her great effect is at hand  she waits for the rest she darts at the brave courier who is explaining something hits him a sounding rap on the hat with the largest key and bids him be silent  she assembles us all round a little trapdoor in the floor as round a grave  voila she darts down at the ring and flings the door open with a crash in her goblin energy though it is no light weight voila les oubliettes  voila les oubliettes  subterranean frightful  black  terrible  deadly  les oubliettes de linquisition  my blood ran cold as i looked from goblin down into the vaults where these forgotten creatures with recollections of the world outside  of wives friends children brothers  starved to death and made the stones ring with their unavailing groans  but the thrill i felt on seeing the accursed wall below decayed and broken through and the sun shining in through its gaping wounds was like a sense of victory and triumph  i felt exalted with the proud delight of living in these degenerate times to see it  as if i were the hero of some high achievement  the light in the doleful vaults was typical of the light that has streamed in on all persecution in gods name but which is not yet at its noon  it cannot look more lovely to a blind man newly restored to sight than to a traveller who sees it calmly and majestically treading down the darkness of that infernal well    chapter iiiavignon to genoa    goblin having shown les oubliettes felt that her great coup was struck  she let the door fall with a crash and stood upon it with her arms akimbo sniffing prodigiously  when we left the place i accompanied her into her house under the outer gateway of the fortress to buy a little history of the building  her cabaret a dark low room lighted by small windows sunk in the thick wallin the softened light and with its forge like chimney its little counter by the door with bottles jars and glasses on it its household implements and scraps of dress against the wall and a soberlooking woman she must have a congenial life of it with goblin knitting at the doorlooked exactly like a picture by ostade  i walked round the building on the outside in a sort of dream and yet with the delightful sense of having awakened from it of which the light down in the vaults had given me the assurance  the immense thickness and giddy height of the walls the enormous strength of the massive towers the great extent of the building its gigantic proportions frowning aspect and barbarous irregularity awaken awe and wonder  the recollection of its opposite old uses  an impregnable fortress a luxurious palace a horrible prison a place of torture the court of the inquisition at one and the same time a house of feasting fighting religion and blood  gives to every stone in its huge form a fearful interest and imparts new meaning to its incongruities  i could think of little however then or long afterwards but the sun in the dungeons  the palace coming down to be the loungingplace of noisy soldiers and being forced to echo their rough talk and common oaths and to have their garments fluttering from its dirty windows was some reduction of its state and something to rejoice at but the day in its cells and the sky for the roof of its chambers of crueltythat was its desolation and defeat  if i had seen it in a blaze from ditch to rampart i should have felt that not that light nor all the light in all the fire that burns could waste it like the sunbeams in its secret councilchamber and its prisons  before i quit this palace of the popes let me translate from the little history i mentioned just now a short anecdote quite appropriate to itself connected with its adventures  an ancient tradition relates that in 1441 a nephew of pierre de lude the popes legate seriously insulted some distinguished ladies of avignon whose relations in revenge seized the young man and horribly mutilated him  for several years the legate kept his revenge within his own breast but he was not the less resolved upon its gratification at last  he even made in the fulness of time advances towards a complete reconciliation and when their apparent sincerity had prevailed he invited to a splendid banquet in this palace certain families whole families whom he sought to exterminate  the utmost gaiety animated the repast but the measures of the legate were well taken  when the dessert was on the board a swiss presented himself with the announcement that a strange ambassador solicited an extraordinary audience  the legate excusing himself for the moment to his guests retired followed by his officers  within a few minutes afterwards five hundred persons were reduced to ashes  the whole of that wing of the building having been blown into the air with a terrible explosion  after seeing the churches i will not trouble you with churches just now we left avignon that afternoon  the heat being very great the roads outside the walls were strewn with people fast asleep in every little slip of shade and with lazy groups half asleep and half awake who were waiting until the sun should be low enough to admit of their playing bowls among the burntup trees and on the dusty road  the harvest here was already gathered in and mules and horses were treading out the corn in the fields  we came at dusk upon a wild and hilly country once famous for brigands and travelled slowly up a steep ascent  so we went on until eleven at night when we halted at the town of aix within two stages of marseilles to sleep  the hotel with all the blinds and shutters closed to keep the light and heat out was comfortable and airy next morning and the town was very clean but so hot and so intensely light that when i walked out at noon it was like coming suddenly from the darkened room into crisp blue fire  the air was so very clear that distant hills and rocky points appeared within an hours walk while the town immediately at handwith a kind of blue wind between me and itseemed to be white hot and to be throwing off a fiery air from the surface  we left this town towards evening and took the road to marseilles a dusty road it was the houses shut up close and the vines powdered white  at nearly all the cottage doors women were peeling and slicing onions into earthen bowls for supper  so they had been doing last night all the way from avignon  we passed one or two shady dark chateaux surrounded by trees and embellished with cool basins of water  which were the more refreshing to behold from the great scarcity of such residences on the road we had travelled  as we approached marseilles the road began to be covered with holiday people  outside the publichouses were parties smoking drinking playing draughts and cards and once dancing  but dust dust dust everywhere  we went on through a long straggling dirty suburb thronged with people having on our left a dreary slope of land on which the countryhouses of the marseilles merchants always staring white are jumbled and heaped without the slightest order  backs fronts sides and gables towards all points of the compass until at last we entered the town  i was there twice or thrice afterwards in fair weather and foul and i am afraid there is no doubt that it is a dirty and disagreeable place  but the prospect from the fortified heights of the beautiful mediterranean with its lovely rocks and islands is most delightful  these heights are a desirable retreat for less picturesque reasonsas an escape from a compound of vile smells perpetually arising from a great harbour full of stagnant water and befouled by the refuse of innumerable ships with all sorts of cargoes  which in hot weather is dreadful in the last degree  there were foreign sailors of all nations in the streets with red shirts blue shirts buff shirts tawny shirts and shirts of orange colour with red caps blue caps green caps great beards and no beards in turkish turbans glazed english hats and neapolitan headdresses  there were the townspeople sitting in clusters on the pavement or airing themselves on the tops of their houses or walking up and down the closest and least airy of boulevards and there were crowds of fiercelooking people of the lower sort blocking up the way constantly  in the very heart of all this stir and uproar was the common madhouse a low contracted miserable building looking straight upon the street without the smallest screen or courtyard where chattering madmen and madwomen were peeping out through rusty bars at the staring faces below while the sun darting fiercely aslant into their little cells seemed to dry up their brains and worry them as if they were baited by a pack of dogs  we were pretty well accommodated at the hotel du paradis situated in a narrow street of very high houses with a hairdressers shop opposite exhibiting in one of its windows two fulllength waxen ladies twirling round and round  which so enchanted the hairdresser himself that he and his family sat in armchairs and in cool undresses on the pavement outside enjoying the gratification of the passersby with lazy dignity  the family had retired to rest when we went to bed at midnight but the hairdresser a corpulent man in drab slippers was still sitting there with his legs stretched out before him and evidently couldnt bear to have the shutters put up  next day we went down to the harbour where the sailors of all nations were discharging and taking in cargoes of all kinds fruits wines oils silks stuffs velvets and every manner of merchandise  taking one of a great number of lively little boats with gaystriped awnings we rowed away under the sterns of great ships under towropes and cables against and among other boats and very much too near the sides of vessels that were faint with oranges to the marie antoinette a handsome steamer bound for genoa lying near the mouth of the harbour  byandby the carriage that unwieldy trifle from the pantechnicon on a flat barge bumping against everything and giving occasion for a prodigious quantity of oaths and grimaces came stupidly alongside and by five oclock we were steaming out in the open sea  the vessel was beautifully clean the meals were served under an awning on deck the night was calm and clear the quiet beauty of the sea and sky unspeakable  we were off nice early next morning and coasted along within a few miles of the cornice road of which more in its place nearly all day  we could see genoa before three and watching it as it gradually developed its splendid amphitheatre terrace rising above terrace garden above garden palace above palace height upon height was ample occupation for us till we ran into the stately harbour  having been duly astonished here by the sight of a few cappucini monks who were watching the fairweighing of some wood upon the wharf we drove off to albaro two miles distant where we had engaged a house  the way lay through the main streets but not through the strada nuova or the strada balbi which are the famous streets of palaces  i never in my life was so dismayed  the wonderful novelty of everything the unusual smells the unaccountable filth though it is reckoned the cleanest of italian towns the disorderly jumbling of dirty houses one upon the roof of another the passages more squalid and more close than any in st giless or old paris in and out of which not vagabonds but welldressed women with white veils and great fans were passing and repassing the perfect absence of resemblance in any dwellinghouse or shop or wall or post or pillar to anything one had ever seen before and the disheartening dirt discomfort and decay perfectly confounded me  i fell into a dismal reverie  i am conscious of a feverish and bewildered vision of saints and virgins shrines at the street cornersof great numbers of friars monks and soldiersof vast red curtains waving in the doorways of the churchesof always going up hill and yet seeing every other street and passage going higher upof fruitstalls with fresh lemons and oranges hanging in garlands made of vineleavesof a guardhouse and a drawbridgeand some gatewaysand vendors of iced water sitting with little trays upon the margin of the kenneland this is all the consciousness i had until i was set down in a rank dull weedy courtyard attached to a kind of pink jail and was told i lived there  i little thought that day that i should ever come to have an attachment for the very stones in the streets of genoa and to look back upon the city with affection as connected with many hours of happiness and quiet  but these are my first impressions honestly set down and how they changed i will set down too  at present let us breathe after this longwinded journey    chapter ivgenoa and its neighbourhood    the first impressions of such a place as albaro the suburb of genoa where i am now as my american friends would say located can hardly fail i should imagine to be mournful and disappointing  it requires a little time and use to overcome the feeling of depression consequent at first on so much ruin and neglect  novelty pleasant to most people is particularly delightful i think to me  i am not easily dispirited when i have the means of pursuing my own fancies and occupations and i believe i have some natural aptitude for accommodating myself to circumstances  but as yet i stroll about here in all the holes and corners of the neighbourhood in a perpetual state of forlorn surprise and returning to my villa  the villa bagnerello it sounds romantic but signor bagnerello is a butcher hard by  have sufficient occupation in pondering over my new experiences and comparing them very much to my own amusement with my expectations until i wander out again  the villa bagnerello  or the pink jail a far more expressive name for the mansion  is in one of the most splendid situations imaginable  the noble bay of genoa with the deep blue mediterranean lies stretched out near at hand monstrous old desolate houses and palaces are dotted all about lofty hills with their tops often hidden in the clouds and with strong forts perched high up on their craggy sides are close upon the left and in front stretching from the walls of the house down to a ruined chapel which stands upon the bold and picturesque rocks on the sea shore are green vineyards where you may wander all day long in partial shade through interminable vistas of grapes trained on a rough trelliswork across the narrow paths  this sequestered spot is approached by lanes so very narrow that when we arrived at the customhouse we found the people here had taken the measure of the narrowest among them and were waiting to apply it to the carriage which ceremony was gravely performed in the street while we all stood by in breathless suspense  it was found to be a very tight fit but just a possibility and no more as i am reminded every day by the sight of various large holes which it punched in the walls on either side as it came along  we are more fortunate i am told than an old lady who took a house in these parts not long ago and who stuck fast in her carriage in a lane and as it was impossible to open one of the doors she was obliged to submit to the indignity of being hauled through one of the little front windows like a harlequin  when you have got through these narrow lanes you come to an archway imperfectly stopped up by a rusty old gatemy gate  the rusty old gate has a bell to correspond which you ring as long as you like and which nobody answers as it has no connection whatever with the house  but there is a rusty old knocker too very loose so that it slides round when you touch itand if you learn the trick of it and knock long enough somebody comes  the brave courier comes and gives you admittance  you walk into a seedy little garden all wild and weedy from which the vineyard opens cross it enter a square hall like a cellar walk up a cracked marble staircase and pass into a most enormous room with a vaulted roof and whitewashed walls  not unlike a great methodist chapel  this is the sala  it has five windows and five doors and is decorated with pictures which would gladden the heart of one of those picturecleaners in london who hang up as a sign a picture divided like death and the lady at the top of the old ballad which always leaves you in a state of uncertainty whether the ingenious professor has cleaned one half or dirtied the other the furniture of this sala is a sort of red brocade  all the chairs are immovable and the sofa weighs several tons  on the same floor and opening out of this same chamber are diningroom drawingroom and divers bedrooms  each with a multiplicity of doors and windows  upstairs are divers other gaunt chambers and a kitchen and downstairs is another kitchen which with all sorts of strange contrivances for burning charcoal looks like an alchemical laboratory  there are also some half dozen small sittingrooms where the servants in this hot july may escape from the heat of the fire and where the brave courier plays all sorts of musical instruments of his own manufacture all the evening long  a mighty old wandering ghostly echoing grim bare house it is as ever i beheld or thought of  there is a little vinecovered terrace opening from the drawing room and under this terrace and forming one side of the little garden is what used to be the stable  it is now a cowhouse and has three cows in it so that we get new milk by the bucketful there is no pasturage near and they never go out but are constantly lying down and surfeiting themselves with vineleaves perfect italian cows enjoying the dolce far niente all day long they are presided over and slept with by an old man named antonio and his son two burntsienna natives with naked legs and feet who wear each a shirt a pair of trousers and a red sash with a relic or some sacred charm like the bonbon off a twelfth cake hanging round the neck  the old man is very anxious to convert me to the catholic faith and exhorts me frequently  we sit upon a stone by the door sometimes in the evening like robinson crusoe and friday reversed and he generally relates towards my conversion an abridgment of the history of saint peter chiefly i believe from the unspeakable delight he has in his imitation of the cock  the view as i have said is charming but in the day you must keep the latticeblinds close shut or the sun would drive you mad and when the sun goes down you must shut up all the windows or the mosquitoes would tempt you to commit suicide  so at this time of the year you dont see much of the prospect within doors  as for the flies you dont mind them  nor the fleas whose size is prodigious and whose name is legion and who populate the coach house to that extent that i daily expect to see the carriage going off bodily drawn by myriads of industrious fleas in harness  the rats are kept away quite comfortably by scores of lean cats who roam about the garden for that purpose  the lizards of course nobody cares for they play in the sun and dont bite  the little scorpions are merely curious  the beetles are rather late and have not appeared yet  the frogs are company  there is a preserve of them in the grounds of the next villa and after nightfall one would think that scores upon scores of women in pattens were going up and down a wet stone pavement without a moments cessation that is exactly the noise they make  the ruined chapel on the picturesque and beautiful seashore was dedicated once upon a time to saint john the baptist  i believe there is a legend that saint johns bones were received there with various solemnities when they were first brought to genoa for genoa possesses them to this day  when there is any uncommon tempest at sea they are brought out and exhibited to the raging weather which they never fail to calm  in consequence of this connection of saint john with the city great numbers of the common people are christened giovanni baptista which latter name is pronounced in the genoese patois batcheetcha like a sneeze  to hear everybody calling everybody else batcheetcha on a sunday or festaday when there are crowds in the streets is not a little singular and amusing to a stranger  the narrow lanes have great villas opening into them whose walls outside walls i mean are profusely painted with all sorts of subjects grim and holy  but time and the seaair have nearly obliterated them and they look like the entrance to vauxhall gardens on a sunny day  the courtyards of these houses are overgrown with grass and weeds all sorts of hideous patches cover the bases of the statues as if they were afflicted with a cutaneous disorder the outer gates are rusty and the iron bars outside the lower windows are all tumbling down  firewood is kept in halls where costly treasures might be heaped up mountains high waterfalls are dry and choked fountains too dull to play and too lazy to work have just enough recollection of their identity in their sleep to make the neighbourhood damp and the sirocco wind is often blowing over all these things for days together like a gigantic oven out for a holiday  not long ago there was a festaday in honour of the virgins mother when the young men of the neighbourhood having worn green wreaths of the vine in some procession or other bathed in them by scores  it looked very odd and pretty  though i am bound to confess not knowing of the festa at that time that i thought and was quite satisfied they wore them as horses doto keep the flies off  soon afterwards there was another festaday in honour of st nazaro  one of the albaro young men brought two large bouquets soon after breakfast and coming upstairs into the great sala presented them himself  this was a polite way of begging for a contribution towards the expenses of some music in the saints honour so we gave him whatever it may have been and his messenger departed  well satisfied  at six oclock in the evening we went to the churchclose at handa very gaudy place hung all over with festoons and bright draperies and filled from the altar to the main door with women all seated  they wear no bonnets here simply a long white veilthe mezzero and it was the most gauzy ethereallooking audience i ever saw  the young women are not generally pretty but they walk remarkably well and in their personal carriage and the management of their veils display much innate grace and elegance  there were some men present  not very many  and a few of these were kneeling about the aisles while everybody else tumbled over them  innumerable tapers were burning in the church the bits of silver and tin about the saints especially in the virgins necklace sparkled brilliantly the priests were seated about the chief altar the organ played away lustily and a full band did the like while a conductor in a little gallery opposite to the band hammered away on the desk before him with a scroll and a tenor without any voice sang the band played one way the organ played another the singer went a third and the unfortunate conductor banged and banged and flourished his scroll on some principle of his own  apparently well satisfied with the whole performance  i never did hear such a discordant din  the heat was intense all the time  the men in red caps and with loose coats hanging on their shoulders they never put them on were playing bowls and buying sweetmeats immediately outside the church  when halfadozen of them finished a game they came into the aisle crossed themselves with the holy water knelt on one knee for an instant and walked off again to play another game at bowls  they are remarkably expert at this diversion and will play in the stony lanes and streets and on the most uneven and disastrous ground for such a purpose with as much nicety as on a billiardtable  but the most favourite game is the national one of mora which they pursue with surprising ardour and at which they will stake everything they possess  it is a destructive kind of gambling requiring no accessories but the ten fingers which are alwaysi intend no pun at hand  two men play together  one calls a numbersay the extreme one ten  he marks what portion of it he pleases by throwing out three or four or five fingers and his adversary has in the same instant at hazard and without seeing his hand to throw out as many fingers as will make the exact balance their eyes and hands become so used to this and act with such astonishing rapidity that an uninitiated bystander would find it very difficult if not impossible to follow the progress of the game  the initiated however of whom there is always an eager group looking on devour it with the most intense avidity and as they are always ready to champion one side or the other in case of a dispute and are frequently divided in their partisanship it is often a very noisy proceeding  it is never the quietest game in the world for the numbers are always called in a loud sharp voice and follow as close upon each other as they can be counted  on a holiday evening standing at a window or walking in a garden or passing through the streets or sauntering in any quiet place about the town you will hear this game in progress in a score of wine shops at once and looking over any vineyard walk or turning almost any corner will come upon a knot of players in full cry it is observable that most men have a propensity to throw out some particular number oftener than another and the vigilance with which two sharpeyed players will mutually endeavour to detect this weakness and adapt their game to it is very curious and entertaining  the effect is greatly heightened by the universal suddenness and vehemence of gesture two men playing for half a farthing with an intensity as allabsorbing as if the stake were life  hard by here is a large palazzo formerly belonging to some member of the brignole family but just now hired by a school of jesuits for their summer quarters  i walked into its dismantled precincts the other evening about sunset and couldnt help pacing up and down for a little time drowsily taking in the aspect of the place which is repeated hereabouts in all directions  i loitered to and fro under a colonnade forming two sides of a weedy grassgrown courtyard whereof the house formed a third side and a low terracewalk overlooking the garden and the neighbouring hills the fourth  i dont believe there was an uncracked stone in the whole pavement  in the centre was a melancholy statue so piebald in its decay that it looked exactly as if it had been covered with stickingplaster and afterwards powdered  the stables coachhouses offices were all empty all ruinous all utterly deserted  doors had lost their hinges and were holding on by their latches windows were broken painted plaster had peeled off and was lying about in clods fowls and cats had so taken possession of the out buildings that i couldnt help thinking of the fairy tales and eyeing them with suspicion as transformed retainers waiting to be changed back again  one old tom in particular  a scraggy brute with a hungry green eye a poor relation in reality i am inclined to think  came prowling round and round me as if he half believed for the moment that i might be the hero come to marry the lady and set all torights but discovering his mistake he suddenly gave a grim snarl and walked away with such a tremendous tail that he couldnt get into the little hole where he lived but was obliged to wait outside until his indignation and his tail had gone down together  in a sort of summerhouse or whatever it may be in this colonnade some englishmen had been living like grubs in a nut but the jesuits had given them notice to go and they had gone and that was shut up too  the house  a wandering echoing thundering barrack of a place with the lower windows barred up as usual was wide open at the door  and i have no doubt i might have gone in and gone to bed and gone dead and nobody a bit the wiser  only one suite of rooms on an upper floor was tenanted and from one of these the voice of a younglady vocalist practising bravura lustily came flaunting out upon the silent evening  i went down into the garden intended to be prim and quaint with avenues and terraces and orangetrees and statues and water in stone basins and everything was green gaunt weedy straggling under grown or over grown mildewy damp redolent of all sorts of slabby clammy creeping and uncomfortable life  there was nothing bright in the whole scene but a fireflyone solitary fireflyshowing against the dark bushes like the last little speck of the departed glory of the house and even it went flitting up and down at sudden angles and leaving a place with a jerk and describing an irregular circle and returning to the same place with a twitch that startled one  as if it were looking for the rest of the glory and wondering heaven knows it might what had become of it   in the course of two months the flitting shapes and shadows of my dismal entering reverie gradually resolved themselves into familiar forms and substances and i already began to think that when the time should come a year hence for closing the long holiday and turning back to england i might part from genoa with anything but a glad heart  it is a place that grows upon you every day  there seems to be always something to find out in it  there are the most extraordinary alleys and byways to walk about in  you can lose your way what a comfort that is when you are idle twenty times a day if you like and turn up again under the most unexpected and surprising difficulties  it abounds in the strangest contrasts things that are picturesque ugly mean magnificent delightful and offensive break upon the view at every turn  they who would know how beautiful the country immediately surrounding genoa is should climb in clear weather to the top of monte faccio or at least ride round the city walls  a feat more easily performed  no prospect can be more diversified and lovely than the changing views of the harbour and the valleys of the two rivers the polcevera and the bizagno from the heights along which the strongly fortified walls are carried like the great wall of china in little  in not the least picturesque part of this ride there is a fair specimen of a real genoese tavern where the visitor may derive good entertainment from real genoese dishes such as tagliarini ravioli german sausages strong of garlic sliced and eaten with fresh green figs cocks combs and sheep kidneys chopped up with mutton chops and liver small pieces of some unknown part of a calf twisted into small shreds fried and served up in a great dish like whitebait and other curiosities of that kind  they often get wine at these suburban trattorie from france and spain and portugal which is brought over by small captains in little tradingvessels  they buy it at so much a bottle without asking what it is or caring to remember if anybody tells them and usually divide it into two heaps of which they label one champagne and the other madeira  the various opposite flavours qualities countries ages and vintages that are comprised under these two general heads is quite extraordinary the most limited range is probably from cool gruel up to old marsala and down again to apple tea  the great majority of the streets are as narrow as any thoroughfare can well be where people even italian people are supposed to live and walk about being mere lanes with here and there a kind of well or breathingplace  the houses are immensely high painted in all sorts of colours and are in every stage and state of damage dirt and lack of repair  they are commonly let off in floors or flats like the houses in the old town of edinburgh or many houses in paris  there are few street doors the entrance halls are for the most part looked upon as public property and any moderately enterprising scavenger might make a fine fortune by now and then clearing them out  as it is impossible for coaches to penetrate into these streets there are sedan chairs gilded and otherwise for hire in divers places  a great many private chairs are also kept among the nobility and gentry and at night these are trotted to and fro in all directions preceded by bearers of great lanthorns made of linen stretched upon a frame  the sedans and lanthorns are the legitimate successors of the long strings of patient and muchabused mules that go jingling their little bells through these confined streets all day long  they follow them as regularly as the stars the sun  when shall i forget the streets of palaces  the strada nuova and the strada balbi or how the former looked one summer day when i first saw it underneath the brightest and most intensely blue of summer skies  which its narrow perspective of immense mansions reduced to a tapering and most precious strip of brightness looking down upon the heavy shade below  a brightness not too common even in july and august to be well esteemed  for if the truth must out there were not eight blue skies in as many midsummer weeks saving sometimes early in the morning when looking out to sea the water and the firmament were one world of deep and brilliant blue  at other times there were clouds and haze enough to make an englishman grumble in his own climate  the endless details of these rich palaces  the walls of some of them within alive with masterpieces by vandyke  the great heavy stone balconies one above another and tier over tier with here and there one larger than the rest towering high upa huge marble platform the doorless vestibules massively barred lower windows immense public staircases thick marble pillars strong dungeonlike arches and dreary dreaming echoing vaulted chambers  among which the eye wanders again and again and again as every palace is succeeded by anotherthe terrace gardens between house and house with green arches of the vine and groves of orangetrees and blushing oleander in full bloom twenty thirty forty feet above the streetthe painted halls mouldering and blotting and rotting in the damp corners and still shining out in beautiful colours and voluptuous designs where the walls are drythe faded figures on the outsides of the houses holding wreaths and crowns and flying upward and downward and standing in niches and here and there looking fainter and more feeble than elsewhere by contrast with some fresh little cupids who on a more recently decorated portion of the front are stretching out what seems to be the semblance of a blanket but is indeed a sundial the steep steep uphill streets of small palaces but very large palaces for all that with marble terraces looking down into close bywaysthe magnificent and innumerable churches and the rapid passage from a street of stately edifices into a maze of the vilest squalor steaming with unwholesome stenches and swarming with halfnaked children and whole worlds of dirty peoplemake up altogether such a scene of wonder  so lively and yet so dead so noisy and yet so quiet  so obtrusive and yet so shy and lowering  so wide awake and yet so fast asleep  that it is a sort of intoxication to a stranger to walk on and on and on and look about him  a bewildering phantasmagoria with all the inconsistency of a dream and all the pain and all the pleasure of an extravagant reality  the different uses to which some of these palaces are applied all at once is characteristic  for instance the english banker my excellent and hospitable friend has his office in a goodsized palazzo in the strada nuova  in the hall every inch of which is elaborately painted but which is as dirty as a policestation in london a hooknosed saracens head with an immense quantity of black hair there is a man attached to it sells walkingsticks on the other side of the doorway a lady with a showy handkerchief for headdress wife to the saracens head i believe sells articles of her own knitting and sometimes flowers  a little further in two or three blind men occasionally beg  sometimes they are visited by a man without legs on a little gocart but who has such a freshcoloured lively face and such a respectable wellconditioned body that he looks as if he had sunk into the ground up to his middle or had come but partially up a flight of cellarsteps to speak to somebody  a little further in a few men perhaps lie asleep in the middle of the day or they may be chairmen waiting for their absent freight  if so they have brought their chairs in with them and there they stand also  on the left of the hall is a little room  a hatters shop  on the first floor is the english bank  on the first floor also is a whole house and a good large residence too  heaven knows what there may be above that but when you are there you have only just begun to go upstairs  and yet coming downstairs again thinking of this and passing out at a great crazy door in the back of the hall instead of turning the other way to get into the street again it bangs behind you making the dismallest and most lonesome echoes and you stand in a yard the yard of the same house which seems to have been unvisited by human foot for a hundred years not a sound disturbs its repose  not a head thrust out of any of the grim dark jealous windows within sight makes the weeds in the cracked pavement faint of heart by suggesting the possibility of there being hands to grub them up  opposite to you is a giant figure carved in stone reclining with an urn upon a lofty piece of artificial rockwork and out of the urn dangles the fag end of a leaden pipe which once upon a time poured a small torrent down the rocks  but the eyesockets of the giant are not drier than this channel is now  he seems to have given his urn which is nearly upside down a final tilt and after crying like a sepulchral child all gone to have lapsed into a stony silence  in the streets of shops the houses are much smaller but of great size notwithstanding and extremely high  they are very dirty quite undrained if my nose be at all reliable  and emit a peculiar fragrance like the smell of very bad cheese kept in very hot blankets  notwithstanding the height of the houses there would seem to have been a lack of room in the city for new houses are thrust in everywhere  wherever it has been possible to cram a tumbledown tenement into a crack or corner in it has gone  if there be a nook or angle in the wall of a church or a crevice in any other dead wall of any sort there you are sure to find some kind of habitation  looking as if it had grown there like a fungus  against the government house against the old senate house round about any large building little shops stick so close like parasite vermin to the great carcase  and for all this look where you may  up steps down steps anywhere everywhere  there are irregular houses receding starting forward tumbling down leaning against their neighbours crippling themselves or their friends by some means or other until one more irregular than the rest chokes up the way and you cant see any further  one of the rottenestlooking parts of the town i think is down by the landingwharf  though it may be that its being associated with a great deal of rottenness on the evening of our arrival has stamped it deeper in my mind  here again the houses are very high and are of an infinite variety of deformed shapes and have as most of the houses have something hanging out of a great many windows and wafting its frowsy fragrance on the breeze sometimes it is a curtain sometimes it is a carpet sometimes it is a bed sometimes a whole linefull of clothes but there is almost always something  before the basement of these houses is an arcade over the pavement  very massive dark and low like an old crypt  the stone or plaster of which it is made has turned quite black and against every one of these black piles all sorts of filth and garbage seem to accumulate spontaneously  beneath some of the arches the sellers of macaroni and polenta establish their stalls which are by no means inviting  the offal of a fish market near at handthat is to say of a back lane where people sit upon the ground and on various old bulkheads and sheds and sell fish when they have any to dispose ofand of a vegetable market constructed on the same principleare contributed to the decoration of this quarter and as all the mercantile business is transacted here and it is crowded all day it has a very decided flavour about it  the porto franco or free port where goods brought in from foreign countries pay no duty until they are sold and taken out as in a bonded warehouse in england is down here also and two portentous officials in cocked hats stand at the gate to search you if they choose and to keep out monks and ladies  for sanctity as well as beauty has been known to yield to the temptation of smuggling and in the same way  that is to say by concealing the smuggled property beneath the loose folds of its dress  so sanctity and beauty may by no means enter  the streets of genoa would be all the better for the importation of a few priests of prepossessing appearance  every fourth or fifth man in the streets is a priest or a monk and there is pretty sure to be at least one itinerant ecclesiastic inside or outside every hackney carriage on the neighbouring roads  i have no knowledge elsewhere of more repulsive countenances than are to be found among these gentry  if natures handwriting be at all legible greater varieties of sloth deceit and intellectual torpor could hardly be observed among any class of men in the world  mr pepys once heard a clergyman assert in his sermon in illustration of his respect for the priestly office that if he could meet a priest and angel together he would salute the priest first  i am rather of the opinion of petrarch who when his pupil boccaccio wrote to him in great tribulation that he had been visited and admonished for his writings by a carthusian friar who claimed to be a messenger immediately commissioned by heaven for that purpose replied that for his own part he would take the liberty of testing the reality of the commission by personal observation of the messengers face eyes forehead behaviour and discourse  i cannot but believe myself from similar observation that many unaccredited celestial messengers may be seen skulking through the streets of genoa or droning away their lives in other italian towns  perhaps the cappuccini though not a learned body are as an order the best friends of the people  they seem to mingle with them more immediately as their counsellors and comforters and to go among them more when they are sick and to pry less than some other orders into the secrets of families for the purpose of establishing a baleful ascendency over their weaker members and to be influenced by a less fierce desire to make converts and once made to let them go to ruin soul and body  they may be seen in their coarse dress in all parts of the town at all times and begging in the markets early in the morning  the jesuits too muster strong in the streets and go slinking noiselessly about in pairs like black cats  in some of the narrow passages distinct trades congregate  there is a street of jewellers and there is a row of booksellers but even down in places where nobody ever can or ever could penetrate in a carriage there are mighty old palaces shut in among the gloomiest and closest walls and almost shut out from the sun very few of the tradesmen have any idea of setting forth their goods or disposing them for show  if you a stranger want to buy anything you usually look round the shop till you see it then clutch it if it be within reach and inquire how much  everything is sold at the most unlikely place  if you want coffee you go to a sweetmeat shop and if you want meat you will probably find it behind an old checked curtain down halfadozen steps in some sequestered nook as hard to find as if the commodity were poison and genoas law were death to any that uttered it  most of the apothecaries shops are great loungingplaces  here grave men with sticks sit down in the shade for hours together passing a meagre genoa paper from hand to hand and talking drowsily and sparingly about the news  two or three of these are poor physicians ready to proclaim themselves on an emergency and tear off with any messenger who may arrive  you may know them by the way in which they stretch their necks to listen when you enter and by the sigh with which they fall back again into their dull corners on finding that you only want medicine  few people lounge in the barbers shops though they are very numerous as hardly any man shaves himself  but the apothecarys has its group of loungers who sit back among the bottles with their hands folded over the tops of their sticks  so still and quiet that either you dont see them in the darkened shop or mistake themas i did one ghostly man in bottlegreen one day with a hat like a stopperfor horse medicine  on a summer evening the genoese are as fond of putting themselves as their ancestors were of putting houses in every available inch of space in and about the town  in all the lanes and alleys and up every little ascent and on every dwarf wall and on every flight of steps they cluster like bees  meanwhile and especially on festadays the bells of the churches ring incessantly not in peals or any known form of sound but in a horrible irregular jerking dingle dingle dingle  with a sudden stop at every fifteenth dingle or so which is maddening  this performance is usually achieved by a boy up in the steeple who takes hold of the clapper or a little rope attached to it and tries to dingle louder than every other boy similarly employed  the noise is supposed to be particularly obnoxious to evil spirits but looking up into the steeples and seeing and hearing these young christians thus engaged one might very naturally mistake them for the enemy  festadays early in the autumn are very numerous  all the shops were shut up twice within a week for these holidays and one night all the houses in the neighbourhood of a particular church were illuminated while the church itself was lighted outside with torches and a grove of blazing links was erected in an open space outside one of the city gates  this part of the ceremony is prettier and more singular a little way in the country where you can trace the illuminated cottages all the way up a steep hill side and where you pass festoons of tapers wasting away in the starlight night before some lonely little house upon the road  on these days they always dress the church of the saint in whose honour the festa is holden very gaily  goldembroidered festoons of different colours hang from the arches the altar furniture is set forth and sometimes even the lofty pillars are swathed from top to bottom in tightfitting draperies  the cathedral is dedicated to st lorenzo  on st lorenzos day we went into it just as the sun was setting  although these decorations are usually in very indifferent taste the effect just then was very superb indeed  for the whole building was dressed in red and the sinking sun streaming in through a great red curtain in the chief doorway made all the gorgeousness its own  when the sun went down and it gradually grew quite dark inside except for a few twinkling tapers on the principal altar and some small dangling silver lamps it was very mysterious and effective  but sitting in any of the churches towards evening is like a mild dose of opium  with the money collected at a festa they usually pay for the dressing of the church and for the hiring of the band and for the tapers  if there be any left which seldom happens i believe the souls in purgatory get the benefit of it  they are also supposed to have the benefit of the exertions of certain small boys who shake moneyboxes before some mysterious little buildings like rural turnpikes which usually shut up close fly open on redletter days and disclose an image and some flowers inside  just without the city gate on the albara road is a small house with an altar in it and a stationary moneybox  also for the benefit of the souls in purgatory  still further to stimulate the charitable there is a monstrous painting on the plaster on either side of the grated door representing a select party of souls frying  one of them has a grey moustache and an elaborate head of grey hair  as if he had been taken out of a hairdressers window and cast into the furnace  there he is  a most grotesque and hideously comic old soul  for ever blistering in the real sun and melting in the mimic fire for the gratification and improvement and the contributions of the poor genoese  they are not a very joyous people and are seldom seen to dance on their holidays  the staple places of entertainment among the women being the churches and the public walks  they are very goodtempered obliging and industrious  industry has not made them clean for their habitations are extremely filthy and their usual occupation on a fine sunday morning is to sit at their doors hunting in each others heads  but their dwellings are so close and confined that if those parts of the city had been beaten down by massena in the time of the terrible blockade it would have at least occasioned one public benefit among many misfortunes  the peasant women with naked feet and legs are so constantly washing clothes in the public tanks and in every stream and ditch that one cannot help wondering in the midst of all this dirt who wears them when they are clean  the custom is to lay the wet linen which is being operated upon on a smooth stone and hammer away at it with a flat wooden mallet  this they do as furiously as if they were revenging themselves on dress in general for being connected with the fall of mankind  it is not unusual to see lying on the edge of the tank at these times or on another flat stone an unfortunate baby tightly swathed up arms and legs and all in an enormous quantity of wrapper so that it is unable to move a toe or finger  this custom which we often see represented in old pictures is universal among the common people  a child is left anywhere without the possibility of crawling away or is accidentally knocked off a shelf or tumbled out of bed or is hung up to a hook now and then and left dangling like a doll at an english ragshop without the least inconvenience to anybody  i was sitting one sunday soon after my arrival in the little country church of san martino a couple of miles from the city while a baptism took place  i saw the priest and an attendant with a large taper and a man and a woman and some others but i had no more idea until the ceremony was all over that it was a baptism or that the curious little stiff instrument that was passed from one to another in the course of the ceremony by the handlelike a short pokerwas a child than i had that it was my own christening  i borrowed the child afterwards for a minute or two it was lying across the font then and found it very red in the face but perfectly quiet and not to be bent on any terms  the number of cripples in the streets soon ceased to surprise me  there are plenty of saints and virgins shrines of course generally at the corners of streets  the favourite memento to the faithful about genoa is a painting representing a peasant on his knees with a spade and some other agricultural implements beside him and the madonna with the infant saviour in her arms appearing to him in a cloud  this is the legend of the madonna della guardia  a chapel on a mountain within a few miles which is in high repute  it seems that this peasant lived all alone by himself tilling some land atop of the mountain where being a devout man he daily said his prayers to the virgin in the open air for his hut was a very poor one  upon a certain day the virgin appeared to him as in the picture and said why do you pray in the open air and without a priest  the peasant explained because there was neither priest nor church at handa very uncommon complaint indeed in italy  i should wish then said the celestial visitor to have a chapel built here in which the prayers of the faithful may be offered up  but santissima madonna said the peasant i am a poor man and chapels cannot be built without money  they must be supported too santissima for to have a chapel and not support it liberally is a wickednessa deadly sin  this sentiment gave great satisfaction to the visitor  go said she  there is such a village in the valley on the left and such another village in the valley on the right and such another village elsewhere that will gladly contribute to the building of a chapel  go to them  relate what you have seen and do not doubt that sufficient money will be forthcoming to erect my chapel or that it will afterwards be handsomely maintained all of which miraculously turned out to be quite true  and in proof of this prediction and revelation there is the chapel of the madonna della guardia rich and flourishing at this day  the splendour and variety of the genoese churches can hardly be exaggerated  the church of the annunciata especially  built like many of the others at the cost of one noble family and now in slow progress of repair  from the outer door to the utmost height of the high cupola is so elaborately painted and set in gold that it looks as simond describes it in his charming book on italy like a great enamelled snuffbox  most of the richer churches contain some beautiful pictures or other embellishments of great price almost universally set side by side with sprawling effigies of maudlin monks and the veriest trash and tinsel ever seen  it may be a consequence of the frequent direction of the popular mind and pocket to the souls in purgatory but there is very little tenderness for the bodies of the dead here  for the very poor there are immediately outside one angle of the walls and behind a jutting point of the fortification near the sea certain common pitsone for every day in the yearwhich all remain closed up until the turn of each comes for its daily reception of dead bodies  among the troops in the town there are usually some swiss  more or less  when any of these die they are buried out of a fund maintained by such of their countrymen as are resident in genoa  their providing coffins for these men is matter of great astonishment to the authorities  certainly the effect of this promiscuous and indecent splashing down of dead people in so many wells is bad  it surrounds death with revolting associations that insensibly become connected with those whom death is approaching  indifference and avoidance are the natural result and all the softening influences of the great sorrow are harshly disturbed  there is a ceremony when an old cavaliere or the like expires of erecting a pile of benches in the cathedral to represent his bier covering them over with a pall of black velvet putting his hat and sword on the top making a little square of seats about the whole and sending out formal invitations to his friends and acquaintances to come and sit there and hear mass  which is performed at the principal altar decorated with an infinity of candles for that purpose  when the better kind of people die or are at the point of death their nearest relations generally walk off  retiring into the country for a little change and leaving the body to be disposed of without any superintendence from them  the procession is usually formed and the coffin borne and the funeral conducted by a body of persons called a confraternita who as a kind of voluntary penance undertake to perform these offices in regular rotation for the dead but who mingling something of pride with their humility are dressed in a loose garment covering their whole person and wear a hood concealing the face with breathingholes and apertures for the eyes  the effect of this costume is very ghastly  especially in the case of a certain blue confraternita belonging to genoa who to say the least of them are very ugly customers and who looksuddenly encountered in their pious ministration in the streetsas if they were ghoules or demons bearing off the body for themselves  although such a custom may be liable to the abuse attendant on many italian customs of being recognised as a means of establishing a current account with heaven on which to draw too easily for future bad actions or as an expiation for past misdeeds it must be admitted to be a good one and a practical one and one involving unquestionably good works  a voluntary service like this is surely better than the imposed penance not at all an infrequent one of giving so many licks to such and such a stone in the pavement of the cathedral or than a vow to the madonna to wear nothing but blue for a year or two  this is supposed to give great delight above blue being as is well known the madonnas favourite colour  women who have devoted themselves to this act of faith are very commonly seen walking in the streets  there are three theatres in the city besides an old one now rarely opened  the most importantthe carlo felice  the operahouse of genoais a very splendid commodious and beautiful theatre  a company of comedians were acting there when we arrived  and soon after their departure a secondrate opera company came  the great season is not until the carnival timein the spring  nothing impressed me so much in my visits here which were pretty numerous as the uncommonly hard and cruel character of the audience who resent the slightest defect take nothing good humouredly seem to be always lying in wait for an opportunity to hiss and spare the actresses as little as the actors  but as there is nothing else of a public nature at which they are allowed to express the least disapprobation perhaps they are resolved to make the most of this opportunity  there are a great number of piedmontese officers too who are allowed the privilege of kicking their heels in the pit for next to nothing  gratuitous or cheap accommodation for these gentlemen being insisted on by the governor in all public or semipublic entertainments  they are lofty critics in consequence and infinitely more exacting than if they made the unhappy managers fortune  the teatro diurno or day theatre is a covered stage in the open air where the performances take place by daylight in the cool of the afternoon commencing at four or five oclock and lasting some three hours  it is curious sitting among the audience to have a fine view of the neighbouring hills and houses and to see the neighbours at their windows looking on and to hear the bells of the churches and convents ringing at most complete cross purposes with the scene  beyond this and the novelty of seeing a play in the fresh pleasant air with the darkening evening closing in there is nothing very exciting or characteristic in the performances  the actors are indifferent and though they sometimes represent one of goldonis comedies the staple of the drama is french  anything like nationality is dangerous to despotic governments and jesuitbeleaguered kings  the theatre of puppets or marionettia famous company from milan is without any exception the drollest exhibition i ever beheld in my life  i never saw anything so exquisitely ridiculous  they look between four and five feet high but are really much smaller for when a musician in the orchestra happens to put his hat on the stage it becomes alarmingly gigantic and almost blots out an actor  they usually play a comedy and a ballet  the comic man in the comedy i saw one summer night is a waiter in an hotel  there never was such a locomotive actor since the world began  great pains are taken with him  he has extra joints in his legs  and a practical eye with which he winks at the pit in a manner that is absolutely insupportable to a stranger but which the initiated audience mainly composed of the common people receive so they do everything else quite as a matter of course and as if he were a man  his spirits are prodigious  he continually shakes his legs and winks his eye  and there is a heavy father with grey hair who sits down on the regular conventional stagebank and blesses his daughter in the regular conventional way who is tremendous  no one would suppose it possible that anything short of a real man could be so tedious  it is the triumph of art  in the ballet an enchanter runs away with the bride in the very hour of her nuptials he brings her to his cave and tries to soothe her  they sit down on a sofa the regular sofa in the regular place o p second entrance and a procession of musicians enters one creature playing a drum and knocking himself off his legs at every blow  these failing to delight her dancers appear  four first then two the two the fleshcoloured two the way in which they dance the height to which they spring the impossible and inhuman extent to which they pirouette the revelation of their preposterous legs the coming down with a pause on the very tips of their toes when the music requires it the gentlemans retiring up when it is the ladys turn and the ladys retiring up when it is the gentlemans turn the final passion of a pasdedeux and the going off with a boundi shall never see a real ballet with a composed countenance again  i went another night to see these puppets act a play called st helena or the death of napoleon  it began by the disclosure of napoleon with an immense head seated on a sofa in his chamber at st helena to whom his valet entered with this obscure announcement  sir yew ud se on low the ow as in cow  sir hudson that you could have seen his regimentals was a perfect mammoth of a man to napoleon hideously ugly with a monstrously disproportionate face and a great clump for the lower jaw to express his tyrannical and obdurate nature  he began his system of persecution by calling his prisoner general buonaparte to which the latter replied with the deepest tragedy sir yew ud se on low call me not thus  repeat that phrase and leave me  i am napoleon emperor of france  sir yew ud se on nothing daunted proceeded to entertain him with an ordinance of the british government regulating the state he should preserve and the furniture of his rooms  and limiting his attendants to four or five persons  four or five for me said napoleon  me one hundred thousand men were lately at my sole command and this english officer talks of four or five for me  throughout the piece napoleon who talked very like the real napoleon and was for ever having small soliloquies by himself was very bitter on these english officers and these english soldiers to the great satisfaction of the audience who were perfectly delighted to have low bullied and who whenever low said general buonaparte which he always did  always receiving the same correction quite execrated him  it would be hard to say why for italians have little cause to sympathise with napoleon heaven knows  there was no plot at all except that a french officer disguised as an englishman came to propound a plan of escape and being discovered but not before napoleon had magnanimously refused to steal his freedom was immediately ordered off by low to be hanged in two very long speeches which low made memorable by winding up with yasto show that he was englishwhich brought down thunders of applause  napoleon was so affected by this catastrophe that he fainted away on the spot and was carried out by two other puppets  judging from what followed it would appear that he never recovered the shock for the next act showed him in a clean shirt in his bed curtains crimson and white where a lady prematurely dressed in mourning brought two little children who kneeled down by the bedside while he made a decent end the last word on his lips being vatterlo  it was unspeakably ludicrous  buonapartes boots were so wonderfully beyond control and did such marvellous things of their own accord  doubling themselves up and getting under tables and dangling in the air and sometimes skating away with him out of all human knowledge when he was in full speechmischances which were not rendered the less absurd by a settled melancholy depicted in his face  to put an end to one conference with low he had to go to a table and read a book  when it was the finest spectacle i ever beheld to see his body bending over the volume like a boot jack and his sentimental eyes glaring obstinately into the pit he was prodigiously good in bed with an immense collar to his shirt and his little hands outside the coverlet  so was dr antommarchi represented by a puppet with long lank hair like mawworms who in consequence of some derangement of his wires hovered about the couch like a vulture and gave medical opinions in the air  he was almost as good as low though the latter was great at all timesa decided brute and villain beyond all possibility of mistake  low was especially fine at the last when hearing the doctor and the valet say the emperor is dead he pulled out his watch and wound up the piece not the watch by exclaiming with characteristic brutality ha ha  eleven minutes to six  the general dead and the spy hanged  this brought the curtain down triumphantly   there is not in italy they say and i believe them a lovelier residence than the palazzo peschiere or palace of the fishponds whither we removed as soon as our three months tenancy of the pink jail at albaro had ceased and determined  it stands on a height within the walls of genoa but aloof from the town  surrounded by beautiful gardens of its own adorned with statues vases fountains marble basins terraces walks of orangetrees and lemontrees groves of roses and camellias  all its apartments are beautiful in their proportions and decorations but the great hall some fifty feet in height with three large windows at the end overlooking the whole town of genoa the harbour and the neighbouring sea affords one of the most fascinating and delightful prospects in the world  any house more cheerful and habitable than the great rooms are within it would be difficult to conceive and certainly nothing more delicious than the scene without in sunshine or in moonlight could be imagined it is more like an enchanted place in an eastern story than a grave and sober lodging  how you may wander on from room to room and never tire of the wild fancies on the walls and ceilings as bright in their fresh colouring as if they had been painted yesterday or how one floor or even the great hall which opens on eight other rooms is a spacious promenade or how there are corridors and bedchambers above which we never use and rarely visit and scarcely know the way through or how there is a view of a perfectly different character on each of the four sides of the building matters little  but that prospect from the hall is like a vision to me  i go back to it in fancy as i have done in calm reality a hundred times a day and stand there looking out with the sweet scents from the garden rising up about me in a perfect dream of happiness  there lies all genoa in beautiful confusion with its many churches monasteries and convents pointing up into the sunny sky and down below me just where the roofs begin a solitary convent parapet fashioned like a gallery with an iron across at the end where sometimes early in the morning i have seen a little group of darkveiled nuns gliding sorrowfully to and fro and stopping now and then to peep down upon the waking world in which they have no part  old monte faccio brightest of hills in good weather but sulkiest when storms are coming on is here upon the left  the fort within the walls the good king built it to command the town and beat the houses of the genoese about their ears in case they should be discontented commands that height upon the right  the broad sea lies beyond in front there and that line of coast beginning by the lighthouse and tapering away a mere speck in the rosy distance is the beautiful coast road that leads to nice  the garden near at hand among the roofs and houses  all red with roses and fresh with little fountains  is the acqua sola a public promenade where the military band plays gaily and the white veils cluster thick and the genoese nobility ride round and round and round in stateclothes and coaches at least if not in absolute wisdom  within a stonesthrow as it seems the audience of the day theatre sit  their faces turned this way  but as the stage is hidden it is very odd without a knowledge of the cause to see their faces changed so suddenly from earnestness to laughter and odder still to hear the rounds upon rounds of applause rattling in the evening air to which the curtain falls but being sunday night they act their best and most attractive play  and now the sun is going down in such magnificent array of red and green and golden light as neither pen nor pencil could depict and to the ringing of the vesper bells darkness sets in at once without a twilight  then lights begin to shine in genoa and on the country road and the revolving lanthorn out at sea there flashing for an instant on this palace front and portico illuminates it as if there were a bright moon bursting from behind a cloud then merges it in deep obscurity  and this so far as i know is the only reason why the genoese avoid it after dark and think it haunted  my memory will haunt it many nights in time to come but nothing worse i will engage  the same ghost will occasionally sail away as i did one pleasant autumn evening into the bright prospect and sniff the morning air at marseilles  the corpulent hairdresser was still sitting in his slippers outside his shopdoor there but the twirling ladies in the window with the natural inconstancy of their sex had ceased to twirl and were languishing stock still with their beautiful faces addressed to blind corners of the establishment where it was impossible for admirers to penetrate  the steamer had come from genoa in a delicious run of eighteen hours and we were going to run back again by the cornice road from nice  not being satisfied to have seen only the outsides of the beautiful towns that rise in picturesque white clusters from among the olive woods and rocks and hills upon the margin of the sea  the boat which started for nice that night at eight oclock was very small and so crowded with goods that there was scarcely room to move neither was there anything to cat on board except bread nor to drink except coffee  but being due at nice at about eight or so in the morning this was of no consequence so when we began to wink at the bright stars in involuntary acknowledgment of their winking at us we turned into our berths in a crowded but cool little cabin and slept soundly till morning  the boat being as dull and dogged a little boat as ever was built it was within an hour of noon when we turned into nice harbour where we very little expected anything but breakfast  but we were laden with wool  wool must not remain in the customhouse at marseilles more than twelve months at a stretch without paying duty  it is the custom to make fictitious removals of unsold wool to evade this law to take it somewhere when the twelve months are nearly out bring it straight back again and warehouse it as a new cargo for nearly twelve months longer  this wool of ours had come originally from some place in the east  it was recognised as eastern produce the moment we entered the harbour  accordingly the gay little sunday boats full of holiday people which had come off to greet us were warned away by the authorities we were declared in quarantine and a great flag was solemnly run up to the masthead on the wharf to make it known to all the town  it was a very hot day indeed  we were unshaved unwashed undressed unfed and could hardly enjoy the absurdity of lying blistering in a lazy harbour with the town looking on from a respectful distance all manner of whiskered men in cocked hats discussing our fate at a remote guardhouse with gestures we looked very hard at them through telescopes expressive of a weeks detention at least  and nothing whatever the matter all the time but even in this crisis the brave courier achieved a triumph  he telegraphed somebody i saw nobody either naturally connected with the hotel or put en rapport with the establishment for that occasion only  the telegraph was answered and in half an hour or less there came a loud shout from the guardhouse  the captain was wanted  everybody helped the captain into his boat  everybody got his luggage and said we were going  the captain rowed away and disappeared behind a little jutting corner of the galley slaves prison  and presently came back with something very sulkily  the brave courier met him at the side and received the something as its rightful owner  it was a wicker basket folded in a linen cloth and in it were two great bottles of wine a roast fowl some salt fish chopped with garlic a great loaf of bread a dozen or so of peaches and a few other trifles  when we had selected our own breakfast the brave courier invited a chosen party to partake of these refreshments and assured them that they need not be deterred by motives of delicacy as he would order a second basket to be furnished at their expense  which he didno one knew howand byandby the captain being again summoned again sulkily returned with another something over which my popular attendant presided as before  carving with a claspknife his own personal property something smaller than a roman sword  the whole party on board were made merry by these unexpected supplies but none more so than a loquacious little frenchman who got drunk in five minutes and a sturdy cappuccino friar who had taken everybodys fancy mightily and was one of the best friars in the world i verily believe  he had a free open countenance and a rich brown flowing beard and was a remarkably handsome man of about fifty  he had come up to us early in the morning and inquired whether we were sure to be at nice by eleven saying that he particularly wanted to know because if we reached it by that time he would have to perform mass and must deal with the consecrated wafer fasting whereas if there were no chance of his being in time he would immediately breakfast  he made this communication under the idea that the brave courier was the captain and indeed he looked much more like it than anybody else on board  being assured that we should arrive in good time he fasted and talked fasting to everybody with the most charming good humour answering jokes at the expense of friars with other jokes at the expense of laymen and saying that friar as he was he would engage to take up the two strongest men on board one after the other with his teeth and carry them along the deck  nobody gave him the opportunity but i dare say he could have done it for he was a gallant noble figure of a man even in the cappuccino dress which is the ugliest and most ungainly that can well be  all this had given great delight to the loquacious frenchman who gradually patronised the friar very much and seemed to commiserate him as one who might have been born a frenchman himself but for an unfortunate destiny  although his patronage was such as a mouse might bestow upon a lion he had a vast opinion of its condescension and in the warmth of that sentiment occasionally rose on tiptoe to slap the friar on the back  when the baskets arrived  it being then too late for mass  the friar went to work bravely  eating prodigiously of the cold meat and bread drinking deep draughts of the wine smoking cigars taking snuff sustaining an uninterrupted conversation with all hands and occasionally running to the boats side and hailing somebody on shore with the intelligence that we must be got out of this quarantine somehow or other as he had to take part in a great religious procession in the afternoon  after this he would come back laughing lustily from pure good humour  while the frenchman wrinkled his small face into ten thousand creases and said how droll it was and what a brave boy was that friar  at length the heat of the sun without and the wine within made the frenchman sleepy  so in the noontide of his patronage of his gigantic protege he lay down among the wool and began to snore  it was four oclock before we were released and the frenchman dirty and woolly and snuffy was still sleeping when the friar went ashore  as soon as we were free we all hurried away to wash and dress that we might make a decent appearance at the procession and i saw no more of the frenchman until we took up our station in the main street to see it pass when he squeezed himself into a front place elaborately renovated threw back his little coat to show a broadbarred velvet waistcoat sprinkled all over with stars then adjusted himself and his cane so as utterly to bewilder and transfix the friar when he should appear  the procession was a very long one and included an immense number of people divided into small parties each party chanting nasally on its own account without reference to any other and producing a most dismal result  there were angels crosses virgins carried on flat boards surrounded by cupids crowns saints missals infantry tapers monks nuns relics dignitaries of the church in green hats walking under crimson parasols  and here and there a species of sacred streetlamp hoisted on a pole  we looked out anxiously for the cappuccini and presently their brown robes and corded girdles were seen coming on in a body  i observed the little frenchman chuckle over the idea that when the friar saw him in the broadbarred waistcoat he would mentally exclaim is that my patron  that distinguished man and would be covered with confusion  ah never was the frenchman so deceived as our friend the cappuccino advanced with folded arms he looked straight into the visage of the little frenchman with a bland serene composed abstraction not to be described  there was not the faintest trace of recognition or amusement on his features not the smallest consciousness of bread and meat wine snuff or cigars  cest luimeme i heard the little frenchman say in some doubt  oh yes it was himself  it was not his brother or his nephew very like him  it was he  he walked in great state being one of the superiors of the order  and looked his part to admiration  there never was anything so perfect of its kind as the contemplative way in which he allowed his placid gaze to rest on us his late companions as if he had never seen us in his life and didnt see us then  the frenchman quite humbled took off his hat at last but the friar still passed on with the same imperturbable serenity and the broadbarred waistcoat fading into the crowd was seen no more  the procession wound up with a discharge of musketry that shook all the windows in the town  next afternoon we started for genoa by the famed cornice road  the halffrench halfitalian vetturino who undertook with his little rattling carriage and pair to convey us thither in three days was a careless goodlooking fellow whose lightheartedness and singing propensities knew no bounds as long as we went on smoothly  so long he had a word and a smile and a flick of his whip for all the peasant girls and odds and ends of the sonnambula for all the echoes  so long he went jingling through every little village with bells on his horses and rings in his ears  a very meteor of gallantry and cheerfulness  but it was highly characteristic to see him under a slight reverse of circumstances when in one part of the journey we came to a narrow place where a waggon had broken down and stopped up the road  his hands were twined in his hair immediately as if a combination of all the direst accidents in life had suddenly fallen on his devoted head  he swore in french prayed in italian and went up and down beating his feet on the ground in a very ecstasy of despair  there were various carters and muledrivers assembled round the broken waggon and at last some man of an original turn of mind proposed that a general and joint effort should be made to get things torights again and clear the wayan idea which i verily believe would never have presented itself to our friend though we had remained there until now  it was done at no great cost of labour but at every pause in the doing his hands were wound in his hair again as if there were no ray of hope to lighten his misery  the moment he was on his box once more and clattering briskly down hill he returned to the sonnambula and the peasant girls as if it were not in the power of misfortune to depress him  much of the romance of the beautiful towns and villages on this beautiful road disappears when they are entered for many of them are very miserable  the streets are narrow dark and dirty the inhabitants lean and squalid and the withered old women with their wiry grey hair twisted up into a knot on the top of the head like a pad to carry loads on are so intensely ugly both along the riviera and in genoa too that seen straggling about in dim doorways with their spindles or crooning together in bycorners they are like a population of witchesexcept that they certainly are not to be suspected of brooms or any other instrument of cleanliness  neither are the pigskins in common use to hold wine and hung out in the sun in all directions by any means ornamental as they always preserve the form of very bloated pigs with their heads and legs cut off dangling upsidedown by their own tails  these towns as they are seen in the approach however  nestling with their clustering roofs and towers among trees on steep hill sides or built upon the brink of noble bays  are charming  the vegetation is everywhere luxuriant and beautiful and the palm tree makes a novel feature in the novel scenery  in one town san remoa most extraordinary place built on gloomy open arches so that one might ramble underneath the whole townthere are pretty terrace gardens in other towns there is the clang of shipwrights hammers and the building of small vessels on the beach  in some of the broad bays the fleets of europe might ride at anchor  in every case each little group of houses presents in the distance some enchanting confusion of picturesque and fanciful shapes  the road itselfnow high above the glittering sea which breaks against the foot of the precipice  now turning inland to sweep the shore of a bay  now crossing the stony bed of a mountain stream now low down on the beach  now winding among riven rocks of many forms and colours  now chequered by a solitary ruined tower one of a chain of towers built in old time to protect the coast from the invasions of the barbary corsairspresents new beauties every moment  when its own striking scenery is passed and it trails on through a long line of suburb lying on the flat seashore to genoa then the changing glimpses of that noble city and its harbour awaken a new source of interest freshened by every huge unwieldy halfinhabited old house in its outskirts  and coming to its climax when the city gate is reached and all genoa with its beautiful harbour and neighbouring hills bursts proudly on the view    chapter vto parma modena and bologna    i strolled away from genoa on the 6th of november bound for a good many places england among them but first for piacenza for which town i started in the coupe of a machine something like a travelling caravan in company with the brave courier and a lady with a large dog who howled dolefully at intervals all night it was very wet and very cold very dark and very dismal we travelled at the rate of barely four miles an hour and stopped nowhere for refreshment  at ten oclock next morning we changed coaches at alessandria where we were packed up in another coach the body whereof would have been small for a fly in company with a very old priest a young jesuit his companionwho carried their breviaries and other books and who in the exertion of getting into the coach had made a gash of pink leg between his black stocking and his black kneeshorts that reminded one of hamlet in ophelias closet only it was visible on both legsa provincial avvocato and a gentleman with a red nose that had an uncommon and singular sheen upon it which i never observed in the human subject before  in this way we travelled on until four oclock in the afternoon the roads being still very heavy and the coach very slow  to mend the matter the old priest was troubled with cramps in his legs so that he had to give a terrible yell every ten minutes or so and be hoisted out by the united efforts of the company the coach always stopping for him with great gravity this disorder and the roads formed the main subject of conversation  finding in the afternoon that the coupe had discharged two people and had only one passenger insidea monstrous ugly tuscan with a great purple moustache of which no man could see the ends when he had his hat oni took advantage of its better accommodation and in company with this gentleman who was very conversational and goodhumoured travelled on until nearly eleven oclock at night when the driver reported that he couldnt think of going any farther and we accordingly made a halt at a place called stradella  the inn was a series of strange galleries surrounding a yard where our coach and a waggon or two and a lot of fowls and firewood were all heaped up together higgledypiggledy so that you didnt know and couldnt have taken your oath which was a fowl and which was a cart  we followed a sleepy man with a flaring torch into a great cold room where there were two immensely broad beds on what looked like two immensely broad deal diningtables another deal table of similar dimensions in the middle of the bare floor four windows and two chairs  somebody said it was my room and i walked up and down it for half an hour or so staring at the tuscan the old priest the young priest and the avvocato red nose lived in the town and had gone home who sat upon their beds and stared at me in return  the rather dreary whimsicality of this stage of the proceedings is interrupted by an announcement from the brave he had been cooking that supper is ready and to the priests chamber the next room and the counterpart of mine we all adjourn  the first dish is a cabbage boiled with a great quantity of rice in a tureen full of water and flavoured with cheese  it is so hot and we are so cold that it appears almost jolly  the second dish is some little bits of pork fried with pigs kidneys  the third two red fowls the fourth two little red turkeys  the fifth a huge stew of garlic and truffles and i dont know what else and this concludes the entertainment  before i can sit down in my own chamber and think it of the dampest the door opens and the brave comes moving in in the middle of such a quantity of fuel that he looks like birnam wood taking a winter walk  he kindles this heap in a twinkling and produces a jorum of hot brandy and water for that bottle of his keeps company with the seasons and now holds nothing but the purest eau de vie  when he has accomplished this feat he retires for the night and i hear him for an hour afterwards and indeed until i fall asleep making jokes in some outhouse apparently under the pillow where he is smoking cigars with a party of confidential friends  he never was in the house in his life before but he knows everybody everywhere before he has been anywhere five minutes and is certain to have attracted to himself in the meantime the enthusiastic devotion of the whole establishment  this is at twelve oclock at night  at four oclock next morning he is up again fresher than a fullblown rose making blazing fires without the least authority from the landlord producing mugs of scalding coffee when nobody else can get anything but cold water and going out into the dark streets and roaring for fresh milk on the chance of somebody with a cow getting up to supply it while the horses are coming i stumble out into the town too  it seems to be all one little piazza with a cold damp wind blowing in and out of the arches alternately in a sort of pattern  but it is profoundly dark and raining heavily and i shouldnt know it tomorrow if i were taken there to try  which heaven forbid  the horses arrive in about an hour  in the interval the driver swears sometimes christian oaths sometimes pagan oaths sometimes when it is a long compound oath he begins with christianity and merges into paganism  various messengers are despatched not so much after the horses as after each other for the first messenger never comes back and all the rest imitate him at length the horses appear surrounded by all the messengers some kicking them and some dragging them and all shouting abuse to them  then the old priest the young priest the avvocato the tuscan and all of us take our places and sleepy voices proceeding from the doors of extraordinary hutches in divers parts of the yard cry out addio corriere mio  buon viaggio corriere  salutations which the courier with his face one monstrous grin returns in like manner as we go jolting and wallowing away through the mud  at piacenza which was four or five hours journey from the inn at stradella we broke up our little company before the hotel door with divers manifestations of friendly feeling on all sides  the old priest was taken with the cramp again before he had got half way down the street and the young priest laid the bundle of books on a doorstep while he dutifully rubbed the old gentlemans legs the client of the avvocato was waiting for him at the yardgate and kissed him on each cheek with such a resounding smack that i am afraid he had either a very bad case or a scantilyfurnished purse  the tuscan with a cigar in his mouth went loitering off carrying his hat in his hand that he might the better trail up the ends of his dishevelled moustache  and the brave courier as he and i strolled away to look about us began immediately to entertain me with the private histories and family affairs of the whole party  a brown decayed old town piacenza is  a deserted solitary grassgrown place with ruined ramparts half filledup trenches which afford a frowsy pasturage to the lean kine that wander about them and streets of stern houses moodily frowning at the other houses over the way  the sleepiest and shabbiest of soldiery go wandering about with the double curse of laziness and poverty uncouthly wrinkling their misfitting regimentals the dirtiest of children play with their impromptu toys pigs and mud in the feeblest of gutters and the gauntest of dogs trot in and out of the dullest of archways in perpetual search of something to eat which they never seem to find  a mysterious and solemn palace guarded by two colossal statues twin genii of the place stands gravely in the midst of the idle town and the king with the marble legs who flourished in the time of the thousand and one nights might live contentedly inside of it and never have the energy in his upper half of flesh and blood to want to come out  what a strange halfsorrowful and halfdelicious doze it is to ramble through these places gone to sleep and basking in the sun each in its turn appears to be of all the mouldy dreary god forgotten towns in the wide world the chief  sitting on this hillock where a bastion used to be and where a noisy fortress was in the time of the old roman station here i became aware that i have never known till now what it is to be lazy  a dormouse must surely be in very much the same condition before he retires under the wool in his cage or a tortoise before he buries himself  i feel that i am getting rusty  that any attempt to think would be accompanied with a creaking noise  that there is nothing anywhere to be done or needing to be done  that there is no more human progress motion effort or advancement of any kind beyond this  that the whole scheme stopped here centuries ago and laid down to rest until the day of judgment  never while the brave courier lives  behold him jingling out of piacenza and staggering this way in the tallest postingchaise ever seen so that he looks out of the front window as if he were peeping over a garden wall while the postilion concentrated essence of all the shabbiness of italy pauses for a moment in his animated conversation to touch his hat to a bluntnosed little virgin hardly less shabby than himself enshrined in a plaster punchs show outside the town  in genoa and thereabouts they train the vines on trelliswork supported on square clumsy pillars which in themselves are anything but picturesque  but here they twine them around trees and let them trail among the hedges and the vineyards are full of trees regularly planted for this purpose each with its own vine twining and clustering about it  their leaves are now of the brightest gold and deepest red and never was anything so enchantingly graceful and full of beauty  through miles of these delightful forms and colours the road winds its way  the wild festoons the elegant wreaths and crowns and garlands of all shapes the fairy nets flung over great trees and making them prisoners in sport the tumbled heaps and mounds of exquisite shapes upon the ground how rich and beautiful they are  and every now and then a long long line of trees will be all bound and garlanded together  as if they had taken hold of one another and were coming dancing down the field  parma has cheerful stirring streets for an italian town and consequently is not so characteristic as many places of less note always excepting the retired piazza where the cathedral baptistery and campanileancient buildings of a sombre brown embellished with innumerable grotesque monsters and dreamylooking creatures carved in marble and red stoneare clustered in a noble and magnificent repose  their silent presence was only invaded when i saw them by the twittering of the many birds that were flying in and out of the crevices in the stones and little nooks in the architecture where they had made their nests  they were busy rising from the cold shade of temples made with hands into the sunny air of heaven  not so the worshippers within who were listening to the same drowsy chaunt or kneeling before the same kinds of images and tapers or whispering with their heads bowed down in the selfsame dark confessionals as i had left in genoa and everywhere else  the decayed and mutilated paintings with which this church is covered have to my thinking a remarkably mournful and depressing influence  it is miserable to see great works of artsomething of the souls of paintersperishing and fading away like human forms this cathedral is odorous with the rotting of correggios frescoes in the cupola  heaven knows how beautiful they may have been at one time  connoisseurs fall into raptures with them now but such a labyrinth of arms and legs  such heaps of foreshortened limbs entangled and involved and jumbled together  no operative surgeon gone mad could imagine in his wildest delirium  there is a very interesting subterranean church here  the roof supported by marble pillars behind each of which there seemed to be at least one beggar in ambush  to say nothing of the tombs and secluded altars  from every one of these lurkingplaces such crowds of phantomlooking men and women leading other men and women with twisted limbs or chattering jaws or paralytic gestures or idiotic heads or some other sad infirmity came hobbling out to beg that if the ruined frescoes in the cathedral above had been suddenly animated and had retired to this lower church they could hardly have made a greater confusion or exhibited a more confounding display of arms and legs  there is petrarchs monument too and there is the baptistery with its beautiful arches and immense font and there is a gallery containing some very remarkable pictures whereof a few were being copied by hairyfaced artists with little velvet caps more off their heads than on  there is the farnese palace too and in it one of the dreariest spectacles of decay that ever was seena grand old gloomy theatre mouldering away  it is a large wooden structure of the horseshoe shape the lower seats arranged upon the roman plan but above them great heavy chambers rather than boxes where the nobles sat remote in their proud state  such desolation as has fallen on this theatre enhanced in the spectators fancy by its gay intention and design none but worms can be familiar with  a hundred and ten years have passed since any play was acted here  the sky shines in through the gashes in the roof the boxes are dropping down wasting away and only tenanted by rats damp and mildew smear the faded colours and make spectral maps upon the panels lean rags are dangling down where there were gay festoons on the proscenium the stage has rotted so that a narrow wooden gallery is thrown across it or it would sink beneath the tread and bury the visitor in the gloomy depth beneath  the desolation and decay impress themselves on all the senses  the air has a mouldering smell and an earthy taste any stray outer sounds that straggle in with some lost sunbeam are muffled and heavy and the worm the maggot and the rot have changed the surface of the wood beneath the touch as time will seam and roughen a smooth hand  if ever ghosts act plays they act them on this ghostly stage  it was most delicious weather when we came into modena where the darkness of the sombre colonnades over the footways skirting the main street on either side was made refreshing and agreeable by the bright sky so wonderfully blue  i passed from all the glory of the day into a dim cathedral where high mass was performing feeble tapers were burning people were kneeling in all directions before all manner of shrines and officiating priests were crooning the usual chant in the usual low dull drawling melancholy tone  thinking how strange it was to find in every stagnant town this same heart beating with the same monotonous pulsation the centre of the same torpid listless system i came out by another door and was suddenly scared to death by a blast from the shrillest trumpet that ever was blown  immediately came tearing round the corner an equestrian company from paris  marshalling themselves under the walls of the church and flouting with their horses heels the griffins lions tigers and other monsters in stone and marble decorating its exterior  first there came a stately nobleman with a great deal of hair and no hat bearing an enormous banner on which was inscribed mazeppa  tonight  then a mexican chief with a great pearshaped club on his shoulder like hercules  then six or eight roman chariots  each with a beautiful lady in extremely short petticoats and unnaturally pink tights erect within  shedding beaming looks upon the crowd in which there was a latent expression of discomposure and anxiety for which i couldnt account until as the open back of each chariot presented itself i saw the immense difficulty with which the pink legs maintained their perpendicular over the uneven pavement of the town  which gave me quite a new idea of the ancient romans and britons  the procession was brought to a close by some dozen indomitable warriors of different nations riding two and two and haughtily surveying the tame population of modena among whom however they occasionally condescended to scatter largesse in the form of a few handbills  after caracolling among the lions and tigers and proclaiming that evenings entertainments with blast of trumpet it then filed off by the other end of the square and left a new and greatly increased dulness behind  when the procession had so entirely passed away that the shrill trumpet was mild in the distance and the tail of the last horse was hopelessly round the corner the people who had come out of the church to stare at it went back again  but one old lady kneeling on the pavement within near the door had seen it all and had been immensely interested without getting up and this old ladys eye at that juncture i happened to catch  to our mutual confusion  she cut our embarrassment very short however by crossing herself devoutly and going down at full length on her face before a figure in a fancy petticoat and a gilt crown which was so like one of the processionfigures that perhaps at this hour she may think the whole appearance a celestial vision anyhow i must certainly have forgiven her her interest in the circus though i had been her father confessor  there was a little fieryeyed old man with a crooked shoulder in the cathedral who took it very ill that i made no effort to see the bucket kept in an old tower which the people of modena took away from the people of bologna in the fourteenth century and about which there was war made and a mockheroic poem by tassone too  being quite content however to look at the outside of the tower and feast in imagination on the bucket within and preferring to loiter in the shade of the tall campanile and about the cathedral i have no personal knowledge of this bucket even at the present time  indeed we were at bologna before the little old man or the guidebook would have considered that we had half done justice to the wonders of modena  but it is such a delight to me to leave new scenes behind and still go on encountering newer scenesand moreover i have such a perverse disposition in respect of sights that are cut and dried and dictatedthat i fear i sin against similar authorities in every place i visit  be this as it may in the pleasant cemetery at bologna i found myself walking next sunday morning among the stately marble tombs and colonnades in company with a crowd of peasants and escorted by a little cicerone of that town who was excessively anxious for the honour of the place and most solicitous to divert my attention from the bad monuments  whereas he was never tired of extolling the good ones  seeing this little man a goodhumoured little man he was who seemed to have nothing in his face but shining teeth and eyes looking wistfully at a certain plot of grass i asked him who was buried there  the poor people signore he said with a shrug and a smile and stopping to look back at mefor he always went on a little before and took off his hat to introduce every new monument  only the poor signore  its very cheerful  its very lively  how green it is how cool  its like a meadow there are fiveholding up all the fingers of his right hand to express the number which an italian peasant will always do if it be within the compass of his ten fingersthere are five of my little children buried there signore just there a little to the right  well  thanks to god  its very cheerful  how green it is how cool it is  its quite a meadow  he looked me very hard in the face and seeing i was sorry for him took a pinch of snuff every cicerone takes snuff and made a little bow partly in deprecation of his having alluded to such a subject and partly in memory of the children and of his favourite saint  it was as unaffected and as perfectly natural a little bow as ever man made  immediately afterwards he took his hat off altogether and begged to introduce me to the next monument and his eyes and his teeth shone brighter than before    chapter vithrough bologna and ferrara    there was such a very smart official in attendance at the cemetery where the little cicerone had buried his children that when the little cicerone suggested to me in a whisper that there would be no offence in presenting this officer in return for some slight extra service with a couple of pauls about tenpence english money i looked incredulously at his cocked hat washleather gloves wellmade uniform and dazzling buttons and rebuked the little cicerone with a grave shake of the head  for in splendour of appearance he was at least equal to the deputy usher of the black rod and the idea of his carrying as jeremy diddler would say such a thing as tenpence away with him seemed monstrous he took it in excellent part however when i made bold to give it him and pulled off his cocked hat with a flourish that would have been a bargain at double the money  it seemed to be his duty to describe the monuments to the people at all events he was doing so and when i compared him like gulliver in brobdingnag with the institutions of my own beloved country i could not refrain from tears of pride and exultation he had no pace at all no more than a tortoise  he loitered as the people loitered that they might gratify their curiosity and positively allowed them now and then to read the inscriptions on the tombs  he was neither shabby nor insolent nor churlish nor ignorant  he spoke his own language with perfect propriety and seemed to consider himself in his way a kind of teacher of the people and to entertain a just respect both for himself and them they would no more have such a man for a verger in westminster abbey than they would let the people in as they do at bologna to see the monuments for nothing 2  again an ancient sombre town under the brilliant sky with heavy arcades over the footways of the older streets and lighter and more cheerful archways in the newer portions of the town  again brown piles of sacred buildings with more birds flying in and out of chinks in the stones and more snarling monsters for the bases of the pillars  again rich churches drowsy masses curling incense tinkling bells priests in bright vestments  pictures tapers laced altar cloths crosses images and artificial flowers  there is a grave and learned air about the city and a pleasant gloom upon it that would leave it a distinct and separate impression in the mind among a crowd of cities though it were not still further marked in the travellers remembrance by the two brick leaning towers sufficiently unsightly in themselves it must be acknowledged inclining crosswise as if they were bowing stiffly to each othera most extraordinary termination to the perspective of some of the narrow streets  the colleges and churches too and palaces  and above all the academy of fine arts where there are a host of interesting pictures especially by guido domenichino and ludovico caracci  give it a place of its own in the memory  even though these were not and there were nothing else to remember it by the great meridian on the pavement of the church of san petronio where the sunbeams mark the time among the kneeling people would give it a fanciful and pleasant interest  bologna being very full of tourists detained there by an inundation which rendered the road to florence impassable i was quartered up at the top of an hotel in an outoftheway room which i never could find  containing a bed big enough for a boardingschool which i couldnt fall asleep in  the chief among the waiters who visited this lonely retreat where there was no other company but the swallows in the broad eaves over the window was a man of one idea in connection with the english and the subject of this harmless monomania was lord byron  i made the discovery by accidentally remarking to him at breakfast that the matting with which the floor was covered was very comfortable at that season when he immediately replied that milor beeron had been much attached to that kind of matting  observing at the same moment that i took no milk he exclaimed with enthusiasm that milor beeron had never touched it  at first i took it for granted in my innocence that he had been one of the beeron servants but no he said no he was in the habit of speaking about my lord to english gentlemen that was all  he knew all about him he said  in proof of it he connected him with every possible topic from the monte pulciano wine at dinner which was grown on an estate he had owned to the big bed itself which was the very model of his  when i left the inn he coupled with his final bow in the yard a parting assurance that the road by which i was going had been milor beerons favourite ride and before the horses feet had well begun to clatter on the pavement he ran briskly upstairs again i dare say to tell some other englishman in some other solitary room that the guest who had just departed was lord beerons living image  i had entered bologna by nightalmost midnightand all along the road thither after our entrance into the papal territory  which is not in any part supremely well governed saint peters keys being rather rusty now the driver had so worried about the danger of robbers in travelling after dark and had so infected the brave courier and the two had been so constantly stopping and getting up and down to look after a portmanteau which was tied on behind that i should have felt almost obliged to any one who would have had the goodness to take it away  hence it was stipulated that whenever we left bologna we should start so as not to arrive at ferrara later than eight at night and a delightful afternoon and evening journey it was albeit through a flat district which gradually became more marshy from the overflow of brooks and rivers in the recent heavy rains  at sunset when i was walking on alone while the horses rested i arrived upon a little scene which by one of those singular mental operations of which we are all conscious seemed perfectly familiar to me and which i see distinctly now  there was not much in it in the blood red light there was a mournful sheet of water just stirred by the evening wind upon its margin a few trees  in the foreground was a group of silent peasant girls leaning over the parapet of a little bridge and looking now up at the sky now down into the water in the distance a deep bell the shade of approaching night on everything  if i had been murdered there in some former life i could not have seemed to remember the place more thoroughly or with a more emphatic chilling of the blood and the mere remembrance of it acquired in that minute is so strengthened by the imaginary recollection that i hardly think i could forget it  more solitary more depopulated more deserted old ferrara than any city of the solemn brotherhood  the grass so grows up in the silent streets that any one might make hay there literally while the sun shines  but the sun shines with diminished cheerfulness in grim ferrara and the people are so few who pass and repass through the places that the flesh of its inhabitants might be grass indeed and growing in the squares  i wonder why the head coppersmith in an italian town always lives next door to the hotel or opposite  making the visitor feel as if the beating hammers were his own heart palpitating with a deadly energy  i wonder why jealous corridors surround the bedroom on all sides and fill it with unnecessary doors that cant be shut and will not open and abut on pitchy darkness  i wonder why it is not enough that these distrustful genii stand agape at ones dreams all night but there must also be round open portholes high in the wall suggestive when a mouse or rat is heard behind the wainscot of a somebody scraping the wall with his toes in his endeavours to reach one of these portholes and look in  i wonder why the faggots are so constructed as to know of no effect but an agony of heat when they are lighted and replenished and an agony of cold and suffocation at all other times  i wonder above all why it is the great feature of domestic architecture in italian inns that all the fire goes up the chimney except the smoke  the answer matters little  coppersmiths doors portholes smoke and faggots are welcome to me  give me the smiling face of the attendant man or woman the courteous manner the amiable desire to please and to be pleased the lighthearted pleasant simple airso many jewels set in dirtand i am theirs again tomorrow  ariostos house tassos prison a rare old gothic cathedral and more churches of course are the sights of ferrara  but the long silent streets and the dismantled palaces where ivy waves in lieu of banners and where rank weeds are slowly creeping up the long untrodden stairs are the best sights of all  the aspect of this dreary town half an hour before sunrise one fine morning when i left it was as picturesque as it seemed unreal and spectral  it was no matter that the people were not yet out of bed for if they had all been up and busy they would have made but little difference in that desert of a place  it was best to see it without a single figure in the picture a city of the dead without one solitary survivor  pestilence might have ravaged streets squares and marketplaces and sack and siege have ruined the old houses battered down their doors and windows and made breaches in their roofs  in one part a great tower rose into the air the only landmark in the melancholy view  in another a prodigious castle with a moat about it stood aloof  a sullen city in itself  in the black dungeons of this castle parisina and her lover were beheaded in the dead of night  the red light beginning to shine when i looked back upon it stained its walls without as they have many a time been stained within in old days but for any sign of life they gave the castle and the city might have been avoided by all human creatures from the moment when the axe went down upon the last of the two lovers  and might have never vibrated to another sound   beyond the blow that to the block pierced through with forced and sullen shock   coming to the po which was greatly swollen and running fiercely we crossed it by a floating bridge of boats and so came into the austrian territory and resumed our journey  through a country of which for some miles a great part was under water  the brave courier and the soldiery had first quarrelled for half an hour or more over our eternal passport  but this was a daily relaxation with the brave who was always stricken deaf when shabby functionaries in uniform came as they constantly did come plunging out of wooden boxes to look at itor in other words to begand who stone deaf to my entreaties that the man might have a trifle given him and we resume our journey in peace was wont to sit reviling the functionary in broken english  while the unfortunate mans face was a portrait of mental agony framed in the coach window from his perfect ignorance of what was being said to his disparagement  there was a postilion in the course of this days journey as wild and savagely goodlooking a vagabond as you would desire to see he was a tall stoutmade darkcomplexioned fellow with a profusion of shaggy black hair hanging all over his face and great black whiskers stretching down his throat  his dress was a torn suit of rifle green garnished here and there with red a steeple crowned hat innocent of nap with a broken and bedraggled feather stuck in the band and a flaming red neckerchief hanging on his shoulders  he was not in the saddle but reposed quite at his ease on a sort of low footboard in front of the postchaise down amongst the horses tailsconvenient for having his brains kicked out at any moment  to this brigand the brave courier when we were at a reasonable trot happened to suggest the practicability of going faster  he received the proposal with a perfect yell of derision brandished his whip about his head such a whip it was more like a homemade bow flung up his heels much higher than the horses and disappeared in a paroxysm somewhere in the neighbourhood of the axletree  i fully expected to see him lying in the road a hundred yards behind but up came the steeple crowned hat again next minute and he was seen reposing as on a sofa entertaining himself with the idea and crying ha ha what next  oh the devil  faster too  shoohoooo  this last ejaculation an inexpressibly defiant hoot  being anxious to reach our immediate destination that night i ventured byandby to repeat the experiment on my own account  it produced exactly the same effect  round flew the whip with the same scornful flourish up came the heels down went the steeplecrowned hat and presently he reappeared reposing as before and saying to himself ha ha what next  faster too  oh the devil  shoohoooo    chapter viian italian dream    i had been travelling for some days resting very little in the night and never in the day  the rapid and unbroken succession of novelties that had passed before me came back like halfformed dreams and a crowd of objects wandered in the greatest confusion through my mind as i travelled on by a solitary road  at intervals some one among them would stop as it were in its restless flitting to and fro and enable me to look at it quite steadily and behold it in full distinctness  after a few moments it would dissolve like a view in a magiclantern and while i saw some part of it quite plainly and some faintly and some not at all would show me another of the many places i had lately seen lingering behind it and coming through it  this was no sooner visible than in its turn it melted into something else  at one moment i was standing again before the brown old rugged churches of modena  as i recognised the curious pillars with grim monsters for their bases i seemed to see them standing by themselves in the quiet square at padua where there were the staid old university and the figures demurely gowned grouped here and there in the open space about it  then i was strolling in the outskirts of that pleasant city admiring the unusual neatness of the dwellinghouses gardens and orchards as i had seen them a few hours before  in their stead arose immediately the two towers of bologna and the most obstinate of all these objects failed to hold its ground a minute before the monstrous moated castle of ferrara which like an illustration to a wild romance came back again in the red sunrise lording it over the solitary grassgrown withered town  in short i had that incoherent but delightful jumble in my brain which travellers are apt to have and are indolently willing to encourage  every shake of the coach in which i sat half dozing in the dark appeared to jerk some new recollection out of its place and to jerk some other new recollection into it and in this state i fell asleep  i was awakened after some time as i thought by the stopping of the coach  it was now quite night and we were at the waterside there lay here a black boat with a little house or cabin in it of the same mournful colour  when i had taken my seat in this the boat was paddled by two men towards a great light lying in the distance on the sea  ever and again there was a dismal sigh of wind  it ruffled the water and rocked the boat and sent the dark clouds flying before the stars  i could not but think how strange it was to be floating away at that hour  leaving the land behind and going on towards this light upon the sea  it soon began to burn brighter and from being one light became a cluster of tapers twinkling and shining out of the water as the boat approached towards them by a dreamy kind of track marked out upon the sea by posts and piles  we had floated on five miles or so over the dark water when i heard it rippling in my dream against some obstruction near at hand  looking out attentively i saw through the gloom a something black and massivelike a shore but lying close and flat upon the water like a raftwhich we were gliding past  the chief of the two rowers said it was a burialplace  full of the interest and wonder which a cemetery lying out there in the lonely sea inspired i turned to gaze upon it as it should recede in our path when it was quickly shut out from my view before i knew by what or how i found that we were gliding up a streeta phantom street the houses rising on both sides from the water and the black boat gliding on beneath their windows  lights were shining from some of these casements plumbing the depth of the black stream with their reflected rays but all was profoundly silent  so we advanced into this ghostly city continuing to hold our course through narrow streets and lanes all filled and flowing with water  some of the corners where our way branched off were so acute and narrow that it seemed impossible for the long slender boat to turn them but the rowers with a low melodious cry of warning sent it skimming on without a pause  sometimes the rowers of another black boat like our own echoed the cry and slackening their speed as i thought we did ours would come flitting past us like a dark shadow  other boats of the same sombre hue were lying moored i thought to painted pillars near to dark mysterious doors that opened straight upon the water  some of these were empty in some the rowers lay asleep towards one i saw some figures coming down a gloomy archway from the interior of a palace  gaily dressed and attended by torchbearers  it was but a glimpse i had of them for a bridge so low and close upon the boat that it seemed ready to fall down and crush us  one of the many bridges that perplexed the dream  blotted them out instantly  on we went floating towards the heart of this strange placewith water all about us where never water was elsewhere clusters of houses churches heaps of stately buildings growing out of itand everywhere the same extraordinary silence presently we shot across a broad and open stream and passing as i thought before a spacious paved quay where the bright lamps with which it was illuminated showed long rows of arches and pillars of ponderous construction and great strength but as light to the eye as garlands of hoarfrost or gossamerand where for the first time i saw people walkingarrived at a flight of steps leading from the water to a large mansion where having passed through corridors and galleries innumerable i lay down to rest listening to the black boats stealing up and down below the window on the rippling water till i fell asleep  the glory of the day that broke upon me in this dream its freshness motion buoyancy its sparkles of the sun in water its clear blue sky and rustling air no waking words can tell  but from my window i looked down on boats and barks on masts sails cordage flags on groups of busy sailors working at the cargoes of these vessels on wide quays strewn with bales casks merchandise of many kinds on great ships lying near at hand in stately indolence on islands crowned with gorgeous domes and turrets  and where golden crosses glittered in the light atop of wondrous churches springing from the sea  going down upon the margin of the green sea rolling on before the door and filling all the streets i came upon a place of such surpassing beauty and such grandeur that all the rest was poor and faded in comparison with its absorbing loveliness  it was a great piazza as i thought anchored like all the rest in the deep ocean  on its broad bosom was a palace more majestic and magnificent in its old age than all the buildings of the earth in the high prime and fulness of their youth  cloisters and galleries  so light they might have been the work of fairy hands so strong that centuries had battered them in vain  wound round and round this palace and enfolded it with a cathedral gorgeous in the wild luxuriant fancies of the east  at no great distance from its porch a lofty tower standing by itself and rearing its proud head alone into the sky looked out upon the adriatic sea near to the margin of the stream were two illomened pillars of red granite one having on its top a figure with a sword and shield the other a winged lion  not far from these again a second tower  richest of the rich in all its decorations  even here where all was rich  sustained aloft a great orb gleaming with gold and deepest blue  the twelve signs painted on it and a mimic sun revolving in its course around them  while above two bronze giants hammered out the hours upon a sounding bell  an oblong square of lofty houses of the whitest stone surrounded by a light and beautiful arcade formed part of this enchanted scene and here and there gay masts for flags rose tapering from the pavement of the unsubstantial ground  i thought i entered the cathedral and went in and out among its many arches  traversing its whole extent  a grand and dreamy structure of immense proportions golden with old mosaics redolent of perfumes dim with the smoke of incense costly in treasure of precious stones and metals glittering through iron bars holy with the bodies of deceased saints rainbowhued with windows of stained glass dark with carved woods and coloured marbles obscure in its vast heights and lengthened distances shining with silver lamps and winking lights unreal fantastic solemn inconceivable throughout  i thought i entered the old palace pacing silent galleries and councilchambers where the old rulers of this mistress of the waters looked sternly out in pictures from the walls and where her highprowed galleys still victorious on canvas fought and conquered as of old  i thought i wandered through its halls of state and triumphbare and empty nowand musing on its pride and might extinct  for that was past all past  heard a voice say some tokens of its ancient rule and some consoling reasons for its downfall may be traced here yet  i dreamed that i was led on then into some jealous rooms communicating with a prison near the palace separated from it by a lofty bridge crossing a narrow street and called i dreamed the bridge of sighs  but first i passed two jagged slits in a stone wall the lions mouthsnow toothlesswhere in the distempered horror of my sleep i thought denunciations of innocent men to the old wicked council had been dropped through many a time when the night was dark  so when i saw the councilroom to which such prisoners were taken for examination and the door by which they passed out when they were condemneda door that never closed upon a man with life and hope before himmy heart appeared to die within me  it was smitten harder though when torch in hand i descended from the cheerful day into two ranges one below another of dismal awful horrible stone cells  they were quite dark  each had a loophole in its massive wall where in the old time every day a torch was placedi dreamedto light the prisoner within for half an hour  the captives by the glimmering of these brief rays had scratched and cut inscriptions in the blackened vaults  i saw them  for their labour with a rusty nails point had outlived their agony and them through many generations  one cell i saw in which no man remained for more than fourand twenty hours being marked for dead before he entered it  hard by another and a dismal one whereto at midnight the confessor camea monk brownrobed and hoodedghastly in the day and free bright air but in the midnight of that murky prison hopes extinguisher and murders herald  i had my foot upon the spot where at the same dread hour the shriven prisoner was strangled and struck my hand upon the guilty doorlowbrowed and stealthy through which the lumpish sack was carried out into a boat and rowed away and drowned where it was death to cast a net  around this dungeon stronghold and above some part of it  licking the rough walls without and smearing them with damp and slime within  stuffing dank weeds and refuse into chinks and crevices as if the very stones and bars had mouths to stop  furnishing a smooth road for the removal of the bodies of the secret victims of the statea road so ready that it went along with them and ran before them like a cruel officerflowed the same water that filled this dream of mine and made it seem one even at the time  descending from the palace by a staircase called i thought the giantsi had some imaginary recollection of an old man abdicating coming more slowly and more feebly down it when he heard the bell proclaiming his successori glided off in one of the dark boats until we came to an old arsenal guarded by four marble lions  to make my dream more monstrous and unlikely one of these had words and sentences upon its body inscribed there at an unknown time and in an unknown language so that their purport was a mystery to all men  there was little sound of hammers in this place for building ships and little work in progress for the greatness of the city was no more as i have said  indeed it seemed a very wreck found drifting on the sea a strange flag hoisted in its honourable stations and strangers standing at its helm  a splendid barge in which its ancient chief had gone forth pompously at certain periods to wed the ocean lay here i thought no more but in its place there was a tiny model made from recollection like the citys greatness and it told of what had been so are the strong and weak confounded in the dust almost as eloquently as the massive pillars arches roofs reared to overshadow stately ships that had no other shadow now upon the water or the earth  an armoury was there yet  plundered and despoiled but an armoury with a fierce standard taken from the turks drooping in the dull air of its cage  rich suits of mail worn by great warriors were hoarded there crossbows and bolts quivers full of arrows spears swords daggers maces shields and heavyheaded axes  plates of wrought steel and iron to make the gallant horse a monster cased in metal scales and one springweapon easy to be carried in the breast designed to do its office noiselessly and made for shooting men with poisoned darts  one press or case i saw full of accursed instruments of torture horribly contrived to cramp and pinch and grind and crush mens bones and tear and twist them with the torment of a thousand deaths  before it were two iron helmets with breastpieces made to close up tight and smooth upon the heads of living sufferers and fastened on to each was a small knob or anvil where the directing devil could repose his elbow at his ease and listen near the walledup ear to the lamentations and confessions of the wretch within  there was that grim resemblance in them to the human shapethey were such moulds of sweating faces pained and crampedthat it was difficult to think them empty and terrible distortions lingering within them seemed to follow me when taking to my boat again i rowed off to a kind of garden or public walk in the sea where there were grass and trees  but i forgot them when i stood upon its farthest brinki stood there in my dreamand looked along the ripple to the setting sun before me in the sky and on the deep a crimson flush and behind me the whole city resolving into streaks of red and purple on the water  in the luxurious wonder of so rare a dream i took but little heed of time and had but little understanding of its flight  but there were days and nights in it and when the sun was high and when the rays of lamps were crooked in the running water i was still afloat i thought  plashing the slippery walls and houses with the cleavings of the tide as my black boat borne upon it skimmed along the streets  sometimes alighting at the doors of churches and vast palaces i wandered on from room to room from aisle to aisle through labyrinths of rich altars ancient monuments decayed apartments where the furniture half awful half grotesque was mouldering away  pictures were there replete with such enduring beauty and expression  with such passion truth and power  that they seemed so many young and fresh realities among a host of spectres  i thought these often intermingled with the old days of the city with its beauties tyrants captains patriots merchants counters priests  nay with its very stones and bricks and public places all of which lived again about me on the walls then coming down some marble staircase where the water lapped and oozed against the lower steps i passed into my boat again and went on in my dream  floating down narrow lanes where carpenters at work with plane and chisel in their shops tossed the light shaving straight upon the water where it lay like weed or ebbed away before me in a tangled heap  past open doors decayed and rotten from long steeping in the wet through which some scanty patch of vine shone green and bright making unusual shadows on the pavement with its trembling leaves  past quays and terraces where women gracefully veiled were passing and repassing and where idlers were reclining in the sunshine on flagstones and on flights of steps  past bridges where there were idlers too loitering and looking over below stone balconies erected at a giddy height before the loftiest windows of the loftiest houses  past plots of garden theatres shrines prodigious piles of architecturegothic saracenicfanciful with all the fancies of all times and countries  past buildings that were high and low and black and white and straight and crooked mean and grand crazy and strong twining among a tangled lot of boats and barges and shooting out at last into a grand canal  there in the errant fancy of my dream i saw old shylock passing to and fro upon a bridge all built upon with shops and humming with the tongues of men a form i seemed to know for desdemonas leaned down through a latticed blind to pluck a flower  and in the dream i thought that shakespeares spirit was abroad upon the water somewhere  stealing through the city  at night when two votive lamps burnt before an image of the virgin in a gallery outside the great cathedral near the roof i fancied that the great piazza of the winged lion was a blaze of cheerful light and that its whole arcade was thronged with people while crowds were diverting themselves in splendid coffeehouses opening from itwhich were never shut i thought but open all night long  when the bronze giants struck the hour of midnight on the bell i thought the life and animation of the city were all centred here and as i rowed away abreast the silent quays i only saw them dotted here and there with sleeping boatmen wrapped up in their cloaks and lying at full length upon the stones  but close about the quays and churches palaces and prisons sucking at their walls and welling up into the secret places of the town crept the water always  noiseless and watchful  coiled round and round it in its many folds like an old serpent  waiting for the time i thought when people should look down into its depths for any stone of the old city that had claimed to be its mistress  thus it floated me away until i awoke in the old marketplace at verona  i have many and many a time thought since of this strange dream upon the water  halfwondering if it lie there yet and if its name be venice    chapter viiiby verona mantua and milan across the pass of the simplon into switzerland    i had been half afraid to go to verona lest it should at all put me out of conceit with romeo and juliet  but i was no sooner come into the old marketplace than the misgiving vanished  it is so fanciful quaint and picturesque a place formed by such an extraordinary and rich variety of fantastic buildings that there could be nothing better at the core of even this romantic town scene of one of the most romantic and beautiful of stories  it was natural enough to go straight from the marketplace to the house of the capulets now degenerated into a most miserable little inn  noisy vetturini and muddy marketcarts were disputing possession of the yard which was ankledeep in dirt with a brood of splashed and bespattered geese and there was a grimvisaged dog viciously panting in a doorway who would certainly have had romeo by the leg the moment he put it over the wall if he had existed and been at large in those times  the orchard fell into other hands and was parted off many years ago but there used to be one attached to the houseor at all events there may have beenand the hat cappello the ancient cognizance of the family may still be seen carved in stone over the gateway of the yard the geese the marketcarts their drivers and the dog were somewhat in the way of the story it must be confessed and it would have been pleasanter to have found the house empty and to have been able to walk through the disused rooms  but the hat was unspeakably comfortable and the place where the garden used to be hardly less so  besides the house is a distrustful jealous looking house as one would desire to see though of a very moderate size  so i was quite satisfied with it as the veritable mansion of old capulet and was correspondingly grateful in my acknowledgments to an extremely unsentimental middleaged lady the padrona of the hotel who was lounging on the threshold looking at the geese and who at least resembled the capulets in the one particular of being very great indeed in the family way  from juliets home to juliets tomb is a transition as natural to the visitor as to fair juliet herself or to the proudest juliet that ever has taught the torches to burn bright in any time  so i went off with a guide to an old old garden once belonging to an old old convent i suppose and being admitted at a shattered gate by a brighteyed woman who was washing clothes went down some walks where fresh plants and young flowers were prettily growing among fragments of old wall and ivycoloured mounds and was shown a little tank or watertrough which the brighteyed womandrying her arms upon her kerchief called la tomba di giulietta la sfortunata  with the best disposition in the world to believe i could do no more than believe that the brighteyed woman believed so i gave her that much credit and her customary fee in ready money  it was a pleasure rather than a disappointment that juliets restingplace was forgotten  however consolatory it may have been to yoricks ghost to hear the feet upon the pavement overhead and twenty times a day the repetition of his name it is better for juliet to lie out of the track of tourists and to have no visitors but such as come to graves in springrain and sweet air and sunshine  pleasant verona  with its beautiful old palaces and charming country in the distance seen from terrace walks and stately balustraded galleries  with its roman gates still spanning the fair street and casting on the sunlight of today the shade of fifteen hundred years ago  with its marblefitted churches lofty towers rich architecture and quaint old quiet thoroughfares where shouts of montagues and capulets once resounded   and made veronas ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partizans   with its fastrushing river picturesque old bridge great castle waving cypresses and prospect so delightful and so cheerful pleasant verona  in the midst of it in the piazza di braa spirit of old time among the familiar realities of the passing houris the great roman amphitheatre  so well preserved and carefully maintained that every row of seats is there unbroken  over certain of the arches the old roman numerals may yet be seen and there are corridors and staircases and subterranean passages for beasts and winding ways above ground and below as when the fierce thousands hurried in and out intent upon the bloody shows of the arena  nestling in some of the shadows and hollow places of the walls now are smiths with their forges and a few small dealers of one kind or other and there are green weeds and leaves and grass upon the parapet  but little else is greatly changed  when i had traversed all about it with great interest and had gone up to the topmost round of seats and turning from the lovely panorama closed in by the distant alps looked down into the building it seemed to lie before me like the inside of a prodigious hat of plaited straw with an enormously broad brim and a shallow crown the plaits being represented by the fourandforty rows of seats  the comparison is a homely and fantastic one in sober remembrance and on paper but it was irresistibly suggested at the moment nevertheless  an equestrian troop had been there a short time beforethe same troop i dare say that appeared to the old lady in the church at modenaand had scooped out a little ring at one end of the area where their performances had taken place and where the marks of their horses feet were still fresh  i could not but picture to myself a handful of spectators gathered together on one or two of the old stone seats and a spangled cavalier being gallant or a policinello funny with the grim walls looking on  above all i thought how strangely those roman mutes would gaze upon the favourite comic scene of the travelling english where a british nobleman lord john with a very loose stomach  dressed in a bluetailed coat down to his heels bright yellow breeches and a white hat  comes abroad riding double on a rearing horse with an english lady lady betsy in a straw bonnet and green veil and a red spencer and who always carries a gigantic reticule and a put up parasol  i walked through and through the town all the rest of the day and could have walked there until now i think  in one place there was a very pretty modern theatre where they had just performed the opera always popular in verona of romeo and juliet  in another there was a collection under a colonnade of greek roman and etruscan remains presided over by an ancient man who might have been an etruscan relic himself for he was not strong enough to open the iron gate when he had unlocked it and had neither voice enough to be audible when he described the curiosities nor sight enough to see them  he was so very old  in another place there was a gallery of pictures  so abominably bad that it was quite delightful to see them mouldering away  but anywhere  in the churches among the palaces in the streets on the bridge or down beside the river  it was always pleasant verona and in my remembrance always will be  i read romeo and juliet in my own room at the inn that nightof course no englishman had ever read it there beforeand set out for mantua next day at sunrise repeating to myself in the coupe of an omnibus and next to the conductor who was reading the mysteries of paris   there is no world without veronas walls but purgatory torture hell itself hencebanished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death    which reminded me that romeo was only banished fiveandtwenty miles after all and rather disturbed my confidence in his energy and boldness  was the way to mantua as beautiful in his time i wonder  did it wind through pasture land as green bright with the same glancing streams and dotted with fresh clumps of graceful trees  those purple mountains lay on the horizon then for certain and the dresses of these peasant girls who wear a great knobbed silver pin like an english lifepreserver through their hair behind can hardly be much changed  the hopeful feeling of so bright a morning and so exquisite a sunrise can have been no stranger even to an exiled lovers breast and mantua itself must have broken on him in the prospect with its towers and walls and water pretty much as on a commonplace and matrimonial omnibus  he made the same sharp twists and turns perhaps over two rumbling drawbridges passed through the like long covered wooden bridge and leaving the marshy water behind approached the rusty gate of stagnant mantua  if ever a man were suited to his place of residence and his place of residence to him the lean apothecary and mantua came together in a perfect fitness of things  it may have been more stirring then perhaps  if so the apothecary was a man in advance of his time and knew what mantua would be in eighteen hundred and forty four  he fasted much and that assisted him in his foreknowledge  i put up at the hotel of the golden lion and was in my own room arranging plans with the brave courier when there came a modest little tap at the door which opened on an outer gallery surrounding a courtyard and an intensely shabby little man looked in to inquire if the gentleman would have a cicerone to show the town  his face was so very wistful and anxious in the halfopened doorway and there was so much poverty expressed in his faded suit and little pinched hat and in the threadbare worsted glove with which he held itnot expressed the less because these were evidently his genteel clothes hastily slipped onthat i would as soon have trodden on him as dismissed him  i engaged him on the instant and he stepped in directly  while i finished the discussion in which i was engaged he stood beaming by himself in a corner making a feint of brushing my hat with his arm  if his fee had been as many napoleons as it was francs there could not have shot over the twilight of his shabbiness such a gleam of sun as lighted up the whole man now that he was hired  well said i when i was ready shall we go out now  if the gentleman pleases  it is a beautiful day  a little fresh but charming altogether charming  the gentleman will allow me to open the door  this is the inn yard  the courtyard of the golden lion  the gentleman will please to mind his footing on the stairs  we were now in the street  this is the street of the golden lion  this the outside of the golden lion  the interesting window up there on the first piano where the pane of glass is broken is the window of the gentlemans chamber  having viewed all these remarkable objects i inquired if there were much to see in mantua  well  truly no  not much  so so he said shrugging his shoulders apologetically  many churches  no  nearly all suppressed by the french  monasteries or convents  no  the french again  nearly all suppressed by napoleon  much business  very little business  many strangers  ah heaven  i thought he would have fainted  then when we have seen the two large churches yonder what shall we do next said i  he looked up the street and down the street and rubbed his chin timidly and then said glancing in my face as if a light had broken on his mind yet with a humble appeal to my forbearance that was perfectly irresistible  we can take a little turn about the town signore  si puo far un piccolo giro della citta  it was impossible to be anything but delighted with the proposal so we set off together in great goodhumour  in the relief of his mind he opened his heart and gave up as much of mantua as a cicerone could  one must eat he said but bah it was a dull place without doubt  he made as much as possible of the basilica of santa andreaa noble churchand of an inclosed portion of the pavement about which tapers were burning and a few people kneeling and under which is said to be preserved the sangreal of the old romances this church disposed of and another after it the cathedral of san pietro we went to the museum which was shut up  it was all the same he said  bah  there was not much inside  then we went to see the piazza del diavolo built by the devil for no particular purpose in a single night then the piazza virgiliana then the statue of virgilour poet my little friend said plucking up a spirit for the moment and putting his hat a little on one side  then we went to a dismal sort of farmyard by which a picturegallery was approached  the moment the gate of this retreat was opened some five hundred geese came waddling round us stretching out their necks and clamouring in the most hideous manner as if they were ejaculating oh heres somebody come to see the pictures  dont go up  dont go up  while we went up they waited very quietly about the door in a crowd cackling to one another occasionally in a subdued tone but the instant we appeared again their necks came out like telescopes and setting up a great noise which meant i have no doubt what you would go would you  what do you think of it  how do you like it they attended us to the outer gate and cast us forth derisively into mantua  the geese who saved the capitol were as compared to these pork to the learned pig  what a gallery it was  i would take their opinion on a question of art in preference to the discourses of sir joshua reynolds  now that we were standing in the street after being thus ignominiouly escorted thither my little friend was plainly reduced to the piccolo giro or little circuit of the town he had formerly proposed  but my suggestion that we should visit the palazzo te of which i had heard a great deal as a strange wild place imparted new life to him and away we went  the secret of the length of midass ears would have been more extensively known if that servant of his who whispered it to the reeds had lived in mantua where there are reeds and rushes enough to have published it to all the world  the palazzo te stands in a swamp among this sort of vegetation and is indeed as singular a place as i ever saw  not for its dreariness though it is very dreary  not for its dampness though it is very damp  nor for its desolate condition though it is as desolate and neglected as house can be  but chiefly for the unaccountable nightmares with which its interior has been decorated among other subjects of more delicate execution by giulio romano  there is a leering giant over a certain chimneypiece and there are dozens of giants titans warring with jove on the walls of another room so inconceivably ugly and grotesque that it is marvellous how any man can have imagined such creatures  in the chamber in which they abound these monsters with swollen faces and cracked cheeks and every kind of distortion of look and limb are depicted as staggering under the weight of falling buildings and being overwhelmed in the ruins upheaving masses of rock and burying themselves beneath vainly striving to sustain the pillars of heavy roofs that topple down upon their heads and in a word undergoing and doing every kind of mad and demoniacal destruction  the figures are immensely large and exaggerated to the utmost pitch of uncouthness the colouring is harsh and disagreeable and the whole effect more like i should imagine a violent rush of blood to the head of the spectator than any real picture set before him by the hand of an artist  this apoplectic performance was shown by a sicklylooking woman whose appearance was referable i dare say to the bad air of the marshes but it was difficult to help feeling as if she were too much haunted by the giants and they were frightening her to death all alone in that exhausted cistern of a palace among the reeds and rushes with the mists hovering about outside and stalking round and round it continually  our walk through mantua showed us in almost every street some suppressed church  now used for a warehouse now for nothing at all  all as crazy and dismantled as they could be short of tumbling down bodily  the marshy town was so intensely dull and flat that the dirt upon it seemed not to have come there in the ordinary course but to have settled and mantled on its surface as on standing water  and yet there were some businessdealings going on and some profits realising for there were arcades full of jews where those extraordinary people were sitting outside their shops contemplating their stores of stuffs and woollens and bright handkerchiefs and trinkets  and looking in all respects as wary and businesslike as their brethren in houndsditch london  having selected a vetturino from among the neighbouring christians who agreed to carry us to milan in two days and a half and to start next morning as soon as the gates were opened i returned to the golden lion and dined luxuriously in my own room in a narrow passage between two bedsteads  confronted by a smoky fire and backed up by a chest of drawers  at six oclock next morning we were jingling in the dark through the wet cold mist that enshrouded the town and before noon the driver a native of mantua and sixty years of age or thereabouts began to ask the way to milan  it lay through bozzolo formerly a little republic and now one of the most deserted and povertystricken of towns  where the landlord of the miserable inn god bless him it was his weekly custom was distributing infinitesimal coins among a clamorous herd of women and children whose rags were fluttering in the wind and rain outside his door where they were gathered to receive his charity  it lay through mist and mud and rain and vines trained low upon the ground all that day and the next the first sleeping place being cremona memorable for its dark brick churches and immensely high tower the torrazzoto say nothing of its violins of which it certainly produces none in these degenerate days and the second lodi  then we went on through more mud mist and rain and marshy ground  and through such a fog as englishmen strong in the faith of their own grievances are apt to believe is nowhere to be found but in their own country until we entered the paved streets of milan  the fog was so dense here that the spire of the farfamed cathedral might as well have been at bombay for anything that could be seen of it at that time  but as we halted to refresh for a few days then and returned to milan again next summer i had ample opportunities of seeing the glorious structure in all its majesty and beauty  all christian homage to the saint who lies within it  there are many good and true saints in the calendar but san carlo borromeo hasif i may quote mrs primrose on such a subjectmy warm heart  a charitable doctor to the sick a munificent friend to the poor and this not in any spirit of blind bigotry but as the bold opponent of enormous abuses in the romish church i honour his memory  i honour it none the less because he was nearly slain by a priest suborned by priests to murder him at the altar  in acknowledgment of his endeavours to reform a false and hypocritical brotherhood of monks  heaven shield all imitators of san carlo borromeo as it shielded him  a reforming pope would need a little shielding even now  the subterranean chapel in which the body of san carlo borromeo is preserved presents as striking and as ghastly a contrast perhaps as any place can show  the tapers which are lighted down there flash and gleam on altirilievi in gold and silver delicately wrought by skilful hands and representing the principal events in the life of the saint  jewels and precious metals shine and sparkle on every side  a windlass slowly removes the front of the altar and within it in a gorgeous shrine of gold and silver is seen through alabaster the shrivelled mummy of a man  the pontifical robes with which it is adorned radiant with diamonds emeralds rubies  every costly and magnificent gem  the shrunken heap of poor earth in the midst of this great glitter is more pitiful than if it lay upon a dunghill  there is not a ray of imprisoned light in all the flash and fire of jewels but seems to mock the dusty holes where eyes were once  every thread of silk in the rich vestments seems only a provision from the worms that spin for the behoof of worms that propagate in sepulchres  in the old refectory of the dilapidated convent of santa maria delle grazie is the work of art perhaps better known than any other in the world  the last supper by leonardo da vinciwith a door cut through it by the intelligent dominican friars to facilitate their operations at dinnertime  i am not mechanically acquainted with the art of painting and have no other means of judging of a picture than as i see it resembling and refining upon nature and presenting graceful combinations of forms and colours  i am therefore no authority whatever in reference to the touch of this or that master though i know very well as anybody may who chooses to think about the matter that few very great masters can possibly have painted in the compass of their lives onehalf of the pictures that bear their names and that are recognised by many aspirants to a reputation for taste as undoubted originals  but this by the way  of the last supper i would simply observe that in its beautiful composition and arrangement there it is at milan a wonderful picture and that in its original colouring or in its original expression of any single face or feature there it is not  apart from the damage it has sustained from damp decay or neglect it has been as barry shows so retouched upon and repainted and that so clumsily that many of the heads are now positive deformities with patches of paint and plaster sticking upon them like wens and utterly distorting the expression  where the original artist set that impress of his genius on a face which almost in a line or touch separated him from meaner painters and made him what he was succeeding bunglers filling up or painting across seams and cracks have been quite unable to imitate his hand and putting in some scowls or frowns or wrinkles of their own have blotched and spoiled the work  this is so well established as an historical fact that i should not repeat it at the risk of being tedious but for having observed an english gentleman before the picture who was at great pains to fall into what i may describe as mild convulsions at certain minute details of expression which are not left in it  whereas it would be comfortable and rational for travellers and critics to arrive at a general understanding that it cannot fail to have been a work of extraordinary merit once when with so few of its original beauties remaining the grandeur of the general design is yet sufficient to sustain it as a piece replete with interest and dignity  we achieved the other sights of milan in due course and a fine city it is though not so unmistakably italian as to possess the characteristic qualities of many towns far less important in themselves  the corso where the milanese gentry ride up and down in carriages and rather than not do which they would half starve themselves at home is a most noble public promenade shaded by long avenues of trees  in the splendid theatre of la scala there was a ballet of action performed after the opera under the title of prometheus  in the beginning of which some hundred or two of men and women represented our mortal race before the refinements of the arts and sciences and loves and graces came on earth to soften them  i never saw anything more effective  generally speaking the pantomimic action of the italians is more remarkable for its sudden and impetuous character than for its delicate expression but in this case the drooping monotony  the weary miserable listless moping life  the sordid passions and desires of human creatures destitute of those elevating influences to which we owe so much and to whose promoters we render so little were expressed in a manner really powerful and affecting  i should have thought it almost impossible to present such an idea so strongly on the stage without the aid of speech  milan soon lay behind us at five oclock in the morning and before the golden statue on the summit of the cathedral spire was lost in the blue sky the alps stupendously confused in lofty peaks and ridges clouds and snow were towering in our path  still we continued to advance toward them until nightfall and all day long the mountain tops presented strangely shifting shapes as the road displayed them in different points of view the beautiful day was just declining when we came upon the lago maggiore with its lovely islands  for however fanciful and fantastic the isola bella may be and is it still is beautiful anything springing out of that blue water with that scenery around it must be  it was ten oclock at night when we got to domo dossola at the foot of the pass of the simplon  but as the moon was shining brightly and there was not a cloud in the starlit sky it was no time for going to bed or going anywhere but on  so we got a little carriage after some delay and began the ascent  it was late in november and the snow lying four or five feet thick in the beaten road on the summit in other parts the new drift was already deep the air was piercing cold  but the serenity of the night and the grandeur of the road with its impenetrable shadows and deep glooms and its sudden turns into the shining of the moon and its incessant roar of falling water rendered the journey more and more sublime at every step  soon leaving the calm italian villages below us sleeping in the moonlight the road began to wind among dark trees and after a time emerged upon a barer region very steep and toilsome where the moon shone bright and high  by degrees the roar of water grew louder and the stupendous track after crossing the torrent by a bridge struck in between two massive perpendicular walls of rock that quite shut out the moonlight and only left a few stars shining in the narrow strip of sky above  then even this was lost in the thick darkness of a cavern in the rock through which the way was pierced the terrible cataract thundering and roaring close below it and its foam and spray hanging in a mist about the entrance  emerging from this cave and coming again into the moonlight and across a dizzy bridge it crept and twisted upward through the gorge of gondo savage and grand beyond description with smoothfronted precipices rising up on either hand and almost meeting overhead  thus we went climbing on our rugged way higher and higher all night without a moments weariness  lost in the contemplation of the black rocks the tremendous heights and depths the fields of smooth snow lying in the clefts and hollows and the fierce torrents thundering headlong down the deep abyss  towards daybreak we came among the snow where a keen wind was blowing fiercely  having with some trouble awakened the inmates of a wooden house in this solitude  round which the wind was howling dismally catching up the snow in wreaths and hurling it away  we got some breakfast in a room built of rough timbers but well warmed by a stove and well contrived as it had need to be for keeping out the bitter storms  a sledge being then made ready and four horses harnessed to it we went ploughing through the snow  still upward but now in the cold light of morning and with the great white desert on which we travelled plain and clear  we were well upon the summit of the mountain  and had before us the rude cross of wood denoting its greatest altitude above the sea  when the light of the rising sun struck all at once upon the waste of snow and turned it a deep red  the lonely grandeur of the scene was then at its height  as we went sledging on there came out of the hospice founded by napoleon a group of peasant travellers with staves and knapsacks who had rested there last night  attended by a monk or two their hospitable entertainers trudging slowly forward with them for companys sake  it was pleasant to give them good morning and pretty looking back a long way after them to see them looking back at us and hesitating presently when one of our horses stumbled and fell whether or no they should return and help us but he was soon up again with the assistance of a rough waggoner whose team had stuck fast there too and when we had helped him out of his difficulty in return we left him slowly ploughing towards them and went slowly and swiftly forward on the brink of a steep precipice among the mountain pines  taking to our wheels again soon afterwards we began rapidly to descend passing under everlasting glaciers by means of arched galleries hung with clusters of dripping icicles under and over foaming waterfalls near places of refuge and galleries of shelter against sudden danger through caverns over whose arched roofs the avalanches slide in spring and bury themselves in the unknown gulf beneath  down over lofty bridges and through horrible ravines  a little shifting speck in the vast desolation of ice and snow and monstrous granite rocks down through the deep gorge of the saltine and deafened by the torrent plunging madly down among the riven blocks of rock into the level country far below gradually down by zigzag roads lying between an upward and a downward precipice into warmer weather calmer air and softer scenery until there lay before us glittering like gold or silver in the thaw and sunshine the metalcovered red green yellow domes and churchspires of a swiss town  the business of these recollections being with italy and my business consequently being to scamper back thither as fast as possible i will not recall though i am sorely tempted how the swiss villages clustered at the feet of giant mountains looked like playthings or how confusedly the houses were heaped and piled together or how there were very narrow streets to shut the howling winds out in the wintertime and broken bridges which the impetuous torrents suddenly released in spring had swept away or how there were peasant women here with great round fur caps looking when they peeped out of casements and only their heads were seen like a population of swordbearers to the lord mayor of london or how the town of vevey lying on the smooth lake of geneva was beautiful to see or how the statue of saint peter in the street at fribourg grasps the largest key that ever was beheld or how fribourg is illustrious for its two suspension bridges and its grand cathedral organ  or how between that town and bale the road meandered among thriving villages of wooden cottages with overhanging thatched roofs and low protruding windows glazed with small round panes of glass like crownpieces or how in every little swiss homestead with its cart or waggon carefully stowed away beside the house its little garden stock of poultry and groups of redcheeked children there was an air of comfort very new and very pleasant after italy or how the dresses of the women changed again and there were no more swordbearers to be seen and fair white stomachers and great black fanshaped gauzylooking caps prevailed instead  or how the country by the jura mountains sprinkled with snow and lighted by the moon and musical with falling water was delightful or how below the windows of the great hotel of the three kings at bale the swollen rhine ran fast and green or how at strasbourg it was quite as fast but not as green  and was said to be foggy lower down  and at that late time of the year was a far less certain means of progress than the highway road to paris  or how strasbourg itself in its magnificent old gothic cathedral and its ancient houses with their peaked roofs and gables made a little gallery of quaint and interesting views or how a crowd was gathered inside the cathedral at noon to see the famous mechanical clock in motion striking twelve  how when it struck twelve a whole army of puppets went through many ingenious evolutions and among them a huge puppetcock perched on the top crowed twelve times loud and clear  or how it was wonderful to see this cock at great pains to clap its wings and strain its throat but obviously having no connection whatever with its own voice which was deep within the clock a long way down  or how the road to paris was one sea of mud and thence to the coast a little better for a hard frost  or how the cliffs of dover were a pleasant sight and england was so wonderfully neat though dark and lacking colour on a winters day it must be conceded  or how a few days afterwards it was cool recrossing the channel with ice upon the decks and snow lying pretty deep in france  or how the malle poste scrambled through the snow headlong drawn in the hilly parts by any number of stout horses at a canter or how there were outside the postoffice yard in paris before daybreak extraordinary adventurers in heaps of rags groping in the snowy streets with little rakes in search of odds and ends  or how between paris and marseilles the snow being then exceeding deep a thaw came on and the mail waded rather than rolled for the next three hundred miles or so breaking springs on sunday nights and putting out its two passengers to warm and refresh themselves pending the repairs in miserable billiardrooms where hairy company collected about stoves were playing cards the cards being very like themselvesextremely limp and dirty  or how there was detention at marseilles from stress of weather and steamers were advertised to go which did not go or how the good steampacket charlemagne at length put out and met such weather that now she threatened to run into toulon and now into nice but the wind moderating did neither but ran on into genoa harbour instead where the familiar bells rang sweetly in my ear or how there was a travelling party on board of whom one member was very ill in the cabin next to mine and being ill was cross and therefore declined to give up the dictionary which he kept under his pillow thereby obliging his companions to come down to him constantly to ask what was the italian for a lump of sugara glass of brandy and waterwhats oclock and so forth  which he always insisted on looking out with his own seasick eyes declining to entrust the book to any man alive  like grumio i might have told you in detail all this and something morebut to as little purposewere i not deterred by the remembrance that my business is with italy  therefore like grumios story it shall die in oblivion    chapter ixto rome by pisa and siena    there is nothing in italy more beautiful to me than the coast road between genoa and spezzia  on one side  sometimes far below sometimes nearly on a level with the road and often skirted by broken rocks of many shapes  there is the free blue sea with here and there a picturesque felucca gliding slowly on on the other side are lofty hills ravines besprinkled with white cottages patches of dark olive woods country churches with their light open towers and country houses gaily painted  on every bank and knoll by the wayside the wild cactus and aloe flourish in exuberant profusion and the gardens of the bright villages along the road are seen all blushing in the summertime with clusters of the belladonna and are fragrant in the autumn and winter with golden oranges and lemons  some of the villages are inhabited almost exclusively by fishermen and it is pleasant to see their great boats hauled up on the beach making little patches of shade where they lie asleep or where the women and children sit romping and looking out to sea while they mend their nets upon the shore  there is one town camoglia with its little harbour on the sea hundreds of feet below the road where families of mariners live who time out of mind have owned coastingvessels in that place and have traded to spain and elsewhere  seen from the road above it is like a tiny model on the margin of the dimpled water shining in the sun descended into by the winding muletracks it is a perfect miniature of a primitive seafaring town the saltest roughest most piratical little place that ever was seen  great rusty iron rings and mooringchains capstans and fragments of old masts and spars choke up the way hardy roughweather boats and seamens clothing flutter in the little harbour or are drawn out on the sunny stones to dry on the parapet of the rude pier a few amphibiouslooking fellows lie asleep with their legs dangling over the wall as though earth or water were all one to them and if they slipped in they would float away dozing comfortably among the fishes the church is bright with trophies of the sea and votive offerings in commemoration of escape from storm and shipwreck  the dwellings not immediately abutting on the harbour are approached by blind low archways and by crooked steps as if in darkness and in difficulty of access they should be like holds of ships or inconvenient cabins under water and everywhere there is a smell of fish and seaweed and old rope  the coastroad whence camoglia is descried so far below is famous in the warm season especially in some parts near genoa for fire flies  walking there on a dark night i have seen it made one sparkling firmament by these beautiful insects  so that the distant stars were pale against the flash and glitter that spangled every olive wood and hillside and pervaded the whole air  it was not in such a season however that we traversed this road on our way to rome  the middle of january was only just past and it was very gloomy and dark weather very wet besides  in crossing the fine pass of bracco we encountered such a storm of mist and rain that we travelled in a cloud the whole way  there might have been no mediterranean in the world for anything that we saw of it there except when a sudden gust of wind clearing the mist before it for a moment showed the agitated sea at a great depth below lashing the distant rocks and spouting up its foam furiously  the rain was incessant every brook and torrent was greatly swollen and such a deafening leaping and roaring and thundering of water i never heard the like of in my life  hence when we came to spezzia we found that the magra an unbridged river on the highroad to pisa was too high to be safely crossed in the ferry boat and were fain to wait until the afternoon of next day when it had in some degree subsided spezzia however is a good place to tarry at by reason firstly of its beautiful bay secondly of its ghostly inn thirdly of the headdress of the women who wear on one side of their head a small dolls straw hat stuck on to the hair which is certainly the oddest and most roguish headgear that ever was invented  the magra safely crossed in the ferry boatthe passage is not by any means agreeable when the current is swollen and strongwe arrived at carrara within a few hours  in good time next morning we got some ponies and went out to see the marble quarries  they are four or five great glens running up into a range of lofty hills until they can run no longer and are stopped by being abruptly strangled by nature  the quarries or caves as they call them there are so many openings high up in the hills on either side of these passes where they blast and excavate for marble  which may turn out good or bad  may make a mans fortune very quickly or ruin him by the great expense of working what is worth nothing  some of these caves were opened by the ancient romans and remain as they left them to this hour  many others are being worked at this moment others are to be begun tomorrow next week next month others are unbought unthought of and marble enough for more ages than have passed since the place was resorted to lies hidden everywhere  patiently awaiting its time of discovery  as you toil and clamber up one of these steep gorges having left your pony soddening his girths in water a mile or two lower down you hear every now and then echoing among the hills in a low tone more silent than the previous silence a melancholy warning buglea signal to the miners to withdraw  then there is a thundering and echoing from hill to hill and perhaps a splashing up of great fragments of rock into the air and on you toil again until some other bugle sounds in a new direction and you stop directly lest you should come within the range of the new explosion  there were numbers of men working high up in these hillson the sidesclearing away and sending down the broken masses of stone and earth to make way for the blocks of marble that had been discovered  as these came rolling down from unseen hands into the narrow valley i could not help thinking of the deep glen just the same sort of glen where the roc left sindbad the sailor and where the merchants from the heights above flung down great pieces of meat for the diamonds to stick to  there were no eagles here to darken the sun in their swoop and pounce upon them but it was as wild and fierce as if there had been hundreds  but the road the road down which the marble comes however immense the blocks the genius of the country and the spirit of its institutions pave that road  repair it watch it keep it going conceive a channel of water running over a rocky bed beset with great heaps of stone of all shapes and sizes winding down the middle of this valley and that being the roadbecause it was the road five hundred years ago  imagine the clumsy carts of five hundred years ago being used to this hour and drawn as they used to be five hundred years ago by oxen whose ancestors were worn to death five hundred years ago as their unhappy descendants are now in twelve months by the suffering and agony of this cruel work  two pair four pair ten pair twenty pair to one block according to its size down it must come this way  in their struggling from stone to stone with their enormous loads behind them they die frequently upon the spot and not they alone for their passionate drivers sometimes tumbling down in their energy are crushed to death beneath the wheels  but it was good five hundred years ago and it must be good now  and a railroad down one of these steeps the easiest thing in the world would be flat blasphemy  when we stood aside to see one of these cars drawn by only a pair of oxen for it had but one small block of marble on it coming down i hailed in my heart the man who sat upon the heavy yoke to keep it on the neck of the poor beastsand who faced backwards not before himas the very devil of true despotism  he had a great rod in his hand with an iron point and when they could plough and force their way through the loose bed of the torrent no longer and came to a stop he poked it into their bodies beat it on their heads screwed it round and round in their nostrils got them on a yard or two in the madness of intense pain repeated all these persuasions with increased intensity of purpose when they stopped again got them on once more forced and goaded them to an abrupter point of the descent and when their writhing and smarting and the weight behind them bore them plunging down the precipice in a cloud of scattered water whirled his rod above his head and gave a great whoop and hallo as if he had achieved something and had no idea that they might shake him off and blindly mash his brains upon the road in the noontide of his triumph  standing in one of the many studii of carrara that afternoonfor it is a great workshop full of beautifullyfinished copies in marble of almost every figure group and bust we knowit seemed at first so strange to me that those exquisite shapes replete with grace and thought and delicate repose should grow out of all this toil and sweat and torture  but i soon found a parallel to it and an explanation of it in every virtue that springs up in miserable ground and every good thing that has its birth in sorrow and distress  and looking out of the sculptors great window upon the marble mountains all red and glowing in the decline of day but stern and solemn to the last i thought my god how many quarries of human hearts and souls capable of far more beautiful results are left shut up and mouldering away while pleasuretravellers through life avert their faces as they pass and shudder at the gloom and ruggedness that conceal them  the then reigning duke of modena to whom this territory in part belonged claimed the proud distinction of being the only sovereign in europe who had not recognised louisphilippe as king of the french  he was not a wag but quite in earnest  he was also much opposed to railroads and if certain lines in contemplation by other potentates on either side of him had been executed would have probably enjoyed the satisfaction of having an omnibus plying to and fro across his not very vast dominions to forward travellers from one terminus to another  carrara shut in by great hills is very picturesque and bold  few tourists stay there and the people are nearly all connected in one way or other with the working of marble  there are also villages among the caves where the workmen live  it contains a beautiful little theatre newly built and it is an interesting custom there to form the chorus of labourers in the marble quarries who are selftaught and sing by ear  i heard them in a comic opera and in an act of norma and they acquitted themselves very well unlike the common people of italy generally who with some exceptions among the neapolitans sing vilely out of tune and have very disagreeable singing voices  from the summit of a lofty hill beyond carrara the first view of the fertile plain in which the town of pisa lieswith leghorn a purple spot in the flat distanceis enchanting  nor is it only distance that lends enchantment to the view for the fruitful country and rich woods of olivetrees through which the road subsequently passes render it delightful  the moon was shining when we approached pisa and for a long time we could see behind the wall the leaning tower all awry in the uncertain light the shadowy original of the old pictures in schoolbooks setting forth the wonders of the world  like most things connected in their first associations with schoolbooks and schooltimes it was too small  i felt it keenly  it was nothing like so high above the wall as i had hoped  it was another of the many deceptions practised by mr harris bookseller at the corner of st pauls churchyard london  his tower was a fiction but this was a realityand by comparison a short reality  still it looked very well and very strange and was quite as much out of the perpendicular as harris had represented it to be  the quiet air of pisa too the big guardhouse at the gate with only two little soldiers in it the streets with scarcely any show of people in them and the arno flowing quaintly through the centre of the town were excellent  so i bore no malice in my heart against mr harris remembering his good intentions but forgave him before dinner and went out full of confidence to see the tower next morning  i might have known better but somehow i had expected to see it casting its long shadow on a public street where people came and went all day  it was a surprise to me to find it in a grave retired place apart from the general resort and carpeted with smooth green turf  but the group of buildings clustered on and about this verdant carpet  comprising the tower the baptistery the cathedral and the church of the campo santo  is perhaps the most remarkable and beautiful in the whole world and from being clustered there together away from the ordinary transactions and details of the town they have a singularly venerable and impressive character  it is the architectural essence of a rich old city with all its common life and common habitations pressed out and filtered away  simond compares the tower to the usual pictorial representations in childrens books of the tower of babel  it is a happy simile and conveys a better idea of the building than chapters of laboured description  nothing can exceed the grace and lightness of the structure nothing can be more remarkable than its general appearance  in the course of the ascent to the top which is by an easy staircase the inclination is not very apparent but at the summit it becomes so and gives one the sensation of being in a ship that has heeled over through the action of an ebbtide  the effect upon the low side so to speaklooking over from the gallery and seeing the shaft recede to its baseis very startling and i saw a nervous traveller hold on to the tower involuntarily after glancing down as if he had some idea of propping it up  the view within from the groundlooking up as through a slanted tubeis also very curious  it certainly inclines as much as the most sanguine tourist could desire  the natural impulse of ninetynine people out of a hundred who were about to recline upon the grass below it to rest and contemplate the adjacent buildings would probably be not to take up their position under the leaning side it is so very much aslant  the manifold beauties of the cathedral and baptistery need no recapitulation from me though in this case as in a hundred others i find it difficult to separate my own delight in recalling them from your weariness in having them recalled  there is a picture of st agnes by andrea del sarto in the former and there are a variety of rich columns in the latter that tempt me strongly  it is i hope no breach of my resolution not to be tempted into elaborate descriptions to remember the campo santo where grass grown graves are dug in earth brought more than six hundred years ago from the holy land and where there are surrounding them such cloisters with such playing lights and shadows falling through their delicate tracery on the stone pavement as surely the dullest memory could never forget  on the walls of this solemn and lovely place are ancient frescoes very much obliterated and decayed but very curious  as usually happens in almost any collection of paintings of any sort in italy where there are many heads there is in one of them a striking accidental likeness of napoleon  at one time i used to please my fancy with the speculation whether these old painters at their work had a foreboding knowledge of the man who would one day arise to wreak such destruction upon art  whose soldiers would make targets of great pictures and stable their horses among triumphs of architecture  but the same corsican face is so plentiful in some parts of italy at this day that a more commonplace solution of the coincidence is unavoidable  if pisa be the seventh wonder of the world in right of its tower it may claim to be at least the second or third in right of its beggars  they waylay the unhappy visitor at every turn escort him to every door he enters at and lie in wait for him with strong reinforcements at every door by which they know he must come out the grating of the portal on its hinges is the signal for a general shout and the moment he appears he is hemmed in and fallen on by heaps of rags and personal distortions  the beggars seem to embody all the trade and enterprise of pisa  nothing else is stirring but warm air  going through the streets the fronts of the sleepy houses look like backs  they are all so still and quiet and unlike houses with people in them that the greater part of the city has the appearance of a city at daybreak or during a general siesta of the population  or it is yet more like those backgrounds of houses in common prints or old engravings where windows and doors are squarely indicated and one figure a beggar of course is seen walking off by itself into illimitable perspective  not so leghorn made illustrious by smolletts grave which is a thriving businesslike matteroffact place where idleness is shouldered out of the way by commerce  the regulations observed there in reference to trade and merchants are very liberal and free and the town of course benefits by them  leghorn had a bad name in connection with stabbers and with some justice it must be allowed for not many years ago there was an assassination club there the members of which bore no illwill to anybody in particular but stabbed people quite strangers to them in the streets at night for the pleasure and excitement of the recreation  i think the president of this amiable society was a shoemaker  he was taken however and the club was broken up  it would probably have disappeared in the natural course of events before the railroad between leghorn and pisa which is a good one and has already begun to astonish italy with a precedent of punctuality order plain dealing and improvementthe most dangerous and heretical astonisher of all  there must have been a slight sensation as of earthquake surely in the vatican when the first italian railroad was thrown open  returning to pisa and hiring a goodtempered vetturino and his four horses to take us on to rome we travelled through pleasant tuscan villages and cheerful scenery all day  the roadside crosses in this part of italy are numerous and curious  there is seldom a figure on the cross though there is sometimes a face but they are remarkable for being garnished with little models in wood of every possible object that can be connected with the saviours death the cock that crowed when peter had denied his master thrice is usually perched on the tiptop and an ornithological phenomenon he generally is  under him is the inscription  then hung on to the crossbeam are the spear the reed with the sponge of vinegar and water at the end the coat without seam for which the soldiers cast lots the dicebox with which they threw for it the hammer that drove in the nails the pincers that pulled them out the ladder which was set against the cross the crown of thorns the instrument of flagellation the lanthorn with which mary went to the tomb i suppose and the sword with which peter smote the servant of the high priesta perfect toyshop of little objects repeated at every four or five miles all along the highway  on the evening of the second day from pisa we reached the beautiful old city of siena  there was what they called a carnival in progress but as its secret lay in a score or two of melancholy people walking up and down the principal street in common toyshop masks and being more melancholy if possible than the same sort of people in england i say no more of it  we went off betimes next morning to see the cathedral which is wonderfully picturesque inside and out especially the latteralso the marketplace or great piazza which is a large square with a great brokennosed fountain in it  some quaint gothic houses  and a high square brick tower outside the top of whicha curious feature in such views in italyhangs an enormous bell  it is like a bit of venice without the water  there are some curious old palazzi in the town which is very ancient and without having for me the interest of verona or genoa it is very dreamy and fantastic and most interesting  we went on again as soon as we had seen these things and going over a rather bleak country there had been nothing but vines until now  mere walkingsticks at that season of the year stopped as usual between one and two hours in the middle of the day to rest the horses that being a part of every vetturino contract  we then went on again through a region gradually becoming bleaker and wilder until it became as bare and desolate as any scottish moors soon after dark we halted for the night at the osteria of la scala  a perfectly lone house where the family were sitting round a great fire in the kitchen raised on a stone platform three or four feet high and big enough for the roasting of an ox  on the upper and only other floor of this hotel there was a great wild rambling sala with one very little window in a bycorner and four black doors opening into four black bedrooms in various directions to say nothing of another large black door opening into another large black sala with the staircase coming abruptly through a kind of trapdoor in the floor and the rafters of the roof looming above  a suspicious little press skulking in one obscure corner and all the knives in the house lying about in various directions the fireplace was of the purest italian architecture so that it was perfectly impossible to see it for the smoke  the waitress was like a dramatic brigands wife and wore the same style of dress upon her head  the dogs barked like mad the echoes returned the compliments bestowed upon them there was not another house within twelve miles and things had a dreary and rather a cutthroat appearance  they were not improved by rumours of robbers having come out strong and boldly within a few nights and of their having stopped the mail very near that place  they were known to have waylaid some travellers not long before on mount vesuvius itself and were the talk at all the roadside inns  as they were no business of ours however for we had very little with us to lose we made ourselves merry on the subject and were very soon as comfortable as need be  we had the usual dinner in this solitary house and a very good dinner it is when you are used to it  there is something with a vegetable or some rice in it which is a sort of shorthand or arbitrary character for soup and which tastes very well when you have flavoured it with plenty of grated cheese lots of salt and abundance of pepper  there is the half fowl of which this soup has been made  there is a stewed pigeon with the gizzards and livers of himself and other birds stuck all round him there is a bit of roast beef the size of a small french roll there are a scrap of parmesan cheese and five little withered apples all huddled together on a small plate and crowding one upon the other as if each were trying to save itself from the chance of being eaten  then there is coffee and then there is bed  you dont mind brick floors you dont mind yawning doors nor banging windows you dont mind your own horses being stabled under the bed  and so close that every time a horse coughs or sneezes he wakes you  if you are goodhumoured to the people about you and speak pleasantly and look cheerful take my word for it you may be well entertained in the very worst italian inn and always in the most obliging manner and may go from one end of the country to the other despite all stories to the contrary without any great trial of your patience anywhere  especially when you get such wine in flasks as the orvieto and the monte pulciano  it was a bad morning when we left this place and we went for twelve miles over a country as barren as stony and as wild as cornwall in england until we came to radicofani where there is a ghostly goblin inn  once a huntingseat belonging to the dukes of tuscany  it is full of such rambling corridors and gaunt rooms that all the murdering and phantom tales that ever were written might have originated in that one house  there are some horrible old palazzi in genoa  one in particular not unlike it outside  but there is a winding creaking wormy rustling door opening footonstaircasefalling character about this radicofani hotel such as i never saw anywhere else  the town such as it is hangs on a hillside above the house and in front of it  the inhabitants are all beggars and as soon as they see a carriage coming they swoop down upon it like so many birds of prey  when we got on the mountain pass which lies beyond this place the wind as they had forewarned us at the inn was so terrific that we were obliged to take my other half out of the carriage lest she should be blown over carriage and all and to hang to it on the windy side as well as we could for laughing to prevent its going heaven knows where  for mere force of wind this landstorm might have competed with an atlantic gale and had a reasonable chance of coming off victorious  the blast came sweeping down great gullies in a range of mountains on the right  so that we looked with positive awe at a great morass on the left and saw that there was not a bush or twig to hold by  it seemed as if once blown from our feet we must be swept out to sea or away into space  there was snow and hail and rain and lightning and thunder and there were rolling mists travelling with incredible velocity  it was dark awful and solitary to the last degree there were mountains above mountains veiled in angry clouds and there was such a wrathful rapid violent tumultuous hurry everywhere as rendered the scene unspeakably exciting and grand  it was a relief to get out of it notwithstanding and to cross even the dismal dirty papal frontier  after passing through two little towns in one of which acquapendente there was also a carnival in progress  consisting of one man dressed and masked as a woman and one woman dressed and masked as a man walking ankledeep through the muddy streets in a very melancholy manner we came at dusk within sight of the lake of bolsena on whose bank there is a little town of the same name much celebrated for malaria  with the exception of this poor place there is not a cottage on the banks of the lake or near it for nobody dare sleep there not a boat upon its waters not a stick or stake to break the dismal monotony of sevenandtwenty watery miles  we were late in getting in the roads being very bad from heavy rains and after dark the dulness of the scene was quite intolerable  we entered on a very different and a finer scene of desolation next night at sunset  we had passed through montefiaschone famous for its wine and viterbo for its fountains  and after climbing up a long hill of eight or ten miles extent came suddenly upon the margin of a solitary lake  in one part very beautiful with a luxuriant wood in another very barren and shut in by bleak volcanic hills  where this lake flows there stood of old a city  it was swallowed up one day and in its stead this water rose  there are ancient traditions common to many parts of the world of the ruined city having been seen below when the water was clear but however that may be from this spot of earth it vanished  the ground came bubbling up above it and the water too and here they stand like ghosts on whom the other world closed suddenly and who have no means of getting back again  they seem to be waiting the course of ages for the next earthquake in that place when they will plunge below the ground at its first yawning and be seen no more  the unhappy city below is not more lost and dreary than these firecharred hills and the stagnant water above  the red sun looked strangely on them as with the knowledge that they were made for caverns and darkness and the melancholy water oozed and sucked the mud and crept quietly among the marshy grass and reeds as if the overthrow of all the ancient towers and housetops and the death of all the ancient people born and bred there were yet heavy on its conscience  a short ride from this lake brought us to ronciglione a little town like a large pigsty where we passed the night  next morning at seven oclock we started for rome  as soon as we were out of the pigsty we entered on the campagna romana an undulating flat as you know where few people can live and where for miles and miles there is nothing to relieve the terrible monotony and gloom  of all kinds of country that could by possibility lie outside the gates of rome this is the aptest and fittest burialground for the dead city  so sad so quiet so sullen so secret in its covering up of great masses of ruin and hiding them so like the waste places into which the men possessed with devils used to go and howl and rend themselves in the old days of jerusalem  we had to traverse thirty miles of this campagna and for twoandtwenty we went on and on seeing nothing but now and then a lonely house or a villainouslooking shepherd with matted hair all over his face and himself wrapped to the chin in a frowsy brown mantle tending his sheep  at the end of that distance we stopped to refresh the horses and to get some lunch in a common malariashaken despondent little publichouse whose every inch of wall and beam inside was according to custom painted and decorated in a way so miserable that every room looked like the wrong side of another room and with its wretched imitation of drapery and lopsided little daubs of lyres seemed to have been plundered from behind the scenes of some travelling circus  when we were fairly going off again we began in a perfect fever to strain our eyes for rome and when after another mile or two the eternal city appeared at length in the distance it looked likei am half afraid to write the wordlike london  there it lay under a thick cloud with innumerable towers and steeples and roofs of houses rising up into the sky and high above them all one dome  i swear that keenly as i felt the seeming absurdity of the comparison it was so like london at that distance that if you could have shown it me in a glass i should have taken it for nothing else    chapter xrome    we entered the eternal city at about four oclock in the afternoon on the thirtieth of january by the porta del popolo and came immediatelyit was a dark muddy day and there had been heavy rainon the skirts of the carnival  we did not then know that we were only looking at the fag end of the masks who were driving slowly round and round the piazza until they could find a promising opportunity for falling into the stream of carriages and getting in good time into the thick of the festivity and coming among them so abruptly all travelstained and weary was not coming very well prepared to enjoy the scene  we had crossed the tiber by the ponte molle two or three miles before  it had looked as yellow as it ought to look and hurrying on between its wornaway and miry banks had a promising aspect of desolation and ruin  the masquerade dresses on the fringe of the carnival did great violence to this promise  there were no great ruins no solemn tokens of antiquity to be seenthey all lie on the other side of the city  there seemed to be long streets of commonplace shops and houses such as are to be found in any european town there were busy people equipages ordinary walkers to and fro a multitude of chattering strangers  it was no more my rome  the rome of anybodys fancy man or boy degraded and fallen and lying asleep in the sun among a heap of ruins  than the place de la concorde in paris is  a cloudy sky a dull cold rain and muddy streets i was prepared for but not for this  and i confess to having gone to bed that night in a very indifferent humour and with a very considerably quenched enthusiasm  immediately on going out next day we hurried off to st peters it looked immense in the distance but distinctly and decidedly small by comparison on a near approach  the beauty of the piazza on which it stands with its clusters of exquisite columns and its gushing fountainsso fresh so broad and free and beautifulnothing can exaggerate  the first burst of the interior in all its expansive majesty and glory  and most of all the looking up into the dome  is a sensation never to be forgotten  but there were preparations for a festa the pillars of stately marble were swathed in some impertinent frippery of red and yellow the altar and entrance to the subterranean chapel which is before it  in the centre of the church  were like a goldsmiths shop or one of the opening scenes in a very lavish pantomime  and though i had as high a sense of the beauty of the building i hope as it is possible to entertain i felt no very strong emotion  i have been infinitely more affected in many english cathedrals when the organ has been playing and in many english country churches when the congregation have been singing i had a much greater sense of mystery and wonder in the cathedral of san mark at venice  when we came out of the church again we stood nearly an hour staring up into the dome  and would not have gone over the cathedral then for any money we said to the coachman go to the coliseum  in a quarter of an hour or so he stopped at the gate and we went in  it is no fiction but plain sober honest truth to say  so suggestive and distinct is it at this hour  that for a moment actually in passing inthey who will may have the whole great pile before them as it used to be with thousands of eager faces staring down into the arena and such a whirl of strife and blood and dust going on there as no language can describe  its solitude its awful beauty and its utter desolation strike upon the stranger the next moment like a softened sorrow and never in his life perhaps will he be so moved and overcome by any sight not immediately connected with his own affections and afflictions  to see it crumbling there an inch a year its walls and arches overgrown with green its corridors open to the day the long grass growing in its porches young trees of yesterday springing up on its ragged parapets and bearing fruit  chance produce of the seeds dropped there by the birds who build their nests within its chinks and crannies to see its pit of fight filled up with earth and the peaceful cross planted in the centre to climb into its upper halls and look down on ruin ruin ruin all about it the triumphal arches of constantine septimus severus and titus the roman forum the palace of the caesars the temples of the old religion fallen down and gone is to see the ghost of old rome wicked wonderful old city haunting the very ground on which its people trod  it is the most impressive the most stately the most solemn grand majestic mournful sight conceivable  never in its bloodiest prime can the sight of the gigantic coliseum full and running over with the lustiest life have moved ones heart as it must move all who look upon it now a ruin  god be thanked  a ruin  as it tops the other ruins  standing there a mountain among graves  so do its ancient influences outlive all other remnants of the old mythology and old butchery of rome in the nature of the fierce and cruel roman people  the italian face changes as the visitor approaches the city its beauty becomes devilish and there is scarcely one countenance in a hundred among the common people in the streets that would not be at home and happy in a renovated coliseum tomorrow  here was rome indeed at last and such a rome as no one can imagine in its full and awful grandeur  we wandered out upon the appian way and then went on through miles of ruined tombs and broken walls with here and there a desolate and uninhabited house  past the circus of romulus where the course of the chariots the stations of the judges competitors and spectators are yet as plainly to be seen as in old time  past the tomb of cecilia metella  past all inclosure hedge or stake wall or fence  away upon the open campagna where on that side of rome nothing is to be beheld but ruin  except where the distant apennines bound the view upon the left the whole wide prospect is one field of ruin broken aqueducts left in the most picturesque and beautiful clusters of arches broken temples broken tombs  a desert of decay sombre and desolate beyond all expression and with a history in every stone that strews the ground   on sunday the pope assisted in the performance of high mass at st peters  the effect of the cathedral on my mind on that second visit was exactly what it was at first and what it remains after many visits  it is not religiously impressive or affecting  it is an immense edifice with no one point for the mind to rest upon and it tires itself with wandering round and round  the very purpose of the place is not expressed in anything you see there unless you examine its detailsand all examination of details is incompatible with the place itself  it might be a pantheon or a senate house or a great architectural trophy having no other object than an architectural triumph  there is a black statue of st peter to be sure under a red canopy which is larger than life and which is constantly having its great toe kissed by good catholics  you cannot help seeing that  it is so very prominent and popular  but it does not heighten the effect of the temple as a work of art and it is not expressiveto me at leastof its high purpose  a large space behind the altar was fitted up with boxes shaped like those at the italian opera in england but in their decoration much more gaudy  in the centre of the kind of theatre thus railed off was a canopied dais with the popes chair upon it  the pavement was covered with a carpet of the brightest green and what with this green and the intolerable reds and crimsons and gold borders of the hangings the whole concern looked like a stupendous bonbon  on either side of the altar was a large box for lady strangers  these were filled with ladies in black dresses and black veils  the gentlemen of the popes guard in red coats leather breeches and jackboots guarded all this reserved space with drawn swords that were very flashy in every sense and from the altar all down the nave a broad lane was kept clear by the popes swiss guard who wear a quaint striped surcoat and striped tight legs and carry halberds like those which are usually shouldered by those theatrical supernumeraries who never can get off the stage fast enough and who may be generally observed to linger in the enemys camp after the open country held by the opposite forces has been split up the middle by a convulsion of nature  i got upon the border of the green carpet in company with a great many other gentlemen attired in black no other passport is necessary and stood there at my ease during the performance of mass  the singers were in a crib of wirework like a large meat safe or birdcage in one corner and sang most atrociously  all about the green carpet there was a slowly moving crowd of people talking to each other  staring at the pope through eyeglasses defrauding one another in moments of partial curiosity out of precarious seats on the bases of pillars  and grinning hideously at the ladies  dotted here and there were little knots of friars francescani or cappuccini in their coarse brown dresses and peaked hoods making a strange contrast to the gaudy ecclesiastics of higher degree and having their humility gratified to the utmost by being shouldered about and elbowed right and left on all sides  some of these had muddy sandals and umbrellas and stained garments  having trudged in from the country  the faces of the greater part were as coarse and heavy as their dress their dogged stupid monotonous stare at all the glory and splendour having something in it half miserable and half ridiculous  upon the green carpet itself and gathered round the altar was a perfect army of cardinals and priests in red gold purple violet white and fine linen  stragglers from these went to and fro among the crowd conversing two and two or giving and receiving introductions and exchanging salutations other functionaries in black gowns and other functionaries in court dresses were similarly engaged  in the midst of all these and stealthy jesuits creeping in and out and the extreme restlessness of the youth of england who were perpetually wandering about some few steady persons in black cassocks who had knelt down with their faces to the wall and were poring over their missals became unintentionally a sort of humane mantraps and with their own devout legs tripped up other peoples by the dozen  there was a great pile of candles lying down on the floor near me which a very old man in a rusty black gown with an openwork tippet like a summer ornament for a fireplace in tissuepaper made himself very busy in dispensing to all the ecclesiastics  one apiece  they loitered about with these for some time under their arms like walkingsticks or in their hands like truncheons  at a certain period of the ceremony however each carried his candle up to the pope laid it across his two knees to be blessed took it back again and filed off  this was done in a very attenuated procession as you may suppose and occupied a long time  not because it takes long to bless a candle through and through but because there were so many candles to be blessed  at last they were all blessed  and then they were all lighted and then the pope was taken up chair and all and carried round the church  i must say that i never saw anything out of november so like the popular english commemoration of the fifth of that month  a bundle of matches and a lantern would have made it perfect  nor did the pope himself at all mar the resemblance though he has a pleasant and venerable face for as this part of the ceremony makes him giddy and sick he shuts his eyes when it is performed  and having his eyes shut and a great mitre on his head and his head itself wagging to and fro as they shook him in carrying he looked as if his mask were going to tumble off  the two immense fans which are always borne one on either side of him accompanied him of course on this occasion  as they carried him along he blessed the people with the mystic sign and as he passed them they kneeled down  when he had made the round of the church he was brought back again and if i am not mistaken this performance was repeated in the whole three times  there was certainly nothing solemn or effective in it and certainly very much that was droll and tawdry  but this remark applies to the whole ceremony except the raising of the host when every man in the guard dropped on one knee instantly and dashed his naked sword on the ground which had a fine effect  the next time i saw the cathedral was some two or three weeks afterwards when i climbed up into the ball and then the hangings being taken down and the carpet taken up but all the framework left the remnants of these decorations looked like an exploded cracker  the friday and saturday having been solemn festa days and sunday being always a dies non in carnival proceedings we had looked forward with some impatience and curiosity to the beginning of the new week  monday and tuesday being the two last and best days of the carnival  on the monday afternoon at one or two oclock there began to be a great rattling of carriages into the courtyard of the hotel a hurrying to and fro of all the servants in it and now and then a swift shooting across some doorway or balcony of a straggling stranger in a fancy dress  not yet sufficiently well used to the same to wear it with confidence and defy public opinion  all the carriages were open and had the linings carefully covered with white cotton or calico to prevent their proper decorations from being spoiled by the incessant pelting of sugarplums and people were packing and cramming into every vehicle as it waited for its occupants enormous sacks and baskets full of these confetti together with such heaps of flowers tied up in little nosegays that some carriages were not only brimful of flowers but literally running over  scattering at every shake and jerk of the springs some of their abundance on the ground  not to be behindhand in these essential particulars we caused two very respectable sacks of sugarplums each about three feet high and a large clothes basket full of flowers to be conveyed into our hired barouche with all speed  and from our place of observation in one of the upper balconies of the hotel we contemplated these arrangements with the liveliest satisfaction  the carriages now beginning to take up their company and move away we got into ours and drove off too armed with little wire masks for our faces the sugarplums like falstaffs adulterated sack having lime in their composition  the corso is a street a mile long a street of shops and palaces and private houses sometimes opening into a broad piazza  there are verandahs and balconies of all shapes and sizes to almost every housenot on one story alone but often to one room or another on every storyput there in general with so little order or regularity that if year after year and season after season it had rained balconies hailed balconies snowed balconies blown balconies they could scarcely have come into existence in a more disorderly manner  this is the great fountainhead and focus of the carnival  but all the streets in which the carnival is held being vigilantly kept by dragoons it is necessary for carriages in the first instance to pass in line down another thoroughfare and so come into the corso at the end remote from the piazza del popolo which is one of its terminations  accordingly we fell into the string of coaches and for some time jogged on quietly enough now crawling on at a very slow walk now trotting halfadozen yards now backing fifty and now stopping altogether  as the pressure in front obliged us if any impetuous carriage dashed out of the rank and clattered forward with the wild idea of getting on faster it was suddenly met or overtaken by a trooper on horseback who deaf as his own drawn sword to all remonstrances immediately escorted it back to the very end of the row and made it a dim speck in the remotest perspective  occasionally we interchanged a volley of confetti with the carriage next in front or the carriage next behind but as yet this capturing of stray and errant coaches by the military was the chief amusement  presently we came into a narrow street where besides one line of carriages going there was another line of carriages returning here the sugarplums and the nosegays began to fly about pretty smartly and i was fortunate enough to observe one gentleman attired as a greek warrior catch a lightwhiskered brigand on the nose he was in the very act of tossing up a bouquet to a young lady in a firstfloor window with a precision that was much applauded by the bystanders  as this victorious greek was exchanging a facetious remark with a stout gentleman in a doorway onehalf black and onehalf white as if he had been peeled up the middlewho had offered him his congratulations on this achievement he received an orange from a housetop full on his left ear and was much surprised not to say discomfited especially as he was standing up at the time and in consequence of the carriage moving on suddenly at the same moment staggered ignominiously and buried himself among his flowers  some quarter of an hour of this sort of progress brought us to the corso and anything so gay so bright and lively as the whole scene there it would be difficult to imagine  from all the innumerable balconies  from the remotest and highest no less than from the lowest and nearest  hangings of bright red bright green bright blue white and gold were fluttering in the brilliant sunlight  from windows and from parapets and tops of houses streamers of the richest colours and draperies of the gaudiest and most sparkling hues were floating out upon the street  the buildings seemed to have been literally turned inside out and to have all their gaiety towards the highway  shopfronts were taken down and the windows filled with company like boxes at a shining theatre doors were carried off their hinges and long tapestried groves hung with garlands of flowers and evergreens displayed within builders scaffoldings were gorgeous temples radiant in silver gold and crimson and in every nook and corner from the pavement to the chimneytops where womens eyes could glisten there they danced and laughed and sparkled like the light in water  every sort of bewitching madness of dress was there little preposterous scarlet jackets quaint old stomachers more wicked than the smartest bodices polish pelisses strained and tight as ripe gooseberries tiny greek caps all awry and clinging to the dark hair heaven knows how every wild quaint bold shy pettish madcap fancy had its illustration in a dress and every fancy was as dead forgotten by its owner in the tumult of merriment as if the three old aqueducts that still remain entire had brought lethe into rome upon their sturdy arches that morning  the carriages were now three abreast in broader places four often stationary for a long time together always one close mass of variegated brightness showing the whole streetfull through the storm of flowers like flowers of a larger growth themselves  in some the horses were richly caparisoned in magnificent trappings in others they were decked from head to tail with flowing ribbons some were driven by coachmen with enormous double faces  one face leering at the horses  the other cocking its extraordinary eyes into the carriage  and both rattling again under the hail of sugarplums  other drivers were attired as women wearing long ringlets and no bonnets and looking more ridiculous in any real difficulty with the horses of which in such a concourse there were a great many than tongue can tell or pen describe  instead of sitting in the carriages upon the seats the handsome roman women to see and to be seen the better sit in the heads of the barouches at this time of general licence with their feet upon the cushionsand oh the flowing skirts and dainty waists the blessed shapes and laughing faces the free goodhumoured gallant figures that they make there were great vans too full of handsome girlsthirty or more together perhapsand the broadsides that were poured into and poured out of these fairy fireshops splashed the air with flowers and bonbons for ten minutes at a time  carriages delayed long in one place would begin a deliberate engagement with other carriages or with people at the lower windows and the spectators at some upper balcony or window joining in the fray and attacking both parties would empty down great bags of confetti that descended like a cloud and in an instant made them white as millers  still carriages on carriages dresses on dresses colours on colours crowds upon crowds without end  men and boys clinging to the wheels of coaches and holding on behind and following in their wake and diving in among the horses feet to pick up scattered flowers to sell again maskers on foot the drollest generally in fantastic exaggerations of courtdresses surveying the throng through enormous eyeglasses and always transported with an ecstasy of love on the discovery of any particularly old lady at a window long strings of policinelli laying about them with blown bladders at the ends of sticks a waggonfull of madmen screaming and tearing to the life a coachfull of grave mamelukes with their horsetail standard set up in the midst a party of gipsywomen engaged in terrific conflict with a shipful of sailors a man monkey on a pole surrounded by strange animals with pigs faces and lions tails carried under their arms or worn gracefully over their shoulders carriages on carriages dresses on dresses colours on colours crowds upon crowds without end  not many actual characters sustained or represented perhaps considering the number dressed but the main pleasure of the scene consisting in its perfect good temper in its bright and infinite and flashing variety and in its entire abandonment to the mad humour of the timean abandonment so perfect so contagious so irresistible that the steadiest foreigner fights up to his middle in flowers and sugarplums like the wildest roman of them all and thinks of nothing else till halfpast four oclock when he is suddenly reminded to his great regret that this is not the whole business of his existence by hearing the trumpets sound and seeing the dragoons begin to clear the street  how it ever is cleared for the race that takes place at five or how the horses ever go through the race without going over the people is more than i can say  but the carriages get out into the bystreets or up into the piazza del popolo and some people sit in temporary galleries in the latter place and tens of thousands line the corso on both sides when the horses are brought out into the piazzato the foot of that same column which for centuries looked down upon the games and chariotraces in the circus maximus  at a given signal they are started off  down the live lane the whole length of the corso they fly like the wind  riderless as all the world knows  with shining ornaments upon their backs and twisted in their plaited manes  and with heavy little balls stuck full of spikes dangling at their sides to goad them on  the jingling of these trappings and the rattling of their hoofs upon the hard stones the dash and fury of their speed along the echoing street nay the very cannon that are firedthese noises are nothing to the roaring of the multitude  their shouts  the clapping of their hands  but it is soon overalmost instantaneously  more cannon shake the town  the horses have plunged into the carpets put across the street to stop them the goal is reached the prizes are won they are given in part by the poor jews as a compromise for not running footraces themselves and there is an end to that days sport  but if the scene be bright and gay and crowded on the last day but one it attains on the concluding day to such a height of glittering colour swarming life and frolicsome uproar that the bare recollection of it makes me giddy at this moment  the same diversions greatly heightened and intensified in the ardour with which they are pursued go on until the same hour  the race is repeated the cannon are fired the shouting and clapping of hands are renewed the cannon are fired again the race is over and the prizes are won  but the carriages  ankledeep with sugarplums within and so beflowered and dusty without as to be hardly recognisable for the same vehicles that they were three hours ago instead of scampering off in all directions throng into the corso where they are soon wedged together in a scarcely moving mass  for the diversion of the moccoletti the last gay madness of the carnival is now at hand and sellers of little tapers like what are called christmas candles in england are shouting lustily on every side moccoli moccoli  ecco moccolia new item in the tumult quite abolishing that other item of  ecco fiori  ecco fiorrr which has been making itself audible over all the rest at intervals the whole day through  as the bright hangings and dresses are all fading into one dull heavy uniform colour in the decline of the day lights begin flashing here and there  in the windows on the housetops in the balconies in the carriages in the hands of the footpassengers little by little  gradually gradually  more and more  until the whole long street is one great glare and blaze of fire  then everybody present has but one engrossing object that is to extinguish other peoples candles and to keep his own alight and everybody  man woman or child gentleman or lady prince or peasant native or foreigner  yells and screams and roars incessantly as a taunt to the subdued senza moccolo senza moccolo  without a light  without a light until nothing is heard but a gigantic chorus of those two words mingled with peals of laughter  the spectacle at this time is one of the most extraordinary that can be imagined  carriages coming slowly by with everybody standing on the seats or on the box holding up their lights at arms length for greater safety some in paper shades some with a bunch of undefended little tapers kindled altogether some with blazing torches some with feeble little candles men on foot creeping along among the wheels watching their opportunity to make a spring at some particular light and dash it out other people climbing up into carriages to get hold of them by main force others chasing some unlucky wanderer round and round his own coach to blow out the light he has begged or stolen somewhere before he can ascend to his own company and enable them to light their extinguished tapers others with their hats off at a carriagedoor humbly beseeching some kindhearted lady to oblige them with a light for a cigar and when she is in the fulness of doubt whether to comply or no blowing out the candle she is guarding so tenderly with her little hand other people at the windows fishing for candles with lines and hooks or letting down long willowwands with handkerchiefs at the end and flapping them out dexterously when the bearer is at the height of his triumph others biding their time in corners with immense extinguishers like halberds and suddenly coming down upon glorious torches others gathered round one coach and sticking to it others raining oranges and nosegays at an obdurate little lantern or regularly storming a pyramid of men holding up one man among them who carries one feeble little wick above his head with which he defies them all  senza moccolo  senza moccolo  beautiful women standing up in coaches pointing in derision at extinguished lights and clapping their hands as they pass on crying senza moccolo  senza moccolo low balconies full of lovely faces and gay dresses struggling with assailants in the streets some repressing them as they climb up some bending down some leaning over some shrinking backdelicate arms and bosomsgraceful figuresglowing lights fluttering dresses senza moccolo senza moccoli senza moccoloooowhen in the wildest enthusiasm of the cry and fullest ecstasy of the sport the ave maria rings from the church steeples and the carnival is over in an instantput out like a taper with a breath  there was a masquerade at the theatre at night as dull and senseless as a london one and only remarkable for the summary way in which the house was cleared at eleven oclock  which was done by a line of soldiers forming along the wall at the back of the stage and sweeping the whole company out before them like a broad broom  the game of the moccoletti the word in the singular moccoletto is the diminutive of moccolo and means a little lamp or candlesnuff is supposed by some to be a ceremony of burlesque mourning for the death of the carnival  candles being indispensable to catholic grief  but whether it be so or be a remnant of the ancient saturnalia or an incorporation of both or have its origin in anything else i shall always remember it and the frolic as a brilliant and most captivating sight  no less remarkable for the unbroken goodhumour of all concerned down to the very lowest and among those who scaled the carriages were many of the commonest men and boys than for its innocent vivacity  for odd as it may seem to say so of a sport so full of thoughtlessness and personal display it is as free from any taint of immodesty as any general mingling of the two sexes can possibly be and there seems to prevail during its progress a feeling of general almost childish simplicity and confidence which one thinks of with a pang when the ave maria has rung it away for a whole year   availing ourselves of a part of the quiet interval between the termination of the carnival and the beginning of the holy week when everybody had run away from the one and few people had yet begun to run back again for the other  we went conscientiously to work to see rome  and by dint of going out early every morning and coming back late every evening and labouring hard all day i believe we made acquaintance with every post and pillar in the city and the country round and in particular explored so many churches that i abandoned that part of the enterprise at last before it was half finished lest i should never of my own accord go to church again as long as i lived  but i managed almost every day at one time or other to get back to the coliseum and out upon the open campagna beyond the tomb of cecilia metella  we often encountered in these expeditions a company of english tourists with whom i had an ardent but ungratified longing to establish a speaking acquaintance  they were one mr davis and a small circle of friends  it was impossible not to know mrs daviss name from her being always in great request among her party and her party being everywhere  during the holy week they were in every part of every scene of every ceremony  for a fortnight or three weeks before it they were in every tomb and every church and every ruin and every picture gallery and i hardly ever observed mrs davis to be silent for a moment  deep underground high up in st peters out on the campagna and stifling in the jews quarter mrs davis turned up all the same i dont think she ever saw anything or ever looked at anything and she had always lost something out of a straw handbasket and was trying to find it with all her might and main among an immense quantity of english halfpence which lay like sands upon the seashore at the bottom of it  there was a professional cicerone always attached to the party which had been brought over from london fifteen or twenty strong by contract and if he so much as looked at mrs davis she invariably cut him short by saying there god bless the man dont worrit me  i dont understand a word you say and shouldnt if you was to talk till you was black in the face  mr davis always had a snuffcoloured greatcoat on and carried a great green umbrella in his hand and had a slow curiosity constantly devouring him which prompted him to do extraordinary things such as taking the covers off urns in tombs and looking in at the ashes as if they were picklesand tracing out inscriptions with the ferrule of his umbrella and saying with intense thoughtfulness heres a b you see and theres a r and this is the way we goes on in is it  his antiquarian habits occasioned his being frequently in the rear of the rest and one of the agonies of mrs davis and the party in general was an everpresent fear that davis would be lost  this caused them to scream for him in the strangest places and at the most improper seasons  and when he came slowly emerging out of some sepulchre or other like a peaceful ghoule saying here i am mrs davis invariably replied youll be buried alive in a foreign country davis and its no use trying to prevent you  mr and mrs davis and their party had probably been brought from london in about nine or ten days  eighteen hundred years ago the roman legions under claudius protested against being led into mr and mrs daviss country urging that it lay beyond the limits of the world  among what may be called the cubs or minor lions of rome there was one that amused me mightily  it is always to be found there and its den is on the great flight of steps that lead from the piazza di spagna to the church of trinita del monte  in plainer words these steps are the great place of resort for the artists models and there they are constantly waiting to be hired  the first time i went up there i could not conceive why the faces seemed familiar to me why they appeared to have beset me for years in every possible variety of action and costume and how it came to pass that they started up before me in rome in the broad day like so many saddled and bridled nightmares  i soon found that we had made acquaintance and improved it for several years on the walls of various exhibition galleries  there is one old gentleman with long white hair and an immense beard who to my knowledge has gone half through the catalogue of the royal academy  this is the venerable or patriarchal model  he carries a long staff and every knot and twist in that staff i have seen faithfully delineated innumerable times  there is another man in a blue cloak who always pretends to be asleep in the sun when there is any and who i need not say is always very wide awake and very attentive to the disposition of his legs  this is the dolce far niente model  there is another man in a brown cloak who leans against a wall with his arms folded in his mantle and looks out of the corners of his eyes  which are just visible beneath his broad slouched hat  this is the assassin model  there is another man who constantly looks over his own shoulder and is always going away but never does  this is the haughty or scornful model  as to domestic happiness and holy families they should come very cheap for there are lumps of them all up the steps and the cream of the thing is that they are all the falsest vagabonds in the world especially made up for the purpose and having no counterparts in rome or any other part of the habitable globe  my recent mention of the carnival reminds me of its being said to be a mock mourning in the ceremony with which it closes for the gaieties and merrymakings before lent and this again reminds me of the real funerals and mourning processions of rome which like those in most other parts of italy are rendered chiefly remarkable to a foreigner by the indifference with which the mere clay is universally regarded after life has left it  and this is not from the survivors having had time to dissociate the memory of the dead from their wellremembered appearance and form on earth for the interment follows too speedily after death for that  almost always taking place within fourandtwenty hours and sometimes within twelve  at rome there is the same arrangement of pits in a great bleak open dreary space that i have already described as existing in genoa  when i visited it at noonday i saw a solitary coffin of plain deal  uncovered by any shroud or pall and so slightly made that the hoof of any wandering mule would have crushed it in carelessly tumbled down all on one side on the door of one of the pitsand there left by itself in the wind and sunshine  how does it come to be left here i asked the man who showed me the place  it was brought here half an hour ago signore he said i remembered to have met the procession on its return  straggling away at a good round pace  when will it be put in the pit i asked him  when the cart comes and it is opened tonight he said  how much does it cost to be brought here in this way instead of coming in the cart i asked him  ten scudi he said about two pounds twoandsixpence english  the other bodies for whom nothing is paid are taken to the church of the santa maria della consolazione he continued and brought here altogether in the cart at night  i stood a moment looking at the coffin which had two initial letters scrawled upon the top and turned away with an expression in my face i suppose of not much liking its exposure in that manner  for he said shrugging his shoulders with great vivacity and giving a pleasant smile but hes dead signore hes dead  why not   among the innumerable churches there is one i must select for separate mention  it is the church of the ara coeli supposed to be built on the site of the old temple of jupiter feretrius and approached on one side by a long steep flight of steps which seem incomplete without some group of bearded soothsayers on the top  it is remarkable for the possession of a miraculous bambino or wooden doll representing the infant saviour and i first saw this miraculous bambino in legal phrase in manner following that is to say  we had strolled into the church one afternoon and were looking down its long vista of gloomy pillars for all these ancient churches built upon the ruins of old temples are dark and sad when the brave came running in with a grin upon his face that stretched it from ear to ear and implored us to follow him without a moments delay as they were going to show the bambino to a select party  we accordingly hurried off to a sort of chapel or sacristy hard by the chief altar but not in the church itself where the select party consisting of two or three catholic gentlemen and ladies not italians were already assembled  and where one hollowcheeked young monk was lighting up divers candles while another was putting on some clerical robes over his coarse brown habit  the candles were on a kind of altar and above it were two delectable figures such as you would see at any english fair representing the holy virgin and saint joseph as i suppose bending in devotion over a wooden box or coffer which was shut  the hollowcheeked monk number one having finished lighting the candles went down on his knees in a corner before this set piece and the monk number two having put on a pair of highly ornamented and goldbespattered gloves lifted down the coffer with great reverence and set it on the altar  then with many genuflexions and muttering certain prayers he opened it and let down the front and took off sundry coverings of satin and lace from the inside  the ladies had been on their knees from the commencement and the gentlemen now dropped down devoutly as he exposed to view a little wooden doll in face very like general tom thumb the american dwarf  gorgeously dressed in satin and gold lace and actually blazing with rich jewels  there was scarcely a spot upon its little breast or neck or stomach but was sparkling with the costly offerings of the faithful  presently he lifted it out of the box and carrying it round among the kneelers set its face against the forehead of every one and tendered its clumsy foot to them to kissa ceremony which they all performed down to a dirty little ragamuffin of a boy who had walked in from the street when this was done he laid it in the box again  and the company rising drew near and commended the jewels in whispers  in good time he replaced the coverings shut up the box put it back in its place locked up the whole concern holy family and all behind a pair of foldingdoors took off his priestly vestments and received the customary small charge while his companion by means of an extinguisher fastened to the end of a long stick put out the lights one after another  the candles being all extinguished and the money all collected they retired and so did the spectators  i met this same bambino in the street a short time afterwards going in great state to the house of some sick person  it is taken to all parts of rome for this purpose constantly but i understand that it is not always as successful as could be wished for making its appearance at the bedside of weak and nervous people in extremity accompanied by a numerous escort it not unfrequently frightens them to death  it is most popular in cases of childbirth where it has done such wonders that if a lady be longer than usual in getting through her difficulties a messenger is despatched with all speed to solicit the immediate attendance of the bambino  it is a very valuable property and much confided inespecially by the religious body to whom it belongs  i am happy to know that it is not considered immaculate by some who are good catholics and who are behind the scenes from what was told me by the near relation of a priest himself a catholic and a gentleman of learning and intelligence  this priest made my informant promise that he would on no account allow the bambino to be borne into the bedroom of a sick lady in whom they were both interested  for said he if they the monks trouble her with it and intrude themselves into her room it will certainly kill her  my informant accordingly looked out of the window when it came and with many thanks declined to open the door  he endeavoured in another case of which he had no other knowledge than such as he gained as a passerby at the moment to prevent its being carried into a small unwholesome chamber where a poor girl was dying  but he strove against it unsuccessfully and she expired while the crowd were pressing round her bed  among the people who drop into st peters at their leisure to kneel on the pavement and say a quiet prayer there are certain schools and seminaries priestly and otherwise that come in twenty or thirty strong  these boys always kneel down in single file one behind the other with a tall grim master in a black gown bringing up the rear  like a pack of cards arranged to be tumbled down at a touch with a disproportionately large knave of clubs at the end  when they have had a minute or so at the chief altar they scramble up and filing off to the chapel of the madonna or the sacrament flop down again in the same order so that if anybody did stumble against the master a general and sudden overthrow of the whole line must inevitably ensue  the scene in all the churches is the strangest possible  the same monotonous heartless drowsy chaunting always going on the same dark building darker from the brightness of the street without the same lamps dimly burning the selfsame people kneeling here and there turned towards you from one altar or other the same priests back with the same large cross embroidered on it however different in size in shape in wealth in architecture this church is from that it is the same thing still  there are the same dirty beggars stopping in their muttered prayers to beg the same miserable cripples exhibiting their deformity at the doors the same blind men rattling little pots like kitchen pepper castors  their depositories for alms the same preposterous crowns of silver stuck upon the painted heads of single saints and virgins in crowded pictures so that a little figure on a mountain has a headdress bigger than the temple in the foreground or adjacent miles of landscape the same favourite shrine or figure smothered with little silver hearts and crosses and the like  the staple trade and show of all the jewellers the same odd mixture of respect and indecorum faith and phlegm  kneeling on the stones and spitting on them loudly getting up from prayers to beg a little or to pursue some other worldly matter  and then kneeling down again to resume the contrite supplication at the point where it was interrupted  in one church a kneeling lady got up from her prayer for a moment to offer us her card as a teacher of music and in another a sedate gentleman with a very thick walkingstaff arose from his devotions to belabour his dog who was growling at another dog  and whose yelps and howls resounded through the church as his master quietly relapsed into his former train of meditationkeeping his eye upon the dog at the same time nevertheless  above all there is always a receptacle for the contributions of the faithful in some form or other  sometimes it is a moneybox set up between the worshipper and the wooden lifesize figure of the redeemer sometimes it is a little chest for the maintenance of the virgin sometimes an appeal on behalf of a popular bambino sometimes a bag at the end of a long stick thrust among the people here and there and vigilantly jingled by an active sacristan but there it always is and very often in many shapes in the same church and doing pretty well in all  nor is it wanting in the open airthe streets and roadsfor often as you are walking along thinking about anything rather than a tin canister that object pounces out upon you from a little house by the wayside and on its top is painted for the souls in purgatory an appeal which the bearer repeats a great many times as he rattles it before you much as punch rattles the cracked bell which his sanguine disposition makes an organ of  and this reminds me that some roman altars of peculiar sanctity bear the inscription every mass performed at this altar frees a soul from purgatory  i have never been able to find out the charge for one of these services but they should needs be expensive  there are several crosses in rome too the kissing of which confers indulgences for varying terms  that in the centre of the coliseum is worth a hundred days and people may be seen kissing it from morning to night  it is curious that some of these crosses seem to acquire an arbitrary popularity  this very one among them  in another part of the coliseum there is a cross upon a marble slab with the inscription who kisses this cross shall be entitled to two hundred and forty days indulgence  but i saw no one person kiss it though day after day i sat in the arena and saw scores upon scores of peasants pass it on their way to kiss the other  to single out details from the great dream of roman churches would be the wildest occupation in the world  but st stefano rotondo a damp mildewed vault of an old church in the outskirts of rome will always struggle uppermost in my mind by reason of the hideous paintings with which its walls are covered  these represent the martyrdoms of saints and early christians and such a panorama of horror and butchery no man could imagine in his sleep though he were to eat a whole pig raw for supper  greybearded men being boiled fried grilled crimped singed eaten by wild beasts worried by dogs buried alive torn asunder by horses chopped up small with hatchets  women having their breasts torn with iron pinchers their tongues cut out their ears screwed off their jaws broken their bodies stretched upon the rack or skinned upon the stake or crackled up and melted in the fire  these are among the mildest subjects  so insisted on and laboured at besides that every sufferer gives you the same occasion for wonder as poor old duncan awoke in lady macbeth when she marvelled at his having so much blood in him  there is an upper chamber in the mamertine prisons over what is said to have beenand very possibly may have beenthe dungeon of st peter  this chamber is now fitted up as an oratory dedicated to that saint and it lives as a distinct and separate place in my recollection too  it is very small and lowroofed and the dread and gloom of the ponderous obdurate old prison are on it as if they had come up in a dark mist through the floor  hanging on the walls among the clustered votive offerings are objects at once strangely in keeping and strangely at variance with the placerusty daggers knives pistols clubs divers instruments of violence and murder brought here fresh from use and hung up to propitiate offended heaven  as if the blood upon them would drain off in consecrated air and have no voice to cry with  it is all so silent and so close and tomblike and the dungeons below are so black and stealthy and stagnant and naked that this little dark spot becomes a dream within a dream  and in the vision of great churches which come rolling past me like a sea it is a small wave by itself that melts into no other wave and does not flow on with the rest  it is an awful thing to think of the enormous caverns that are entered from some roman churches and undermine the city  many churches have crypts and subterranean chapels of great size which in the ancient time were baths and secret chambers of temples and what not  but i do not speak of them  beneath the church of st giovanni and st paolo there are the jaws of a terrific range of caverns hewn out of the rock and said to have another outlet underneath the coliseumtremendous darknesses of vast extent halfburied in the earth and unexplorable where the dull torches flashed by the attendants glimmer down long ranges of distant vaults branching to the right and left like streets in a city of the dead and show the cold damp stealing down the walls drip drop dripdrop to join the pools of water that lie here and there and never saw or never will see one ray of the sun  some accounts make these the prisons of the wild beasts destined for the amphitheatre some the prisons of the condemned gladiators some both  but the legend most appalling to the fancy is that in the upper range for there are two stories of these caves the early christians destined to be eaten at the coliseum shows heard the wild beasts hungry for them roaring down below until upon the night and solitude of their captivity there burst the sudden noon and life of the vast theatre crowded to the parapet and of these their dreaded neighbours bounding in  below the church of san sebastiano two miles beyond the gate of san sebastiano on the appian way is the entrance to the catacombs of romequarries in the old time but afterwards the hidingplaces of the christians  these ghastly passages have been explored for twenty miles and form a chain of labyrinths sixty miles in circumference  a gaunt franciscan friar with a wild bright eye was our only guide down into this profound and dreadful place  the narrow ways and openings hither and thither coupled with the dead and heavy air soon blotted out in all of us any recollection of the track by which we had come  and i could not help thinking good heaven if in a sudden fit of madness he should dash the torches out or if he should be seized with a fit what would become of us  on we wandered among martyrs graves  passing great subterranean vaulted roads diverging in all directions and choked up with heaps of stones that thieves and murderers may not take refuge there and form a population under rome even worse than that which lives between it and the sun  graves graves graves graves of men of women of their little children who ran crying to the persecutors we are christians  we are christians that they might be murdered with their parents graves with the palm of martyrdom roughly cut into their stone boundaries and little niches made to hold a vessel of the martyrs blood graves of some who lived down here for years together ministering to the rest and preaching truth and hope and comfort from the rude altars that bear witness to their fortitude at this hour more roomy graves but far more terrible where hundreds being surprised were hemmed in and walled up  buried before death and killed by slow starvation  the triumphs of the faith are not above ground in our splendid churches said the friar looking round upon us as we stopped to rest in one of the low passages with bones and dust surrounding us on every side  they are here  among the martyrs graves  he was a gentle earnest man and said it from his heart but when i thought how christian men have dealt with one another how perverting our most merciful religion they have hunted down and tortured burnt and beheaded strangled slaughtered and oppressed each other i pictured to myself an agony surpassing any that this dust had suffered with the breath of life yet lingering in it and how these great and constant hearts would have been shakenhow they would have quailed and droopedif a foreknowledge of the deeds that professing christians would commit in the great name for which they died could have rent them with its own unutterable anguish on the cruel wheel and bitter cross and in the fearful fire  such are the spots and patches in my dream of churches that remain apart and keep their separate identity  i have a fainter recollection sometimes of the relics of the fragments of the pillar of the temple that was rent in twain of the portion of the table that was spread for the last supper of the well at which the woman of samaria gave water to our saviour of two columns from the house of pontius pilate of the stone to which the sacred hands were bound when the scourging was performed of the gridiron of saint lawrence and the stone below it marked with the frying of his fat and blood these set a shadowy mark on some cathedrals as an old story or a fable might and stop them for an instant as they flit before me  the rest is a vast wilderness of consecrated buildings of all shapes and fancies blending one with another of battered pillars of old pagan temples dug up from the ground and forced like giant captives to support the roofs of christian churches of pictures bad and wonderful and impious and ridiculous of kneeling people curling incense tinkling bells and sometimes but not often of a swelling organ  of madonne with their breasts stuck full of swords arranged in a halfcircle like a modern fan of actual skeletons of dead saints hideously attired in gaudy satins silks and velvets trimmed with gold their withered crust of skull adorned with precious jewels or with chaplets of crushed flowers sometimes of people gathered round the pulpit and a monk within it stretching out the crucifix and preaching fiercely  the sun just streaming down through some high window on the sailcloth stretched above him and across the church to keep his highpitched voice from being lost among the echoes of the roof  then my tired memory comes out upon a flight of steps where knots of people are asleep or basking in the light and strolls away among the rags and smells and palaces and hovels of an old italian street   on one saturday morning the eighth of march a man was beheaded here  nine or ten months before he had waylaid a bavarian countess travelling as a pilgrim to romealone and on foot of courseand performing it is said that act of piety for the fourth time  he saw her change a piece of gold at viterbo where he lived followed her bore her company on her journey for some forty miles or more on the treacherous pretext of protecting her attacked her in the fulfilment of his unrelenting purpose on the campagna within a very short distance of rome near to what is called but what is not the tomb of nero robbed her and beat her to death with her own pilgrims staff  he was newly married and gave some of her apparel to his wife  saying that he had bought it at a fair  she however who had seen the pilgrimcountess passing through their town recognised some trifle as having belonged to her  her husband then told her what he had done  she in confession told a priest and the man was taken within four days after the commission of the murder  there are no fixed times for the administration of justice or its execution in this unaccountable country and he had been in prison ever since  on the friday as he was dining with the other prisoners they came and told him he was to be beheaded next morning and took him away  it is very unusual to execute in lent but his crime being a very bad one it was deemed advisable to make an example of him at that time when great numbers of pilgrims were coming towards rome from all parts for the holy week  i heard of this on the friday evening and saw the bills up at the churches calling on the people to pray for the criminals soul  so i determined to go and see him executed  the beheading was appointed for fourteen and ahalf oclock roman time  or a quarter before nine in the forenoon  i had two friends with me and as we did not know but that the crowd might be very great we were on the spot by halfpast seven  the place of execution was near the church of san giovanni decollato a doubtful compliment to saint john the baptist in one of the impassable back streets without any footway of which a great part of rome is composeda street of rotten houses which do not seem to belong to anybody and do not seem to have ever been inhabited and certainly were never built on any plan or for any particular purpose and have no windowsashes and are a little like deserted breweries and might be warehouses but for having nothing in them  opposite to one of these a white house the scaffold was built  an untidy unpainted uncouth crazylooking thing of course  some seven feet high perhaps  with a tall gallowsshaped frame rising above it in which was the knife charged with a ponderous mass of iron all ready to descend and glittering brightly in the morning sun whenever it looked out now and then from behind a cloud  there were not many people lingering about and these were kept at a considerable distance from the scaffold by parties of the popes dragoons  two or three hundred footsoldiers were under arms standing at ease in clusters here and there and the officers were walking up and down in twos and threes chatting together and smoking cigars  at the end of the street was an open space where there would be a dustheap and piles of broken crockery and mounds of vegetable refuse but for such things being thrown anywhere and everywhere in rome and favouring no particular sort of locality  we got into a kind of washhouse belonging to a dwellinghouse on this spot and standing there in an old cart and on a heap of cartwheels piled against the wall looked through a large grated window at the scaffold and straight down the street beyond it until in consequence of its turning off abruptly to the left our perspective was brought to a sudden termination and had a corpulent officer in a cocked hat for its crowning feature  nine oclock struck and ten oclock struck and nothing happened all the bells of all the churches rang as usual  a little parliament of dogs assembled in the open space and chased each other in and out among the soldiers  fiercelooking romans of the lowest class in blue cloaks russet cloaks and rags uncloaked came and went and talked together  women and children fluttered on the skirts of the scanty crowd  one large muddy spot was left quite bare like a bald place on a mans head  a cigarmerchant with an earthen pot of charcoal ashes in one hand went up and down crying his wares  a pastrymerchant divided his attention between the scaffold and his customers  boys tried to climb up walls and tumbled down again  priests and monks elbowed a passage for themselves among the people and stood on tiptoe for a sight of the knife  then went away  artists in inconceivable hats of the middleages and beards thank heaven of no age at all flashed picturesque scowls about them from their stations in the throng one gentleman connected with the fine arts i presume went up and down in a pair of hessianboots with a red beard hanging down on his breast and his long and bright red hair plaited into two tails one on either side of his head which fell over his shoulders in front of him very nearly to his waist and were carefully entwined and braided  eleven oclock struck and still nothing happened  a rumour got about among the crowd that the criminal would not confess in which case the priests would keep him until the ave maria sunset for it is their merciful custom never finally to turn the crucifix away from a man at that pass as one refusing to be shriven and consequently a sinner abandoned of the saviour until then  people began to drop off  the officers shrugged their shoulders and looked doubtful  the dragoons who came riding up below our window every now and then to order an unlucky hackney coach or cart away as soon as it had comfortably established itself and was covered with exulting people but never before became imperious and quicktempered  the bald place hadnt a straggling hair upon it and the corpulent officer crowning the perspective took a world of snuff  suddenly there was a noise of trumpets  attention was among the footsoldiers instantly  they were marched up to the scaffold and formed round it  the dragoons galloped to their nearer stations too  the guillotine became the centre of a wood of bristling bayonets and shining sabres  the people closed round nearer on the flank of the soldiery  a long straggling stream of men and boys who had accompanied the procession from the prison came pouring into the open space  the bald spot was scarcely distinguishable from the rest  the cigar and pastrymerchants resigned all thoughts of business for the moment and abandoning themselves wholly to pleasure got good situations in the crowd the perspective ended now in a troop of dragoons  and the corpulent officer sword in hand looked hard at a church close to him which he could see but we the crowd could not  after a short delay some monks were seen approaching to the scaffold from this church and above their heads coming on slowly and gloomily the effigy of christ upon the cross canopied with black  this was carried round the foot of the scaffold to the front and turned towards the criminal that he might see it to the last  it was hardly in its place when he appeared on the platform barefooted his hands bound and with the collar and neck of his shirt cut away almost to the shoulder  a young man sixandtwentyvigorously made and wellshaped  face pale small dark moustache and dark brown hair  he had refused to confess it seemed without first having his wife brought to see him and they had sent an escort for her which had occasioned the delay  he immediately kneeled down below the knife  his neck fitting into a hole made for the purpose in a cross plank was shut down by another plank above exactly like the pillory  immediately below him was a leathern bag  and into it his head rolled instantly  the executioner was holding it by the hair and walking with it round the scaffold showing it to the people before one quite knew that the knife had fallen heavily and with a rattling sound  when it had travelled round the four sides of the scaffold it was set upon a pole in fronta little patch of black and white for the long street to stare at and the flies to settle on  the eyes were turned upward as if he had avoided the sight of the leathern bag and looked to the crucifix  every tinge and hue of life had left it in that instant  it was dull cold livid wax  the body also  there was a great deal of blood  when we left the window and went close up to the scaffold it was very dirty one of the two men who were throwing water over it turning to help the other lift the body into a shell picked his way as through mire  a strange appearance was the apparent annihilation of the neck  the head was taken off so close that it seemed as if the knife had narrowly escaped crushing the jaw or shaving off the ear and the body looked as if there were nothing left above the shoulder  nobody cared or was at all affected  there was no manifestation of disgust or pity or indignation or sorrow  my empty pockets were tried several times in the crowd immediately below the scaffold as the corpse was being put into its coffin  it was an ugly filthy careless sickening spectacle meaning nothing but butchery beyond the momentary interest to the one wretched actor yes  such a sight has one meaning and one warning  let me not forget it  the speculators in the lottery station themselves at favourable points for counting the gouts of blood that spirt out here or there and buy that number  it is pretty sure to have a run upon it  the body was carted away in due time the knife cleansed the scaffold taken down and all the hideous apparatus removed  the executioner  an outlaw ex officio what a satire on the punishment who dare not for his life cross the bridge of st angelo but to do his work  retreated to his lair and the show was over   at the head of the collections in the palaces of rome the vatican of course with its treasures of art its enormous galleries and staircases and suites upon suites of immense chambers ranks highest and stands foremost  many most noble statues and wonderful pictures are there nor is it heresy to say that there is a considerable amount of rubbish there too  when any old piece of sculpture dug out of the ground finds a place in a gallery because it is old and without any reference to its intrinsic merits  and finds admirers by the hundred because it is there and for no other reason on earth  there will be no lack of objects very indifferent in the plain eyesight of any one who employs so vulgar a property when he may wear the spectacles of cant for less than nothing and establish himself as a man of taste for the mere trouble of putting them on  i unreservedly confess for myself that i cannot leave my natural perception of what is natural and true at a palacedoor in italy or elsewhere as i should leave my shoes if i were travelling in the east  i cannot forget that there are certain expressions of face natural to certain passions and as unchangeable in their nature as the gait of a lion or the flight of an eagle  i cannot dismiss from my certain knowledge such commonplace facts as the ordinary proportion of mens arms and legs and heads and when i meet with performances that do violence to these experiences and recollections no matter where they may be i cannot honestly admire them and think it best to say so in spite of high critical advice that we should sometimes feign an admiration though we have it not  therefore i freely acknowledge that when i see a jolly young waterman representing a cherubim or a barclay and perkinss drayman depicted as an evangelist i see nothing to commend or admire in the performance however great its reputed painter neither am i partial to libellous angels who play on fiddles and bassoons for the edification of sprawling monks apparently in liquor  nor to those monsieur tonsons of galleries saint francis and saint sebastian both of whom i submit should have very uncommon and rare merits as works of art to justify their compound multiplication by italian painters  it seems to me too that the indiscriminate and determined raptures in which some critics indulge is incompatible with the true appreciation of the really great and transcendent works  i cannot imagine for example how the resolute champion of undeserving pictures can soar to the amazing beauty of titians great picture of the assumption of the virgin at venice or how the man who is truly affected by the sublimity of that exquisite production or who is truly sensible of the beauty of tintorettos great picture of the assembly of the blessed in the same place can discern in michael angelos last judgment in the sistine chapel any general idea or one pervading thought in harmony with the stupendous subject  he who will contemplate raphaels masterpiece the transfiguration and will go away into another chamber of that same vatican and contemplate another design of raphael representing in incredible caricature the miraculous stopping of a great fire by leo the fourthand who will say that he admires them both as works of extraordinary geniusmust as i think be wanting in his powers of perception in one of the two instances and probably in the high and lofty one  it is easy to suggest a doubt but i have a great doubt whether sometimes the rules of art are not too strictly observed and whether it is quite well or agreeable that we should know beforehand where this figure will be turning round and where that figure will be lying down and where there will be drapery in folds and so forth  when i observe heads inferior to the subject in pictures of merit in italian galleries i do not attach that reproach to the painter for i have a suspicion that these great men who were of necessity very much in the hands of monks and priests painted monks and priests a great deal too often  i frequently see in pictures of real power heads quite below the story and the painter  and i invariably observe that those heads are of the convent stamp and have their counterparts among the convent inmates of this hour so i have settled with myself that in such cases the lameness was not with the painter but with the vanity and ignorance of certain of his employers who would be apostleson canvas at all events  the exquisite grace and beauty of canovas statues the wonderful gravity and repose of many of the ancient works in sculpture both in the capitol and the vatican and the strength and fire of many others are in their different ways beyond all reach of words they are especially impressive and delightful after the works of bernini and his disciples in which the churches of rome from st peters downward abound and which are i verily believe the most detestable class of productions in the wide world  i would infinitely rather as mere works of art look upon the three deities of the past the present and the future in the chinese collection than upon the best of these breezy maniacs whose every fold of drapery is blown insideout whose smallest vein or artery is as big as an ordinary forefinger whose hair is like a nest of lively snakes and whose attitudes put all other extravagance to shame  insomuch that i do honestly believe there can be no place in the world where such intolerable abortions begotten of the sculptors chisel are to be found in such profusion as in rome  there is a fine collection of egyptian antiquities in the vatican and the ceilings of the rooms in which they are arranged are painted to represent a starlight sky in the desert  it may seem an odd idea but it is very effective  the grim halfhuman monsters from the temples look more grim and monstrous underneath the deep dark blue it sheds a strange uncertain gloomy air on everythinga mystery adapted to the objects and you leave them as you find them shrouded in a solemn night  in the private palaces pictures are seen to the best advantage there are seldom so many in one place that the attention need become distracted or the eye confused  you see them very leisurely and are rarely interrupted by a crowd of people  there are portraits innumerable by titian and rembrandt and vandyke heads by guido and domenichino and carlo dolci various subjects by correggio and murillo and raphael and salvator rosa and spagnolettomany of which it would be difficult indeed to praise too highly or to praise enough such is their tenderness and grace their noble elevation purity and beauty  the portrait of beatrice di cenci in the palazzo berberini is a picture almost impossible to be forgotten  through the transcendent sweetness and beauty of the face there is a something shining out that haunts me  i see it now as i see this paper or my pen  the head is loosely draped in white the light hair falling down below the linen folds  she has turned suddenly towards you and there is an expression in the eyesalthough they are very tender and gentleas if the wildness of a momentary terror or distraction had been struggled with and overcome that instant and nothing but a celestial hope and a beautiful sorrow and a desolate earthly helplessness remained  some stories say that guido painted it the night before her execution some other stories that he painted it from memory after having seen her on her way to the scaffold  i am willing to believe that as you see her on his canvas so she turned towards him in the crowd from the first sight of the axe and stamped upon his mind a look which he has stamped on mine as though i had stood beside him in the concourse  the guilty palace of the cenci  blighting a whole quarter of the town as it stands withering away by grains  had that face to my fancy in its dismal porch and at its black blind windows and flitting up and down its dreary stairs and growing out of the darkness of the ghostly galleries  the history is written in the painting written in the dying girls face by natures own hand  and oh how in that one touch she puts to flight instead of making kin the puny world that claim to be related to her in right of poor conventional forgeries  i saw in the palazzo spada the statue of pompey the statue at whose base caesar fell  a stern tremendous figure  i imagined one of greater finish  of the last refinement  full of delicate touches  losing its distinctness in the giddy eyes of one whose blood was ebbing before it and settling into some such rigid majesty as this as death came creeping over the upturned face  the excursions in the neighbourhood of rome are charming and would be full of interest were it only for the changing views they afford of the wild campagna  but every inch of ground in every direction is rich in associations and in natural beauties  there is albano with its lovely lake and wooded shore and with its wine that certainly has not improved since the days of horace and in these times hardly justifies his panegyric  there is squalid tivoli with the river anio diverted from its course and plunging down headlong some eighty feet in search of it  with its picturesque temple of the sibyl perched high on a crag its minor waterfalls glancing and sparkling in the sun and one good cavern yawning darkly where the river takes a fearful plunge and shoots on low down under beetling rocks  there too is the villa deste deserted and decaying among groves of melancholy pine and cypress trees where it seems to lie in state  then there is frascati and on the steep above it the ruins of tusculum where cicero lived and wrote and adorned his favourite house some fragments of it may yet be seen there and where cato was born we saw its ruined amphitheatre on a grey dull day when a shrill march wind was blowing and when the scattered stones of the old city lay strewn about the lonely eminence as desolate and dead as the ashes of a long extinguished fire  one day we walked out a little party of three to albano fourteen miles distant possessed by a great desire to go there by the ancient appian way long since ruined and overgrown  we started at halfpast seven in the morning and within an hour or so were out upon the open campagna  for twelve miles we went climbing on over an unbroken succession of mounds and heaps and hills of ruin tombs and temples overthrown and prostrate small fragments of columns friezes pediments great blocks of granite and marble mouldering arches grassgrown and decayed ruin enough to build a spacious city from lay strewn about us  sometimes loose walls built up from these fragments by the shepherds came across our path sometimes a ditch between two mounds of broken stones obstructed our progress sometimes the fragments themselves rolling from beneath our feet made it a toilsome matter to advance but it was always ruin  now we tracked a piece of the old road above the ground now traced it underneath a grassy covering as if that were its grave but all the way was ruin  in the distance ruined aqueducts went stalking on their giant course along the plain and every breath of wind that swept towards us stirred early flowers and grasses springing up spontaneously on miles of ruin  the unseen larks above us who alone disturbed the awful silence had their nests in ruin and the fierce herdsmen clad in sheepskins who now and then scowled out upon us from their sleeping nooks were housed in ruin  the aspect of the desolate campagna in one direction where it was most level reminded me of an american prairie but what is the solitude of a region where men have never dwelt to that of a desert where a mighty race have left their footprints in the earth from which they have vanished where the restingplaces of their dead have fallen like their dead and the broken hourglass of time is but a heap of idle dust returning by the road at sunset and looking from the distance on the course we had taken in the morning i almost feel as i had felt when i first saw it at that hour as if the sun would never rise again but looked its last that night upon a ruined world  to come again on rome by moonlight after such an expedition is a fitting close to such a day  the narrow streets devoid of footways and choked in every obscure corner by heaps of dunghillrubbish contrast so strongly in their cramped dimensions and their filth and darkness with the broad square before some haughty church  in the centre of which a hieroglyphiccovered obelisk brought from egypt in the days of the emperors looks strangely on the foreign scene about it or perhaps an ancient pillar with its honoured statue overthrown supports a christian saint  marcus aurelius giving place to paul and trajan to st peter  then there are the ponderous buildings reared from the spoliation of the coliseum shutting out the moon like mountains  while here and there are broken arches and rent walls through which it gushes freely as the life comes pouring from a wound  the little town of miserable houses walled and shut in by barred gates is the quarter where the jews are locked up nightly when the clock strikes eighta miserable place densely populated and reeking with bad odours but where the people are industrious and moneygetting  in the daytime as you make your way along the narrow streets you see them all at work  upon the pavement oftener than in their dark and frouzy shops  furbishing old clothes and driving bargains  crossing from these patches of thick darkness out into the moon once more the fountain of trevi welling from a hundred jets and rolling over mimic rocks is silvery to the eye and ear  in the narrow little throat of street beyond a booth dressed out with flaring lamps and boughs of trees attracts a group of sulky romans round its smoky coppers of hot broth and cauliflower stew its trays of fried fish and its flasks of wine  as you rattle round the sharplytwisting corner a lumbering sound is heard  the coachman stops abruptly and uncovers as a van comes slowly by preceded by a man who bears a large cross by a torchbearer and a priest  the latter chaunting as he goes  it is the dead cart with the bodies of the poor on their way to burial in the sacred field outside the walls where they will be thrown into the pit that will be covered with a stone tonight and sealed up for a year  but whether in this ride you pass by obelisks or columns ancient temples theatres houses porticoes or forums  it is strange to see how every fragment whenever it is possible has been blended into some modern structure and made to serve some modern purpose a wall a dwellingplace a granary a stablesome use for which it never was designed and associated with which it cannot otherwise than lamely assort  it is stranger still to see how many ruins of the old mythology  how many fragments of obsolete legend and observance  have been incorporated into the worship of christian altars here and how in numberless respects the false faith and the true are fused into a monstrous union  from one part of the city looking out beyond the walls a squat and stunted pyramid the burialplace of caius cestius makes an opaque triangle in the moonlight  but to an english traveller it serves to mark the grave of shelley too whose ashes lie beneath a little garden near it  nearer still almost within its shadow lie the bones of keats whose name is writ in water that shines brightly in the landscape of a calm italian night  the holy week in rome is supposed to offer great attractions to all visitors but saving for the sights of easter sunday i would counsel those who go to rome for its own interest to avoid it at that time  the ceremonies in general are of the most tedious and wearisome kind the heat and crowd at every one of them painfully oppressive the noise hubbub and confusion quite distracting we abandoned the pursuit of these shows very early in the proceedings and betook ourselves to the ruins again  but we plunged into the crowd for a share of the best of the sights and what we saw i will describe to you  at the sistine chapel on the wednesday we saw very little for by the time we reached it though we were early the besieging crowd had filled it to the door and overflowed into the adjoining hall where they were struggling and squeezing and mutually expostulating and making great rushes every time a lady was brought out faint as if at least fifty people could be accommodated in her vacant standingroom  hanging in the doorway of the chapel was a heavy curtain and this curtain some twenty people nearest to it in their anxiety to hear the chaunting of the miserere were continually plucking at in opposition to each other that it might not fall down and stifle the sound of the voices  the consequence was that it occasioned the most extraordinary confusion and seemed to wind itself about the unwary like a serpent  now a lady was wrapped up in it and couldnt be unwound  now the voice of a stifling gentleman was heard inside it beseeching to be let out  now two muffled arms no man could say of which sex struggled in it as in a sack  now it was carried by a rush bodily overhead into the chapel like an awning  now it came out the other way and blinded one of the popes swiss guard who had arrived that moment to set things to rights  being seated at a little distance among two or three of the popes gentlemen who were very weary and counting the minutesas perhaps his holiness was toowe had better opportunities of observing this eccentric entertainment than of hearing the miserere  sometimes there was a swell of mournful voices that sounded very pathetic and sad and died away into a low strain again but that was all we heard  at another time there was the exhibition of relics in st peters which took place at between six and seven oclock in the evening and was striking from the cathedral being dark and gloomy and having a great many people in it  the place into which the relics were brought one by one by a party of three priests was a high balcony near the chief altar  this was the only lighted part of the church  there are always a hundred and twelve lamps burning near the altar and there were two tall tapers besides near the black statue of st peter but these were nothing in such an immense edifice  the gloom and the general upturning of faces to the balcony and the prostration of true believers on the pavement as shining objects like pictures or lookingglasses were brought out and shown had something effective in it despite the very preposterous manner in which they were held up for the general edification and the great elevation at which they were displayed which one would think rather calculated to diminish the comfort derivable from a full conviction of their being genuine  on the thursday we went to see the pope convey the sacrament from the sistine chapel to deposit it in the capella paolina another chapel in the vaticana ceremony emblematical of the entombment of the saviour before his resurrection  we waited in a great gallery with a great crowd of people threefourths of them english for an hour or so while they were chaunting the miserere in the sistine chapel again  both chapels opened out of the gallery and the general attention was concentrated on the occasional opening and shutting of the door of the one for which the pope was ultimately bound  none of these openings disclosed anything more tremendous than a man on a ladder lighting a great quantity of candles but at each and every opening there was a terrific rush made at this ladder and this man something like i should think a charge of the heavy british cavalry at waterloo the man was never brought down however nor the ladder for it performed the strangest antics in the world among the crowdwhere it was carried by the man when the candles were all lighted and finally it was stuck up against the gallery wall in a very disorderly manner just before the opening of the other chapel and the commencement of a new chaunt announced the approach of his holiness  at this crisis the soldiers of the guard who had been poking the crowd into all sorts of shapes formed down the gallery and the procession came up between the two lines they made  there were a few choristers and then a great many priests walking two and two and carryingthe goodlooking priests at leasttheir lighted tapers so as to throw the light with a good effect upon their faces  for the room was darkened  those who were not handsome or who had not long beards carried their tapers anyhow and abandoned themselves to spiritual contemplation  meanwhile the chaunting was very monotonous and dreary  the procession passed on slowly into the chapel and the drone of voices went on and came on with it until the pope himself appeared walking under a white satin canopy and bearing the covered sacrament in both hands cardinals and canons clustered round him making a brilliant show  the soldiers of the guard knelt down as he passed all the bystanders bowed and so he passed on into the chapel  the white satin canopy being removed from over him at the door and a white satin parasol hoisted over his poor old head in place of it a few more couples brought up the rear and passed into the chapel also  then the chapel door was shut and it was all over and everybody hurried off headlong as for life or death to see something else and say it wasnt worth the trouble  i think the most popular and most crowded sight excepting those of easter sunday and monday which are open to all classes of people was the pope washing the feet of thirteen men representing the twelve apostles and judas iscariot  the place in which this pious office is performed is one of the chapels of st peters which is gaily decorated for the occasion the thirteen sitting all of a row on a very high bench and looking particularly uncomfortable with the eyes of heaven knows how many english french americans swiss germans russians swedes norwegians and other foreigners nailed to their faces all the time  they are robed in white and on their heads they wear a stiff white cap like a large english porterpot without a handle  each carries in his hand a nosegay of the size of a fine cauliflower and two of them on this occasion wore spectacles which remembering the characters they sustained i thought a droll appendage to the costume  there was a great eye to character  st john was represented by a goodlooking young man  st peter by a gravelooking old gentleman with a flowing brown beard and judas iscariot by such an enormous hypocrite i could not make out though whether the expression of his face was real or assumed that if he had acted the part to the death and had gone away and hanged himself he would have left nothing to be desired  as the two large boxes appropriated to ladies at this sight were full to the throat and getting near was hopeless we posted off along with a great crowd to be in time at the table where the pope in person waits on these thirteen and after a prodigious struggle at the vatican staircase and several personal conflicts with the swiss guard the whole crowd swept into the room  it was a long gallery hung with drapery of white and red with another great box for ladies who are obliged to dress in black at these ceremonies and to wear black veils a royal box for the king of naples and his party and the table itself which set out like a ball supper and ornamented with golden figures of the real apostles was arranged on an elevated platform on one side of the gallery  the counterfeit apostles knives and forks were laid out on that side of the table which was nearest to the wall so that they might be stared at again without let or hindrance  the body of the room was full of male strangers the crowd immense the heat very great and the pressure sometimes frightful  it was at its height when the stream came pouring in from the feet washing and then there were such shrieks and outcries that a party of piedmontese dragoons went to the rescue of the swiss guard and helped them to calm the tumult  the ladies were particularly ferocious in their struggles for places  one lady of my acquaintance was seized round the waist in the ladies box by a strong matron and hoisted out of her place and there was another lady in a back row in the same box who improved her position by sticking a large pin into the ladies before her  the gentlemen about me were remarkably anxious to see what was on the table and one englishman seemed to have embarked the whole energy of his nature in the determination to discover whether there was any mustard  by jupiter theres vinegar i heard him say to his friend after he had stood on tiptoe an immense time and had been crushed and beaten on all sides  and theres oil  i saw them distinctly in cruets  can any gentleman in front there see mustard on the table  sir will you oblige me  do you see a mustardpot  the apostles and judas appearing on the platform after much expectation were marshalled in line in front of the table with peter at the top and a good long stare was taken at them by the company while twelve of them took a long smell at their nosegays and judasmoving his lips very obtrusivelyengaged in inward prayer  then the pope clad in a scarlet robe and wearing on his head a skullcap of white satin appeared in the midst of a crowd of cardinals and other dignitaries and took in his hand a little golden ewer from which he poured a little water over one of peters hands while one attendant held a golden basin a second a fine cloth a third peters nosegay which was taken from him during the operation  this his holiness performed with considerable expedition on every man in the line judas i observed to be particularly overcome by his condescension and then the whole thirteen sat down to dinner  grace said by the pope  peter in the chair  there was white wine and red wine  and the dinner looked very good  the courses appeared in portions one for each apostle  and these being presented to the pope by cardinals upon their knees were by him handed to the thirteen  the manner in which judas grew more whitelivered over his victuals and languished with his head on one side as if he had no appetite defies all description peter was a good sound old man and went in as the saying is to win eating everything that was given him he got the best being first in the row and saying nothing to anybody  the dishes appeared to be chiefly composed of fish and vegetables  the pope helped the thirteen to wine also and during the whole dinner somebody read something aloud out of a large bookthe bible i presumewhich nobody could hear and to which nobody paid the least attention  the cardinals and other attendants smiled to each other from time to time as if the thing were a great farce and if they thought so there is little doubt they were perfectly right  his holiness did what he had to do as a sensible man gets through a troublesome ceremony and seemed very glad when it was all over  the pilgrims suppers  where lords and ladies waited on the pilgrims in token of humility and dried their feet when they had been well washed by deputy  were very attractive  but of all the many spectacles of dangerous reliance on outward observances in themselves mere empty forms none struck me half so much as the scala santa or holy staircase which i saw several times but to the greatest advantage or disadvantage on good friday  this holy staircase is composed of eightandtwenty steps said to have belonged to pontius pilates house and to be the identical stair on which our saviour trod in coming down from the judgment seat  pilgrims ascend it only on their knees  it is steep and at the summit is a chapel reported to be full of relics into which they peep through some iron bars and then come down again by one of two side staircases which are not sacred and may be walked on  on good friday there were on a moderate computation a hundred people slowly shuffling up these stairs on their knees at one time while others who were going up or had come downand a few who had done both and were going up again for the second time stood loitering in the porch below where an old gentleman in a sort of watchbox rattled a tin canister with a slit in the top incessantly to remind them that he took the money  the majority were countrypeople male and female  there were four or five jesuit priests however and some halfdozen welldressed women  a whole school of boys twenty at least were about halfway up evidently enjoying it very much  they were all wedged together pretty closely but the rest of the company gave the boys as wide a berth as possible in consequence of their betraying some recklessness in the management of their boots  i never in my life saw anything at once so ridiculous and so unpleasant as this sightridiculous in the absurd incidents inseparable from it and unpleasant in its senseless and unmeaning degradation  there are two steps to begin with and then a rather broad landing  the more rigid climbers went along this landing on their knees as well as up the stairs and the figures they cut in their shuffling progress over the level surface no description can paint  then to see them watch their opportunity from the porch and cut in where there was a place next the wall  and to see one man with an umbrella brought on purpose for it was a fine day hoisting himself unlawfully from stair to stair  and to observe a demure lady of fiftyfive or so looking back every now and then to assure herself that her legs were properly disposed  there were such odd differences in the speed of different people too  some got on as if they were doing a match against time others stopped to say a prayer on every step  this man touched every stair with his forehead and kissed it that man scratched his head all the way  the boys got on brilliantly and were up and down again before the old lady had accomplished her halfdozen stairs  but most of the penitents came down very sprightly and fresh as having done a real good substantial deed which it would take a good deal of sin to counterbalance and the old gentleman in the watchbox was down upon them with his canister while they were in this humour i promise you  as if such a progress were not in its nature inevitably droll enough there lay on the top of the stairs a wooden figure on a crucifix resting on a sort of great iron saucer  so rickety and unsteady that whenever an enthusiastic person kissed the figure with more than usual devotion or threw a coin into the saucer with more than common readiness for it served in this respect as a second or supplementary canister it gave a great leap and rattle and nearly shook the attendant lamp out  horribly frightening the people further down and throwing the guilty party into unspeakable embarrassment  on easter sunday as well as on the preceding thursday the pope bestows his benediction on the people from the balcony in front of st peters  this easter sunday was a day so bright and blue  so cloudless balmy wonderfully bright  that all the previous bad weather vanished from the recollection in a moment  i had seen the thursdays benediction dropping damply on some hundreds of umbrellas but there was not a sparkle then in all the hundred fountains of romesuch fountains as they areand on this sunday morning they were running diamonds  the miles of miserable streets through which we drove compelled to a certain course by the popes dragoons  the roman police on such occasions were so full of colour that nothing in them was capable of wearing a faded aspect the common people came out in their gayest dresses the richer people in their smartest vehicles cardinals rattled to the church of the poor fishermen in their state carriages shabby magnificence flaunted its threadbare liveries and tarnished cocked hats in the sun and every coach in rome was put in requisition for the great piazza of st peters  one hundred and fifty thousand people were there at least  yet there was ample room  how many carriages were there i dont know yet there was room for them too and to spare  the great steps of the church were densely crowded  there were many of the contadini from albano who delight in red in that part of the square and the mingling of bright colours in the crowd was beautiful  below the steps the troops were ranged  in the magnificent proportions of the place they looked like a bed of flowers  sulky romans lively peasants from the neighbouring country groups of pilgrims from distant parts of italy sightseeing foreigners of all nations made a murmur in the clear air like so many insects and high above them all plashing and bubbling and making rainbow colours in the light the two delicious fountains welled and tumbled bountifully  a kind of bright carpet was hung over the front of the balcony and the sides of the great window were bedecked with crimson drapery an awning was stretched too over the top to screen the old man from the hot rays of the sun  as noon approached all eyes were turned up to this window  in due time the chair was seen approaching to the front with the gigantic fans of peacocks feathers close behind  the doll within it for the balcony is very high then rose up and stretched out its tiny arms while all the male spectators in the square uncovered and some but not by any means the greater part kneeled down  the guns upon the ramparts of the castle of st angelo proclaimed next moment that the benediction was given drums beat trumpets sounded arms clashed and the great mass below suddenly breaking into smaller heaps and scattering here and there in rills was stirred like particoloured sand  what a bright noon it was as we rode away  the tiber was no longer yellow but blue  there was a blush on the old bridges that made them fresh and hale again  the pantheon with its majestic front all seamed and furrowed like an old face had summer light upon its battered walls  every squalid and desolate hut in the eternal city bear witness every grim old palace to the filth and misery of the plebeian neighbour that elbows it as certain as time has laid its grip on its patrician head was fresh and new with some ray of the sun  the very prison in the crowded street a whirl of carriages and people had some stray sense of the day dropping through its chinks and crevices  and dismal prisoners who could not wind their faces round the barricading of the blockedup windows stretched out their hands and clinging to the rusty bars turned them towards the overflowing street  as if it were a cheerful fire and could be shared in that way  but when the night came on without a cloud to dim the full moon what a sight it was to see the great square full once more and the whole church from the cross to the ground lighted with innumerable lanterns tracing out the architecture and winking and shining all round the colonnade of the piazza  and what a sense of exultation joy delight it was when the great bell struck half past sevenon the instantto behold one bright red mass of fire soar gallantly from the top of the cupola to the extremest summit of the cross and the moment it leaped into its place become the signal of a bursting out of countless lights as great and red and blazing as itself from every part of the gigantic church so that every cornice capital and smallest ornament of stone expressed itself in fire  and the black solid groundwork of the enormous dome seemed to grow transparent as an eggshell  a train of gunpowder an electric chainnothing could be fired more suddenly and swiftly than this second illumination and when we had got away and gone upon a distant height and looked towards it two hours afterwards there it still stood shining and glittering in the calm night like a jewel  not a line of its proportions wanting not an angle blunted not an atom of its radiance lost  the next nighteaster mondaythere was a great display of fireworks from the castle of st angelo  we hired a room in an opposite house and made our way to our places in good time through a dense mob of people choking up the square in front and all the avenues leading to it and so loading the bridge by which the castle is approached that it seemed ready to sink into the rapid tiber below  there are statues on this bridge execrable works and among them great vessels full of burning tow were placed  glaring strangely on the faces of the crowd and not less strangely on the stone counterfeits above them  the show began with a tremendous discharge of cannon and then for twenty minutes or half an hour the whole castle was one incessant sheet of fire and labyrinth of blazing wheels of every colour size and speed  while rockets streamed into the sky not by ones or twos or scores but hundreds at a time  the concluding burst the girandolawas like the blowing up into the air of the whole massive castle without smoke or dust  in half an hour afterwards the immense concourse had dispersed the moon was looking calmly down upon her wrinkled image in the river and halfadozen men and boys with bits of lighted candle in their hands  moving here and there in search of anything worth having that might have been dropped in the press  had the whole scene to themselves  by way of contrast we rode out into old ruined rome after all this firing and booming to take our leave of the coliseum  i had seen it by moonlight before i could never get through a day without going back to it but its tremendous solitude that night is past all telling  the ghostly pillars in the forum the triumphal arches of old emperors those enormous masses of ruins which were once their palaces the grassgrown mounds that mark the graves of ruined temples the stones of the via sacra smooth with the tread of feet in ancient rome even these were dimmed in their transcendent melancholy by the dark ghost of its bloody holidays erect and grim haunting the old scene despoiled by pillaging popes and fighting princes but not laid wringing wild hands of weed and grass and bramble and lamenting to the night in every gap and broken archthe shadow of its awful self immovable  as we lay down on the grass of the campagna next day on our way to florence hearing the larks sing we saw that a little wooden cross had been erected on the spot where the poor pilgrim countess was murdered  so we piled some loose stones about it as the beginning of a mound to her memory and wondered if we should ever rest there again and look back at rome    chapter xia rapid diorama    we are bound for naples  and we cross the threshold of the eternal city at yonder gate the gate of san giovanni laterano where the two last objects that attract the notice of a departing visitor and the two first objects that attract the notice of an arriving one are a proud church and a decaying ruingood emblems of rome  our way lies over the campagna which looks more solemn on a bright blue day like this than beneath a darker sky the great extent of ruin being plainer to the eye  and the sunshine through the arches of the broken aqueducts showing other broken arches shining through them in the melancholy distance  when we have traversed it and look back from albano its dark undulating surface lies below us like a stagnant lake or like a broad dull lethe flowing round the walls of rome and separating it from all the world  how often have the legions in triumphant march gone glittering across that purple waste so silent and unpeopled now  how often has the train of captives looked with sinking hearts upon the distant city and beheld its population pouring out to hail the return of their conqueror  what riot sensuality and murder have run mad in the vast palaces now heaps of brick and shattered marble  what glare of fires and roar of popular tumult and wail of pestilence and famine have come sweeping over the wild plain where nothing is now heard but the wind and where the solitary lizards gambol unmolested in the sun  the train of winecarts going into rome each driven by a shaggy peasant reclining beneath a little gipsyfashioned canopy of sheep skin is ended now and we go toiling up into a higher country where there are trees  the next day brings us on the pontine marshes wearily flat and lonesome and overgrown with brushwood and swamped with water but with a fine road made across them shaded by a long long avenue  here and there we pass a solitary guardhouse here and there a hovel deserted and walled up  some herdsmen loiter on the banks of the stream beside the road and sometimes a flatbottomed boat towed by a man comes rippling idly along it  a horseman passes occasionally carrying a long gun crosswise on the saddle before him and attended by fierce dogs but there is nothing else astir save the wind and the shadows until we come in sight of terracina  how blue and bright the sea rolling below the windows of the inn so famous in robber stories  how picturesque the great crags and points of rock overhanging tomorrows narrow road where galley slaves are working in the quarries above and the sentinels who guard them lounge on the seashore  all night there is the murmur of the sea beneath the stars and in the morning just at daybreak the prospect suddenly becoming expanded as if by a miracle revealsin the far distance across the sea there naples with its islands and vesuvius spouting fire  within a quarter of an hour the whole is gone as if it were a vision in the clouds and there is nothing but the sea and sky  the neapolitan frontier crossed after two hours travelling and the hungriest of soldiers and customhouse officers with difficulty appeased we enter by a gateless portal into the first neapolitan townfondi  take note of fondi in the name of all that is wretched and beggarly  a filthy channel of mud and refuse meanders down the centre of the miserable streets fed by obscene rivulets that trickle from the abject houses  there is not a door a window or a shutter not a roof a wall a post or a pillar in all fondi but is decayed and crazy and rotting away  the wretched history of the town with all its sieges and pillages by barbarossa and the rest might have been acted last year  how the gaunt dogs that sneak about the miserable streets come to be alive and undevoured by the people is one of the enigmas of the world  a hollowcheeked and scowling people they are  all beggars but thats nothing  look at them as they gather round  some are too indolent to come downstairs or are too wisely mistrustful of the stairs perhaps to venture  so stretch out their lean hands from upper windows and howl others come flocking about us fighting and jostling one another and demanding incessantly charity for the love of god charity for the love of the blessed virgin charity for the love of all the saints  a group of miserable children almost naked screaming forth the same petition discover that they can see themselves reflected in the varnish of the carriage and begin to dance and make grimaces that they may have the pleasure of seeing their antics repeated in this mirror  a crippled idiot in the act of striking one of them who drowns his clamorous demand for charity observes his angry counterpart in the panel stops short and thrusting out his tongue begins to wag his head and chatter  the shrill cry raised at this awakens halfa dozen wild creatures wrapped in frowsy brown cloaks who are lying on the churchsteps with pots and pans for sale  these scrambling up approach and beg defiantly  i am hungry  give me something listen to me signor  i am hungry  then a ghastly old woman fearful of being too late comes hobbling down the street stretching out one hand and scratching herself all the way with the other and screaming long before she can be heard charity charity  ill go and pray for you directly beautiful lady if youll give me charity  lastly the members of a brotherhood for burying the dead  hideously masked and attired in shabby black robes white at the skirts with the splashes of many muddy winters  escorted by a dirty priest and a congenial crossbearer come hurrying past  surrounded by this motley concourse we move out of fondi  bad bright eyes glaring at us out of the darkness of every crazy tenement like glistening fragments of its filth and putrefaction  a noble mountainpass with the ruins of a fort on a strong eminence traditionally called the fort of fra diavolo the old town of itri like a device in pastry built up almost perpendicularly on a hill and approached by long steep flights of steps beautiful mola di gaeta whose wines like those of albano have degenerated since the days of horace or his taste for wine was bad  which is not likely of one who enjoyed it so much and extolled it so well another night upon the road at st agatha a rest next day at capua which is picturesque but hardly so seductive to a traveller now as the soldiers of praetorian rome were wont to find the ancient city of that name a flat road among vines festooned and looped from tree to tree and mount vesuvius close at hand at lastits cone and summit whitened with snow and its smoke hanging over it in the heavy atmosphere of the day like a dense cloud  so we go rattling down hill into naples  a funeral is coming up the street towards us  the body on an open bier borne on a kind of palanquin covered with a gay cloth of crimson and gold  the mourners in white gowns and masks  if there be death abroad life is well represented too for all naples would seem to be out of doors and tearing to and fro in carriages some of these the common vetturino vehicles are drawn by three horses abreast decked with smart trappings and great abundance of brazen ornament and always going very fast  not that their loads are light for the smallest of them has at least six people inside four in front four or five more hanging on behind and two or three more in a net or bag below the axletree where they lie halfsuffocated with mud and dust  exhibitors of punch buffo singers with guitars reciters of poetry reciters of stories a row of cheap exhibitions with clowns and showmen drums and trumpets painted cloths representing the wonders within and admiring crowds assembled without assist the whirl and bustle ragged lazzaroni lie asleep in doorways archways and kennels the gentry gaily dressed are dashing up and down in carriages on the chiaji or walking in the public gardens and quiet letterwriters perched behind their little desks and inkstands under the portico of the great theatre of san carlo in the public street are waiting for clients  here is a galleyslave in chains who wants a letter written to a friend  he approaches a clerklylooking man sitting under the corner arch and makes his bargain  he has obtained permission of the sentinel who guards him  who stands near leaning against the wall and cracking nuts  the galleyslave dictates in the ear of the letterwriter what he desires to say and as he cant read writing looks intently in his face to read there whether he sets down faithfully what he is told  after a time the galleyslave becomes discursiveincoherent  the secretary pauses and rubs his chin  the galleyslave is voluble and energetic  the secretary at length catches the idea and with the air of a man who knows how to word it sets it down stopping now and then to glance back at his text admiringly  the galleyslave is silent  the soldier stoically cracks his nuts  is there anything more to say inquires the letterwriter  no more  then listen friend of mine he reads it through  the galleyslave is quite enchanted  it is folded and addressed and given to him and he pays the fee  the secretary falls back indolently in his chair and takes a book the galleyslave gathers up an empty sack  the sentinel throws away a handful of nutshells shoulders his musket and away they go together  why do the beggars rap their chins constantly with their right hands when you look at them  everything is done in pantomime in naples and that is the conventional sign for hunger  a man who is quarrelling with another yonder lays the palm of his right hand on the back of his left and shakes the two thumbsexpressive of a donkeys earswhereat his adversary is goaded to desperation  two people bargaining for fish the buyer empties an imaginary waistcoat pocket when he is told the price and walks away without a word  having thoroughly conveyed to the seller that he considers it too dear  two people in carriages meeting one touches his lips twice or thrice holding up the five fingers of his right hand and gives a horizontal cut in the air with the palm  the other nods briskly and goes his way  he has been invited to a friendly dinner at halfpast five oclock and will certainly come  all over italy a peculiar shake of the right hand from the wrist with the forefinger stretched out expresses a negativethe only negative beggars will ever understand  but in naples those five fingers are a copious language  all this and every other kind of outdoor life and stir and macaronieating at sunset and flowerselling all day long and begging and stealing everywhere and at all hours you see upon the bright seashore where the waves of the bay sparkle merrily  but lovers and hunters of the picturesque let us not keep too studiously out of view the miserable depravity degradation and wretchedness with which this gay neapolitan life is inseparably associated  it is not well to find saint giless so repulsive and the porta capuana so attractive  a pair of naked legs and a ragged red scarf do not make all the difference between what is interesting and what is coarse and odious  painting and poetising for ever if you will the beauties of this most beautiful and lovely spot of earth let us as our duty try to associate a new picturesque with some faint recognition of mans destiny and capabilities more hopeful i believe among the ice and snow of the north pole than in the sun and bloom of naples  caprionce made odious by the deified beast tiberiusischia procida and the thousand distant beauties of the bay lie in the blue sea yonder changing in the mist and sunshine twenty times a day  now close at hand now far off now unseen  the fairest country in the world is spread about us  whether we turn towards the miseno shore of the splendid watery amphitheatre and go by the grotto of posilipo to the grotto del cane and away to baiae  or take the other way towards vesuvius and sorrento it is one succession of delights  in the lastnamed direction where over doors and archways there are countless little images of san gennaro with his canutes hand stretched out to check the fury of the burning mountain we are carried pleasantly by a railroad on the beautiful sea beach past the town of torre del greco built upon the ashes of the former town destroyed by an eruption of vesuvius within a hundred years and past the flatroofed houses granaries and macaroni manufactories to castelamare with its ruined castle now inhabited by fishermen standing in the sea upon a heap of rocks  here the railroad terminates but hence we may ride on by an unbroken succession of enchanting bays and beautiful scenery sloping from the highest summit of saint angelo the highest neighbouring mountain down to the waters edgeamong vineyards olivetrees gardens of oranges and lemons orchards heapedup rocks green gorges in the hillsand by the bases of snowcovered heights and through small towns with handsome dark haired women at the doorsand pass delicious summer villasto sorrento where the poet tasso drew his inspiration from the beauty surrounding him  returning we may climb the heights above castel amare and looking down among the boughs and leaves see the crisp water glistening in the sun and clusters of white houses in distant naples dwindling in the great extent of prospect down to dice  the coming back to the city by the beach again at sunset with the glowing sea on one side and the darkening mountain with its smoke and flame upon the other  is a sublime conclusion to the glory of the day  that church by the porta capuananear the old fishermarket in the dirtiest quarter of dirty naples where the revolt of masaniello beganis memorable for having been the scene of one of his earliest proclamations to the people and is particularly remarkable for nothing else unless it be its waxen and bejewelled saint in a glass case with two odd hands or the enormous number of beggars who are constantly rapping their chins there like a battery of castanets  the cathedral with the beautiful door and the columns of african and egyptian granite that once ornamented the temple of apollo contains the famous sacred blood of san gennaro or januarius  which is preserved in two phials in a silver tabernacle and miraculously liquefies three times ayear to the great admiration of the people  at the same moment the stone distant some miles where the saint suffered martyrdom becomes faintly red  it is said that the officiating priests turn faintly red also sometimes when these miracles occur  the old old men who live in hovels at the entrance of these ancient catacombs and who in their age and infirmity seem waiting here to be buried themselves are members of a curious body called the royal hospital who are the official attendants at funerals  two of these old spectres totter away with lighted tapers to show the caverns of deathas unconcerned as if they were immortal  they were used as buryingplaces for three hundred years and in one part is a large pit full of skulls and bones said to be the sad remains of a great mortality occasioned by a plague  in the rest there is nothing but dust  they consist chiefly of great wide corridors and labyrinths hewn out of the rock  at the end of some of these long passages are unexpected glimpses of the daylight shining down from above  it looks as ghastly and as strange among the torches and the dust and the dark vaults  as if it too were dead and buried  the present burialplace lies out yonder on a hill between the city and vesuvius  the old campo santo with its three hundred and sixtyfive pits is only used for those who die in hospitals and prisons and are unclaimed by their friends  the graceful new cemetery at no great distance from it though yet unfinished has already many graves among its shrubs and flowers and airy colonnades  it might be reasonably objected elsewhere that some of the tombs are meretricious and too fanciful but the general brightness seems to justify it here and mount vesuvius separated from them by a lovely slope of ground exalts and saddens the scene  if it be solemn to behold from this new city of the dead with its dark smoke hanging in the clear sky how much more awful and impressive is it viewed from the ghostly ruins of herculaneum and pompeii  stand at the bottom of the great marketplace of pompeii and look up the silent streets through the ruined temples of jupiter and isis over the broken houses with their inmost sanctuaries open to the day away to mount vesuvius bright and snowy in the peaceful distance and lose all count of time and heed of other things in the strange and melancholy sensation of seeing the destroyed and the destroyer making this quiet picture in the sun  then ramble on and see at every turn the little familiar tokens of human habitation and everyday pursuits the chafing of the bucketrope in the stone rim of the exhausted well the track of carriage wheels in the pavement of the street the marks of drinkingvessels on the stone counter of the wineshop the amphorae in private cellars stored away so many hundred years ago and undisturbed to this hourall rendering the solitude and deadly lonesomeness of the place ten thousand times more solemn than if the volcano in its fury had swept the city from the earth and sunk it in the bottom of the sea  after it was shaken by the earthquake which preceded the eruption workmen were employed in shaping out in stone new ornaments for temples and other buildings that had suffered  here lies their work outside the city gate as if they would return tomorrow  in the cellar of diomedes house where certain skeletons were found huddled together close to the door the impression of their bodies on the ashes hardened with the ashes and became stamped and fixed there after they had shrunk inside to scanty bones so in the theatre of herculaneum a comic mask floating on the stream when it was hot and liquid stamped its mimic features in it as it hardened into stone and now it turns upon the stranger the fantastic look it turned upon the audiences in that same theatre two thousand years ago  next to the wonder of going up and down the streets and in and out of the houses and traversing the secret chambers of the temples of a religion that has vanished from the earth and finding so many fresh traces of remote antiquity  as if the course of time had been stopped after this desolation and there had been no nights and days months years and centuries since  nothing is more impressive and terrible than the many evidences of the searching nature of the ashes as bespeaking their irresistible power and the impossibility of escaping them  in the winecellars they forced their way into the earthen vessels  displacing the wine and choking them to the brim with dust  in the tombs they forced the ashes of the dead from the funeral urns and rained new ruin even into them  the mouths and eyes and skulls of all the skeletons were stuffed with this terrible hail  in herculaneum where the flood was of a different and a heavier kind it rolled in like a sea  imagine a deluge of water turned to marble at its heightand that is what is called the lava here  some workmen were digging the gloomy well on the brink of which we now stand looking down when they came on some of the stone benches of the theatrethose steps for such they seem at the bottom of the excavationand found the buried city of herculaneum presently going down with lighted torches we are perplexed by great walls of monstrous thickness rising up between the benches shutting out the stage obtruding their shapeless forms in absurd places confusing the whole plan and making it a disordered dream we cannot at first believe or picture to ourselves that this came rolling in and drowned the city and that all that is not here has been cut away by the axe like solid stone  but this perceived and understood the horror and oppression of its presence are indescribable  many of the paintings on the walls in the roofless chambers of both cities or carefully removed to the museum at naples are as fresh and plain as if they had been executed yesterday  here are subjects of still life as provisions dead game bottles glasses and the like familiar classical stories or mythological fables always forcibly and plainly told conceits of cupids quarrelling sporting working at trades theatrical rehearsals poets reading their productions to their friends inscriptions chalked upon the walls political squibs advertisements rough drawings by schoolboys everything to people and restore the ancient cities in the fancy of their wondering visitor  furniture too you see of every kindlamps tables couches vessels for eating drinking and cooking workmens tools surgical instruments tickets for the theatre pieces of money personal ornaments bunches of keys found clenched in the grasp of skeletons helmets of guards and warriors little household bells yet musical with their old domestic tones  the least among these objects lends its aid to swell the interest of vesuvius and invest it with a perfect fascination  the looking from either ruined city into the neighbouring grounds overgrown with beautiful vines and luxuriant trees and remembering that house upon house temple on temple building after building and street after street are still lying underneath the roots of all the quiet cultivation waiting to be turned up to the light of day is something so wonderful so full of mystery so captivating to the imagination that one would think it would be paramount and yield to nothing else  to nothing but vesuvius but the mountain is the genius of the scene  from every indication of the ruin it has worked we look again with an absorbing interest to where its smoke is rising up into the sky  it is beyond us as we thread the ruined streets  above us as we stand upon the ruined walls we follow it through every vista of broken columns as we wander through the empty courtyards of the houses and through the garlandings and interlacings of every wanton vine  turning away to paestum yonder to see the awful structures built the least aged of them hundreds of years before the birth of christ and standing yet erect in lonely majesty upon the wild malariablighted plainwe watch vesuvius as it disappears from the prospect and watch for it again on our return with the same thrill of interest  as the doom and destiny of all this beautiful country biding its terrible time  it is very warm in the sun on this early springday when we return from paestum but very cold in the shade  insomuch that although we may lunch pleasantly at noon in the open air by the gate of pompeii the neighbouring rivulet supplies thick ice for our wine  but the sun is shining brightly there is not a cloud or speck of vapour in the whole blue sky looking down upon the bay of naples and the moon will be at the full tonight  no matter that the snow and ice lie thick upon the summit of vesuvius or that we have been on foot all day at pompeii or that croakers maintain that strangers should not be on the mountain by night in such an unusual season  let us take advantage of the fine weather make the best of our way to resina the little village at the foot of the mountain prepare ourselves as well as we can on so short a notice at the guides house ascend at once and have sunset halfway up moonlight at the top and midnight to come down in  at four oclock in the afternoon there is a terrible uproar in the little stableyard of signior salvatore the recognised headguide with the gold band round his cap and thirty underguides who are all scuffling and screaming at once are preparing halfadozen saddled ponies three litters and some stout staves for the journey  every one of the thirty quarrels with the other twenty nine and frightens the six ponies and as much of the village as can possibly squeeze itself into the little stableyard participates in the tumult and gets trodden on by the cattle  after much violent skirmishing and more noise than would suffice for the storming of naples the procession starts  the headguide who is liberally paid for all the attendants rides a little in advance of the party the other thirty guides proceed on foot eight go forward with the litters that are to be used byandby and the remaining twoandtwenty beg  we ascend gradually by stony lanes like rough broad flights of stairs for some time  at length we leave these and the vineyards on either side of them and emerge upon a bleak bare region where the lava lies confusedly in enormous rusty masses as if the earth had been ploughed up by burning thunderbolts  and now we halt to see the sun set  the change that falls upon the dreary region and on the whole mountain as its red light fades and the night comes onand the unutterable solemnity and dreariness that reign around who that has witnessed it can ever forget  it is dark when after winding for some time over the broken ground we arrive at the foot of the cone  which is extremely steep and seems to rise almost perpendicularly from the spot where we dismount  the only light is reflected from the snow deep hard and white with which the cone is covered  it is now intensely cold and the air is piercing  the thirtyone have brought no torches knowing that the moon will rise before we reach the top  two of the litters are devoted to the two ladies the third to a rather heavy gentleman from naples whose hospitality and goodnature have attached him to the expedition and determined him to assist in doing the honours of the mountain  the rather heavy gentleman is carried by fifteen men each of the ladies by halfadozen  we who walk make the best use of our staves and so the whole party begin to labour upward over the snowas if they were toiling to the summit of an antediluvian twelfthcake  we are a long time toiling up and the headguide looks oddly about him when one of the companynot an italian though an habitue of the mountain for many years  whom we will call for our present purpose mr pickle of porticisuggests that as it is freezing hard and the usual footing of ashes is covered by the snow and ice it will surely be difficult to descend  but the sight of the litters above tilting up and down and jerking from this side to that as the bearers continually slip and tumble diverts our attention more especially as the whole length of the rather heavy gentleman is at that moment presented to us alarmingly foreshortened with his head downwards  the rising of the moon soon afterwards revives the flagging spirits of the bearers  stimulating each other with their usual watchword courage friend  it is to eat macaroni they press on gallantly for the summit  from tingeing the top of the snow above us with a band of light and pouring it in a stream through the valley below while we have been ascending in the dark the moon soon lights the whole white mountainside and the broad sea down below and tiny naples in the distance and every village in the country round  the whole prospect is in this lovely state when we come upon the platform on the mountaintopthe region of firean exhausted crater formed of great masses of gigantic cinders like blocks of stone from some tremendous waterfall burnt up from every chink and crevice of which hot sulphurous smoke is pouring out  while from another conicalshaped hill the present crater rising abruptly from this platform at the end great sheets of fire are streaming forth reddening the night with flame blackening it with smoke and spotting it with redhot stones and cinders that fly up into the air like feathers and fall down like lead  what words can paint the gloom and grandeur of this scene  the broken ground the smoke the sense of suffocation from the sulphur  the fear of falling down through the crevices in the yawning ground the stopping every now and then for somebody who is missing in the dark for the dense smoke now obscures the moon the intolerable noise of the thirty and the hoarse roaring of the mountain make it a scene of such confusion at the same time that we reel again  but dragging the ladies through it and across another exhausted crater to the foot of the present volcano we approach close to it on the windy side and then sit down among the hot ashes at its foot and look up in silence faintly estimating the action that is going on within from its being full a hundred feet higher at this minute than it was six weeks ago  there is something in the fire and roar that generates an irresistible desire to get nearer to it  we cannot rest long without starting off two of us on our hands and knees accompanied by the headguide to climb to the brim of the flaming crater and try to look in  meanwhile the thirty yell as with one voice that it is a dangerous proceeding and call to us to come back frightening the rest of the party out of their wits  what with their noise and what with the trembling of the thin crust of ground that seems about to open underneath our feet and plunge us in the burning gulf below which is the real danger if there be any and what with the flashing of the fire in our faces and the shower of redhot ashes that is raining down and the choking smoke and sulphur we may well feel giddy and irrational like drunken men  but we contrive to climb up to the brim and look down for a moment into the hell of boiling fire below then we all three come rolling down blackened and singed and scorched and hot and giddy  and each with his dress alight in halfadozen places  you have read a thousand times that the usual way of descending is by sliding down the ashes  which forming a gradually increasing ledge below the feet prevent too rapid a descent  but when we have crossed the two exhausted craters on our way back and are come to this precipitous place there is as mr pickle has foretold no vestige of ashes to be seen the whole being a smooth sheet of ice  in this dilemma ten or a dozen of the guides cautiously join hands and make a chain of men of whom the foremost beat as well as they can a rough track with their sticks down which we prepare to follow  the way being fearfully steep and none of the party even of the thirty  being able to keep their feet for six paces together the ladies are taken out of their litters and placed each between two careful persons while others of the thirty hold by their skirts to prevent their falling forwarda necessary precaution tending to the immediate and hopeless dilapidation of their apparel  the rather heavy gentleman is abjured to leave his litter too and be escorted in a similar manner but he resolves to be brought down as he was brought up on the principle that his fifteen bearers are not likely to tumble all at once and that he is safer so than trusting to his own legs  in this order we begin the descent  sometimes on foot sometimes shuffling on the ice  always proceeding much more quietly and slowly than on our upward way  and constantly alarmed by the falling among us of somebody from behind who endangers the footing of the whole party and clings pertinaciously to anybodys ankles it is impossible for the litter to be in advance too as the track has to be made and its appearance behind us overheadwith some one or other of the bearers always down and the rather heavy gentleman with his legs always in the airis very threatening and frightful  we have gone on thus a very little way painfully and anxiously but quite merrily and regarding it as a great success and have all fallen several times and have all been stopped somehow or other as we were sliding awaywhen mr pickle of portici in the act of remarking on these uncommon circumstances as quite beyond his experience stumbles falls disengages himself with quick presence of mind from those about him plunges away head foremost and rolls over and over down the whole surface of the cone  sickening as it is to look and be so powerless to help him i see him there in the moonlighti have had such a dream often skimming over the white ice like a cannonball  almost at the same moment there is a cry from behind and a man who has carried a light basket of spare cloaks on his head comes rolling past at the same frightful speed closely followed by a boy  at this climax of the chapter of accidents the remaining eightandtwenty vociferate to that degree that a pack of wolves would be music to them  giddy and bloody and a mere bundle of rags is pickle of portici when we reach the place where we dismounted and where the horses are waiting but thank god sound in limb  and never are we likely to be more glad to see a man alive and on his feet than to see him nowmaking light of it too though sorely bruised and in great pain  the boy is brought into the hermitage on the mountain while we are at supper with his head tied up and the man is heard of some hours afterwards  he too is bruised and stunned but has broken no bones the snow having fortunately covered all the larger blocks of rock and stone and rendered them harmless  after a cheerful meal and a good rest before a blazing fire we again take horse and continue our descent to salvatores house very slowly by reason of our bruised friend being hardly able to keep the saddle or endure the pain of motion  though it is so late at night or early in the morning all the people of the village are waiting about the little stableyard when we arrive and looking up the road by which we are expected  our appearance is hailed with a great clamour of tongues and a general sensation for which in our modesty we are somewhat at a loss to account until turning into the yard we find that one of a party of french gentlemen who were on the mountain at the same time is lying on some straw in the stable with a broken limb  looking like death and suffering great torture and that we were confidently supposed to have encountered some worse accident  so well returned and heaven be praised as the cheerful vetturino who has borne us company all the way from pisa says with all his heart  and away with his ready horses into sleeping naples  it wakes again to policinelli and pickpockets buffo singers and beggars rags puppets flowers brightness dirt and universal degradation airing its harlequin suit in the sunshine next day and every day singing starving dancing gaming on the sea shore and leaving all labour to the burning mountain which is ever at its work  our english dilettanti would be very pathetic on the subject of the national taste if they could hear an italian opera half as badly sung in england as we may hear the foscari performed tonight in the splendid theatre of san carlo  but for astonishing truth and spirit in seizing and embodying the real life about it the shabby little san carlino theatrethe rickety house one story high with a staring picture outside  down among the drums and trumpets and the tumblers and the lady conjureris without a rival anywhere  there is one extraordinary feature in the real life of naples at which we may take a glance before we gothe lotteries  they prevail in most parts of italy but are particularly obvious in their effects and influences here  they are drawn every saturday  they bring an immense revenue to the government and diffuse a taste for gambling among the poorest of the poor which is very comfortable to the coffers of the state and very ruinous to themselves  the lowest stake is one grain less than a farthing  one hundred numbersfrom one to a hundred inclusive are put into a box  five are drawn  those are the prizes  i buy three numbers  if one of them come up i win a small prize  if two some hundreds of times my stake  if three three thousand five hundred times my stake  i stake or play as they call it what i can upon my numbers and buy what numbers i please  the amount i play i pay at the lottery office where i purchase the ticket and it is stated on the ticket itself  every lottery office keeps a printed book an universal lottery diviner where every possible accident and circumstance is provided for and has a number against it  for instance let us take two carliniabout sevenpence  on our way to the lottery office we run against a black man  when we get there we say gravely the diviner  it is handed over the counter as a serious matter of business  we look at black man  such a number  give us that we look at running against a person in the street  give us that  we look at the name of the street itself  give us that  now we have our three numbers  if the roof of the theatre of san carlo were to fall in so many people would play upon the numbers attached to such an accident in the diviner that the government would soon close those numbers and decline to run the risk of losing any more upon them  this often happens  not long ago when there was a fire in the kings palace there was such a desperate run on fire and king and palace that further stakes on the numbers attached to those words in the golden book were forbidden  every accident or event is supposed by the ignorant populace to be a revelation to the beholder or party concerned in connection with the lottery certain people who have a talent for dreaming fortunately are much sought after and there are some priests who are constantly favoured with visions of the lucky numbers  i heard of a horse running away with a man and dashing him down dead at the corner of a street  pursuing the horse with incredible speed was another man who ran so fast that he came up immediately after the accident  he threw himself upon his knees beside the unfortunate rider and clasped his hand with an expression of the wildest grief  if you have life he said speak one word to me  if you have one gasp of breath left mention your age for heavens sake that i may play that number in the lottery  it is four oclock in the afternoon and we may go to see our lottery drawn  the ceremony takes place every saturday in the tribunale or court of justicethis singular earthysmelling room or gallery as mouldy as an old cellar and as damp as a dungeon  at the upper end is a platform with a large horseshoe table upon it and a president and council sitting roundall judges of the law  the man on the little stool behind the president is the capo lazzarone a kind of tribune of the people appointed on their behalf to see that all is fairly conducted attended by a few personal friends  a ragged swarthy fellow he is  with long matted hair hanging down all over his face  and covered from head to foot with most unquestionably genuine dirt all the body of the room is filled with the commonest of the neapolitan people  and between them and the platform guarding the steps leading to the latter is a small body of soldiers  there is some delay in the arrival of the necessary number of judges during which the box in which the numbers are being placed is a source of the deepest interest  when the box is full the boy who is to draw the numbers out of it becomes the prominent feature of the proceedings  he is already dressed for his part in a tight brown holland coat with only one the left sleeve to it which leaves his right arm bared to the shoulder ready for plunging down into the mysterious chest  during the hush and whisper that pervade the room all eyes are turned on this young minister of fortune  people begin to inquire his age with a view to the next lottery and the number of his brothers and sisters and the age of his father and mother and whether he has any moles or pimples upon him and where and how many when the arrival of the last judge but one a little old man universally dreaded as possessing the evil eye makes a slight diversion and would occasion a greater one but that he is immediately deposed as a source of interest by the officiating priest who advances gravely to his place followed by a very dirty little boy carrying his sacred vestments and a pot of holy water  here is the last judge come at last and now he takes his place at the horseshoe table  there is a murmur of irrepressible agitation  in the midst of it the priest puts his head into the sacred vestments and pulls the same over his shoulders  then he says a silent prayer and dipping a brush into the pot of holy water sprinkles it over the boxand over the boy and gives them a doublebarrelled blessing which the box and the boy are both hoisted on the table to receive  the boy remaining on the table the box is now carried round the front of the platform by an attendant who holds it up and shakes it lustily all the time seeming to say like the conjurer there is no deception ladies and gentlemen keep your eyes upon me if you please  at last the box is set before the boy and the boy first holding up his naked arm and open hand dives down into the hole it is made like a ballotbox and pulls out a number which is rolled up round something hard like a bonbon  this he hands to the judge next him who unrolls a little bit and hands it to the president next to whom he sits  the president unrolls it very slowly  the capo lazzarone leans over his shoulder  the president holds it up unrolled to the capo lazzarone  the capo lazzarone looking at it eagerly cries out in a shrill loud voice sessantadue sixty two expressing the two upon his fingers as he calls it out alas the capo lazzarone himself has not staked on sixtytwo  his face is very long and his eyes roll wildly  as it happens to be a favourite number however it is pretty well received which is not always the case  they are all drawn with the same ceremony omitting the blessing  one blessing is enough for the whole multiplicationtable  the only new incident in the proceedings is the gradually deepening intensity of the change in the cape lazzarone who has evidently speculated to the very utmost extent of his means and who when he sees the last number and finds that it is not one of his clasps his hands and raises his eyes to the ceiling before proclaiming it as though remonstrating in a secret agony with his patron saint for having committed so gross a breach of confidence  i hope the capo lazzarone may not desert him for some other member of the calendar but he seems to threaten it  where the winners may be nobody knows  they certainly are not present the general disappointment filling one with pity for the poor people  they look  when we stand aside observing them in their passage through the courtyard down below  as miserable as the prisoners in the gaol it forms a part of the building who are peeping down upon them from between their bars or as the fragments of human heads which are still dangling in chains outside in memory of the good old times when their owners were strung up there for the popular edification  away from naples in a glorious sunrise by the road to capua and then on a three days journey along byroads that we may see on the way the monastery of monte cassino which is perched on the steep and lofty hill above the little town of san germano and is lost on a misty morning in the clouds  so much the better for the deep sounding of its bell which as we go winding up on mules towards the convent is heard mysteriously in the still air while nothing is seen but the grey mist moving solemnly and slowly like a funeral procession  behold at length the shadowy pile of building close before us  its grey walls and towers dimly seen though so near and so vast  and the raw vapour rolling through its cloisters heavily  there are two black shadows walking to and fro in the quadrangle near the statues of the patron saint and his sister and hopping on behind them in and out of the old arches is a raven croaking in answer to the bell and uttering at intervals the purest tuscan how like a jesuit he looks  there never was a sly and stealthy fellow so at home as is this raven standing now at the refectory door with his head on one side and pretending to glance another way while he is scrutinizing the visitors keenly and listening with fixed attention  what a dullheaded monk the porter becomes in comparison  he speaks like us says the porter  quite as plainly  quite as plainly porter  nothing could be more expressive than his reception of the peasants who are entering the gate with baskets and burdens  there is a roll in his eye and a chuckle in his throat which should qualify him to be chosen superior of an order of ravens  he knows all about it  its all right he says  we know what we know  come along good people  glad to see you how was this extraordinary structure ever built in such a situation where the labour of conveying the stone and iron and marble so great a height must have been prodigious  caw says the raven welcoming the peasants  how being despoiled by plunder fire and earthquake has it risen from its ruins and been again made what we now see it with its church so sumptuous and magnificent  caw says the raven welcoming the peasants  these people have a miserable appearance and as usual are densely ignorant and all beg while the monks are chaunting in the chapel caw says the raven cuckoo  so we leave him chuckling and rolling his eye at the convent gate and wind slowly down again through the cloud  at last emerging from it we come in sight of the village far below and the flat green country intersected by rivulets which is pleasant and fresh to see after the obscurity and haze of the conventno disrespect to the raven or the holy friars  away we go again by muddy roads and through the most shattered and tattered of villages where there is not a whole window among all the houses or a whole garment among all the peasants or the least appearance of anything to eat in any of the wretched hucksters shops  the women wear a bright red bodice laced before and behind a white skirt and the neapolitan headdress of square folds of linen primitively meant to carry loads on  the men and children wear anything they can get  the soldiers are as dirty and rapacious as the dogs  the inns are such hobgoblin places that they are infinitely more attractive and amusing than the best hotels in paris  here is one near valmontone that is valmontone the round walled town on the mount opposite which is approached by a quagmire almost kneedeep  there is a wild colonnade below and a dark yard full of empty stables and lofts and a great long kitchen with a great long bench and a great long form where a party of travellers with two priests among them are crowding round the fire while their supper is cooking  above stairs is a rough brick gallery to sit in with very little windows with very small patches of knotty glass in them and all the doors that open from it a dozen or two off their hinges and a bare board on tressels for a table at which thirty people might dine easily and a fireplace large enough in itself for a breakfastparlour where as the faggots blaze and crackle they illuminate the ugliest and grimmest of faces drawn in charcoal on the whitewashed chimney sides by previous travellers  there is a flaring country lamp on the table and hovering about it scratching her thick black hair continually a yellow dwarf of a woman who stands on tiptoe to arrange the hatchet knives and takes a flying leap to look into the waterjug  the beds in the adjoining rooms are of the liveliest kind  there is not a solitary scrap of lookingglass in the house and the washing apparatus is identical with the cooking utensils  but the yellow dwarf sets on the table a good flask of excellent wine holding a quart at least and produces among half adozen other dishes twothirds of a roasted kid smoking hot she is as goodhumoured too as dirty which is saying a great deal  so heres long life to her in the flask of wine and prosperity to the establishment  rome gained and left behind and with it the pilgrims who are now repairing to their own homes againeach with his scallop shell and staff and soliciting alms for the love of godwe come by a fair country to the falls of terni where the whole velino river dashes headlong from a rocky height amidst shining spray and rainbows  perugia strongly fortified by art and nature on a lofty eminence rising abruptly from the plain where purple mountains mingle with the distant sky is glowing on its market day with radiant colours  they set off its sombre but rich gothic buildings admirably  the pavement of its marketplace is strewn with country goods  all along the steep hill leading from the town under the town wall there is a noisy fair of calves lambs pigs horses mules and oxen  fowls geese and turkeys flutter vigorously among their very hoofs and buyers sellers and spectators clustering everywhere block up the road as we come shouting down upon them  suddenly there is a ringing sound among our horses  the driver stops them  sinking in his saddle and casting up his eyes to heaven he delivers this apostrophe oh jove omnipotent here is a horse has lost his shoe  notwithstanding the tremendous nature of this accident and the utterly forlorn look and gesture impossible in any one but an italian vetturino with which it is announced it is not long in being repaired by a mortal farrier by whose assistance we reach castiglione the same night and arezzo next day  mass is of course performing in its fine cathedral where the sun shines in among the clustered pillars through rich stainedglass windows half revealing half concealing the kneeling figures on the pavement and striking out paths of spotted light in the long aisles  but how much beauty of another kind is here when on a fair clear morning we look from the summit of a hill on florence  see where it lies before us in a sunlighted valley bright with the winding arno and shut in by swelling hills its domes and towers and palaces rising from the rich country in a glittering heap and shining in the sun like gold  magnificently stern and sombre are the streets of beautiful florence and the strong old piles of building make such heaps of shadow on the ground and in the river that there is another and a different city of rich forms and fancies always lying at our feet prodigious palaces constructed for defence with small distrustful windows heavily barred and walls of great thickness formed of huge masses of rough stone frown in their old sulky state on every street  in the midst of the cityin the piazza of the grand duke adorned with beautiful statues and the fountain of neptunerises the palazzo vecchio with its enormous overhanging battlements and the great tower that watches over the whole town  in its court yardworthy of the castle of otranto in its ponderous gloomis a massive staircase that the heaviest waggon and the stoutest team of horses might be driven up  within it is a great saloon faded and tarnished in its stately decorations and mouldering by grains but recording yet in pictures on its walls the triumphs of the medici and the wars of the old florentine people  the prison is hard by in an adjacent courtyard of the buildinga foul and dismal place where some men are shut up close in small cells like ovens and where others look through bars and beg where some are playing draughts and some are talking to their friends who smoke the while to purify the air and some are buying wine and fruit of womenvendors and all are squalid dirty and vile to look at they are merry enough signore says the jailer  they are all bloodstained here he adds indicating with his hand three fourths of the whole building  before the hour is out an old man eighty years of age quarrelling over a bargain with a young girl of seventeen stabs her dead in the marketplace full of bright flowers and is brought in prisoner to swell the number  among the four old bridges that span the river the ponte vecchio that bridge which is covered with the shops of jewellers and goldsmithsis a most enchanting feature in the scene  the space of one house in the centre being left open the view beyond is shown as in a frame and that precious glimpse of sky and water and rich buildings shining so quietly among the huddled roofs and gables on the bridge is exquisite  above it the gallery of the grand duke crosses the river  it was built to connect the two great palaces by a secret passage and it takes its jealous course among the streets and houses with true despotism  going where it lists and spurning every obstacle away before it  the grand duke has a worthier secret passage through the streets in his black robe and hood as a member of the compagnia della misericordia which brotherhood includes all ranks of men  if an accident take place their office is to raise the sufferer and bear him tenderly to the hospital  if a fire break out it is one of their functions to repair to the spot and render their assistance and protection  it is also among their commonest offices to attend and console the sick and they neither receive money nor eat nor drink in any house they visit for this purpose  those who are on duty for the time are all called together on a moments notice by the tolling of the great bell of the tower and it is said that the grand duke has been seen at this sound to rise from his seat at table and quietly withdraw to attend the summons  in this other large piazza where an irregular kind of market is held and stores of old iron and other small merchandise are set out on stalls or scattered on the pavement are grouped together the cathedral with its great dome the beautiful italian gothic tower the campanile and the baptistery with its wrought bronze doors  and here a small untrodden square in the pavement is the stone of dante where so runs the story he was used to bring his stool and sit in contemplation  i wonder was he ever in his bitter exile withheld from cursing the very stones in the streets of florence the ungrateful by any kind remembrance of this old musingplace and its association with gentle thoughts of little beatrice  the chapel of the medici the good and bad angels of florence the church of santa croce where michael angelo lies buried and where every stone in the cloisters is eloquent on great mens deaths innumerable churches often masses of unfinished heavy brickwork externally but solemn and serene within arrest our lingering steps in strolling through the city  in keeping with the tombs among the cloisters is the museum of natural history famous through the world for its preparations in wax beginning with models of leaves seeds plants inferior animals and gradually ascending through separate organs of the human frame up to the whole structure of that wonderful creation exquisitely presented as in recent death  few admonitions of our frail mortality can be more solemn and more sad or strike so home upon the heart as the counterfeits of youth and beauty that are lying there upon their beds in their last sleep  beyond the walls the whole sweet valley of the arno the convent at fiesole the tower of galileo boccaccios house old villas and retreats innumerable spots of interest all glowing in a landscape of surpassing beauty steeped in the richest light are spread before us  returning from so much brightness how solemn and how grand the streets again with their great dark mournful palaces and many legends  not of siege and war and might and iron hand alone but of the triumphant growth of peaceful arts and sciences  what light is shed upon the world at this day from amidst these rugged palaces of florence  here open to all comers in their beautiful and calm retreats the ancient sculptors are immortal side by side with michael angelo canova titian rembrandt raphael poets historians philosophersthose illustrious men of history beside whom its crowned heads and harnessed warriors show so poor and small and are so soon forgotten  here the imperishable part of noble minds survives placid and equal when strongholds of assault and defence are overthrown when the tyranny of the many or the few or both is but a tale when pride and power are so much cloistered dust  the fire within the stern streets and among the massive palaces and towers kindled by rays from heaven is still burning brightly when the flickering of war is extinguished and the household fires of generations have decayed as thousands upon thousands of faces rigid with the strife and passion of the hour have faded out of the old squares and public haunts while the nameless florentine lady preserved from oblivion by a painters hand yet lives on in enduring grace and youth  let us look back on florence while we may and when its shining dome is seen no more go travelling through cheerful tuscany with a bright remembrance of it for italy will be the fairer for the recollection  the summertime being come  and genoa and milan and the lake of como lying far behind us  and we resting at faido a swiss village near the awful rocks and mountains the everlasting snows and roaring cataracts of the great saint gothard  hearing the italian tongue for the last time on this journey  let us part from italy with all its miseries and wrongs affectionately in our admiration of the beauties natural and artificial of which it is full to overflowing and in our tenderness towards a people naturally welldisposed and patient and sweettempered  years of neglect oppression and misrule have been at work to change their nature and reduce their spirit miserable jealousies fomented by petty princes to whom union was destruction and division strength have been a canker at their root of nationality and have barbarized their language but the good that was in them ever is in them yet and a noble people may be one day raised up from these ashes  let us entertain that hope  and let us not remember italy the less regardfully because in every fragment of her fallen temples and every stone of her deserted palaces and prisons she helps to inculcate the lesson that the wheel of time is rolling for an end and that the world is in all great essentials better gentler more forbearing and more hopeful as it rolls    footnotes  1  this was written in 1846  2  a far more liberal and just recognition of the
