20196717	in a hollow of the hills   by  bret bret harte     chapter i  it was very dark and the wind was increasing  the last gust had been preceded by an ominous roaring down the whole mountainside which continued for some time after the trees in the little valley had lapsed into silence  the air was filled with a faint cool sodden odor as of stirred forest depths  in those intervals of silence the darkness seemed to increase in proportion and grow almost palpable  yet out of this sightless and soundless void now came the tinkle of a spurs rowels the dry crackling of saddle leathers and the muffled plunge of a hoof in the thick carpet of dust and desiccated leaves  then a voice which in spite of its matteroffact reality the obscurity lent a certain mystery to said  i cant make out anything  where the devil have we got to anyway its as black as tophet here ahead  strike a light and make a flare with something returned a second voice  look where youre shoving tonowkeep your horse off will ye  there was more muffled plunging a silence the rustle of paper the quick spurt of a match and then the uplifting of a flickering flame but it revealed only the heads and shoulders of three horsemen framed within a nebulous ring of light that still left their horses and even their lower figures in impenetrable shadow then the flame leaped up and died out with a few zigzagging sparks that were falling to the ground when a third voice that was low but somewhat pleasant in its cadence said  be careful where you throw that  you were careless last time with this wind and the leaves like tinder you might send a furnace blast through the woods  then at least wed see where we were  nevertheless he moved his horse whose trampling hoofs beat out the last fallen spark  complete darkness and silence again followed presently the first speaker continued  i reckon well have to wait here till the next squall clears away the scud from the sky  hello  whats that  out of the obscurity before them appeared a faint lighta dim but perfectly defined square of radiancewhich however did not appear to illuminate anything around it  suddenly it disappeared  thats a houseits a light in a window said the second voice  house be dd retorted the first speaker  a house with a window on gallopers ridge fifteen miles from anywhere  youre crazy  nevertheless from the muffled plunging and tinkling that followed they seemed to be moving in the direction where the light had appeared then there was a pause  theres nothing but a rocky outcrop here where a house couldnt stand and were off the trail again said the first speaker impatiently  stopthere it is again  the same square of light appeared once more but the horsemen had evidently diverged in the darkness for it seemed to be in a different direction  but it was more distinct and as they gazed a shadow appeared upon its radiant surfacethe profile of a human face  then the light suddenly went out and the face vanished with it  it is a window and there was some one behind it said the second speaker emphatically  it was a womans face said the pleasant voice  whoever it is just hail them so that we can get our bearings sing out  all together  the three voices rose in a prolonged shout in which however the distinguishing quality of the pleasant voice was sustained  but there was no response from the darkness beyond  the shouting was repeated after an interval with the same result the silence and obscurity remained unchanged  lets get out of this said the first speaker angrily house or no house man or woman were not wanted and well make nothing waltzing round here  hush said the second voice  shh  listen  the leaves of the nearest trees were trilling audibly  then came a sudden gust that swept the fronds of the taller ferns into their faces and laid the thin lithe whips of alder over their horses flanks sharply  it was followed by the distant sealike roaring of the mountainside  thats a little more like it said the first speaker joyfully another blow like that and were all right  and look theres a lightenin up over the trail we came by  there was indeed a faint glow in that direction like the first suffusion of dawn permitting the huge shoulder of the mountain along whose flanks they had been journeying to be distinctly seen the sodden breath of the stirred forest depths was slightly tainted with an acrid fume  thats the match you threw away two hours ago said the pleasant voice deliberately  its caught the dry brush in the trail round the bend  anyhow its given us our bearings boys said the first speaker with satisfied accents  were all right now and the winds lifting the sky ahead there  forward now all together and lets get out of this hellhole while we can  it was so much lighter that the bulk of each horseman could be seen as they moved forward together  but there was no thinning of the obscurity on either side of them  nevertheless the profile of the horseman with the pleasant voice seemed to be occasionally turned backward and he suddenly checked his horse  theres the window again he said  look  thereits gone again  let it go and be dd returned the leader  come on  they spurred forward in silence  it was not long before the wayside trees began to dimly show spaces between them and the ferns to give way to lower thickset shrubs which in turn yielded to a velvety moss with long quiet intervals of netted and tangled grasses  the regular fall of the horses feet became a mere rhythmic throbbing then suddenly a single hoof rang out sharply on stone and the first speaker reined in slightly  thank the lord were on the ridge now and the rest is easy  tell you what though boys now were all right i dont mind saying that i didnt take no stock in that blamed corpse light down there if there ever was a willothewisp on a square up mountain that was one  it wasnt no window  some of ye thought ye saw a face tooeh  yes and a rather pretty one said the pleasant voice meditatively  thats the way theyd build that sort of thing of course  its lucky ye had to satisfy yourself with looking  gosh i feel creepy yet thinking of it  what are ye looking back for now like lots wife blamed if i dont think that face bewitched ye  i was only thinking about that fire you started returned the other quietly  i dont see it now  wellif you did  i was wondering whether it could reach that hollow  i reckon that hollow could take care of any casual natrel fire that came boomin along and go two better every time  why i dont believe there was any fire it was all a piece of that infernal ignis fatuus phantasmagoriana that was played upon us down there  with the laugh that followed they started forward again relapsing into the silence of tired men at the end of a long journey  even their few remarks were interjectional or reminiscent of topics whose freshness had been exhausted with the day  the gaining light which seemed to come from the ground about them rather than from the still overcast sky above defined their individuality more distinctly  the man who had first spoken and who seemed to be their leader wore the virgin unshaven beard mustache and flowing hair of the californian pioneer and might have been the eldest the second speaker was close shaven thin and energetic the third with the pleasant voice in height litheness and suppleness of figure appeared to be the youngest of the party  the trail had now become a grayish streak along the level tableland they were following which also had the singular effect of appearing lighter than the surrounding landscape yet of plunging into utter darkness on either side of its precipitous walls nevertheless at the end of an hour the leader rose in his stirrups with a sigh of satisfaction  theres the light in collinsons mill  theres nothing gaudy and spectacular about that boys eh  no sir its a square honest beacon that a man can steer by  well be there in twenty minutes he was pointing into the darkness below the already descending trail only a pioneers eye could have detected the few pinpricks of light in the impenetrable distance and it was a signal proof of his leadership that the others accepted it without seeing it its just ten oclock he continued holding a huge silver watch to his eye weve wasted an hour on those blamed spooks yonder  we werent off the trail more than ten minutes uncle dick protested the pleasant voice  all right my son go down there if you like and fetch out your witch of endor but as for me im going to throw myself the other side of collinsons lights  theyre good enough for me and a blamed sight more stationary  the grade was very steep but they took it california fashion at a gallop being genuinely good riders and using their brains as well as their spurs in the understanding of their horses and of certain natural laws which the more artificial riders of civilization are apt to overlook  hence there was no hesitation or indecision communicated to the nervous creatures they bestrode who swept over crumbling stones and slippery ledges with a momentum that took away half their weight and made a stumble or false step or indeed anything but an actual collision almost impossible closing together they avoided the latter and holding each other well up became one irresistible wedgeshaped mass  at times they yelled not from consciousness nor bravado but from the purely animal instinct of warning and to combat the breathlessness of their descent until reaching the level they charged across the gravelly bed of a vanished river and pulled up at collinsons mill  the mill itself had long since vanished with the river but the building that had once stood for it was used as a rude hostelry for travelers which however bore no legend or invitatory sign those who wanted it knew it those who passed it by gave it no offense  collinson himself stood by the door smoking a contemplative pipe as they rode up he disengaged himself from the doorpost listlessly walked slowly towards them said reflectively to the leader ive been thinking with you that a vote for thompson is a vote thrown away and prepared to lead the horses towards the water tank  he had parted with them over twelve hours before but his air of simply renewing a recently interrupted conversation was too common a circumstance to attract their notice  they knew and he knew that no one else had passed that way since he had last spoken that the same sun had swung silently above him and the unchanged landscape and there had been no interruption nor diversion to his monotonous thought  the wilderness annihilates time and space with the grim pathos of patience  nevertheless he smiled  ye dont seem to have got through coming down yet he continued as a few small boulders loosened in their rapid descent came more deliberately rolling and plunging after the travelers along the gravelly bottom  then he turned away with the horses and after they were watered he reentered the house his guests had evidently not waited for his ministration  they had already taken one or two bottles from the shelves behind a wide bar and helped themselves and glasses in hand were now satisfying the more imminent cravings of hunger with biscuits from a barrel and slices of smoked herring from a box  their equally singular host accepting their conduct as not unusual joined the circle they had comfortably drawn round the fireplace and meditatively kicking a brand back at the fire said without looking at them  well  well returned the leader leaning back in his chair after carefully unloosing the buckle of his belt but with his eyes also on the firewell weve prospected every yard of outcrop along the divide and there aint the ghost of a silver indication anywhere  not a smell added the closeshaven guest without raising his eyes  they all remained silent looking at the fire as if it were the one thing they had taken into their confidence  collinson also addressed himself to the blaze as he said presently it allus seemed to me that thar was something shiny about that ledge just round the shoulder of the spur over the long canyon  the leader ejaculated a short laugh  shiny eh shiny  ye think that a sign  why you might as well reckon that because keys head over thar is gray and silvery that hes got sabe and experience  as he spoke he looked towards the man with a pleasant voice  the fire shining full upon him revealed the singular fact that while his face was still young and his mustache quite dark his hair was perfectly gray  the object of this attention far from being disconcerted by the comparison added with a smile  or that he had any silver in his pocket  another lapse of silence followed  the wind tore round the house and rumbled in the short adobe chimney  no gentlemen said the leader reflectively this sort o thing is played out  i dont take no more stock in that cockandbull story about the lost mexican mine  i dont catch on to that sundayschool yarn about the pious scientific sharp who collected leaves and vegetables all over the divide all the while he scientifically knew that the range was solid silver only he wouldnt soil his fingers with godforsaken lucre  i aint saying anything agin that finespun theory that key believes in about volcanic upheavals that set up on end argentiferous rock but i simply say that i dont see itwith the naked eye  and i reckon its about time boys as the games up that we handed in our checks and left the board  there was another silence around the fire another whirl and turmoil without  there was no attempt to combat the opinions of their leader possibly the same sense of disappointed hopes was felt by all only they preferred to let the man of greater experience voice it  he went on  weve had our little game boys ever since we left rawlins a week ago weve had our ups and downs weve been starved and parched snowed up and half drowned shot at by roadagents and horsethieves kicked by mules and played with by grizzlies  weve had a heap o fun boys for our money but i reckon the picnic is about over  so well shake hands tomorrow all round and call it square and go on our ways separately  and what do you think youll do uncle dick said his closeshaven companion listlessly  ill make tracks for a square meal a bed that a man can comfortably take off his boots and die in and some violetscented soap civilizations good enough for me  i even reckon i wouldnt mind the sound of the churchgoing bell ef there was a theatre handy as there likely would be  but the wilderness is played out  youll be back to it again in six months uncle dick retorted the other quickly  uncle dick did not reply  it was a peculiarity of the party that in their isolated companionship they had already exhausted discussion and argument  a silence followed in which they all looked at the fire as if it was its turn to make a suggestion  collinson said the pleasant voice abruptly who lives in the hollow this side of the divide about two miles from the first spur above the big canyon  nary soul  are you sure  sartin  thar aint no one but me betwixt bald top and skinnerstwentyfive miles  of course youd know if any one had come there lately persisted the pleasant voice  i reckon  it aint a week ago that i tramped the whole distance that you fellers just rode over  there aint said the leader deliberately any enchanted castle or cabin that goes waltzing round the road with revolving windows and fairy princesses looking out of em  but collinson recognizing this as purely irrelevant humor with possibly a trap or pitfall in it moved away from the fireplace without a word and retired to the adjoining kitchen to prepare supper presently he reappeared  the pork barls empty boys so ill hev to fix ye up with jerked beef potatoes and flapjacks  ye see thar aint anybody ben over from skinners store for a week  all right only hurry up said uncle dick cheerfully settling himself back in his chair i reckon to turn in as soon as ive rastled with your hash for ive got to turn out agin and be off at sunup  they were all very quiet againso quiet that they could not help noticing that the sound of collinsons preparations for their supper had ceased too  uncle dick arose softly and walked to the kitchen door  collinson was sitting before a small kitchen stove with a fork in his hand gazing abstractedly before him  at the sound of his guests footsteps he started and the noise of preparation recommenced uncle dick returned to his chair by the fire  leaning towards the chair of the closeshaven man he said in a lower voice  he was off agin  what  thinkin of that wife of his  what about his wife asked key lowering his voice also  the three mens heads were close together  when collinson fixed up this mill he sent for his wife in the states said uncle dick in a half whisper waited a year for her hanging round and boarding every emigrant wagon that came through the pass she didnt comeonly the news that she was dead  he paused and nudged his chair still closerthe heads were almost touching  they say over in the barhis voice had sunk to a complete whisperthat it was a lie  that she ran away with the man that was fetchin her out  three thousand miles and three weeks with another man upsets some women  but he knows nothing about it only he sometimes kinder goes off looneylike thinking of her  he stopped the heads separated collinson had appeared at the doorway his melancholy patience apparently unchanged  grubs on gentlemen sit by and eat  the humble meal was dispatched with zest and silence  a few interjectional remarks about the uncertainties of prospecting only accented the other pauses  in ten minutes they were out again by the fireplace with their lit pipes  as there were only three chairs collinson stood beside the chimney  collinson said uncle dick after the usual pause taking his pipe from his lips as weve got to get up and get at sunup we might as well tell you now that were dead broke  weve been living for the last few weeks on preble keys loose changeand thats gone  youll have to let this little account and damage stand over  collinsons brow slightly contracted without however altering his general expression of resigned patience  im sorry for you boys he said slowly and diffidently kinder sorry for myself too  you see i reckoned on goin over to skinners tomorrow to fill up the pork barl and vote for mesick and the wagonroad  but skinner cant let me have anything more until ive paid suthin on account as he calls it  dye mean to say thars any mountain man as low flung and mean as that said uncle dick indignantly  but it isnt his fault said collinson gently you see they wont send him goods from sacramento if he dont pay up and he cant if i dont  sabe  ah thats another thing  they are meanin sacramento said uncle dick somewhat mollified  the other guests murmured an assent to this general proposition suddenly uncle dicks face brightened  look here  i know skinner and ill stop there  no blank it all i cant for its off my route  well then well fix it this way  key will go there and tell skinner that i say that ill send the money to that sacramento hound  thatll fix it  collinsons brow cleared the solution of the difficulty seemed to satisfy everybody and the closeshaven man smiled  and ill secure it he said and give collinson a sight draft on myself at san francisco  whats that for said collinson with a sudden suffusion on each cheek  in case of accident  wot accident persisted collinson with a dark look of suspicion on his usually placid face  in case we should forget it said the closeshaven man with a laugh  and do you suppose that if you boys went and forgot it that id have anything to do with your dd paper said collinson a murky cloud coming into his eyes  why thats only business colly interposed uncle dick quickly thats all jim parker means hes a business man dont you see suppose we got killed  youve that draft to show  show who growled collinson  whyhang itour friends our heirs our relationsto get your money hesitated uncle dick  and do you kalkilate said collinson with deeply laboring breath that if you got killed that id be coming on your folks for the worth of the dd truck i giv ye  go way  lemme git out o this  youre makin me tired  he stalked to the door lit his pipe and began to walk up and down the gravelly riverbed  uncle dick followed him from time to time the two other guests heard the sounds of alternate protest and explanation as they passed and repassed the windows preble key smiled parker shrugged his shoulders  hell be thinkin youve begrudged him your grub if you dontthats the way with these business men said uncle dicks voice in one of these intervals  presently they reentered the house uncle dick saying casually to parker you can leave that draft on the bar when youre ready to go tomorrow and the incident was presumed to have ended but collinson did not glance in the direction of parker for the rest of the evening and indeed standing with his back to the chimney more than once fell into that stolid abstraction which was supposed to be the contemplation of his absent wife  from this silence which became infectious the three guests were suddenly aroused by a furious clattering down the steep descent of the mountain along the trail they had just ridden  it came near increasing in sound until it even seemed to scatter the fine gravel of the riverbed against the sides of the house and then passed in a gust of wind that shook the roof and roared in the chimney  with one common impulse the three travelers rose and went to the door  they opened it to a blackness that seemed to stand as another and an iron door before them but to nothing else  somebody went by then said uncle dick turning to collinson didnt you hear it  nary said collinson patiently without moving from the chimney  what in gods name was it then  only some of them boulders you loosed coming down  its touch and go with them for days after  when i first came here i used to start up and rush out into the roadlike as you wouldyellin and screechin after folks that never was there and never went by then it got kinder monotonous and id lie still and let em slide why one night id a sworn that some one pulled up with a yell and shook the door  but i sort of allowed to myself that whatever it was it wasnt wantin to eat drink sleep or it would come in and i hadnt any call to interfere  and in the mornin i found a rock as big as that box lying chockablock agin the door  then i knowed i was right  preble key remained looking from the door  theres a glow in the sky over big canyon he said with a meaning glance at uncle dick  saw it an hour ago said collinson  it must be the woods afire just round the bend above the canyon  whoever goes to skinners had better give it a wide berth  key turned towards collinson as if to speak but apparently changed his mind and presently joined his companions who were already rolling themselves in their blankets in a series of wooden bunks or berths ranged as in a ships cabin around the walls of a resinous sawdusty apartment that had been the measuring room of the mill  collinson disappearedno one knew or seemed to care whereand in less than ten minutes from the time that they had returned from the door the hush of sleep and rest seemed to possess the whole house  there was no light but that of the fire in the front room which threw flickering and gigantic shadows on the walls of the three empty chairs before it an hour later it seemed as if one of the chairs were occupied and a grotesque profile of collinsons slumberingor meditatingface and figure was projected grimly on the rafters as though it were the hovering guardian spirit of the house  but even that passed presently and faded out and the beleaguering darkness that had encompassed the house all the evening began to slowly creep in through every chink and cranny of the rambling illjointed structure until it at last obliterated even the faint embers on the hearth  the cool fragrance of the woodland depths crept in with it until the steep of human warmth the reek of human clothing and the lingering odors of stale human victual were swept away in that incorruptible and omnipotent breath an hour laterand the wilderness had repossessed itself of all  key the lightest sleeper awoke earlyso early that the dawn announced itself only in two dim squares of light that seemed to grow out of the darkness at the end of the room where the windows looked out upon the valley  this reminded him of his woodland vision of the night before and he lay and watched them until they brightened and began to outline the figures of his still sleeping companions  but there were faint stirrings elsewherethe soft brushing of a squirrel across the shingled roof the tiny flutter of invisible wings in the rafters the peep and squeak of baby life below the floor  and then he fell into a deeper sleep and awoke only when it was broad day  the sun was shining upon the empty bunks his companions were already up and gone  they had separated as they had come togetherwith the lighthearted irresponsibility of animalswithout regret and scarcely reminiscence bearing with cheerful philosophy and the hopefulness of a future unfettered by their past the final disappointment of their quest  if they ever met again they would laugh and remember if they did not they would forget without a sigh he hurriedly dressed himself and went outside to dip his face and hands in the bucket that stood beside the door but the clear air the dazzling sunshine and the unexpected prospect half intoxicated him  the abandoned mill stretched beside him in all the pathos of its premature decay  the ribs of the waterwheel appeared amid a tangle of shrubs and driftwood and were twined with long grasses and straggling vines mounds of sawdust and heaps of brush had taken upon themselves a velvety moss where the trickling slime of the vanished river lost itself in sluggish pools discolored with the dyes of redwood  but on the other side of the rocky ledge dropped the whole length of the valley alternately bathed in sunshine or hidden in drifts of white and clinging smoke  the upper end of the long canyon and the crests of the ridge above him were lost in this fleecy cloud which at times seemed to overflow the summits and fall in slow leaps like lazy cataracts down the mountainside  only the range before the ledge was clear there the green pines seemed to swell onward and upward in long mounting billows until at last they broke against the sky  in the keen stimulus of the hour and the air key felt the mountaineers longing for action and scarcely noticed that collinson had pathetically brought out his pork barrel to scrape together a few remnants for his last meal  it was not until he had finished his coffee and collinson had brought up his horse that a slight sense of shame at his own and his comrades selfishness embarrassed his parting with his patient host  he himself was going to skinners to plead for him he knew that parker had left the drafthe had seen it lying in the barbut a new sense of delicacy kept him from alluding to it now it was better to leave collinson with his own peculiar ideas of the responsibilities of hospitality unchanged  key shook his hand warmly and galloped up the rocky slope  but when he had finally reached the higher level and fancied he could even now see the dust raised by his departing comrades on their two diverging paths although he knew that they had already gone their different waysperhaps never to meet againhis thoughts and his eyes reverted only to the ruined mill below him and its lonely occupant  he could see him quite distinctly in that clear air still standing before his door  and then he appeared to make a parting gesture with his hand and something like snow fluttered in the air above his head it was only the torn fragments of parkers draft which this homely gentleman of the sierras standing beside his empty pork barrel had scattered to the four winds    chapter ii  keys attention was presently directed to something more important to his present purpose  the keen wind which he had faced in mounting the grade had changed and was now blowing at his back his experience of forest fires had already taught him that this was too often only the cold air rushing in to fill the vacuum made by the conflagration and it needed not his sensation of an acrid smarting in his eyes and an unaccountable dryness in the air which he was now facing to convince him that the fire was approaching him  it had evidently traveled faster than he had expected or had diverged from its course  he was disappointed not because it would oblige him to take another route to skinners as collinson had suggested but for a very different reason ever since his vision of the preceding night he had resolved to revisit the hollow and discover the mystery  he had kept his purpose a secretpartly because he wished to avoid the jesting remarks of his companions but particularly because he wished to go alone from a very singular impression that although they had witnessed the incident he had really seen more than they did  to this was also added the haunting fear he had felt during the night that this mysterious habitation and its occupants were in the track of the conflagration he had not dared to dwell upon it openly on account of uncle dicks evident responsibility for the origin of the fire he appeased his conscience with the reflection that the inmates of the dwelling no doubt had ample warning in time to escape  but still he and his companions ought to have stopped to help them and thenbut here he paused conscious of another reason he could scarcely voice then or even now  preble key had not passed the age of romance but like other romancists he thought he had evaded it by treating it practically  meantime he had reached the fork where the trail diverged to the right and he must take that direction if he wished to make a detour of the burning woods to reach skinners  his momentary indecision communicated itself to his horse who halted  recalled to himself he looked down mechanically when his attention was attracted by an unfamiliar object lying in the dust of the trail it was a small slipperso small that at first he thought it must have belonged to some child  he dismounted and picked it up  it was worn and shaped to the foot  it could not have lain there long for it was not filled nor discolored by the windblown dust of the trail as all other adjacent objects were  if it had been dropped by a passing traveler that traveler must have passed collinsons going or coming within the last twelve hours  it was scarcely possible that the shoe could have dropped from the foot without the wearers knowing it and it must have been dropped in an urgent flight or it would have been recovered thus practically key treated his romance  and having done so he instantly wheeled his horse and plunged into the road in the direction of the fire  but he was surprised after twenty minutes riding to find that the course of the fire had evidently changed  it was growing clearer before him the dry heat seemed to come more from the right in the direction of the detour he should have taken to skinners  this seemed almost providential and in keeping with his practical treatment of his romance as was also the fact that in all probability the fire had not yet visited the little hollow which he intended to explore  he knew he was nearing it now the locality had been strongly impressed upon him even in the darkness of the previous evening  he had passed the rocky ledge his horses hoofs no longer rang out clearly slowly and perceptibly they grew deadened in the springy mosses and were finally lost in the netted grasses and tangled vines that indicated the vicinity of the densely wooded hollow  here were already some of the wider spaced vanguards of that wood but here too a peculiar circumstance struck him  he was already descending the slight declivity but the distance instead of deepening in leafy shadow was actually growing lighter  here were the outskirting sentinels of the woodbut the wood itself was gone  he spurred his horse through the tall arch between the opened columns and pulled up in amazement  the wood indeed was gone and the whole hollow filled with the already black and dead stumps of the utterly consumed forest  more than that from the indications before him the catastrophe must have almost immediately followed his retreat from the hollow on the preceding night  it was evident that the fire had leaped the intervening shoulder of the spur in one of the unaccountable but by no means rare phenomena of this kind of disaster  the circling heights around were yet untouched only the hollow and the ledge of rock against which they had blundered with their horses when they were seeking the mysterious window in last evenings darkness were calcined and destroyed  he dismounted and climbed the ledge still warm from the spent fire  a large mass of grayish outcrop had evidently been the focus of the furnace blast of heat which must have raged for hours in this spot  he was skirting its crumbling debris when he started suddenly at a discovery which made everything else fade into utter insignificance  before him in a slight depression formed by a fault or lapse in the upheaved strata lay the charred and incinerated remains of a dwellinghouse leveled to the earth  originally half hidden by a natural abattis of growing myrtle and ceanothus which covered this counterscarp of rock towards the trail it must have stood within a hundred feet of them during their halt  even in its utter and complete obliteration by the furious furnace blast that had swept across it there was still to be seen an unmistakable ground plan and outline of a fourroomed house  while everything that was combustible had succumbed to that intense heat there was still enough halffused and warped metal fractured iron plate and twisted and broken bars to indicate the kitchen and tool shed  very little had evidently been taken away the house and its contents were consumed where they stood  with a feeling of horror and desperation key at last ventured to disturb two or three of the blackened heaps that lay before him  but they were only vestiges of clothing bedding and crockerythere was no human trace that he could detect  nor was there any suggestion of the original condition and quality of the house except its size whether the ordinary unsightly cabin of frontier partners or some sylvan cottagethere was nothing left but the usual ignoble and unsavory ruins of burntout human habitation  and yet its very existence was a mystery  it had been unknown at collinsons its nearest neighbor and it was presumable that it was equally unknown at skinners  neither he nor his companions had detected it in their first journey by day through the hollow and only the telltale window at night had been a hint of what was even then so successfully concealed that they could not discover it when they had blundered against its rock foundation  for concealed it certainly was and intentionally so  but for what purpose  he gave his romance full play for a few minutes with this question some recluse preferring the absolute simplicity of nature or perhaps wearied with the artificialities of society had secluded himself here with the company of his only daughter  proficient as a pathfinder he had easily discovered some other way of provisioning his house from the settlements than by the ordinary trails past collinsons or skinners which would have betrayed his vicinity  but recluses are not usually accompanied by young daughters whose relations with the world not being as antagonistic would make them uncertain companions  why not a wife  his presumption of the extreme youth of the face he had seen at the window was after all only based upon the slipper he had found  and if a wife whose absolute acceptance of such confined seclusion might be equally uncertain why not somebody elses wife here was a reason for concealment and the end of an episode not unknown even in the wilderness  and here was the work of the nemesis who had overtaken them in their guilty contentment  the story even to its moral was complete  and yet it did not entirely satisfy him so superior is the absolutely unknown to the most elaborate theory  his attention had been once or twice drawn towards the crumbling wall of outcrop which during the conflagration must have felt the full force of the fiery blast that had swept through the hollow and spent its fury upon it  it bore evidence of the intense heat in cracked fissures and the crumbling debris that lay at its feet key picked up some of the still warm fragments and was not surprised that they easily broke in a gritty grayish powder in his hands  in spite of his preoccupation with the human interest the instinct of the prospector was still strong upon him and he almost mechanically put some of the pieces in his pockets  then after another careful survey of the locality for any further record of its vanished tenants he returned to his horse  here he took from his saddlebags half listlessly a precious phial encased in wood and opening it poured into another thick glass vessel part of a smoking fluid he then crumbled some of the calcined fragments into the glass and watched the ebullition that followed with mechanical gravity  when it had almost ceased he drained off the contents into another glass which he set down and then proceeded to pour some water from his drinkingflask into the ordinary tin cup which formed part of his culinary travelingkit  into this he put three or four pinches of salt from his provision store  then dipping his fingers into the salt and water he allowed a drop to fall into the glass  a white cloud instantly gathered in the colorless fluid and then fell in a fine film to the bottom of the glass  keys eyes concentrated suddenly the listless look left his face  his fingers trembled lightly as he again let the salt water fall into the solution with exactly the same result  again and again he repeated it until the bottom of the glass was quite gray with the fallen precipitate  and his own face grew as gray  his hand trembled no longer as he carefully poured off the solution so as not to disturb the precipitate at the bottom  then he drew out his knife scooped a little of the gray sediment upon its point and emptying his tin cup turned it upside down upon his knee placed the sediment upon it and began to spread it over the dull surface of its bottom with his knife  he had intended to rub it briskly with his knife blade  but in the very action of spreading it the first stroke of his knife left upon the sediment and the cup the luminous streak of burnished silver  he stood up and drew a long breath to still the beatings of his heart then he rapidly reclimbed the rock and passed over the ruins again this time plunging hurriedly through and kicking aside the charred heaps without a thought of what they had contained  key was not an unfeeling man he was not an unrefined one he was a gentleman by instinct and had an intuitive sympathy for others but in that instant his whole mind was concentrated upon the calcined outcrop  and his first impulse was to see if it bore any evidence of previous examination prospecting or working by its suddenly evicted neighbors and owners  there was none they had evidently not known it  nor was there any reason to suppose that they would ever return to their hidden home now devastated and laid bare to the open sunlight and open trail they were already far away their guilty personal secret would keep them from revisiting it  an immense feeling of relief came over the soul of this moral romancer a momentary recognition of the most high in this perfect poetical retribution  he ran back quickly to his saddlebags drew out one or two carefully written formal notices of preemption and claim which he and his former companions had carried in their brief partnership erased their signatures and left only his own name with another grateful sense of divine interference as he thought of them speeding far away in the distance and returned to the ruins with unconscious irony he selected a charred post from the embers stuck it in the ground a few feet from the debris of outcrop and finally affixed his notice  then with a conscientiousness born possibly of his new religious convictions he dislodged with his pickaxe enough of the brittle outcrop to constitute that presumption of actual work upon the claim which was legally required for its maintenance and returned to his horse  in replacing his things in his saddlebags he came upon the slipper and for an instant so complete was his preoccupation in his later discovery that he was about to throw it away as useless impedimenta until it occurred to him albeit vaguely that it might be of service to him in its connection with that discovery in the way of refuting possible false claimants he was not aware of any faithlessness to his momentary romance any more than he was conscious of any disloyalty to his old companions in his gratification that his good fortune had come to him alone this singular selection was a common experience of prospecting and there was something about the magnitude of his discovery that seemed to point to an individual achievement  he had made a rough calculation of the richness of the lode from the quantity of precipitate in his rude experiment he had estimated its length breadth and thickness from his slight knowledge of geology and the theories then ripe and the yield would be colossal  of course he would require capital to work it he would have to let in others to his scheme and his prosperity but the control of it would always be his own  then he suddenly started as he had never in his life before started at the foot of man  for there was a footfall in the charred brush and not twenty yards from him stood collinson who had just dismounted from a mule  the blood rushed to keys pale face  prospectin agin said the proprietor of the mill with his weary smile  no said key quickly only straightening my pack  the blood deepened in his cheek at his instinctive lie  had he carefully thought it out before he would have welcomed collinson and told him all  but now a quick uneasy suspicion flashed upon him perhaps his late host had lied and knew of the existence of the hidden house  perhapshe had spoken of some silvery rock the night beforehe even knew something of the lode itself  he turned upon him with an aggressive face  but collinsons next words dissipated the thought  im glad i found ye anyhow he said  ye see arter you left i saw ye turn off the trail and make for the burning woods instead o goin round  i sez to myself that fellow is making straight for skinners hes sorter worried about me and that empty pork barli hadnt oughter spoke that away afore you boys anyhowand hes takin risks to help me  so i reckoned id throw my leg over jenny here and look arter yeand go over to skinners myselfand vote  certainly said key with cheerful alacrity and the one thought of getting collinson away well go together and well see that that pork barrel is filled  he glowed quite honestly with this sudden idea of remembering collinson through his good fortune lets get on quickly for we may find the fire between us on the outer trail  he hastily mounted his horse  then you didnt take this as a short cut said collinson with dull perseverance in his idea  why not  it looks all clear ahead  yes said key hurriedly but its been only a leap of the fire its still raging round the bend  we must go back to the crosstrail  his face was still flushing with his very equivocating and his anxiety to get his companion away  only a few steps further might bring collinson before the ruins and the notice and that discovery must not be made by him until keys plans were perfected  a sudden aversion to the man he had a moment before wished to reward began to take possession of him  come on he added almost roughly  but to his surprise collinson yielded with his usual grim patience and even a slight look of sympathy with his friends annoyance  i reckon youre right and mebbee youre in a hurry to get to skinners all along o my business i oughtnt hev told you boys what i did  as they rode rapidly away he took occasion to add when key had reined in slightly with a feeling of relief at being out of the hollow i was thinkin too of what youd asked about any one livin here unbeknownst to me  well said key with a new nervousness  well i only had an idea o proposin that you and me just took a look around that holler whar you thought you saw suthin said collinson tentatively  nonsense said key hurriedly  we really saw nothingit was all a fancy and uncle dick was joking me because i said i thought i saw a womans face he added with a forced laugh  collinson glanced at him half sadly  oh  you were only funnin then  i oughter guessed that  i oughter have knowed it from uncle dicks talk  they rode for some moments in silence key preoccupied and feverish and eager only to reach skinners skinner was not only postmaster but registrar of the district and the new discoverer did not feel entirely safe until he had put his formal notification and claims on record  this was no publication of his actual secret nor any indication of success but was only a record that would in all probability remain unnoticed and unchallenged amidst the many other hopeful dreams of sanguine prospectors  but he was suddenly startled from his preoccupation  ye said ye war straightenin up yer pack just now said collinson slowly  yes said key almost angrily and i was  ye didnt stop to straighten it up down at the forks of the trail did ye  i may have said key nervously  but why  ye wont mind my axin ye another question will ye  ye aint carryin round with ye no womans shoe  key felt the blood drop from his cheeks  what do you mean he stammered scarcely daring to lift his conscious eyelids to his companions glance  but when he did so he was amazed to find that collinsons face was almost as much disturbed as his own  i know it aint the square thing to ask ye but this is how it is said collinson hesitatingly  ye see just down by the fork of the trail where you came i picked up a womans shoe  it sorter got me for i sez to myself thar aint no one bin by my shanty comin or goin for weeks but you boys and that shoe from the looks of it aint bin there as many hours  i knew there wasnt any wimin hereabouts  i reckoned it couldnt hev bin dropped by uncle dick or that other man for you would have seen it on the road  so i allowed it might have bin you  and yer it is  he slowly drew from his pocketwhat key was fully prepared to seethe mate of the slipper key had in his saddlebags  the fair fugitive had evidently lost them both  but key was better prepared now perhaps this kind of dissimulation is progressive and quickly alive to the necessity of throwing collinson off this unexpected scent  and his companions own suggestion was right to his hand and as it seemed again quite providential  he laughed with a quick color which however appeared to help his lie as he replied half hysterically youre right old man i own up its mine  its dd silly i knowbut then were all fools where women are concernedand i wouldnt have lost that slipper for a mint of money  he held out his hand gayly but collinson retained the slipper while he gravely examined it  you wouldnt mind telling me where you mought hev got that he said meditatively  of course i should mind said key with a wellaffected mingling of mirth and indignation  what are you thinking of you old rascal what do you take me for  but collinson did not laugh  you wouldnt mind givin me the size and shape and general heft of her as wore that shoe  most decidedly i should do nothing of the kind said key half impatiently  enough that it was given to me by a very pretty girl there thats all you will know  given to you said collinson lifting his eyes  yes returned key sharply  collinson handed him the slipper gravely  i only asked you he said slowly but with a certain quiet dignity which key had never before seen in his face because thar was suthin about the size and shape and fillin out o that shoe that kinder reminded me of some un but that some unher as mought hev stood up in that shoeaint o that kind as would ever stand in the shoes of her as you know at all  the rebuke if such were intended lay quite as much in the utter ignoring of keys airy gallantry and levity as in any conscious slur upon the fair fame of his invented dulcinea yet key oddly felt a strong inclination to resent the aspersion as well as collinsons gratuitous morality and with a mean recollection of uncle dicks last evenings scandalous gossip he said sarcastically and of course that some one you were thinking of was your lawful wife  it war said collinson gravely  perhaps it was something in collinsons manner or his own preoccupation but he did not pursue the subject and the conversation lagged  they were nearing too the outer edge of the present conflagration and the smoke lying low in the unburnt woods or creeping like an actual exhalation of the soil blinded them so that at times they lost the trail completely  at other times from the intense heat it seemed as if they were momentarily impinging upon the burning area or were being caught in a closing circle  it was remarkable that with his sudden accession of fortune key seemed to lose his usual frank and careless fearlessness and impatiently questioned his companions woodcraft there were intervals when he regretted his haste to reach skinners by this shorter cut and began to bitterly attribute it to his desire to serve collinson  ah yes it would be fine indeed if just as he were about to clutch the prize he should be sacrificed through the ignorance and stupidity of this heavyhanded moralist at his side  but it was not until through that moralists guidance they climbed a steep acclivity to a second ridge and were comparatively safe that he began to feel ashamed of his surly silence or surlier interruptions  and collinson either through his unconquerable patience or possibly in a fit of his usual uxorious abstraction appeared to take no notice of it  a sloping tableland of weatherbeaten boulders now effectually separated them from the fire on the lower ridge  they presently began to descend on the further side of the crest and at last dropped upon a wagonroad and the first track of wheels that key had seen for a fortnight  rude as it was it seemed to him the highway to fortune for he knew that it passed skinners and then joined the great stageroad to marysvillenow his ultimate destination  a few rods further on they came in view of skinners lying like a dingy forgotten winter snowdrift on the mountain shelf  it contained a postoffice tavern blacksmiths shop general store and expressoffice scarcely a dozen buildings in all but all differing from collinsons mill in some vague suggestion of vitality as if the daily regular pulse of civilization still beat albeit languidly in that remote extremity  there was anticipation and accomplishment twice a day and as key and collinson rode up to the expressoffice the expresswagon was standing before the door ready to start to meet the stagecoach at the crossroads three miles away  this again seemed a special providence to key  he had a brief official communication with skinner as registrar and duly recorded his claim he had a hasty and confidential aside with skinner as general storekeeper and such was the unconscious magnetism developed by this embryo millionaire that skinner extended the necessary credit to collinson on keys word alone that done he rejoined collinson in high spirits with the news adding cheerfully and i dare say if you want any further advances skinner will give them to you on parkers draft  you mean that bit o paper that chap left said collinson gravely  yes  i tore it up  you tore it up ejaculated key  you hear me  yes said collinson  key stared at him  surely it was again providential that he had not intrusted his secret to this utterly ignorant and prejudiced man  the slight twinges of conscience that his lie about the slippers had caused him disappeared at once  he could not have trusted him even in that it would have been like this stupid fanatic to have prevented keys preemption of that claim until he collinson had satisfied himself of the whereabouts of the missing proprietor  was he quite sure that collinson would not revisit the spot when he had gone  but he was ready for the emergency  he had intended to leave his horse with skinner as security for collinsons provisions but skinners liberality had made this unnecessary and he now offered it to collinson to use and keep for him until called for  this would enable his companion to pack his goods on the mule and oblige him to return to the mill by the wagonroad and outside trail as more commodious for the two animals  ye aint afeared o the road agents suggested a bystander they just swarm on gallopers ridge and they held up the down stage only last week  theyre not so lively since the deputysheriffs got a new idea about them and has been lying low in the brush near bald top returned skinner  anyhow they dont stop teams nor packs unless theres a chance of their getting some fancy horseflesh by it and i reckon thar aint much to tempt them thar he added with a satirical side glance at his customers cattle  but key was already standing in the expresswagon giving a farewell shake to his patient companions hand and this ingenuous pleasantry passed unnoticed  nevertheless as the expresswagon rolled away his active fancy began to consider this new danger that might threaten the hidden wealth of his claim  but he reflected that for a time at least only the crude ore would be taken out and shipped to marysville in a shape that offered no profit to the highwaymen had it been a gold minebut here again was the interposition of providence  a week later preble key returned to skinners with a foreman and ten men and an unlimited credit to draw upon at marysville expeditions of this kind created no surprise at skinners  parties had before this entered the wilderness gayly none knew where or what for the sedate and silent woods had kept their secret while there they had evaporated none knew when or whereoften alas with an unpaid account at skinners  consequently there was nothing in keys party to challenge curiosity  in another week a rambling onestoried shed of pine logs occupied the site of the mysterious ruins and contained the party in two weeks excavations had been made and the whole face of the outcrop was exposed in three weeks every vestige of former tenancy which the fire had not consumed was trampled out by the alien feet of these toilers of the sylvan silver hollow company  none of keys former companions would have recognized the hollow in its blackened leveling and rocky foundation even collinson would not have remembered this stripped and splintered rock with its heaps of fresh debris as the place where he had overtaken key  and key himself had forgotten in his triumph everything but the chance experiment that had led to his success  perhaps it was well therefore that one night when the darkness had mercifully fallen upon this scene of sylvan desolation and its still more incongruous and unsavory human restoration and the low murmur of the pines occasionally swelled up from the unscathed mountainside a loud shout and the trampling of horses feet awoke the dwellers in the shanty  springing to their feet they hurriedly seized their weapons and rushed out only to be confronted by a dark motionless ring of horsemen two flaming torches of pine knots and a low but distinct voice of authority in their excitement halfawakened suspicion and confusion they were affected by its note of calm preparation and conscious power  drop those gunshold up your hands  weve got every man of you covered  key was no coward the men though flustered were not cravens but they obeyed  trot out your leader  let him stand out there clear beside that torch  one of the gleaming pine knots disengaged itself from the dark circle and moved to the centre as preble key cool and confident stepped beside it  that will do said the immutable voice  now we want jack riggs sydney jack french pete and oneeyed charley  a vivid reminiscence of the former night scene in the hollowof his own and his companions voices raised in the darknessflashed across key  with an instinctive premonition that this invasion had something to do with the former tenant he said calmly  who wants them  the state of california said the voice  the state of california must look further returned key in his old pleasant voice there are no such names among my party  who are you  the manager of the sylvan silver hollow company and these are my workmen  there was a hurried movement and the sound of whispering in the hitherto dark and silent circle and then the voice rose again  you have the papers to prove that  yes in the cabin  and you  ive a warrant to the sheriff of sierra  there was a pause and the voice went on less confidently  how long have you been here  three weeks  i came here the day of the fire and took up this claim  there was no other house here  there were ruinsyou can see them still  it may have been a burntup cabin  the voice disengaged itself from the vague background and came slowly forwards  it was a den of thieves  it was the hidingplace of jack riggs and his gang of road agents  ive been hunting this spot for three weeks and now the whole things up  there was a laugh from keys men but it was checked as the owner of the voice slowly ranged up beside the burning torch and they saw his face  it was dark and set with the defeat of a brave man  wont you come in and take something said key kindly  no  its enough fool work for me to have routed ye out already but i suppose its all in my dd days work  goodnight  forward there get  the two torches danced forwards with the trailing off of vague shadows in dim procession there was a clatter over the rocks and they were gone  then as preble key gazed after them he felt that with them had passed the only shadow that lay upon his great fortune and with the last tenant of the hollow a proscribed outlaw and fugitive he was henceforth forever safe in his claim and his discovery  and yet oddly enough at that moment as he turned away for the first time in three weeks there passed before his fancy with a stirring of reproach a vision of the face that he had seen at the window    chapter iii  of the great discovery in sylvan silver hollow it would seem that collinson as yet knew nothing  in spite of keys fears that he might stray there on his return from skinners he did not nor did he afterwards revisit the locality  neither the news of the registry of the claim nor the arrival of keys workmen ever reached him  the few travelers who passed his mill came from the valley to cross the divide on their way to skinners and returned by the longer but easier detour of the stageroad over gallopers ridge he had no chance to participate in the prosperity that flowed from the opening of the mine which plentifully besprinkled skinners settlement he was too far away to profit even by the chance custom of keys sabbath wandering workmen his isolation from civilization for those who came to him from the valley were rude western emigrants like himself remained undisturbed the return of the prospecting party to his humble hospitality that night had been an exceptional case in his characteristic simplicity he did not dream that it was because they had nowhere else to go in their penniless condition  it was an incident to be pleasantly remembered but whose nonrecurrence did not disturb his infinite patience  his pork barrel and flour sack had been replenished for other travelers his own wants were few  it was a day or two after the midnight visit of the sheriff to silver hollow that key galloped down the steep grade to collinsons  he was amused albeit in his new importance a little aggrieved also to find that collinson had as usual confounded his descent with that of the generally detached boulder and that he was obliged to add his voice to the general uproar this brought collinson to his door  ive had your hoss hobbled out among the chickweed and clover in the green pasture back o the mill and hes picked up that much that hes lookin fat and sassy he said quietly beginning to mechanically unstrap keys bridle even while his guest was in the act of dismounting  his backs quite healed up  key could not restrain a shrug of impatience  it was three weeks since they had metthree weeks crammed with excitement energy achievement and fortune to key and yet this place and this man were as stupidly unchanged as when he had left them  a momentary fancy that this was the reality that he himself was only awakening from some delusive dream came over him  but collinsons next words were practical  i reckoned that maybe youd write from marysville to skinner to send for the hoss and forward him to ye for i never kalkilated youd come back  it was quite plain from this that collinson had heard nothing  but it was also awkward as key would now have to tell the whole story and reveal the fact that he had been really experimenting when collinson overtook him in the hollow  he evaded this by postdating his discovery of the richness of the ore until he had reached marysville but he found some difficulty in recounting his good fortune he was naturally no boaster he had no desire to impress collinson with his penetration nor the undaunted energy he had displayed in getting up his company and opening the mine so that he was actually embarrassed by his own understatement and under the grave patient eyes of his companion told his story at best lamely  collinsons face betrayed neither profound interest nor the slightest resentment  when key had ended his awkward recital collinson said slowly  then uncle dick and that other parker feller aint got no show in this yer find  no said key quickly  dont you remember we broke up our partnership that morning and went off our own ways  you dont suppose he added with a forced halflaugh that if uncle dick or parker had struck a lead after they left me theyd have put me in it  wouldnt they asked collinson gravely  of course not  he laughed a little more naturally but presently added with an uneasy smile what makes you think they would  nuthin said collinson promptly  nevertheless when they were seated before the fire with glasses in their hands collinson returned patiently to the subject  you wuz saying they went their way and you went yours  but your way was back on the old way that youd all gone together  but key felt himself on firmer ground here and answered deliberately and truthfully yes but i only went back to the hollow to satisfy myself if there really was any house there and if there was to warn the occupants of the approaching fire  and there was a house there said collinson thoughtfully  only the ruins  he stopped and flushed quickly for he remembered that he had denied its existence at their former meeting  that is he went on hurriedly i found out from the sheriff you know that there had been a house there  but he added reverting to his stronger position my going back there was an accident and my picking up the outcrop was an accident and had no more to do with our partnership prospecting than you had  in fact he said with a reassuring laugh youd have had a better right to share in my claim coming there as you did at that moment than they  why if id have known what the thing was worth i might have put you inonly it wanted capital and some experience he was glad that he had pitched upon that excuse it had only just occurred to him and glanced affably at collinson  but that gentleman said soberly  no you wouldnt nuther  why not said key half angrily  collinson paused  after a moment he said cos i wouldnt hev took anything outer thet place  key felt relieved  from what he knew of collinsons vagaries he believed him  he was wise in not admitting him to his confidences at the beginning he might have thought it his duty to tell others  im not so particular he returned laughingly but the silver in that hole was never touched nor i dare say even imagined by mortal man before  however there is something else about the hollow that i want to tell you  you remember the slipper that you picked up  yes  well i lied to you about that i never dropped it  on the contrary i had picked up the mate of it very near where you found yours and i wanted to know to whom it belonged  for i dont mind telling you now collinson that i believe there was a woman in that house and the same woman whose face i saw at the window  you remember how the boys joked me about itwell perhaps i didnt care that you should laugh at me too but ive had a sore conscience over my lie for i remembered that you seemed to have some interest in the matter too and i thought that maybe i might have thrown you off the scent  it seemed to me that if you had any idea who it was we might now talk the matter over and compare notes  i think you saidat least i gathered the idea from a remark of yours he added hastily as he remembered that the suggestion was his own and a satirical onethat it reminded you of your wifes slipper  of course as your wife is dead that would offer no clue and can only be a chance resemblance unless he stopped  have you got em yet  yes both  he took them from the pocket of his ridingjacket  as collinson received them his face took upon itself an even graver expression  its mighty curous he said reflectively but looking at the two of em the likeness is more fetchin  ye see my wife had a straight foot and never wore reglar rights and lefts like other women but kinder changed about ye see these shoes is reglar rights and lefts but never was worn as sich  there may be other women as peculiar suggested key  there must be said collinson quietly  for an instant key was touched with the manly security of the reply for remembering uncle dicks scandal it had occurred to him that the unknown tenant of the robbers den might be collinsons wife  he was glad to be relieved on that point and went on more confidently  so you see this woman was undoubtedly in that house on the night of the fire  she escaped and in a mighty hurry too for she had not time to change her slippers for shoes she escaped on horseback for that is how she lost them  now what was she doing there with those rascals for the face i saw looked as innocent as a saints  seemed to ye sort o contrairy jist as i reckoned my wifes foot would have looked in a slipper that you said was giv to ye suggested collinson pointedly but with no implication of reproach in his voice  yes said key impatiently  ive read yarns afore now about them eyetalian brigands stealin women said collinson reflectively but that aint california roadagent style  great scott if one even so much as spoke to a woman theyd have been wiped outer the state long ago  no the woman as was there came there to stay  as keys face did not seem to express either assent or satisfaction at this last statement collinson after a glance at it went on with a somewhat gentler gravity i see wots troublin you mr key youve bin thinkin that mebbee that poor woman might hev bin the better for a bit o that fortin that you discovered under the very spot where them slippers of hers had often trod  youre thinkin that mebbee it might hev turned her and those men from their evil ways  mr key had been thinking nothing of the kind but for some obscure reason the skeptical jeer that had risen to his lips remained unsaid he rose impatiently  well there seems to be no chance of discovering anything now the house is burnt the gang dispersed and she has probably gone with them  he paused and then laid three or four large gold pieces on the table  its for that old bill of our party collinson he said  ill settle and collect from each  some time when you come over to the mine and i hope youll give us a call you can bring the horse  meanwhile you can use him youll find hes a little quicker than the mule  how is business he added with a perfunctory glance around the vacant room and dusty bar  thar aint much passin this way said collinson with equal carelessness as he gathered up the money cept those boys from the valley and theyre most always strapped when they come here  key smiled as he observed that collinson offered him no receipt and moreover as he remembered that he had only collinsons word for the destruction of parkers draft  but he merely glanced at his unconscious host and said nothing  after a pause he returned in a lighter tone i suppose you are rather out of the world here indeed i had an idea at first of buying out your mill collinson and putting in steam power to get out timber for our new buildings but you see you are so far away from the wagonroad that we couldnt haul the timber away  that was the trouble or id have made you a fair offer  i dont reckon to ever sell the mill said collinson simply then observing the look of suspicion in his companions face he added gravely you see i rigged up the whole thing when i expected my wife out from the states and i calkilate to keep it in memory of her  key slightly lifted his brows  but you never told us by the way how you ever came to put up a mill here with such an uncertain watersupply  it wasnt onsartin when i came here mr key it was a fullfed stream straight from them snow peaks  it was the earthquake did it  the earthquake repeated key  yes  ef the earthquake kin heave up that silverbearing rock that you told us about the first day you kem here and that you found tother day it could play roots with a mere millstream i reckon  but the convulsion i spoke of happened ages on ages ago when this whole mountain range was being fashioned said key with a laugh  well this yer earthquake was ten years ago just after i came  i reckon i oughter remember it  it was a queer sort o day in the fall dry and hot as if thar might hev bin a fire in the woods only thar wasnt no wind  not a breath of air anywhar  the leaves of them alders hung straight as a plumbline  except for that thar stream and that thar wheel nuthin moved  thar wasnt a bird on the wing over that canyon thar wasnt a squirrel skirmishin in the hull wood even the lizards in the rocks stiffened like stone chinese idols  it kept gettin quieter and quieter ontil i walked out on that ledge and felt as if id have to give a yell just to hear my own voice  thar was a thin veil over everything and betwixt and between everything and the sun was rooted in the middle of it as if it couldnt move neither everythin seemed to be waitin waitin waitin  then all of a suddin suthin seemed to give somewhar  suthin fetched away with a queer sort of rumblin as if the peg had slipped outer creation  i looked up and kalkilated to see half a dozen of them boulders come lickity switch down the grade  but darn my skin if one of em stirred and yet while i was looking the whole face o that bluff bowed over softly as if saying goodby and got clean away somewhar before i knowed it  why you see that pile agin the side o the canyon  well a thousand feet under that theres trees three hundred feet high still upright and standin  you know how them pines over on that far mountainside always seem to be climbin up up up over each others heads to the very top  well mr key i saw em climbin  and when i pulled myself together and got back to the mill everything was quiet and by gd so was the millwheel and there wasnt two inches of water in the river  and what did you think of it said key interested in spite of his impatience  i thought mr key  no i mustnt say i thought for i knowed it  i knowed that suthin had happened to my wife  key did not smile but even felt a faint superstitious thrill as he gazed at him  after a pause collinson resumed i heard a month after that she had died about that time o yaller fever in texas with the party she was comin with  her folks wrote that they died like flies and wuz all buried together unbeknownst and promiscuous and thar wasnt no remains  she slipped away from me like that bluff over that canyon and that was the end of it  but she might have escaped said key quickly forgetting himself in his eagerness  but collinson only shook his head  then shed have been here he said gravely  key moved towards the door still abstractedly held out his hand shook that of his companion warmly and then saddling his horse himself departed  a sense of disappointmentin which a vague dissatisfaction with himself was mingledwas all that had come of his interview  he took himself severely to task for following his romantic quest so far it was unworthy of the president of the sylvan silver hollow company and he was not quite sure but that his confidences with collinson might have imperiled even the interests of the company  to atone for this momentary aberration and correct his dismal fancies he resolved to attend to some business at skinners before returning and branched off on a long detour that would intersect the traveled stageroad  but here a singular incident overtook him  as he wheeled into the turnpike he heard the trampling hoofbeats and jingling harness of the oncoming coach behind him  he had barely time to draw up against the bank before the six galloping horses and swinging vehicle swept heavily by  he had a quick impression of the heat and steam of sweating horsehide the reek of varnish and leather and the momentary vision of a female face silhouetted against the glass window of the coach but even in that flash of perception he recognized the profile that he had seen at the window of the mysterious hut  he halted for an instant dazed and bewildered in the dust of the departing wheels  then as the bulk of the vehicle reappeared already narrowing in the distance without a second thought he dashed after it his disappointment his selfcriticism his practical resolutions were forgotten  he had but one idea nowthe vision was providential  the clue to the mystery was before himhe must follow it  yet he had sense enough to realize that the coach would not stop to take up a passenger between stations and that the next station was the one three miles below skinners  it would not be difficult to reach this by a cutoff in time and although the vehicle had appeared to be crowded he could no doubt obtain a seat on top  his eager curiosity however led him to put spurs to his horse and range up alongside of the coach as if passing it while he examined the stranger more closely  her face was bent listlessly over a book there was unmistakably the same profile that he had seen but the full face was different in outline and expression  a strange sense of disappointment that was almost a revulsion of feeling came over him he lingered he glanced again she was certainly a very pretty woman there was the beautifully rounded chin the short straight nose and delicately curved upper lip that he had seen in the profileand yetyet it was not the same face he had dreamt of  with an odd provoking sense of disillusion he swept ahead of the coach and again slackened his speed to let it pass  this time the fair unknown raised her long lashes and gazed suddenly at this persistent horseman at her side and an odd expression it seemed to him almost a glance of recognition and expectation came into her dark languid eyes  the pupils concentrated upon him with a singular significance that was almost he even thought a reply to his glance and yet it was as utterly unintelligible  a moment later however it was explained he had fallen slightly behind in a new confusion of hesitation wonder and embarrassment when from a wooded trail to the right another horseman suddenly swept into the road before him  he was a powerfully built man mounted on a thoroughbred horse of a quality far superior to the ordinary roadster  without looking at key he easily ranged up beside the coach as if to pass it but key with a sudden resolution put spurs to his own horse and ranged also abreast of him in time to see his fair unknown start at the apparition of this second horseman and unmistakably convey some signal to hima signal that to keys fancy now betrayed some warning of himself  he was the more convinced as the stranger after continuing a few paces ahead of the coach allowed it to pass him at a curve of the road and slackened his pace to permit key to do the same  instinctively conscious that the strangers object was to scrutinize or identify him he determined to take the initiative and fixed his eyes upon him as they approached but the stranger who wore a loose brown linen duster over clothes that appeared to be superior in fashion and material also had part of his face and head draped by a white silk handkerchief worn under his hat ostensibly to keep the sun and dust from his head and neckand had the advantage of him  he only caught the flash of a pair of steelgray eyes as the newcomer apparently having satisfied himself gave rein to his spirited steed and easily repassed the coach disappearing in a cloud of dust before it  but key had by this time reached the cutoff which the stranger if he intended to follow the coach either disdained or was ignorant of and he urged his horse to its utmost speed  even with the strangers advantages it would be a close race to the station  nevertheless as he dashed on he was by no means insensible to the somewhat quixotic nature of his undertaking  if he was right in his suspicion that a signal had been given by the lady to the stranger it was exceedingly probable that he had discovered not only the fair inmate of the robbers den but one of the gang itself or at least a confederate and ally  yet far from deterring him in that ingenious sophistry with which he was apt to treat his romance he now looked upon his adventure as a practical pursuit in the interests of law and justice  it was true that it was said that the band of road agents had been dispersed it was a fact that there had been no spoliation of coach or teams for three weeks but none of the depredators had ever been caught and their booty which was considerable was known to be still intact  it was to the interest of the mine his partners and his workmen that this clue to a danger which threatened the locality should be followed to the end  as to the lady in spite of the disappointment that still rankled in his breast he could be magnanimous  she might be the paramour of the strange horseman she might be only escaping from some hateful companionship by his aid  and yet one thing puzzled him she was evidently not acquainted with the personality of the active gang for she had without doubt at first mistaken him for one of them and after recognizing her real accomplice had communicated her mistake to him  it was a great relief to him when the rough and tangled cutoff at last broadened and lightened into the turnpike road again and he beheld scarcely a quarter of a mile before him the dust cloud that overhung the coach as it drew up at the lonely wayside station  he was in time for he knew that the horses were changed there but a sudden fear that the fair unknown might alight or take some other conveyance made him still spur his jaded steed forward  as he neared the station he glanced eagerly around for the other horseman but he was nowhere to be seen  he had evidently either abandoned the chase or ridden ahead  it seemed equally a part of what he believed was a providential intercession that on arriving at the station he found there was a vacant seat inside the coach  it was diagonally opposite that occupied by the lady and he was thus enabled to study her face as it was bent over her book whose pages however she scarcely turned  after her first casual glance of curiosity at the new passenger she seemed to take no more notice of him and key began to wonder if he had not mistaken her previous interrogating look nor was it his only disturbing query he was conscious of the same disappointment now that he could examine her face more attentively as in his first cursory glance  she was certainly handsome if there was no longer the freshness of youth there was still the indefinable charm of the woman of thirty and with it the delicate curves of matured muliebrity and repose  there were lines particularly around the mouth and fringed eyelids that were deepened as by pain and the chin even in its rounded fullness had the angle of determination  from what was visible below the brown linen duster that she wore she appeared to be tastefully although not richly dressed  as the coach at last drove away from the station a grizzled farmerlooking man seated beside her uttered a sigh of relief so palpable as to attract the general attention  turning to his fair neighbor with a smile of uncouth but goodhumored apology he said in explanation  youll excuse me miss  i dont know ezactly how youre feelinfor judging from your looks and ginral gait youre a stranger in these partsbut ez for me i dont mind sayin that i never feel ezactly safe from these yer road agents and stage robbers ontil arter we pass skinners station  all along thet gallopers ridge its jest tech and go like the woods is swarmin with em  but once past skinners youre all right  they never dare go below that  so ef you dont mind miss for its bein in your presence ill jest pull off my butes and ease my feet for a spell  neither the inconsequence of this singular request nor the smile it evoked on the faces of the other passengers seemed to disturb the ladys abstraction  scarcely lifting her eyes from her book she bowed a grave assent  you see miss he continued and you gents he added taking the whole coach into his confidence ive got over forty ounces of clean gold dust in them butes between the upper and lower soleand its mighty tight packing for my feet  ye kin heft it he said as he removed one boot and held it up before them  i put the dust there for safetykalkilatin that while these road gentry allus goes for a mans pockets and his body belt they never thinks of his butes or havent time to go through em  he looked around him with a smile of selfsatisfaction  the murmur of admiring comment was however broken by a burlybearded miner who sat in the middle seat  thets pretty fair as far as it goes he said smilingly but i reckon it wouldnt go far ef you started to run  ive got a simpler game than that gentlemen and ez were all friends here and the dangers over i dont mind tellin ye the first thing these yer road agents do after theyve covered the driver with their shot guns is to make the passengers get out and hold up their hands  that maamexplanatorily to the lady who betrayed only a languid interestis to keep em from drawing their revolvers a revolver is the last thing a road agent wants either in a mans hand or in his holster  so i sez to myself ef a sixshooter aint of no account wets the use of carryin it  so i just put my shootingiron in my valise when i travel and fill my holster with my gold dust so its a deuced sight heavier than a revolver but they dont feel its weight and dont keer to come nigh it  and ive been held up twice on tother side of the divide this year and i passed free every time  the applause that followed this revelation and the exhibition of the holster not only threw the farmers exploits into the shade but seemed to excite an emulation among the passengers  other methods of securing their property were freely discussed but the excitement culminated in the leaning forward of a passenger who had up to that moment maintained a reserve almost equal to the fair unknown  his dress and general appearance were those of a professional man his voice and manner corroborated the presumption  i dont think gentlemen he began with a pleasant smile that any man of us here would like to be called a coward but in fighting with an enemy who never attacks or even appears except with a deliberately prepared advantage on his side it is my opinion that a man is not only justified in avoiding an unequal encounter with him but in circumventing by every means the object of his attack  you have all been frank in telling your methods  i will be equally so in telling mine even if i have perhaps to confess to a little more than you have for i have not only availed myself of a wellknown rule of the robbers who infest these mountains to exempt all women and children from their spoliationa rule which of course they perfectly understand gives them a sentimental consideration with all californiansbut i have i confess also availed myself of the innocent kindness of one of that charming and justly exempted sex  he paused and bowed courteously to the fair unknown  when i entered this coach i had with me a bulky parcel which was manifestly too large for my pockets yet as evidently too small and too valuable to be intrusted to the ordinary luggage seeing my difficulty our charming companion opposite out of the very kindness and innocence of her heart offered to make a place for it in her satchel which was not full  i accepted the offer joyfully  when i state to you gentlemen that that package contained valuable government bonds to a considerable amount i do so not to claim your praise for any originality of my own but to make this public avowal to our fair fellow passenger for securing to me this most perfect security and immunity from the road agent that has been yet recorded  with his eyes riveted on the ladys face key saw a faint color rise to her otherwise impassive face which might have been called out by the enthusiastic praise that followed the lawyers confession  but he was painfully conscious of what now seemed to him a monstrous situation here was he believed the actual accomplice of the road agents calmly receiving the complacent and puerile confessions of the men who were seeking to outwit them could he in ordinary justice to them to himself or the mission he conceived he was pursuing refrain from exposing her or warning them privately  but was he certain  was a vague remembrance of a profile momentarily seenand as he must even now admit inconsistent with the full face he was gazing atsufficient for such an accusation  more than that was the protection she had apparently afforded the lawyer consistent with the function of an accomplice  then if the dangers over said the lady gently reaching down to draw her satchel from under the seat i suppose i may return it to you  by no means  dont trouble yourself  pray allow me to still remain your debtorat least as far as the next station said the lawyer gallantly  the lady uttered a languid sigh sank back in her seat and calmly settled herself to the perusal of her book  key felt his cheeks beginning to burn with the embarrassment and shame of his evident misconception  and here he was on his way to marysville to follow a woman for whom he felt he no longer cared and for whose pursuit he had no longer the excuse of justice  then i understand that you have twice seen these road agents said the professional man turning to the miner  of course you could be able to identify them  nary a man  you see theyre all masked and only one of em ever speaks  the leader or chief  no the orator  the orator repeated the professional man in amazement  well you see i call him the orator for hes mighty glib with his tongue and reels off all he has to say like as if he had it by heart hes mighty rough on you too sometimes for all his hightoned style ef he thinks a man is hidin anything he jest scalps him with his tongue and blamed if i dont think he likes the chance of doin it hes got a regular set speech and hes bound to go through it all even if he makes everything wait and runs the risk of capture  yet he aint the chiefand even ive heard folks say aint got any responsibility if he is took for he dont tech anybody or anybodys money and couldnt be prosecuted  i reckon hes some sort of a brokendown lawyerdye see  not much of a lawyer i imagine said the professional man smiling for hell find himself quite mistaken as to his share of responsibility  but its a rather clever way of concealing the identity of the real leader  its the smartest gang that was ever started in the sierras  they fooled the sheriff of sierra the other day  they gave him a sort of idea that they had a kind of hidinplace in the woods whar they met and kept their booty and by jinks he goes down thar with his hull possejust spilin for a fightand only lights upon a gang of innocent greenhorns who were boring for silver on the very spot where he allowed the robbers had their den  he aint held up his head since  key cast a quick glance at the lady to see the effect of this revelation  but her faceif the same profile he had seen at the windowbetrayed neither concern nor curiosity  he let his eyes drop to the smart boot that peeped from below her gown and the thought of his trying to identify it with the slipper he had picked up seemed to him as ridiculous as his other misconceptions  he sank back gloomily in his seat by degrees the fatigue and excitement of the day began to mercifully benumb his senses twilight had fallen and the talk had ceased  the lady had allowed her book to drop in her lap as the darkness gathered and had closed her eyes he closed his own and slipped away presently into a dream in which he saw the profile again as he had seen it in the darkness of the hollow only that this time it changed to a full face unlike the ladys or any one he had ever seen then the window seemed to open with a rattle and he again felt the cool odors of the forest but he awoke to find that the lady had only opened her window for a breath of fresh air  it was nearly eight o clock it would be an hour yet before the coach stopped at the next station for supper the passengers were drowsily nodding he closed his eyes and fell into a deeper sleep from which he awoke with a start  the coach had stopped    chapter iv  it cant be three pines yet said a passengers voice in which the laziness of sleep still lingered or else weve snoozed over five mile  i dont see no lights wot are we stoppin for  the other passengers struggled to an upright position  one nearest the window opened it its place was instantly occupied by the double muzzle of a shotgun  no one moved  in the awestricken silence the voice of the driver rose in drawling protestation  it aint no business o mine but it sorter strikes me that you chaps are aplayin it just a little too fine this time  it aint three miles from three pine station and forty men  of course thats your lookoutnot mine  the audacity of the thing had evidently struck even the usually taciturn and phlegmatic driver into his first expostulation on record  your thoughtful consideration does you great credit said a voice from the darkness and shall be properly presented to our manager but at the same time we wish it understood that we do not hesitate to take any risks in strict attention to our business and our clients  in the mean time you will expedite matters and give your passengers a chance to get an early tea at three pines by handing down that treasurebox and mailpouch  be careful in handling that blunderbuss you keep beside it the last time it unfortunately went off and i regret to say slightly wounded one of your passengers accidents of this kind interfering as they do with the harmony and pleasure of our chance meetings cannot be too highly deplored  by gosh ejaculated an outside passenger in an audible whisper  thank you sir said the voice quietly but as i overlooked you i will trouble you now to descend with the others  the voice moved nearer and by the light of a flaming bullseye cast upon the coach it could be seen to come from a stout mediumsized man with a black mask which however showed half of a smooth beardless face and an affable yet satirical mouth  the speaker cleared his throat with the slight preparatory cough of the practiced orator and approaching the window to keys intense surprise actually began in the identical professional and rhetorical style previously indicated by the miner  circumstances over which we have no control gentlemen compel us to oblige you to alight stand in a row on one side and hold up your hands  you will find the attitude not unpleasant after your cramped position in the coach while the change from its confined air to the wholesome nightbreeze of the sierras cannot but prove salutary and refreshing  it will also enable us to relieve you of such socalled valuables and treasures in the way of gold dust and coin which i regret to say too often are misapplied in careless hands and which the teachings of the highest morality distinctly denominate as the root of all evil  i need not inform you gentlemen as business men that promptitude and celerity of compliance will insure dispatch and shorten an interview which has been sometimes needlessly and i regret to say painfully protracted  he drew back deliberately with the same monotonous precision of habit and disclosed the muzzles of his confederates weapons still leveled at the passengers  in spite of their astonishment indignation and discomfiture his practiced effrontery and deliberate display appeared in some way to touch their humorous sense and one or two smiled hysterically as they rose and hesitatingly filed out of the vehicle it is possible however that the leveled shotguns contributed more or less directly to this result  two masks began to search the passengers under the combined focus of the bullseyes the shining gunbarrels and a running but still carefully prepared commentary from the spokesman  it is to be regretted that business men instead of intrusting their property to the custody of the regularly constituted express agent still continue to secrete it on their persons a custom that without enhancing its security is not only an injustice to the express company but a great detriment to dispatch  we also wish to point out that while we do not as a rule interfere with the possession of articles of ordinary personal use or adornment such as simple jewelry or watches we reserve our right to restrict by confiscation the vulgarity and unmanliness of diamonds and enormous fob chains  the act of spoliation was apparently complete yet it was evident that the orator was restraining himself for a more effective climax clearing his throat again and stepping before the impatient but still mystified file of passengers he reviewed them gravely  then in a perfectly pitched tone of mingled pain and apology he said slowly  it would seem that from no wish of our own we are obliged on this present occasion to suspend one or two of our usual rules  we are not in the habit of interfering with the wearing apparel of our esteemed clients but in the interests of ordinary humanity we are obliged to remove the boots of the gentleman on the extreme left which evidently give him great pain and impede his locomotion  we also seldom deviate from our rule of obliging our clients to hold up their hands during this examination but we gladly make an exception in favor of the gentleman next to him and permit him to hand us the altogether too heavily weighted holster which presses upon his hip  gentlemen said the orator slightly raising his voice with a deprecating gesture you need not be alarmed  the indignant movement of our friend just now was not to draw his revolverfor it isnt there  he paused while his companions speedily removed the farmers boots and the miners holster and with a still more apologetic air approached the coach where only the lady remained erect and rigid in her corner and now he said with simulated hesitation we come to the last and to us the most painful suspension of our rules  on these very rare occasions when we have been honored with the presence of the fair sex it has been our invariable custom not only to leave them in the undisturbed possession of their property but even of their privacy as well  it is with deep regret that on this occasion we are obliged to make an exception  for in the present instance the lady out of the gentleness of her heart and the politeness of her sex has burdened herself not only with the weight but the responsibility of a package forced upon her by one of the passengers  we feel and we believe gentlemen that most of you will agree with us that so scandalous and unmanly an attempt to evade our rules and violate the sanctity of the ladys immunity will never be permitted  for your own sake madam we are compelled to ask you for the satchel under your seat  it will be returned to you when the package is removed  one moment said the professional man indignantly there is a man here whom you have spareda man who lately joined us  is that man pointing to the astonished key one of your confederates  that man returned the spokesman with a laugh is the owner of the sylvan hollow mine  we have spared him because we owe him some consideration for having been turned out of his house at the dead of night while the sheriff of sierra was seeking us  he stopped and then in an entirely different voice and in a totally changed manner said roughly tumble in there all of you quick  and you sir to keyid advise you to ride outside  now driver raise so much as a rein or a whiplash until you hear the signaland by god youll know what next  he stepped back and seemed to be instantly swallowed up in the darkness but the light of a solitary bullseyethe holder himself invisiblestill showed the muzzles of the guns covering the driver  there was a momentary stir of voices within the closed coach but an angry roar of silence from the darkness hushed it  the moments crept slowly by all now were breathless  then a clear whistle rang from the distance the light suddenly was extinguished the leveled muzzles vanished with it the drivers lash fell simultaneously on the backs of his horses and the coach leaped forward  the jolt nearly threw key from the top but a moment later it was still more difficult to keep his seat in the headlong fury of their progress again and again the lash descended upon the maddened horses until the whole coach seemed to leap bound and swerve with every stroke  cries of protest and even distress began to come from the interior but the driver heeded it not  a window was suddenly let down the voice of the professional man saying whats the matter  were not followed  you are imperiling our lives by this speed was answered only by will some of ye throttle that dd fool from the driver and the renewed fall of the lash  the wayside trees appeared a solid plateau before them opened danced at their side closed up again behind thembut still they sped along  rushing down grades with the speed of an avalanche they ascended again without drawing rein and as if by sheer momentum for the heavy vehicle now seemed to have a diabolical energy of its own  it ground scattered rocks to powder with its crushing wheels it swayed heavily on ticklish corners recovering itself with the resistless forward propulsion of the straining teams until the lights of three pine station began to glitter through the trees  then a succession of yells broke from the driver so strong and dominant that they seemed to outstrip even the speed of the unabated cattle lesser lights were presently seen running to and fro and on the outermost fringe of the settlement the stage pulled up before a crowd of wondering faces and the driver spoke  weve been held up on the open road by gd not three miles from whar ye men are sittin here yawpin  if thars a man among ye that hasnt got the soul of a skunk hell foller and close in upon em before they have a chance to get into the brush  having thus relieved himself of his duty as an enforced noncombatant and allowed all further responsibility to devolve upon his recreant fellow employees he relapsed into his usual taciturnity and drove a trifle less recklessly to the station where he grimly set down his bruised and discomfited passengers  as key mingled with them he could not help perceiving that neither the late orators explanation of his exemption from their fate nor the drivers surly corroboration of his respectability had pacified them  for a time this amused him particularly as he could not help remembering that he first appeared to them beside the mysterious horseman who some one thought had been identified as one of the masks  but he was not a little piqued to find that the fair unknown appeared to participate in their feelings and his first civility to her met with a chilling response  even then in the general disillusion of his romance regarding her this would have been only a momentary annoyance but it strangely revived all his previous suspicions and set him to thinking  was the singular sagacity displayed by the orator in his search purely intuitive could any one have disclosed to him the secret of the passengers hoards was it possible for her while sitting alone in the coach to have communicated with the band  suddenly the remembrance flashed across him of her opening the window for fresh air  she could have easily then dropped some signal  if this were so and she really was the culprit it was quite natural for her own safety that she should encourage the passengers in the absurd suspicion of himself  his dying interest revived a few moments ago he had half resolved to abandon his quest and turn back at three pines  now he determined to follow her to the end  but he did not indulge in any further sophistry regarding his duty yet in a new sense of honor he did not dream of retaliating upon her by communicating his suspicions to his fellow passengers when the coach started again he took his seat on the top and remained there until they reached jamestown in the early evening  here a number of his despoiled companions were obliged to wait to communicate with their friends happily the exemption that had made them indignant enabled him to continue his journey with a full purse  but he was content with a modest surveillance of the lady from the top of the coach  on arriving at stockton this surveillance became less easy  it was the terminus of the stageroute and the divergence of others by boat and rail  if he were lucky enough to discover which one the lady took his presence now would be more marked and might excite her suspicion  but here a circumstance which he also believed to be providential determined him  as the luggage was being removed from the top of the coach he overheard the agent tell the expressman to check the ladys trunk to san luis  key was seized with an idea which seemed to solve the difficulty although it involved a risk of losing the clue entirely  there were two routes to san luis one was by stage and direct though slower the other by steamboat and rail via san francisco  if he took the boat there was less danger of her discovering him even if she chose the same conveyance if she took the direct stageand he trusted to a womans avoidance of the hurry of change and transshipment for that choicehe would still arrive at san luis via san francisco an hour before her  he resolved to take the boat a careful scrutiny from a stateroom window of the arriving passengers on the gangplank satisfied him that she had preferred the stage  there was still the chance that in losing sight of her she might escape him but the risk seemed small  and a trifling circumstance had almost unconsciously influenced himafter his romantic and superstitious fashionas to this final step  he had been singularly moved when he heard that san luis was the ladys probable destination  it did not seem to bear any relation to the mountain wilderness and the wild life she had just quitted it was apparently the most antipathic incongruous and inconsistent refuge she could have taken  it offered no opportunity for the disposal of booty or for communication with the gang  it was less secure than a crowded town  an old spanish mission and monastery college in a sleepy pastoral plainit had even retained its oldworld flavor amidst american improvements and social revolution  he knew it well  from the quaint college cloisters where the only reposeful years of his adventurous youth had been spent to the long alameda or double avenues of ancient trees which connected it with the convent of santa luisa and some of his youthful devotionsit had been the nursery of his romance  he was amused at what seemed to be the irony of fate in now linking it with this folly of his maturer manhood and yet he was uneasily conscious of being more seriously affected by it  and it was with a greater anxiety than this adventure had ever yet cost him that he at last arrived at the san jose hotel and from a balcony corner awaited the coming of the coach  his heart beat rapidly as it approached  she was there  but at her side as she descended from the coach was the mysterious horseman of the sierra road  key could not mistake the wellbuilt figure whatever doubt there had been about the features which had been so carefully concealed  with the astonishment of this rediscovery there flashed across him again the fatefulness of the inspiration which had decided him not to go in the coach  his presence there would have no doubt warned the stranger and so estopped this convincing denouement  it was quite possible that her companion by relays of horses and the advantage of bridle cutoffs could have easily followed the three pine coach and joined her at stockton  but for what purpose  the ladys trunk which had not been disturbed during the first part of the journey and had been forwarded at stockton untouched before keys eyes could not have contained booty to be disposed of in this forgotten old town  the register of the hotel bore simply the name of mrs barker of stockton but no record of her companion who seemed to have disappeared as mysteriously as he came  that she occupied a sittingroom on the same floor as his ownin which she was apparently secluded during the rest of the daywas all he knew nobody else seemed to know her  key felt an odd hesitation that might have been the result of some vague fear of implicating her prematurely in making any marked inquiry or imperiling his secret by the bribed espionage of servants  once when he was passing her door he heard the sounds of laughteralbeit innocent and heartfreewhich seemed so inconsistent with the gravity of the situation and his own thoughts that he was strangely shocked  but he was still more disturbed by a later occurrence  in his watchfulness of the movements of his neighbor he had been equally careful of his own and had not only refrained from registering his name but had enjoined secrecy upon the landlord whom he knew yet the next morning after his arrival the porter not answering his bell promptly enough he so far forgot himself as to walk to the staircase which was near the ladys room and call to the employee over the balustrade  as he was still leaning over the railing the faint creak of a door and a singular magnetic consciousness of being overlooked caused him to turn slowly but only in time to hear the rustle of a withdrawing skirt as the door was quickly closed  in an instant he felt the full force of his foolish heedlessness but it was too late  had the mysterious fugitive recognized him  perhaps not their eyes had not met and his face had been turned away  he varied his espionage by subterfuges which his knowledge of the old town made easy  he watched the door of the hotel himself unseen from the windows of a billiard saloon opposite which he had frequented in former days  yet he was surprised the same afternoon to see her from his coigne of vantage reentering the hotel where he was sure he had left her a few moments ago  had she gone out by some other exitor had she been disguised  but on entering his room that evening he was confounded by an incident that seemed to him as convincing of her identity as it was audacious  lying on his pillow were a few dead leaves of an odorous mountain fern known only to the sierras  they were tied together by a narrow blue ribbon and had evidently been intended to attract his attention  as he took them in his hand the distinguishing subtle aroma of the little sylvan hollow in the hills came to him like a memory and a revelation  he summoned the chambermaid she knew nothing of them or indeed of any one who had entered his room  he walked cautiously into the hall the ladys sittingroom door was open the room was empty  the occupant said the chambermaid had left that afternoon  he held the proof of her identity in his hand but she herself had vanished  that she had recognized him there was now no doubt had she divined the real object of his quest or had she accepted it as a mere sentimental gallantry at the moment when she knew it was hopeless and she herself was perfectly safe from pursuit  in either event he had been duped  he did not know whether to be piqued angryor relieved of his irresolute quest  nevertheless he spent the rest of the twilight and the early evening in fruitlessly wandering through the one long thoroughfare of the town until it merged into the bosky alameda or spacious grove that connected it with santa luisa  by degrees his chagrin and disappointment were forgotten in the memories of the past evoked by the familiar pathway  the moon was slowly riding overhead and silvering the carriageway between the straight ebony lines of trees while the footpaths were diapered with black and white checkers  the faint tinkling of a tramcar bell in the distance apprised him of one of the few innovations of the past the car was approaching him overtook him and was passing with its faintly illuminated windows when glancing carelessly up he beheld at one of them the profile of the face which he had just thought he had lost forever  he stopped for an instant not in indecision this time but in a grim resolution to let no chance escape him now  the car was going slowly it was easy to board it now but again the tinkle of the bell indicated that it was stopping at the corner of a road beyond he checked his pacea lady alightedit was she  she turned into the crossstreet darkened with the shadows of some low suburban tenement houses and he boldly followed  he was fully determined to find out her secret and even if necessary to accost her for that purpose  he was perfectly aware what he was doing and all its risks and penalties he knew the audacity of such an introduction but he felt in his lefthand pocket for the sprig of fern which was an excuse for it he knew the danger of following a possible confidante of desperadoes but he felt in his righthand pocket for the derringer that was equal to it  they were both there he was ready  he was nearing the convent and the oldest and most ruinous part of the town  he did not disguise from himself the gloomy significance of this even in the old days the crumbling adobe buildings that abutted on the old garden wall of the convent were the haunts of lawless mexicans and vagabond peons  as the roadway began to be rough and uneven and the gaunt outlines of the sagging roofs of tiles stood out against the sky above the lurking shadows of ruined doorways he was prepared for the worst  as the crumbling but still massive walls of the convent garden loomed ahead the tall graceful blackgowned figure he was following presently turned into the shadow of the wall itself  he quickened his pace lest it should again escape him suddenly it stopped and remained motionless  he stopped too  at the same moment it vanished  he ran quickly forward to where it had stood and found himself before a large iron gate with a smaller one in the centre that had just clanged to on its rusty hinges  he rubbed his eyesthe place the gate the wall were all strangely familiar  then he stepped back into the roadway and looked at it again  he was not mistaken  he was standing before the porters lodge of the convent of the sacred heart    chapter v  the day following the great stagecoach robbery found the patient proprietor of collinsons mill calm and untroubled in his usual seclusion  the news that had thrilled the length and breadth of gallopers ridge had not touched the leafy banks of the driedup river the hue and cry had followed the stageroad and no courier had deemed it worth his while to diverge as far as the rocky ridge which formed the only pathway to the mill  that day collinsons solitude had been unbroken even by the haggard emigrant from the valley with his old monotonous story of hardship and privation the birds had flown nearer to the old mill as if emboldened by the unwonted quiet  that morning there had been the half human imprint of a bears foot in the ooze beside the millwheel and coming home with his scant stock from the woodland pasture he had found a golden squirrela beautiful airy embodiment of the brown woods itselfcalmly seated on his barcounter with a biscuit between its baby hands  he was full of his characteristic reveries and abstractions that afternoon falling into them even at his woodpile leaning on his axeso still that an emeraldthroated lizard who had slid upon the log went to sleep under the forgotten stroke  but at nightfall the wind aroseat first as a distant murmur along the hillside that died away before it reached the rocky ledge then it rocked the tops of the tall redwoods behind the mill but left the mill and the dried leaves that lay in the riverbed undisturbed  then the murmur was prolonged until it became the continuous trouble of some faroff sea and at last the wind possessed the ledge itself driving the smoke down the stumpy chimney of the mill rattling the sunwarped shingles on the roof stirring the inside rafters with cool breaths and singing over the rough projections of the outside eaves  at nine oclock he rolled himself up in his blankets before the fire as was his wont and fell asleep  it was past midnight when he was awakened by the familiar clatter of boulders down the grade the usual simulation of a wild rush from without that encompassed the whole mill even to that heavy impact against the door which he had heard once before  in this he recognized merely the ordinary phenomena of his experience and only turned over to sleep again  but this time the door rudely fell in upon him and a figure strode over his prostrate body with a gun leveled at his head  he sprang sideways for his own weapon which stood by the hearth in another second that action would have been his last and the solitude of seth collinson might have remained henceforward unbroken by any mortal  but the gun of the first figure was knocked sharply upward by a second man and the one and only shot fired that night sped harmlessly to the roof  with the report he felt his arms gripped tightly behind him through the smoke he saw dimly that the room was filled with masked and armed men and in another moment he was pinioned and thrust into his empty armchair at a signal three of the men left the room and he could hear them exploring the other rooms and outhouses  then the two men who had been standing beside him fell back with a certain disciplined precision as a smoothchinned man advanced from the open door going to the bar he poured out a glass of whiskey tossed it off deliberately and standing in front of collinson with his shoulder against the chimney and his hand resting lightly on his hip cleared his throat  had collinson been an observant man he would have noticed that the two men dropped their eyes and moved their feet with a half impatient perfunctory air of waiting  had he witnessed the stagerobbery he would have recognized in the smoothfaced man the presence of the orator  but he only gazed at him with his dull imperturbable patience  we regret exceedingly to have to use force to a gentleman in his own house began the orator blandly but we feel it our duty to prevent a repetition of the unhappy incident which occurred as we entered  we desire that you should answer a few questions and are deeply grateful that you are still able to do sowhich seemed extremely improbable a moment or two ago  he paused coughed and leaned back against the chimney  how many men have you here besides yourself  nary one said collinson  the interrogator glanced at the other men who had reentered  they nodded significantly  good he resumed  you have told the truthan excellent habit and one that expedites business  now is there a room in this house with a door that locks  your front door doesnt  no  no cellar nor outhouse  no  we regret that for it will compel us much against our wishes to keep you bound as you are for the present  the matter is simply this circumstances of a very pressing nature oblige us to occupy this house for a few dayspossibly for an indefinite period  we respect the sacred rites of hospitality too much to turn you out of it indeed nothing could be more distasteful to our feelings than to have you in your own person spread such a disgraceful report through the chivalrous sierras  we must therefore keep you a close prisoneropen however to an offer  it is this we propose to give you five hundred dollars for this property as it stands provided that you leave it and accompany a packtrain which will start tomorrow morning for the lower valley as far as thompsons pass binding yourself to quit the state for three months and keep this matter a secret  three of these gentlemen will go with you they will point out to you your duty their shotguns will apprise you of any dereliction from it  what do you say  who yer talking to said collinson in a dull voice  you remind us said the orator suavely that we have not yet the pleasure of knowing  my names seth collinson  there was a dead silence in the room and every eye was fixed upon the two men  the orators smile slightly stiffened  where from he continued blandly  mizzouri  a very good place to go back tothrough thompsons pass  but you havent answered our proposal  i reckon i dont intend to sell this house or leave it said collinson simply  i trust you will not make us regret the fortunate termination of your little accident mr collinson said the orator with a singular smile may i ask why you object to selling out  is it the figure  the house isnt mine said collinson deliberately  i built this yer house for my wife wot i left in mizzouri  its hers  i kalkilate to keep it and live in it ontil she comes fur it  and when i tell ye that she is dead ye kin reckon just what chance ye have of ever gettin it  there was an unmistakable start of sensation in the room followed by a silence so profound that the moaning of the wind on the mountainside was distinctly heard  a wellbuilt man with a mask that scarcely concealed his heavy mustachios who had been standing with his back to the orator in half contemptuous patience faced around suddenly and made a step forward as if to come between the questioner and questioned  a voice from the corner ejaculated by gd  silence said the orator sharply  then still more harshly he turned to the others pick him up and stand him outside with a guard and then clear out all of you  the prisoner was lifted up and carried out the room was instantly cleared only the orator and the man who had stepped forward remained simultaneously they drew the masks from their faces and stood looking at each other  the orators face was smooth and corrupt the full sensual lips wrinkled at the corners with a sardonic humor the man who confronted him appeared to be physically and even morally his superior albeit gloomy and discontented in expression  he cast a rapid glance around the room to assure himself that they were alone and then straightening his eyebrows as he backed against the chimney said  dd if i like this chivers  its your affair but its mighty lowdown work for a man  you might have made it easier if you hadnt knocked up bryces gun that would have settled it though no one guessed that the cur was her husband said chivers hotly  if you want it settled that way theres still time returned the other with a slight sneer  youve only to tell him that youre the man that ran away with his wife and youll have it out together right on the ledge at twelve paces  the boys will see you through  in fact he added his sneer deepening i rather think its what theyre expecting  thank you mr jack riggs said chivers sardonically  i dare say it would be more convenient to some people just before our booty is divided if i were drilled through by a blundering shot from that hayseed or it would seem right to your hightoned chivalry if a deadshot as i am knocked over a man who may have never fired a revolver before but i dont exactly see it in that light either as a man or as your equal partner  i dont think you quite understand me my dear jack  if you dont value the only man who is identified in all california as the leader of this gang the man whose style and address has made it popularyes popular by gdto every man woman and child who has heard of him whose sayings and doings are quoted by the newspapers whom people run risks to see who has got the sympathy of the crowd so that judges hesitate to issue warrants and constables to serve themif you dont see the use of such a man i do  why theres a column and a half in the sacramento union about our last job calling me the claude duval of the sierras and speaking of my courtesy to a lady  a ladyhis wife by gd our confederate  my dear jack you not only dont know business values but pon my soul you dont seem to understand humor  ha ha  for all his cynical levity for all his affected exaggeration there was the ring of an unmistakable and even pitiable vanity in his voice and a selfconsciousness that suffused his broad cheeks and writhed his full mouth but seemed to deepen the frown on riggss face  you know the woman hates it and would bolt if she couldeven from you said riggs gloomily  think what she might do if she knew her husband were here  i tell you she holds our lives in the hollow of her hand  thats your fault mr jack riggs you would bring your sister with her infernal convent innocence and simplicity into our hut in the hollow  she was meek enough before that  but this is sheer nonsense i have no fear of her  the woman dont live who would go back on godfrey chiversfor a husband  besides she went off to see your sister at the convent at santa clara as soon as she passed those bonds off on charley to get rid of  think of her traveling with that dd fool lawyer all the way to stockton and his bonds which we had put back in her bag alongside of them all the time and he telling her he was going to stop their payment and giving her the letter to mail for himeh  well well have time to get rid of her husband before she gets back  if he dont go easywell  none of that chivers you understand once for all interrupted riggs peremptorily  if you cannot see that your making away with that womans husband would damn that boasted reputation you make so much of and set every mans hand against us i do and i wont permit it  its a rotten business enoughour coming on him as we have and if this wasnt the only godforsaken place where we could divide our stuff without danger and get it away off the highroads id pull up stakes at once  let her stay at the convent then and be dd to her said chivers roughly  shell be glad enough to be with your sister again and theres no fear of her being touched there  but i want to put an end to that too returned riggs sharply i do not choose to have my sister any longer implicated with our confederate or your mistress  no more of thatyou understand me  the two men had been standing side by side leaning against the chimney  chivers now faced his companion his full lips wreathed into an evil smile  i think i understand you mr jack riggs ori beg your pardonrivers or whatever your real name may be he began slowly sadie collinson the mistress of judge godfrey chivers formerly of kentucky was good enough company for you the day you dropped down upon us in our little house in the hollow of gallopers ridge we were living quite an idyllic pastoral life there werent weshe and me hidden from the censorious eye of society andcollinson obeying only the voice of nature and the little birds it was a happy time he went on with a grimly affected sigh disregarding his companions impatient gesture  you were young then waging your fight against society and freshuncommonly fresh i may sayfrom your first exploit  and a very stupid clumsy awkward exploit too mr riggs if you will pardon my freedom  you wanted money and you had an ugly temper and you had lost both to a gambler so you stopped the coach to rob him and had to kill two men to get back your paltry thousand dollars after frightening a whole coachload of passengers and letting wells fargo and cos treasurebox with fifty thousand dollars in it slide  it was a stupid a blundering a cruel act mr riggs and i think i told you so at the time  it was a waste of energy and material and made you not a hero but a stupid outcast  i think i proved this to you and showed you how it might have been done  dry up on that interrupted riggs impatiently  you offered to become my partner and you did  pardon me  observe my impetuous friend that my contention is that youyoupoisoned our blameless eden in the hollow that you were our serpent and that this sadie collinson over whom you have become so fastidious whom you knew as my mistress was obliged to become our confederate  you did not object to her when we formed our gang and her house became our hidingplace and refuge  you took advantage of her womans wit and fine address in disposing of our booty you availed yourself with the rest of the secrets she gathered as my mistress just as you were willing to profit by the superior address of her paramouryour humble servantwhen your own face was known to the sheriff and your old methods pronounced brutal and vulgar  excuse me but i must insist upon this and that you dropped down upon me and sadie collinson exactly as you have dropped down here upon her husband  enough of this said riggs angrily  i admit the woman is part and parcel of the gang and gets her shareor you get it for her he added sneeringly but that doesnt permit her to mix herself with my family affairs  pardon me again interrupted chivers softly  your memory my dear riggs is absurdly defective  we knew that you had a young sister in the mountains from whom you discreetly wished to conceal your real position  we respected and i trust shall always respect your noble reticence  but do you remember the night you were taking her to school at santa claratwo nights before the firewhen you were recognized on the road near skinners and had to fly with her for your life and brought her to usyour two dear old friends mr and mrs barker of chicago who had a pastoral home in the forest  you remember how we took her inyes doubly took her inand kept your secret from her and do you remember how this woman this mistress of mine and our confederate while we were away saved her from the fire on our only horse caught the stagecoach and brought her to the convent  riggs walked towards the window turned and coming back held out his hand  yes she did it and i thanked her as i thank you he stopped and hesitated as the other took his hand  but blank it all chivers dont you see that alice is a young girl and this woman isyou know what i mean  somebody might recognize her and that would be worse for alice than even if it were known what alices brother was gd if these two things were put together the girl would be ruined forever  jack said chivers suddenly you want this woman out of the way welldash it allshe nearly separated us and ill be frank with you as between man and man  ill give her up  there are women enough in the world and hang it were partners after all  then you abandon her said riggs slowly his eyes fixed on his companion  yes  shes getting a little too maundering lately  it will be a ticklish job to manage for she knows too much but it will be done theres my hand on it  riggs not only took no notice of the proffered hand but his former look of discontent came back with an illconcealed addition of loathing and contempt  well drop that now he said shortly weve talked here alone long enough already  the men are waiting for us  he turned on his heel into the inner room  chivers remained standing by the chimney until his stiffened smile gave way under the working of his writhing lips then he turned to the bar poured out and swallowed another glass of whiskey at a single gulp and followed his partner with halfclosed lids that scarcely veiled his ominous eyes  the men with the exception of the sentinels stationed on the rocky ledge and the one who was guarding the unfortunate collinson were drinking and gambling away their perspective gains around a small pile of portmanteaus and saddlebags heaped in the centre of the room they contained the results of their last successes but one pair of saddlebags bore the mildewed appearance of having been cached or buried some time before  most of their treasure was in packages of gold dust and from the conversation that ensued it appeared that owing to the difficulties of disposing of it in the mountain towns the plan was to convey it by ordinary pack mule to the unfrequented valley and thence by an emigrant wagon on the old emigrant trail to the southern counties where it could be no longer traced  since the recent robberies the local express companies and bankers had refused to receive it except the owners were known and identified  there had been but one box of coin which had already been speedily divided up among the band  drafts bills bonds and valuable papers had been usually intrusted to one charley who acted as a flying messenger to a corrupt broker in sacramento who played the role of the bands fence  it had been the duty of chivers to control this delicate business even as it had been his peculiar function to open all the letters and documents  this he had always lightened by characteristic levity and sarcastic comments on the private revelations of the contents the rough illspelt letter of the miner to his wife inclosing a draft or the more sentimental effusion of an emigrant swain to his sweetheart with the gift of a specimen had always received due attention at the hands of this elegant humorist  but the operation was conducted tonight with business severity and silence the two leaders sat opposite to each other in what might have appeared to the rest of the band a scarcely veiled surveillance of each others actions  when the examination was concluded and the more valuable inclosures put aside the despoiled letters were carried to the fire and heaped upon the coals  presently the chimney added its roar to the moaning of the distant hillside a few sparks leaped up and died out in the midnight air as if the pathos and sentiment of the unconscious correspondents had exhaled with them  thats a dd foolish thing to do growled french pete over his cards  why demanded chivers sharply  whywhy it makes a flare in the sky that any scout can see and a scent for him to follow  were four miles from any traveled road returned chivers contemptuously and the man who could see that glare and smell that smoke would be on his way here already  that reminds me that that chap youve tied upthat collinsonallows he wants to see you continued french pete  to see me repeated chivers  you mean the captain  i reckon he means you returned french pete he said the man who talked so purty  the men looked at each other with a smile of anticipation and put down their cards  chivers walked towards the door one or two rose to their feet as if to follow but riggs stopped them peremptorily sit down he said roughly then as chivers passed him he added to him in a lower tone remember  slightly squaring his shoulders and opening his coat to permit a rhetorical freedom which did not however prevent him from keeping touch with the butt of his revolver chivers stepped into the open air collinson had been moved to the shelter of an overhang of the roof probably more for the comfort of the guard who sat crosslegged on the ground near him than for his own dismissing the man with a gesture chivers straightened himself before his captive  we deeply regret that your unfortunate determination my dear sir has been the means of depriving us of the pleasure of your company and you of your absolute freedom but may we cherish the hope that your desire to see me may indicate some change in your opinion  by the light of the sentrys lantern left upon the ground chivers could see that collinsons face wore a slightly troubled and even apologetic expression  ive bin thinkin said collinson raising his eyes to his captor with a singularly new and shy admiration in them mebbee not so much of wot you said ez how you said it and its kinder bothered me sittin here that i aint bin actin to you boys quite on the square ive said to myself collinson thar aint another house betwixt bald top and skinners whar them fellows kin get a bite or a drink to help themselves and you aint offered em neither  it aint no matter who they are or how they came whether they came crawling along the road from the valley or dropped down upon you like them rocks from the grade yere they are and its your duty ez long ez you keep this yer house for your wife in trust so to speak for wanderers  and i aint forgettin yer ginerel soft style and easy gait with me when you kem here  it aint every man as could walk into another mans house arter the owner of it had grabbed a gun ez softspeakin ez overlookin and ez perlite ez you  ive acted mighty rough and lowdown and i know it  and i sent for you to say that you and your folks kin use this house and all thats in it ez long ez youre in trouble  ive told you why i couldnt sell the house to ye and why i couldnt leave it  but ye kin use it and while yere here and when you go collinson dont tell nobody  i dont know what ye mean by binding myself to keep your secret when collinson says a thing he sticks to it and when he passes his word with a man or a man passes his word with him it dont need no bit of paper  there was no doubt of its truth  in the grave upraised eyes of his prisoner chivers saw the certainty that he could trust him even far more than he could trust any one within the house he had just quitted but this very certainty for all its assurance of safety to himself filled him not with remorse which might have been an evanescent emotion but with a sudden alarming and terrible consciousness of being in the presence of a hitherto unknown and immeasurable power  he had no pity for man who trusted him he had no sense of shame in taking advantage of it he even felt an intellectual superiority in this want of sagacity in his dupe but he still felt in some way defeated insulted shocked and frightened  at first like all scoundrels he had measured the man by himself was suspicious and prepared for rivalry but the grave truthfulness of collinsons eyes left him helpless  he was terrified by this unknown factor  the right that contends and fights often stimulates its adversary the right that yields leaves the victor vanquished  chivers could even have killed collinson in his vague discomfiture but he had a terrible consciousness that there was something behind him that he could not make way with that was why this accomplished rascal felt his flaccid cheeks grow purple and his glib tongue trip before his captive  but collinson more occupied with his own shortcomings took no note of this and chivers quickly recovered his wits if not his former artificiality  all right he said quickly with a hurried glance at the door behind him  now that you think better of it ill be frank with you and tell you im your friend  you understandyour friend dont talk much to those mendont give yourself away to them he laughed this time in absolute natural embarrassment  dont talk about your wife and this house but just say youve made the thing up with mewith me you know and ill see you through  an idea as yet vague that he could turn collinsons unexpected docility to his own purposes possessed him even in his embarrassment and he was still more strangely conscious of his inordinate vanity gathering a fearful joy from collinsons evident admiration  it was heightened by his captives next words  ef i wasnt tied id shake hands with ye on that  youre the kind o man mr chivers that i cottoned to from the first  ef this house wasnt hers id a bin tempted to cotton to yer offer too and mebbee made yer one myself for it seems to me your style and mine would sorter jibe together  but i see you sabe whats in my mind and make allowance  we dont want no bit o paper to shake hands on that  your secret and your folks secret is mine and i dont blab that any more than id blab to them wot youve just told me  under a sudden impulse chivers leaned forward and albeit with somewhat unsteady hands and an embarrassed will untied the cords that held collinson in his chair  as the freed man stretched himself to his full height he looked gravely down into the bleared eyes of his captor and held out his strong right hand  chivers took it  whether there was some occult power in collinsons honest grasp i know not but there sprang up in chiverss agile mind the idea that a good way to get rid of mrs collinson was to put her in the way of her husbands finding her and for an instant in the contemplation of that idea this supreme rascal absolutely felt an embarrassing glow of virtue    chapter vi  the astonishment of preble key on recognizing the gateway into which the mysterious lady had vanished was so great that he was at first inclined to believe her entry there a mere trick of his fancy  that the confederate of a gang of robbers should be admitted to the austere recesses of the convent with a celerity that bespoke familiarity was incredible  he again glanced up and down the length of the shadowed but still visible wall  there was no one there  the wall itself contained no break or recess in which one could hide and this was the only gateway  the opposite side of the street in the full moonlight stared emptily  no unless she were an illusion herself and his whole chase a dream she must have entered here  but the chase was not hopeless  he had at least tracked her to a place where she could be identified  it was not a hotel which she could leave at any moment unobserved  though he could not follow her and penetrate its seclusion now he could laterthanks to his old associations with the padres of the contiguous collegegain an introduction to the lady superior on some pretext  she was safe there that night  he turned away with a feeling of relief  the incongruity of her retreat assumed a more favorable aspect to his hopes  he looked at the hallowed walls and the slumbering peacefulness of the gnarled old trees that hid the convent and a gentle reminiscence of his youth stole over him  it was not the first time that he had gazed wistfully upon that chaste refuge where perhaps the bright eyes that he had followed in the quaint school procession under the leafy alameda in the afternoon were at last closed in gentle slumber  there was the very grille through which the wicked conchitaor was it doloreshad shot her parthian glance at the lingering student  and the man of thirtyfive prematurely gray and settled in fortune smiled as he turned away and forgot the adventuress of thirty who had brought him there  the next morning he was up betimes and at the college of san jose father cipriano a trifle more snuffy and aged remembered with delight his old pupil  ah it was true then that he had become a mining president and that was why his hair was gray but he trusted that don preble had not forgot that this was not all of life and that fortune brought great responsibilities and cares but what was this then  he had thought of bringing out some of his relations from the states and placing a niece in the convent that was good and wise  ah yes  for education in this new country one must turn to the church  and he would see the lady superior  ah that was but the twist of ones finger and the lifting of a latch to a grave superintendent and a gray head like that  of course he had not forgotten the convent and the young senoritas nor the discipline and the suspended holidays  ah it was a special grace of our lady that he father cipriano had not been worried into his grave by those foolish muchachos  yet when he had extinguished a snuffy chuckle in his red bandana handkerchief key knew that he would accompany him to the convent that noon  it was with a slight stirring of shame over his elaborate pretext that he passed the gate of the sacred heart with the good father but it is to be feared that he speedily forgot that in the unexpected information that it elicited  the lady superior was gracious and even enthusiastic  ah yes it was a growing custom of the american caballeroswho had no homes nor yet time to create anyto bring their sisters wards and nieces here andwith a dovelike sideglance towards keyeven the young senoritas they wished to fit for their christian brides  unlike the caballero there were many business men so immersed in their affairs that they could not find time for a personal examination of the conventwhich was to be regrettedbut who trusting to the reputation of the sacred heart and its good friends simply sent the young lady there by some trusted female companion  notably this was the case of the senor riversdid don preble ever know hima great capitalist in the sierras whose sweet young sister a naive ingenuous creature was the pride of the convent  of course it was better that it was so  discipline and seclusion had to be maintained  the young girl should look upon this as her home  the rules for visitors were necessarily severe  it was rare indeedexcept in a case of urgency such as happened last nightthat even a lady unless the parent of a scholar was admitted to the hospitality of the convent  and this lady was only the friend of that same sister of the american capitalist although she was the one who had brought her there  no she was not a relation perhaps don preble had heard of a mrs barkerthe friend of rivers of the sierras  it was a queer combination of names  but what will you  the names of americanos mean nothing  and don preble knows them not  ah possiblygood  the lady would be remembered being tall dark and of fine presence though sad  a few hours earlier and don preble could have judged for himself for as it were she might have passed through this visitors room but she was gonedeparted by the coach  it was from a telegramthose heathen contrivances that blurt out things to you with never an excuse nor a smile nor a kiss of the hand  for her part she never let her scholars receive them but opened them herself and translated them in a christian spirit after due preparation at her leisure  and it was this telegram that made the senora barker go or without doubt she would have of herself told to the don preble her compatriot of the sierras how good the convent was for his niece  stung by the thought that this woman had again evaded him and disconcerted and confused by the scarcely intelligible information he had acquired key could with difficulty maintain his composure the caballero is tired of his long pasear said the lady superior gently we will have a glass of wine in the lodge waitingroom she led the way from the reception room to the outer door but stopped at the sound of approaching footsteps and rustling muslin along the gravel walk the second class are going out she said as a gentle procession of white frocks led by two nuns filed before the gateway  we will wait until they have passed  but the senor can see that my children do not look unhappy  they certainly looked very cheerful although they had halted before the gateway with a little of the demureness of young people who know they are overlooked by authority and had bumped against each other with affected gravity  somewhat ashamed of his useless deception and the guileless simplicity of the good lady superior key hesitated and began i am afraid that i am really giving you too much trouble and suddenly stopped  for as his voice broke the demure silence one of the nearesta young girl of apparently seventeenturned towards him with a quick and an apparently irresistible impulse and as quickly turned away again  but in that instant key caught a glimpse of a face that might not only have thrilled him in its beauty its freshness but in some vague suggestiveness  yet it was not that which set his pulses beating it was the look of joyous recognition set in the parted lips and sparkling eyes the glow of childlike innocent pleasure that mantled the sweet young face the frank confusion of suddenly realized expectancy and longing  a great truth gripped his throbbing heart and held it still it was the face that he had seen in the hollow  the movement of the young girl was too marked to escape the eye of the lady superior though she had translated it differently  you must not believe our young ladies are all so rude don preble she said dryly though our dear child has still some of the mountain freedom  and this is the senor riverss sister  but possiblywho knows she said gently yet with a sudden sharpness in her clear eyesperhaps she recognized in your voice a companion of her brother  luckily for key the shock had been so sudden and overpowering that he showed none of the lesser symptoms of agitation or embarrassment  in this revelation of a secret that he now instinctively felt was bound up with his own future happiness he exhibited none of the signs of a discovered intriguer or unmasked lothario  he said quietly and coldly i am afraid i have not the pleasure of knowing the young lady and certainly have never before addressed her  yet he scarcely heard his companions voice and answered mechanically seeing only before him the vision of the girls bewitching face in its still more bewitching consciousness of his presence  with all that he now knew or thought he knew came a strange delicacy of asking further questions a vague fear of compromising her a quick impatience of his present deception even his whole quest of her seemed now to be a profanation for which he must ask her forgiveness  he longed to be alone to recover himself even the temptation to linger on some pretext and wait for her return and another glance from her joyous eyes was not as strong as his conviction of the necessity of cooler thought and action  he had met his fate that morning for good or ill that was all he knew  as soon as he could decently retire he thanked the lady superior promised to communicate with her later and taking leave of father cipriano found himself again in the street  who was she what was she and what meant her joyous recognition of him  it is to be feared that it was the last question that affected him most now that he felt that he must have really loved her from the first  had she really seen him before and had been as mysteriously impressed as he was  it was not the reflection of a conceited man for key had not that kind of vanity and he had already touched the humility that is at the base of any genuine passion  but he would not think of that now  he had established the identity of the other woman as being her companion in the house in the hollow on that eventful night but it was her profile that he had seen at the window  the mysterious brother rivers might have been one of the robbersperhaps the one who accompanied mrs barker to san jose  but it was plain that the young girl had no complicity with the actions of the gang whatever might have been her companions confederation  in the prescience of a true lover he knew that she must have been deceived and kept in utter ignorance of it  there was no look of it in her lovely guileless eyes her very impulsiveness and ingenuousness would have long since betrayed the secret  was it left for him at this very outset of his passion to be the one to tell her  could he bear to see those frank beautiful eyes dimmed with shame and sorrow  his own grew moist another idea began to haunt him  would it not be wiser even more manly for hima man over twice her yearsto leave her alone with her secret and so pass out of her innocent young life as chancefully as he had entered it  but was it altogether chanceful  was there not in her innocent happiness in him a recognition of something in him better than he had dared to think himself  it was the last conceit of the humility of love  he reached his hotel at last unresolved perplexed yet singularly happy  the clerk handed him in passing a businesslooking letter formally addressed  without opening it he took it to his room and throwing himself listlessly on a chair by the window again tried to think  but the atmosphere of his room only recalled to him the mysterious gift he had found the day before on his pillow  he felt now with a thrill that it must have been from her how did she convey it there  she would not have intrusted it to mrs barker  the idea struck him now as distastefully as it seemed improbable  perhaps she had been here herself with her companionthe convent sometimes made that concession to a relative or wellknown friend  he recalled the fact that he had seen mrs barker enter the hotel alone after the incident of the opening door while he was leaning over the balustrade it was she who was alone then and had recognized his voice and he had not known it  she was out again today with the procession  a sudden idea struck him  he glanced quickly at the letter in his hand and hurriedly opened it  it contained only three lines in a large formal hand but they sent the swift blood to his cheeks  i heard your voice today for the third time  i want to hear it again  i will come at dusk  do not go out until then  he sat stupefied  was it madness audacity or a trick  he summoned the waiter  the letter had been left by a boy from the confectioners shop in the next block  he remembered it of olda resort for the young ladies of the convent  nothing was easier than conveying a letter in that way  he remembered with a shock of disillusion and disgust that it was a common device of silly but innocent assignation was he to be the ridiculous accomplice of a schoolgirls extravagant escapade or the deluded victim of some infamous plot of her infamous companion  he could not believe either yet he could not check a certain revulsion of feeling towards her which only a moment ago he would have believed impossible  yet whatever was her purpose he must prevent her coming there at any hazard  her visit would be the culmination of her folly or the success of any plot  even while he was fully conscious of the material effect of any scandal and exposure to her even while he was incensed and disillusionized at her unexpected audacity he was unusually stirred with the conviction that she was wronging herself and that more than ever she demanded his help and his consideration  still she must not come  but how was he to prevent her  it wanted but an hour of dusk  even if he could again penetrate the convent on some pretext at that inaccessible hour for visitorstwilighthow could he communicate with her  he might intercept her on the way and persuade her to return but she must be kept from entering the hotel  he seized his hat and rushed downstairs  but here another difficulty beset him  it was easy enough to take the ordinary road to the convent but would she follow that public one in what must be a surreptitious escape  and might she not have eluded the procession that morning and even now be concealed somewhere waiting for the darkness to make her visit  he concluded to patrol the block next to the hotel yet near enough to intercept her before she reached it until the hour came  the time passed slowly  he loitered before shop windows or entered and made purchases with his eye on the street the figure of a pretty girland there were manythe fluttering ribbons on a distant hat or the flashing of a cambric skirt around the corner sent a nervous thrill through him  the reflection of his grave abstracted face against a shop window or the announcement of the workings of his own mine on a bulletin board in its incongruity with his present occupation gave him an hysterical impulse to laugh  the shadows were already gathering when he saw a slender graceful figure disappear in the confectioners shop on the block below  in his elaborate precautions he had overlooked that common trysting spot  he hurried thither and entered  the object of his search was not there and he was compelled to make a shamefaced awkward survey of the tables in an inner refreshment saloon to satisfy himself  any one of the pretty girls seated there might have been the one who had just entered but none was the one he sought  he hurried into the street againhe had wasted a precious momentand resumed his watch  the sun had sunk the angelus had rung out of a chapel belfry and shadows were darkening the vista of the alameda  she had not come  perhaps she had thought better of it perhaps she had been prevented perhaps the whole appointment had been only a trick of some dayscholars who were laughing at him behind some window  in proportion as he became convinced that she was not coming he was conscious of a keen despair growing in his heart and a sickening remorse that he had ever thought of preventing her  and when he at last reluctantly reentered the hotel he was as miserable over the conviction that she was not coming as he had been at her expected arrival  the porter met him hurriedly in the hall  sister seraphina of the sacred heart has been here in a hurry to see you on a matter of importance he said eyeing key somewhat curiously she would not wait in the public parlor as she said her business was confidential so i have put her in a private sittingroom on your floor  key felt the blood leave his cheeks  the secret was out for all his precaution  the lady superior had discovered the girls flightor her attempt  one of the governing sisterhood was here to arraign him for it or at least prevent an open scandal  yet he was resolved and seizing this last straw he hurriedly mounted the stairs determined to do battle at any risk for the girls safety and to perjure himself to any extent  she was standing in the room by the window  the light fell upon the coarse serge dress with its white facings on the single girdle that scarcely defined the formless waist on the huge crucifix that dangled ungracefully almost to her knees on the hideous whitewinged coif that with the coarse but dense white veil was itself a renunciation of all human vanity  it was a figure he remembered well as a boy and even in his excitement and half resentment touched him now as when a boy with a sense of its pathetic isolation  his head bowed with boyish deference as she approached gently passed him a slight salutation and closed the door that he had forgotten to shut behind him  then with a rapid movement so quick that he could scarcely follow it the coif veil rosary and crucifix were swept off and the young pupil of the convent stood before him  for all the sombre suggestiveness of her disguise and its ungraceful contour there was no mistaking the adorable little head tumbled all over with silky tendrils of hair from the hasty withdrawal of her coif or the blue eyes that sparkled with frank delight beneath them  key thought her more beautiful than ever yet the very effect of her frankness and beauty was to recall him to all the danger and incongruity of her position  this is madness he said quickly  you may be followed here and discovered in this costume at any moment  nevertheless he caught the two little hands that had been extended to him and held them tightly and with a frank familiarity that he would have wondered at an instant before  but i wont she said simply  you see im doing a halfretreat and i stay with sister seraphina in her room and she always sleeps two hours after the angelus and i got out without anybody knowing me in her clothes  i see what it is she said suddenly bending a reproachful glance upon him you dont like me in them  i know theyre just horrid but it was the only way i could get out  you dont understand me he said eagerly  i dont like you to run these dreadful risks and dangers forhe would have said for me but added with sudden humilityfor nothing  had i dreamed that you cared to see me i would have arranged it easily without this indiscretion which might make others misjudge you every instant that you remain hereworse every moment that you are away from the convent in that disguise is fraught with danger i know you never thought of it  but i did she said quietly i thought of it and thought that if sister seraphina woke up and they sent for me you would take me away with you to that dear little hollow in the hills where i first heard your voice  you remember it dont you  you were lost i think in the darkness and i used to say to myself afterwards that i found you that was the first time  then the second time i heard you was here in the hall  i was alone in the other room for mrs barker had gone out i did not know you were here but i knew your voice  and the third time was before the convent gate and then i knew you knew me  and after that i didnt think of anything but coming to you for i knew that if i was found out you would take me back with you and perhaps send word to my brother where we were and then  she stopped suddenly with her eyes fixed on keys blank face  her own grew blank the joy faded out of her clear eyes she gently withdrew her hand from his and without a word began to resume her disguise  listen to me said key passionately  i am thinking only of you i want to and will save you from any blameblame you do not understand even now  there is still time  i will go back to the convent with you at once  you shall tell me everything i will tell you everything on the way  she had already completely resumed her austere garb and drew the veil across her face  with the putting on her coif she seemed to have extinguished all the joyous youthfulness of her spirit and moved with the deliberateness of renunciation towards the door they descended the staircase without a word  those who saw them pass made way for them with formal respect  when they were in the street she said quietly dont give me your armsisters dont take it  when they had reached the street corner she turned it saying this is the shortest way  it was key who was now restrained awkward and embarrassed  the fire of his spirit the passion he had felt a moment before had gone out of him as if she were really the character she had assumed  he said at last desperately  how long did you live in the hollow  only two days  my brother was bringing me here to school but in the stage coach there was some one with whom he had quarreled and he didnt want to meet him with me  so we got out at skinners and came to the hollow where his old friends mr and mrs barker lived  there was no hesitation nor affectation in her voice  again he felt that he would as soon have doubted the words of the sister she represented as her own  and your brotherdid you live with him  no  i was at school at marysville until he took me away  i saw little of him for the past two years for he had business in the mountainsvery rough business where he couldnt take me for it kept him away from the settlements for weeks  i think it had something to do with cattle for he was always having a new horse i was all alone before that too i had no other relations i had no friends  we had always been moving about so much my brother and i  i never saw any one that i liked except you and until yesterday i had only heard you  her perfect naivete alternately thrilled him with pain and doubt in his awkwardness and uneasiness he was brutal  yes but you must have met somebodyother menhere even when you were out with your schoolfellows or perhaps on an adventure like this  her white coif turned towards him quickly  i never wanted to know anybody else  i never cared to see anybody else  i never would have gone out in this way but for you she said hurriedly  after a pause she added in a frightened tone that didnt sound like your voice then  it didnt sound like it a moment ago either  but you are sure that you know my voice he said with affected gayety  there were two others in the hollow with me that night  i know that too  but i know even what you said  you reproved them for throwing a lighted match in the dry grass  you were thinking of us then  i know it  of us said key quickly  of mrs barker and myself  we were alone in the house for my brother and her husband were both away  what you said seemed to forewarn me and i told her  so we were prepared when the fire came nearer and we both escaped on the same horse  and you dropped your shoes in your flight said key laughingly and i picked them up the next day when i came to search for you i have kept them still  they were her shoes said the girl quickly i couldnt find mine in our hurry and hers were too large for me and dropped off she stopped and with a faint return of her old gladness said then you did come back  i knew you would  i should have stayed then but we got no reply when we shouted why was that he demanded suddenly  oh we were warned against speaking to any stranger or even being seen by any one while we were alone returned the girl simply  but why persisted key  oh because there were so many highwaymen and horsestealers in the woods  why they had stopped the coach only a few weeks before and only a day or two ago when mrs barker came down  she saw them  key with difficulty suppressed a groan  they walked on in silence for some moments he scarcely daring to lift his eyes to the decorous little figure hastening by his side  alternately touched by mistrust and pain at last an infinite pity not unmingled with a desperate resolution took possession of him  i must make a confession to you miss rivers he began with the bashful haste of a very boy that ishe stammered with a half hysteric laughthat isa confession as if you were really a sister or a priest you knowa sort of confidence to youto your dress  i have seen you or thought i saw you before  it was that which brought me here that which made me follow mrs barkermy only clue to youto the door of that convent  that night in the hollow i saw a profile at the lighted window which i thought was yours  i never was near the window said the young girl quickly  it must have been mrs barker  i know that now returned key  but remember it was my only clue to you  i mean he added awkwardly it was the means of my finding you  i dont see how it made you think of me whom you never saw to see another womans profile she retorted with the faintest touch of asperity in her childlike voice  but she added more gently and with a relapse into her adorable naivete most peoples profiles look alike  it was not that protested key still awkwardly it was only that i realized somethingonly a dream perhaps  she did not reply and they continued on in silence  the gray wall of the convent was already in sight  key felt he had achieved nothing except for information that was hopeless he had come to no nearer understanding of the beautiful girl beside him and his future appeared as vague as before and above all he was conscious of an inferiority of character and purpose to this simple creature who had obeyed him so submissively  had he acted wisely would it not have been better if he had followed her own frankness and  then it was mrs barkers profile that brought you here resumed the voice beneath the coif  you know she has gone back  i suppose you will follow  you will not understand me said key desperately  but he added in a lower voice i shall remain here until you do  he drew a little closer to her side  then you must not begin by walking so close to me she said moving slightly away they may see you from the gate  and you must not go with me beyond that corner  if i have been missed already they will suspect you  but how shall i know he said attempting to take her hand  let me walk past the gate  i cannot leave you in this uncertainty  you will know soon enough she said gravely evading his hand you must not go further now  goodnight  she had stopped at the corner of the wall  he again held out his hand her little fingers slid coldly between his  goodnight miss rivers  stop she said suddenly withdrawing her veil and lifting her clear eyes to his in the moonlight  you must not say thatit isnt the truth  i cant bear to hear it from your lips in your voice  my name is not rivers  not riverswhy said key astounded  oh i dont know why she said half despairingly only my brother didnt want me to use my name and his here and i promised my name is riggsthere  its a secretyou mustnt tell it but i could not bear to hear you say a lie  goodnight miss riggs said key sadly  no nor that either she said softly  say alice  goodnight alice  she moved on before him  she reached the gate  for a moment her figure in its austere formless garments seemed to him to even stoop and bend forward in the humility of age and selfrenunciation and she vanished within as into a living tomb  forgetting all precaution he pressed eagerly forward and stopped before the gate  there was no sound from within there had evidently been no challenge nor interruption  she was safe    chapter vii  the reappearance of chivers in the mill with collinson and the brief announcement that the prisoner had consented to a satisfactory compromise were received at first with a half contemptuous smile by the party but for the commands of their leaders and possibly a conviction that collinsons fatuous cooperation with chivers would be safer than his wrath which might not expend itself only on chivers but imperil the safety of all it is probable that they would have informed the unfortunate prisoner of his real relations to his captor in these circumstances chiverss half satirical suggestion that collinson should be added to the sentries outside and guard his own property was surlily assented to by riggs and complacently accepted by the others  chivers offered to post him himselfnot without an interchange of meaning glances with riggscollinsons own gun was returned to him and the strangely assorted pair left the mill amicably together  but however humanly confident chivers was in his companions faithfulness he was not without a rascals precaution and determined to select a position for collinson where he could do the least damage in any aberration of trust  at the top of the grade above the mill was the only trail by which a party in force could approach it  this was to chivers obviously too strategic a position to intrust to his prisoner and the sentry who guarded its approach five hundred yards away was left unchanged  but there was another blind trail or cutoff to the left through the thickest undergrowth of the woods known only to his party  to place collinson there was to insure him perfect immunity from the approach of an enemy as well as from any confidential advances of his fellow sentry  this done he drew a cigar from his pocket and handing it to collinson lighted another for himself and leaning back comfortably against a large boulder glanced complacently at his companion  you may smoke until i go mr collinson and even afterwards if you keep the bowl of your pipe behind a rock so as to be out of sight of your fellow sentry whose advances by the way if i were you i should not encourage  your position here you see is a rather peculiar one you were saying i think that a lingering affection for your wife impelled you to keep this place for her although you were convinced of her death  collinsons unaffected delight in chiverss kindliness had made his eyes shine in the moonlight with a doglike wistfulness  i reckon i did say that mr chivers he said apologetically though it aint goin to interfere with you usin the shanty jest now  i wasnt alluding to that collinson returned chivers with a large rhetorical wave of the hand and an equal enjoyment in his companions evident admiration of him but it struck me that your remark nevertheless implied some doubt of your wifes death and i dont know but that your doubts are right  wots that said collinson with a dull glow in his face  chivers blew the smoke of his cigar lazily in the still air listen he said  since your miraculous conversion a few moments ago i have made some friendly inquiries about you and i find that you lost all trace of your wife in texas in 52 where a number of her fellow emigrants died of yellow fever  is that so  yes said collinson quickly  well it so happens that a friend of mine continued chivers slowly was in a train which followed that one and picked up and brought on some of the survivors  that was the train wot brought the news said collinson relapsing into his old patience  thats how i knowed she hadnt come  did you ever hear the names of any of its passengers said chivers with a keen glance at his companion  nary one  i only got to know it was a small train of only two wagons and it sorter melted into californy through a southern pass and kinder petered out and no one ever heard of it agin and that was all  that was not all collinson said chivers lazily  i saw the train arrive at south pass  i was awaiting a friend and his wife there was a lady with them one of the survivors  i didnt hear her name but i think my friends wife called her sadie  i remember her as a rather pretty womantall fair with a straight nose and a full chin and small slim feet  i saw her only a moment for she was on her way to los angeles and was i believe going to join her husband somewhere in the sierras  the rascal had been enjoying with intense satisfaction the return of the dull glow in collinsons face that even seemed to animate the whole length of his angular frame as it turned eagerly towards him  so he went on experiencing a devilish zest in this description of his mistress to her husband apart from the pleasure of noting the slow awakening of this apathetic giant with a sensation akin to having warmed him into life  yet his triumph was of short duration  the fire dropped suddenly out of collinsons eyes the glow from his face and the dull look of unwearied patience returned  thats all very kind and purty of yer mr chivers he said gravely youve got all my wifes pints thar to a dot and it seems to fit her jest like a shoe i picked up tother day  but it wasnt my sadie for ef shes living or had lived shed bin just yere  the same fear and recognition of some unknown reserve in this trustful man came over chivers as before  in his angry resentment of it he would have liked to blurt out the infidelity of the wife before her husband but he knew collinson would not believe him and he had another purpose now  his full lips twisted into a suave smile  while i would not give you false hopes mr collinson he said with a bland smile my interest in you compels me to say that you may be over confident and wrong  there are a thousand things that may have prevented your wife from coming to youillness possibly the result of her exposure poverty misapprehension of your place of meeting and above all perhaps some false report of your own death  has it ever occurred to you that it is as possible for her to have been deceived in that way as for you  wot yer say said collinson with a vague suspicion  what i mean  you think yourself justified in believing your wife dead because she did not seek you here may she not feel herself equally justified in believing the same of you because you had not sought her elsewhere  but it was writ that she was comin yere andi boarded every train that come in that fall said collinson with a new irritation unlike his usual calm  except one my dear collinsonexcept one returned chivers holding up a fat forefinger smilingly  and that may be the clue now listen there is still a chance of following it if you will the name of my friends were mr and mrs barker  i regret he added with a perfunctory cough that poor barker is dead  he was not such an exemplary husband as you are my dear collinson and i fear was not all that mrs barker could have wished enough that he succumbed from various excesses and did not leave me mrs barkers present address but she has a young friend a ward living at the convent of santa luisa whose name is miss rivers who can put you in communication with her  now one thing more i can understand your feelings and that you would wish at once to satisfy your mind  it is not perhaps to my interest nor the interest of my party to advise you but he continued glancing around him you have an admirably secluded position here on the edge of the trail and if you are missing from your post tomorrow morning i shall respect your feelings trust to your honor to keep this secret andconsider it useless to pursue you  there was neither shame nor pity in his heart as the deceived man turned towards him with tremulous eagerness and grasped his hand in silent gratitude  but the old rage and fear returned as collinson said gravely  you kinder put a new life inter me mr chivers and i wish i had yer gift o speech to tell ye so  but ive passed my word to the capting thar and to the rest o you folks that id stand guard out yere and i dont go back o my word  i mout and i moutnt find my sadie but she wouldnt think the less o me arter these years o waitin ef i stayed here another night to guard the house i keep in trust for her and the strangers ive took in on her account  as you like then said chivers contracting his lips but keep your own counsel tonight  there may be those who would like to deter you from your search  and now i will leave you alone in this delightful moonlight  i quite envy you your unrestricted communion with nature adios amigo adios  he leaped lightly on a large rock that overhung the edge of the grade and waved his hand  i wouldnt do that mr chivers said collinson with a concerned face them rocks are mighty ticklish and that one in partiklar a tech sometimes sends em scooting  mr chivers leaped quickly to the ground turned waved his hand again and disappeared down the grade  but collinson was no longer alone  hitherto his characteristic reveries had been of the pastreminiscences in which there was only recollection no imagination and very little hope  under the spell of chiverss words his fancy seemed to expand he began to think of his wife as she might be nowperhaps ill despairing wandering hopelessly even ragged and footsore orbelieving him deadrelapsing into the resigned patience that had been his own but always a new sadie whom he had never seen or known before  a faint dread the lightest of misgivings perhaps coming from his very ignorance for the first time touched his steadfast heart and sent a chill through it  he shouldered his weapon and walked briskly towards the edge of the thickset woods  there were the fragrant essences of the laurel and sprucebaked in the longday sunshine that had encompassed their recessesstill coming warm to his face there were the strange shiftings of temperature throughout the openings that alternately warmed and chilled him as he walked  it seemed so odd that he should now have to seek her instead of her coming to him it would never be the same meeting to him away from the house that he had built for her he strolled back and looked down upon it nestling on the ledge  the white moonlight that lay upon it dulled the glitter of lights in its windows but the sounds of laughter and singing came to even his unfastidious ears with a sense of vague discord  he walked back again and began to pace before the thickset wood  suddenly he stopped and listened  to any other ears but those accustomed to mountain solitude it would have seemed nothing  but familiar as he was with all the infinite disturbances of the woodland and even the simulation of intrusion caused by a falling branch or lapsing pinecone he was arrested now by a recurring sound unlike any other  it was an occasional muffled beatinterrupted at uncertain intervals but always returning in regular rhythm whenever it was audible  he knew it was made by a cantering horse that the intervals were due to the patches of dead leaves in its course and that the varying movement was the effect of its progress through obstacles and underbrush  it was therefore coming through some blind cutoff in the thickset wood  the shifting of the sound also showed that the rider was unfamiliar with the locality and sometimes wandered from the direct course but the unfailing and accelerating persistency of the sound in spite of these difficulties indicated haste and determination  he swung his gun from his shoulder and examined its caps  as the sound came nearer he drew up beside a young spruce at the entrance of the thicket  there was no necessity to alarm the house or call the other sentry  it was a single horse and rider and he was equal to that  he waited quietly and with his usual fateful patience  even then his thoughts still reverted to his wife and it was with a singular feeling that he at last saw the thick underbrush give way before a woman mounted on a sweating but still spirited horse who swept out into the open  nevertheless he stopped in front of her and called  hold up thar  the horse recoiled nearly unseating her  collinson caught the reins she lifted her whip mechanically yet remained holding it in the air trembling until she slipped half struggling half helplessly from the saddle to the ground  here she would have again fallen but collinson caught her sharply by the waist  at his touch she started and uttered a frightened no  at her voice collinson started  sadie he gasped  seth she half whispered  they stood looking at each other  but collinson was already himself again  the man of simple directness and no imagination saw only his wife before hima little breathless a little flurried a little disheveled from rapid riding as he had sometimes seen her before but otherwise unchanged  nor had he changed he took her up where he had left her years ago  his grave face only broadened into a smile as he held both her hands in his  yes its melordy  why i was comin only tomorrow to find ye sade  she glanced hurriedly around her toto find me she said incredulously  sartain  that ez i was goin to ask about yegoin to ask about ye at the convent  at the convent she echoed with a frightened amazement  yes why lordy sadedont you see  you thought i was dead and i thought you was deadthats whats the matter  but i never reckoned that youd think me dead until chivers allowed that it must be so  her face whitened in the moonlight chivers she said blankly  in course but natrally you dont know him honey  he only saw you onct  but it was along o that sade that he told me he reckoned you wasnt dead and told me how to find you  he was mighty kind and consarned about it and he even allowed id better slip off to you this very night  chivers she repeated gazing at her husband with bloodless lips  yes an awful purtyspoken man  yell have to get to know him sade hes here with some of his folks az hez got inter troubleim forgettin to tell ye  you see  yes yes yes she interrupted hysterically and this is the mill  yes lovey the millmy millyour millthe house i built for you dear  id show it to you now but you see sade im out here standin guard  are you one of them she said clutching his hand desperately  no dear he said soothinglyno only you see i giv my word to em as i giv my house tonight and im bound to protect them and see em through  why lordy sade youd have done the samefor chivers  yes yes she said beating her hands together strangely of course he was so kind to bring me back to you  and you might have never found me but for him  she burst into an hysterical laugh which the simpleminded man might have overlooked but for the tears that coursed down her bloodless face  whats gone o ye sadie he said in a sudden fear grasping her hands that laugh aint yournthat voice aint yourn  youre the old sadie aint ye  he stopped  for a moment his face blanched as he glanced towards the mill from which the faint sound of bacchanalian voices came to his quick ear  sadie dear ye aint thinkin anything agin me  ye aint allowin im keeping anythin back from ye  her face stiffened into rigidity she dashed the tears from her eyes no she said quickly  then after a moment she added with a faint laugh you see we havent seen each other for so longits all so suddenso unexpected  but you kem here just now calkilatin to find me said collinson gravely  yes yes she said quickly still grasping both his hands but with her head slightly turned in the direction of the mill  but who told ye where to find the mill he said with gentle patience  a friend she said hurriedly  perhaps she added with a singular smile a friend of the friend who told you  i see said collinson with a relieved face and a broadening smile its a sort of fairy story  ill bet now it was that old barker woman that chivers knows  her teeth gleamed rigidly together in the moonlight like a deathshead  yes she said dryly it was that old barker woman say seth she continued moistening her lips slowly youre guarding this place alone  thars another feller up the traila sentrybut dont you be afeard he cant hear us sade  on this side of the mill  yes  why lord love ye sadie tother side o the mill it drops down straight to the valley nobody comes yer that way but poor lowdown emigrants  and its miles round to come by the valley from the summit  you didnt hear your friend chivers say that the sheriff was out with his posse tonight hunting them  no  did you  i think i heard something of that kind at skinners but it may have been only a warning to me traveling alone  thets so said collinson with a tender solicitude but none o these yer roadagents would have teched a woman  and this yer chivers aint the man to insult one either  no she said with a return of her hysteric laugh  but it was overlooked by collinson who was taking his gun from beside the tree where he had placed it where are you going she said suddenly  i reckon them fellers ought to be warned o what you heard  ill be back in a minit  and youre going to leave me nowwhenwhen weve only just met after these years she said with a faint attempt at a smile which however did not reach the cold glitter of her eyes  just for a little honey  besides dont you see ive got to get excused for well have to go off to skinners or somewhere sadie for we cant stay in thar along o them  so you and your wife are turned out of your home to please chivers she said still smiling  thats whar you slip up sadie said collinson with a troubled face for hes that kind of a man thet if i jest as much as hinted you was here hed turn em all out o the house for a lady thets why i dont propose to let on anything about you till tomorrow  tomorrow will do she said still smiling but with a singular abstraction in her face  pray dont disturb them now  you say there is another sentinel beyond  he is enough to warn them of any approach from the trail  im tired and illvery ill  sit by me here seth and wait  we can wait here togetherwe have waited so long sethand the end has come now  she suddenly lapsed against the tree and slipped in a sitting posture to the ground  collinson cast himself at her side and put his arm round her  wots gone o ye sade  youre cold and sick  listen  your hoss is just over thar feedin  ill put you back on him run in and tell em im off and be with ye in a jiffy and take ye back to skinners  wait she said softly  wait  or to the silver hollowits not so far  she had caught his hands again her rigid face close to his what hollowspeak she said breathlessly  the hollow whar a friend o mine struck silver  hell take yur in  her head sank against his shoulder  let me stay here she answered and wait  he supported her tenderly feeling the gentle brushing of her hair against his cheek as in the old days  he was content to wait holding her thus  they were very silent her eyes half closed as if in exhaustion yet with the strange suggestion of listening in the vacant pupils  ye aint hearin anythin deary he said with a troubled face  no but everything is so deathly still she said in a frightened whisper  it certainly was very still  a singular hush seemed to have slid over the landscape there was no longer any sound from the mill there was an ominous rest in the woodland so perfect that the tiny rustle of an uneasy wing in the tree above them had made them start even the moonlight seemed to hang suspended in the air  its like the lull before the storm she said with her strange laugh  but the nonimaginative collinson was more practical  its mighty like that earthquake weather before the big shake thet dried up the river and stopped the mill  that was just the time i got the news o your bein dead with yellow fever  lord honey i allus allowed to myself thet suthin was happenin to ye then  she did not reply but he holding her figure closer to him felt it trembling with a nervous expectation  suddenly she threw him off and rose to her feet with a cry  there she screamed frantically theyve come theyve come  a rabbit had run out into the moonlight before them a gray fox had dashed from the thicket into the wood but nothing else  whos come said collinson staring at her  the sheriff and his posse  theyre surrounding them now  dont you hear she gasped  there was a strange rattling in the direction of the mill a dull rumble with wild shouts and outcries and the trampling of feet on its wooden platform  collinson staggered to his feet but at the same moment he was thrown violently against his wife and they both clung helplessly to the tree with their eyes turned toward the ledge  there was a dense cloud of dust and haze hanging over it  she uttered another cry and ran swiftly towards the rocky grade collinson ran quickly after her but as she reached the grade he suddenly shouted with an awful revelation in his voice come back stop sadie for gods sake  but it was too late  she had already disappeared and as he reached the rock on which chivers had leaped he felt it give way beneath him  but there was no sound only a rush of wind from the valley below everything lapsed again into its awful stillness  as the cloud lifted from where the mill had stood the moon shone only upon empty space there was a singular murmuring and whispering from the woods beyond that increased in sound and an hour later the dry bed of the old millstream was filled with a rushing river    chapter viii  preble key returned to his hotel from the convent it is to be feared with very little of that righteous satisfaction which is supposed to follow the performance of a good deed  he was by no means certain that what he had done was best for the young girl he had only shown himself to her as a worldly monitor of dangers of which her innocence was providentially unconscious  in his feverish haste to avert a scandal he had no chance to explain his real feelings he had perhaps even exposed her thwarted impulses to equally naive but more dangerous expression which he might not have the opportunity to check  he tossed wakefully that night upon his pillow tormented with alternate visions of her adorable presence at the hotel and her bowed renunciating figure as she reentered the convent gate  he waited expectantly the next day for the message she had promised and which he believed she would find some way to send  but no message was forthcoming  the day passed and he became alarmed  the fear that her escapade had been discovered again seized him  if she were in close restraint she could neither send to him nor could he convey to her the solicitude and sympathy that filled his heart  in her childish frankness she might have confessed the whole truth and this would not only shut the doors of the convent against him under his former pretext but compromise her still more if he boldly called he waylaid the afternoon procession she was not among them utterly despairing the wildest plans for seeing her passed through his brainplans that recalled his hotheaded youth and a few moments later made him smile at his extravagance even while it half frightened him at the reality of his passion  he reached the hotel heartsick and desperate  the porter met him on the steps it was with a thrill that sent the blood leaping to his cheeks that he heard the man say  sister seraphina is waiting for you in the sittingroom  there was no thought of discovery or scandal in preble keys mind now no doubt or hesitation as to what he would do as he sprang up the staircase  he only knew that he had found her again and was happy he burst into the room but this time remembered to shut the door behind him  he looked eagerly towards the window where she had stood the day before but now she rose quickly from the sofa in the corner where she had been seated and the missal she had been reading rolled from her lap to the floor  he ran towards her to pick it up  her namethe name she had told him to call herwas passionately trembling on his lips when she slowly put her veil aside and displayed a pale kindly middleaged face slightly marked by old scars of smallpox  it was not alice it was the real sister seraphina who stood before him  his first revulsion of bitter disappointment was so quickly followed by a realization that all had been discovered and his sacrifice of yesterday had gone for naught that he stood before her stammering but without the power to say a word  luckily for him his utter embarrassment seemed to reassure her and to calm that timidity which his brusque manlike irruption might well produce in the inexperienced contemplative mind of the recluse her voice was very sweet albeit sad as she said gently  i am afraid i have taken you by surprise but there was no time to arrange for a meeting and the lady superior thought that i who knew all the facts had better see you confidentially  father cipriano gave us your address  amazed and wondering key bowed her to a seat  you will remember she went on softly that the lady superior failed to get any information from you regarding the brother of one of our dear children whom he committed to our charge through aa companion or acquaintancea mrs barker  as she was armed with his authority by letter we accepted the dear child through her permitted her as his representative to have free access to his sister and even allowed her as an unattended woman to pass the night at the convent  we were therefore surprised this morning to receive a letter from him absolutely forbidding any further intercourse correspondence or association of his sister with this companion mrs barker  it was necessary to inform the dear child of this at once as she was on the point of writing to this woman but we were pained and shocked at her reception of her brothers wishes  i ought to say in justice to the dear child that while she is usually docile intelligent and tractable to discipline and a devote in her religious feelings she is singularly impulsive  but we were not prepared for the rash and sudden step she has taken  at noon today she escaped from the convent  key who had been following her with relief sprang to his feet at this unexpected culmination  escaped he said  impossible  i mean he added hurriedly recalling himself your rules your discipline your attendants are so perfect  the poor impulsive creature has added sacrilege to her madnessa sacrilege we are willing to believe she did not understand for she escaped in a religious habitmy own  but this would sufficiently identify her he said controlling himself with an effort  alas not so  there are many of us who go abroad on our missions in these garments and they are made all alike so as to divert rather than attract attention to any individuality  we have sent private messengers in all directions and sought her everywhere but without success  you will understand that we wish to avoid scandal which a more public inquiry would create  and you come to me said key with a return of his first suspicion in spite of his eagerness to cut short the interview and be free to actto me almost a stranger  not a stranger mr key returned the religieuse gently but to a wellknown mana man of affairs in the country where this unhappy childs brother livesa friend who seems to be sent by heaven to find out this brother for us and speed this news to him we come to the old pupil of father cipriano a friend of the holy church to the kindly gentleman who knows what it is to have dear relations of his own and who only yesterday was seeking the convent to  enough interrupted key hurriedly with a slight color  i will go at once  i do not know this man but i will do my best to find him and thisthisyoung girl  you say you have no trace of her  may she not still be here  i should have some clue by which to seek heri mean that i could give to her brother  alas we fear she is already far away from here  if she went at once to san luis she could have easily taken a train to san francisco before we discovered her flight  we believe that it was the poor childs intent to join her brother so as to intercede for her friendor perhaps alas to seek her  and this friend left yesterday morning he said quickly yet concealing a feeling of relief  well you may depend on me  and now as there is no time to be lost i will make my arrangements to take the next train  he held out his hand paused and said in almost boyish embarrassment bid me god speed sister seraphina  may the holy virgin aid you she said gently  yet as she passed out of the door with a grateful smile a characteristic reaction came over key  his romantic belief in the interposition of providence was not without a tendency to apply the ordinary rules of human evidence to such phenomena  sister seraphinas application to him seemed little short of miraculous interference but what if it were only a trick to get rid of him while the girl whose escapade had been discovered was either under restraint in the convent or hiding in santa luisa  yet this did not prevent him from mechanically continuing his arrangements for departure when they were completed and he had barely time to get to the station at san luis he again lingered in vague expectation of some determining event  the appearance of a servant with a telegraphic message at this moment seemed to be an answer to this instinctive feeling  he tore it open hastily  but it was only a single line from his foreman at the mine which had been repeated to him from the companys office in san francisco  it read come at onceimportant  disappointed as it left him it determined his action and as the train steamed out of san luis it for a while diverted his attention from the object of his pursuit  in any event his destination would have been skinners or the hollow as the point from which to begin his search he believed with sister seraphina that the young girl would make her direct appeal to her brother but even if she sought mrs barker it would still be at some of the haunts of the gang  the letter to the lady superior had been postmarked from bald top which key knew to be an obscure settlement less frequented than skinners  even then it was hardly possible that the chief of the road agents would present himself at the postoffice and it had probably been left by some less known of the gang  a vague idea that was hardly a suspicion that the girl might have a secret address of her brothers without understanding the reasons for its secrecy came into his mind  a still more vague hope that he might meet her before she found her brother upheld him  it would be an accidental meeting on her part for he no longer dared to hope that she would seek or trust him again  and it was with very little of his old sanguine quality that travelworn and weary he at last alighted at skinners  but his half careless inquiry if any lady passengers had lately arrived there to his embarrassment produced a broad smile on the face of skinner  youre the second man that asked that question mr key he said  the second man ejaculated key nervously  yes the first was the sheriff of sierra  he wanted to find a tall goodlooking woman about thirty with black eyes  i hope that aint the kind o girl youre looking arteris it for i reckon shes gin you both the slip  key protested with a forced laugh that it was not yet suddenly hesitated to describe alice for he instantly recognized the portrait of her friend the assumed mrs barker  skinner continued in lazy confidence  ye see they say that the sheriff had sorter got the dead wood on that gang o road agents and had hemmed em in somewhar betwixt bald top and collinsons  but that woman was one o their spies and spotted his little game and managed to give em the tip so they got clean away  anyhow they aint bin heard from since  but the big shake has made scoutin along the ledges rather stiff work for the sheriff  they say the valley near long canyons chock full o rock and slumgullion thats slipped down  what do you mean by the big shake asked key in surprise  great scott you didnt hear of it  didnt hear of the arthquake that shook us up all along gallopers the other night  well he added disgustedly thats jist the conceit of them folks in the bay that cant allow that anythin happens in the mountains  the urgent telegrams of his foreman now flashed across keys preoccupied mind  possibly skinner saw his concern i reckon your mine is all right mr key  one of your men was over yere last night and didnt say nothin  but this did not satisfy key and in a few minutes he had mounted his horse and was speeding towards the hollow with a remorseful consciousness of having neglected his colleagues interests  for himself in the utter prepossession of his passion for alice he cared nothing  as he dashed down the slope to the hollow he thought only of the two momentous days that she had passed there and the fate that had brought them so nearly together  there was nothing to recall its sylvan beauty in the hideous works that now possessed it or the substantial dwellinghouse that had taken the place of the old cabin a few hurried questions to the foreman satisfied him of the integrity of the property  there had been some alarm in the shaft but there was no subsidence of the seam nor any difficulty in the working  what i telegraphed you for mr key was about something that has cropped up way back o the earthquake  we were served here the other day with a legal notice of a claim to the mine on account of previous work done on the ledge by the last occupant  but the cabin was built by a gang of thieves who used it as a hoard for their booty returned key hotly and every one of them are outlaws and have no standing before the law  he stopped with a pang as he thought of alice  and the blood rushed to his cheeks as the foreman quietly continued  but the claim aint in any o their names  its allowed to be the gift of their leader to his young sister afore the outlawry and its in her namealice riggs or something  of the halfdozen tumultuous thoughts that passed through keys mind only one remained  it was purely an act of the brothers to secure some possible future benefit for his sister  and of this she was perfectly ignorant  he recovered himself quickly and said with a smile  but i discovered the ledge and its auriferous character myself there was no trace or sign of previous discovery or mining occupation  so i jedged and so i said and thet puts ye all right  but i thought id tell ye for mining laws is mining laws and its the one thing ye cant get over he added with the peculiar superstitious reverence of the californian miner for that vested authority  but key scarcely listened  all that he had heard seemed only to link him more fatefully and indissolubly with the young girl  he was already impatient of even this slight delay in his quest  in his perplexity his thoughts had reverted to collinsons the mill was a good point to begin his search from its goodnatured stupid proprietor might be his guide his ally and even his confidant  when his horse was baited he was again in the saddle  if yer going collinsons way yer might ask him if hes lost a horse said the foreman  the morning after the shake some of the boys picked up a mustang with a makeup ladys saddle on  key started  while it was impossible that it could have been ridden by alice it might have been by the woman who had preceded her  did you make any search he inquired eagerly there may have been an accident  i reckon it wasnt no accident returned the foreman coolly for the riata was loose and trailing as if it had been staked out and broken away  without another word key put spurs to his horse and galloped away leaving his companion staring after him  here was a clue the horse could not have strayed far the broken tether indicated a camp the gang had been gathered somewhere in the vicinity where mrs barker had warned themperhaps in the wood beyond collinsons  he would penetrate it alone  he knew his danger but as a single unarmed man he might be admitted to the presence of the leader and the alleged claim was a sufficient excuse  what he would say or do afterwards depended upon chance  it was a wild schemebut he was reckless  yet he would go to collinsons first  at the end of two hours he reached the thickset wood that gave upon the shelf at the top of the grade which descended to the mill as he emerged from the wood into the bursting sunlight of the valley below he sharply reined in his horse and stopped  another bound would have been his last  for the shelf the rocky grade itself the ledge below and the mill upon it were all gone  the crumbling outer wall of the rocky grade had slipped away into immeasurable depths below leaving only the sharp edge of a cliff which incurved towards the woods that had once stood behind the mill but which now bristled on the very edge of a precipice  a mist was hanging over its brink and rising from the valley it was a fullfed stream that was coursing through the former dry bed of the river and falling down the face of the bluff  he rubbed his eyes dismounted crept along the edge of the precipice and looked below whatever had subsided and melted down into its thousand feet of depth there was no trace left upon its smooth face  scarcely an angle of drift or debris marred the perpendicular the burial of all ruin was deep and compact the erasure had been swift and surethe obliteration complete  it might have been the precipitation of ages and not of a single night  at that remote distance it even seemed as if grass were already growing ever this enormous sepulchre but it was only the tops of the buried pines  the absolute silence the utter absence of any mark of convulsive struggle even the lulling whimper of falling waters gave the scene a pastoral repose  so profound was the impression upon key and his human passion that it at first seemed an ironical and eternal ending of his quest  it was with difficulty that he reasoned that the catastrophe occurred before alices flight and that even collinson might have had time to escape he slowly skirted the edge of the chasm and made his way back through the empty woods behind the old millsite towards the place where he had dismounted  his horse seemed to have strayed into the shadows of this covert but as he approached him he was amazed to see that it was not his own and that a womans scarf was lying over its side saddle  a wild idea seized him and found expression in an impulsive cry  alice  the woods echoed it there was an interval of silence and then a faint response  but it was her voice  he ran eagerly forward in that direction and called again the response was nearer this time and then the tall ferns parted and her lithe graceful figure came running stumbling and limping towards him like a wounded fawn  her face was pale and agitated the tendrils of her light hair were straying over her shoulder and one of the sleeves of her schoolgown was stained with blood and dust  he caught the white and trembling hands that were thrust out to him eagerly  it is you she gasped  i prayed for some one to come but i did not dream it would be you  and then i heard your voiceand i thought it could be only a dream until you called a second time  but you are hurt he exclaimed passionately  you have met with some accident  no no she said eagerly  not ibut a poor poor man i found lying on the edge of the cliff  i could not help him much i did not care to leave him  no one would come  i have been with him alone all the morning  come quick he may be dying  he passed his arm around her waist unconsciously she permitted it as unconsciously as he half supported her figure while they hurried forward  he had been crushed by something and was just hanging over the ledge and could not move nor speak she went on quickly  i dragged him away to a tree it took me hours to move him he was so heavyand i got him some water from the stream and bathed his face and blooded all my sleeve  but what were you doing here he asked quickly  a faint blush crossed the pallor of her delicate cheek  she looked away quickly  iwas going to find my brother at bald top she replied at last hurriedly  but dont ask me nowonly come quick do  is the wounded man conscious  did you speak with him  does he know who you are asked key uneasily  no he only moaned a little and opened his eyes when i dragged him  i dont think he even knew what had happened  they hurried on again  the wood lightened suddenly  here she said in a half whisper and stepped timidly into the open light only a few feet from the fatal ledge against the roots of a buckeye with her shawl thrown over him lay the wounded man  key started back  it was collinson  his head and shoulders seemed uninjured but as key lifted the shawl he saw that the long lank figure appeared to melt away below the waist into a mass of shapeless and dirty rags  key hurriedly replaced the shawl and bending over him listened to his hurried respiration and the beating of his heart  then he pressed a drinkingflask to his lips  the spirit seemed to revive him he slowly opened his eyes they fell upon key with quick recognition  but the look changed one could see that he was trying to rise but that no movement of the limbs accompanied that effort of will and his old patient resigned look returned  key shuddered  there was some injury to the spine  the man was paralyzed  i cant get up mr key he said in a faint but untroubled voice nor seem to move my arms but youll just allow that ive shook hands with yeall the same  how did this happen said key anxiously  thets wot gets me  sometimes i reckon i know and sometimes i dont lyin thar on thet ledge all last night and only jest able to look down into the old valley sometimes it seemed to me ez if i fell over and got caught in the rocks trying to save my wife but then when i kem to think sensible and know my wife wasnt there at all i get mystified  sometimes i think i got ter thinkin of my wife only when this yer young gal thets bin like an angel to me kem here and dragged me off the ledge for you see she dont belong here and hez dropped on to me like a sperrit  then you were not in the house when the shock came said key  no  you see the mill was filled with them fellers as the sheriff was arter and it went over with emand i  alice said key with a white face would you mind going to my horse which you will find somewhere near yours and bringing me a medicine case from my saddlebags  the innocent girl glanced quickly at her companion saw the change in his face and attributing it to the imminent danger of the injured man at once glided away  when she was out of hearing key leaned gravely over him  collinson i must trust you with a secret  i am afraid that this poor girl who helped you is the sister of the leader of that gang the sheriff was in pursuit of  she has been kept in perfect ignorance of her brothers crimes  she must never know themnor even know his fate  if he perished utterly in this catastrophe as it would seemit was gods will to spare her that knowledge  i tell you this to warn you in anything you say before her  she must believe as i shall try to make her believe that he has gone back to the stateswhere she will perhaps hereafter believe that he died  better that she should know nothingand keep her thought of him unchanged  i seei seei see mr key murmured the injured man  thets wot ive been sayin to myself lyin here all night  thets wot i bin sayin o my wife sadieher that i actooally got to think kem back to me last night  you see id heerd from one o those fellars that a woman like unto her had been picked up in texas and brought on yere and that mebbe she was somewhar in californy  i was that foolishand that ontrue to her all the while knowin as i once told you mr key that ef shed been alive shed bin yerethat i believed it true for a minit  and that was why afore this happened i had a dream right out yer and dreamed she kem to me all white and troubled through the woods  at first i thought it war my sadie but when i see she warnt like her old self and her voice was strange and her laugh was strangethen i knowed it wasnt her and i was dreamin  youre right mr key in wot you got off just nowwot was it  better to know nothinand keep the old thoughts unchanged  have you any pain asked key after a pause  no i kinder feel easier now  key looked at his changing face  tell me he said gently if it does not tax your strength all that has happened here all you know it is for her sake  thus adjured with his eyes fixed on key collinson narrated his story from the irruption of the outlaws to the final catastrophe even then he palliated their outrage with his characteristic patience keeping still his strange fascination for chivers and his blind belief in his miserable wife  the story was at times broken by lapses of faintness by a singular return of his old abstraction and forgetfulness in the midst of a sentence and at last by a fit of coughing that left a few crimson bubbles on the corners of his month  key lifted his eyes anxiously there was some grave internal injury which the dying mans resolute patience had suppressed  yet at the sound of alices returning step collinsons eyes brightened apparently as much at her coming as from the effect of the powerful stimulant key had taken from his medicine case  i thank ye mr key he said faintly for ive got an idea i aint got no great time before me and ive got suthin to say to you afore witnesseshis eyes sought alices in half apologyafore witnesses you understand  would you mind standin out thar afore me in the light so i kin see you both and you miss rememberin ez a witness suthin i got to tell to him  you might take his hand miss to make it more regular and lawlike  the two did as he bade them standing side by side painfully humoring what seemed to them to be wanderings of a dying man  thar was a young fellow said collinson in a steady voice ez kem to my shanty a night ago on his way to thethevalley  he was a sprightly young fellow gay and chipperlike and he sez to me confidentiallike collinson sez he im off to the states this very night on business of importance mebbe ill be away a long timefor years  you know sez he mr key in the hollow go to him sez he and tell him ez how i hadnt time to get to see him tell him sez he that riversyouve got the name mr keyyouve got the name missthat rivers wants him to say this to his little sister from her lovin brother  and tell him sez he this yer rivers to look arter her being alone  you remember that mr key you remember it miss  you see i remembered it too being so to speak alone myselfhe paused and added in a faint whispertill now  then he was silent  that innocent lie was the first and last upon his honest lips for as they stood there hand in hand they saw his plain hard face take upon itself at first the gray ashen hues of the rocks around him and then and thereafter something of the infinite tranquillity and peace of that wilderness in which he had lived and died and of which he was a part  contemporaneous history was less kindly  the bald top sentinel congratulated its readers that the late seismic disturbance was accompanied with very little loss of life if any  it is reported that the proprietor of a low shebeen for emigrants in an obscure hollow had succumbed from injuries but added the editor with a fine touch of western humor whether this was the result of his being forcibly mixed up with his own tanglefoot whiskey or not we are unable to determine from the evidence before us  for all that a small stone shaft was added later to the rocks near the site of the old mill inscribed to the memory of this obscure proprietor with the singular legend have ye faith like to him and those who knew only of the material catastrophe looking around upon the scene of desolation it commemorated thought grimly that it must be faith indeed andwere wiser than they knew  you smiled don preble said the lady superior to key a few weeks later when i told to you that many caballeros thought it most discreet to intrust their future brides to the maternal guardianship and training of the holy church yet of a truth i meant not you  and yeteh well we shall see
