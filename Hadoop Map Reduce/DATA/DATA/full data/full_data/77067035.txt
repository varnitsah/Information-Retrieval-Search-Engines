77067035	orthodoxy  by  gilbert k chesterton        preface        this book is meant to be a companion to heretics and to put the positive side in addition to the negative  many critics complained of the book called heretics because it merely criticised current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy this book is an attempt to answer the challenge  it is unavoidably affirmative and therefore unavoidably autobiographical  the writer has been driven back upon somewhat the same difficulty as that which beset newman in writing his apologia he has been forced to be egotistical only in order to be sincere  while everything else may be different the motive in both cases is the same  it is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation not of whether the christian faith can be believed but of how he personally has come to believe it the book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle and its answer  it deals first with all the writers own solitary and sincere speculations and then with all the startling style in which they were all suddenly satisfied by the christian theology the writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed  but if it is not that it is at least a repeated and surprising coincidence                                             gilbert k chesterton      contents      i  introduction in defence of everything else   ii  the maniac  iii  the suicide of thought   iv  the ethics of elfland    v  the flag of the world   vi  the paradoxes of christianity  vii  the eternal revolution viii  the romance of orthodoxy   ix  authority and the adventurer      orthodoxy    i introduction in defence of everything else        the only possible excuse for this book is that it is an answer to a challenge  even a bad shot is dignified when he accepts a duel when some time ago i published a series of hasty but sincere papers under the name of heretics several critics for whose intellect i have a warm respect i may mention specially mr gsstreet said that it was all very well for me to tell everybody to affirm his cosmic theory but that i had carefully avoided supporting my precepts with example  i will begin to worry about my philosophy said mr street when mr chesterton has given us his it was perhaps an incautious suggestion to make to a person only too ready to write books upon the feeblest provocation but after all though mr street has inspired and created this book he need not read it  if he does read it he will find that in its pages i have attempted in a vague and personal way in a set of mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions to state the philosophy in which i have come to believe  i will not call it my philosophy for i did not make it  god and humanity made it and it made me       i have often had a fancy for writing a romance about an english yachtsman who slightly miscalculated his course and discovered england under the impression that it was a new island in the south seas i always find however that i am either too busy or too lazy to write this fine work so i may as well give it away for the purposes of philosophical illustration  there will probably be a general impression that the man who landed armed to the teeth and talking by signs to plant the british flag on that barbaric temple which turned out to be the pavilion at brighton felt rather a fool i am not here concerned to deny that he looked a fool  but if you imagine that he felt a fool or at any rate that the sense of folly was his sole or his dominant emotion then you have not studied with sufficient delicacy the rich romantic nature of the hero of this tale  his mistake was really a most enviable mistake and he knew it if he was the man i take him for  what could be more delightful than to have in the same few minutes all the fascinating terrors of going abroad combined with all the humane security of coming home again  what could be better than to have all the fun of discovering south africa without the disgusting necessity of landing there  what could be more glorious than to brace ones self up to discover new south wales and then realize with a gush of happy tears that it was really old south wales this at least seems to me the main problem for philosophers and is in a manner the main problem of this book  how can we contrive to be at once astonished at the world and yet at home in it how can this queer cosmic town with its manylegged citizens with its monstrous and ancient lamps how can this world give us at once the fascination of a strange town and the comfort and honour of being our own town       to show that a faith or a philosophy is true from every standpoint would be too big an undertaking even for a much bigger book than this it is necessary to follow one path of argument and this is the path that i here propose to follow  i wish to set forth my faith as particularly answering this double spiritual need the need for that mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar which christendom has rightly named romance  for the very word romance has in it the mystery and ancient meaning of rome any one setting out to dispute anything ought always to begin by saying what he does not dispute  beyond stating what he proposes to prove he should always state what he does not propose to prove the thing i do not propose to prove the thing i propose to take as common ground between myself and any average reader is this desirability of an active and imaginative life picturesque and full of a poetical curiosity a life such as western man at any rate always seems to have desired  if a man says that extinction is better than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure then he is not one of the ordinary people to whom i am talking if a man prefers nothing i can give him nothing  but nearly all people i have ever met in this western society in which i live would agree to the general proposition that we need this life of practical romance the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure  we need so to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome  we need to be happy in this wonderland without once being merely comfortable it is this achievement of my creed that i shall chiefly pursue in these pages       but i have a peculiar reason for mentioning the man in a yacht who discovered england  for i am that man in a yacht i discovered england  i do not see how this book can avoid being egotistical and i do not quite see to tell the truth how it can avoid being dull  dulness will however free me from the charge which i most lament the charge of being flippant mere light sophistry is the thing that i happen to despise most of all things and it is perhaps a wholesome fact that this is the thing of which i am generally accused  i know nothing so contemptible as a mere paradox a mere ingenious defence of the indefensible if it were true as has been said that mr bernard shaw lived upon paradox then he ought to be a mere common millionaire for a man of his mental activity could invent a sophistry every six minutes  it is as easy as lying because it is lying the truth is of course that mr shaw is cruelly hampered by the fact that he cannot tell any lie unless he thinks it is the truth i find myself under the same intolerable bondage  i never in my life said anything merely because i thought it funny though of course i have had ordinary human vainglory and may have thought it funny because i had said it  it is one thing to describe an interview with a gorgon or a griffin a creature who does not exist it is another thing to discover that the rhinoceros does exist and then take pleasure in the fact that he looks as if he didnt one searches for truth but it may be that one pursues instinctively the more extraordinary truths  and i offer this book with the heartiest sentiments to all the jolly people who hate what i write and regard it very justly for all i know as a piece of poor clowning or a single tiresome joke       for if this book is a joke it is a joke against me i am the man who with the utmost daring discovered what had been discovered before  if there is an element of farce in what follows the farce is at my own expense for this book explains how i fancied i was the first to set foot in brighton and then found i was the last it recounts my elephantine adventures in pursuit of the obvious no one can think my case more ludicrous than i think it myself no reader can accuse me here of trying to make a fool of him i am the fool of this story and no rebel shall hurl me from my throne  i freely confess all the idiotic ambitions of the end of the nineteenth century  i did like all other solemn little boys try to be in advance of the age  like them i tried to be some ten minutes in advance of the truth  and i found that i was eighteen hundred years behind it  i did strain my voice with a painfully juvenile exaggeration in uttering my truths  and i was punished in the fittest and funniest way for i have kept my truths but i have discovered not that they were not truths but simply that they were not mine  when i fancied that i stood alone i was really in the ridiculous position of being backed up by all christendom it may be heaven forgive me that i did try to be original but i only succeeded in inventing all by myself an inferior copy of the existing traditions of civilized religion  the man from the yacht thought he was the first to find england i thought i was the first to find europe  i did try to found a heresy of my own and when i had put the last touches to it i discovered that it was orthodoxy       it may be that somebody will be entertained by the account of this happy fiasco  it might amuse a friend or an enemy to read how i gradually learnt from the truth of some stray legend or from the falsehood of some dominant philosophy things that i might have learnt from my catechismif i had ever learnt it there may or may not be some entertainment in reading how i found at last in an anarchist club or a babylonian temple what i might have found in the nearest parish church  if any one is entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or the phrases in an omnibus the accidents of politics or the pains of youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain conviction of christian orthodoxy he may possibly read this book but there is in everything a reasonable division of labour i have written the book and nothing on earth would induce me to read it       i add one purely pedantic note which comes as a note naturally should at the beginning of the book  these essays are concerned only to discuss the actual fact that the central christian theology sufficiently summarized in the apostles creed is the best root of energy and sound ethics  they are not intended to discuss the very fascinating but quite different question of what is the present seat of authority for the proclamation of that creed  when the word orthodoxy is used here it means the apostles creed as understood by everybody calling himself christian until a very short time ago and the general historic conduct of those who held such a creed  i have been forced by mere space to confine myself to what i have got from this creed i do not touch the matter much disputed among modern christians of where we ourselves got it  this is not an ecclesiastical treatise but a sort of slovenly autobiography  but if any one wants my opinions about the actual nature of the authority mr gsstreet has only to throw me another challenge and i will write him another book    ii the maniac        thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true once i remember walking with a prosperous publisher who made a remark which i had often heard before it is indeed almost a motto of the modern world  yet i had heard it once too often and i saw suddenly that there was nothing in it  the publisher said of somebody that man will get on he believes in himself and i remember that as i lifted my head to listen my eye caught an omnibus on which was written hanwell  i said to him shall i tell you where the men are who believe most in themselves for i can tell you  i know of men who believe in themselves more colossally than napoleon or caesar  i know where flames the fixed star of certainty and success  i can guide you to the thrones of the supermen the men who really believe in themselves are all in lunatic asylums  he said mildly that there were a good many men after all who believed in themselves and who were not in lunatic asylums yes there are i retorted and you of all men ought to know them that drunken poet from whom you would not take a dreary tragedy he believed in himself  that elderly minister with an epic from whom you were hiding in a back room he believed in himself if you consulted your business experience instead of your ugly individualistic philosophy you would know that believing in himself is one of the commonest signs of a rotter  actors who cant act believe in themselves and debtors who wont pay  it would be much truer to say that a man will certainly fail because he believes in himself  complete selfconfidence is not merely a sin complete selfconfidence is a weakness  believing utterly in ones self is a hysterical and superstitious belief like believing in joanna southcote  the man who has it has hanwell written on his face as plain as it is written on that omnibus  and to all this my friend the publisher made this very deep and effective reply well if a man is not to believe in himself in what is he to believe after a long pause i replied i will go home and write a book in answer to that question  this is the book that i have written in answer to it       but i think this book may well start where our argument started in the neighbourhood of the madhouse modern masters of science are much impressed with the need of beginning all inquiry with a fact the ancient masters of religion were quite equally impressed with that necessity  they began with the fact of sina fact as practical as potatoes  whether or no man could be washed in miraculous waters there was no doubt at any rate that he wanted washing but certain religious leaders in london not mere materialists have begun in our day not to deny the highly disputable water but to deny the indisputable dirt  certain new theologians dispute original sin which is the only part of christian theology which can really be proved  some followers of the reverend rjcampbell in their almost too fastidious spirituality admit divine sinlessness which they cannot see even in their dreams  but they essentially deny human sin which they can see in the street  the strongest saints and the strongest sceptics alike took positive evil as the startingpoint of their argument  if it be true as it certainly is that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat then the religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions he must either deny the existence of god as all atheists do or he must deny the present union between god and man as all christians do the new theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution to deny the cat       in this remarkable situation it is plainly not now possible with any hope of a universal appeal to start as our fathers did with the fact of sin  this very fact which was to them and is to me as plain as a pikestaff is the very fact that has been specially diluted or denied  but though moderns deny the existence of sin i do not think that they have yet denied the existence of a lunatic asylum  we all agree still that there is a collapse of the intellect as unmistakable as a falling house  men deny hell but not as yet hanwell  for the purpose of our primary argument the one may very well stand where the other stood  i mean that as all thoughts and theories were once judged by whether they tended to make a man lose his soul so for our present purpose all modern thoughts and theories may be judged by whether they tend to make a man lose his wits       it is true that some speak lightly and loosely of insanity as in itself attractive  but a moments thought will show that if disease is beautiful it is generally some one elses disease a blind man may be picturesque but it requires two eyes to see the picture  and similarly even the wildest poetry of insanity can only be enjoyed by the sane  to the insane man his insanity is quite prosaic because it is quite true  a man who thinks himself a chicken is to himself as ordinary as a chicken  a man who thinks he is a bit of glass is to himself as dull as a bit of glass it is the homogeneity of his mind which makes him dull and which makes him mad  it is only because we see the irony of his idea that we think him even amusing it is only because he does not see the irony of his idea that he is put in hanwell at all  in short oddities only strike ordinary people  oddities do not strike odd people  this is why ordinary people have a much more exciting time while odd people are always complaining of the dulness of life this is also why the new novels die so quickly and why the old fairy tales endure for ever  the old fairy tale makes the hero a normal human boy it is his adventures that are startling they startle him because he is normal  but in the modern psychological novel the hero is abnormal the centre is not central hence the fiercest adventures fail to affect him adequately and the book is monotonous  you can make a story out of a hero among dragons but not out of a dragon among dragons  the fairy tale discusses what a sane man will do in a mad world  the sober realistic novel of today discusses what an essential lunatic will do in a dull world       let us begin then with the madhouse from this evil and fantastic inn let us set forth on our intellectual journey  now if we are to glance at the philosophy of sanity the first thing to do in the matter is to blot out one big and common mistake  there is a notion adrift everywhere that imagination especially mystical imagination is dangerous to mans mental balance  poets are commonly spoken of as psychologically unreliable and generally there is a vague association between wreathing laurels in your hair and sticking straws in it facts and history utterly contradict this view  most of the very great poets have been not only sane but extremely businesslike and if shakespeare ever really held horses it was because he was much the safest man to hold them  imagination does not breed insanity exactly what does breed insanity is reason  poets do not go mad but chessplayers do  mathematicians go mad and cashiers but creative artists very seldom  i am not as will be seen in any sense attacking logic  i only say that this danger does lie in logic not in imagination  artistic paternity is as wholesome as physical paternity  moreover it is worthy of remark that when a poet really was morbid it was commonly because he had some weak spot of rationality on his brain  poe for instance really was morbid not because he was poetical but because he was specially analytical  even chess was too poetical for him he disliked chess because it was full of knights and castles like a poem  he avowedly preferred the black discs of draughts because they were more like the mere black dots on a diagram perhaps the strongest case of all is this  that only one great english poet went mad cowper  and he was definitely driven mad by logic by the ugly and alien logic of predestination  poetry was not the disease but the medicine poetry partly kept him in health he could sometimes forget the red and thirsty hell to which his hideous necessitarianism dragged him among the wide waters and the white flat lilies of the ouse  he was damned by john calvin he was almost saved by john gilpin  everywhere we see that men do not go mad by dreaming  critics are much madder than poets homer is complete and calm enough it is his critics who tear him into extravagant tatters  shakespeare is quite himself it is only some of his critics who have discovered that he was somebody else and though st john the evangelist saw many strange monsters in his vision he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators the general fact is simple  poetry is sane because it floats easily in an infinite sea reason seeks to cross the infinite sea and so make it finite  the result is mental exhaustion like the physical exhaustion of mr holbein  to accept everything is an exercise to understand everything a strain  the poet only desires exaltation and expansion a world to stretch himself in the poet only asks to get his head into the heavens  it is the logician who seeks to get the heavens into his head  and it is his head that splits       it is a small matter but not irrelevant that this striking mistake is commonly supported by a striking misquotation  we have all heard people cite the celebrated line of dryden as great genius is to madness near allied  but dryden did not say that great genius was to madness near allied  dryden was a great genius himself and knew better  it would have been hard to find a man more romantic than he or more sensible  what dryden said was this great wits are oft to madness near allied and that is true  it is the pure promptitude of the intellect that is in peril of a breakdown also people might remember of what sort of man dryden was talking he was not talking of any unworldly visionary like vaughan or george herbert  he was talking of a cynical man of the world a sceptic a diplomatist a great practical politician  such men are indeed to madness near allied  their incessant calculation of their own brains and other peoples brains is a dangerous trade it is always perilous to the mind to reckon up the mind  a flippant person has asked why we say as mad as a hatter  a more flippant person might answer that a hatter is mad because he has to measure the human head       and if great reasoners are often maniacal it is equally true that maniacs are commonly great reasoners  when i was engaged in a controversy with the clarion on the matter of free will that able writer mr rbsuthers said that free will was lunacy because it meant causeless actions and the actions of a lunatic would be causeless  i do not dwell here upon the disastrous lapse in determinist logic  obviously if any actions even a lunatics can be causeless determinism is done for  if the chain of causation can be broken for a madman it can be broken for a man but my purpose is to point out something more practical it was natural perhaps that a modern marxian socialist should not know anything about free will  but it was certainly remarkable that a modern marxian socialist should not know anything about lunatics mr suthers evidently did not know anything about lunatics the last thing that can be said of a lunatic is that his actions are causeless  if any human acts may loosely be called causeless they are the minor acts of a healthy man whistling as he walks slashing the grass with a stick kicking his heels or rubbing his hands  it is the happy man who does the useless things the sick man is not strong enough to be idle  it is exactly such careless and causeless actions that the madman could never understand for the madman like the determinist generally sees too much cause in everything  the madman would read a conspiratorial significance into those empty activities  he would think that the lopping of the grass was an attack on private property  he would think that the kicking of the heels was a signal to an accomplice if the madman could for an instant become careless he would become sane  every one who has had the misfortune to talk with people in the heart or on the edge of mental disorder knows that their most sinister quality is a horrible clarity of detail a connecting of one thing with another in a map more elaborate than a maze if you argue with a madman it is extremely probable that you will get the worst of it for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker for not being delayed by the things that go with good judgment he is not hampered by a sense of humour or by charity or by the dumb certainties of experience  he is the more logical for losing certain sane affections  indeed the common phrase for insanity is in this respect a misleading one  the madman is not the man who has lost his reason  the madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason       the madmans explanation of a thing is always complete and often in a purely rational sense satisfactory  or to speak more strictly the insane explanation if not conclusive is at least unanswerable this may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds of madness  if a man says for instance that men have a conspiracy against him you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men deny that they are conspirators which is exactly what conspirators would do  his explanation covers the facts as much as yours or if a man says that he is the rightful king of england it is no complete answer to say that the existing authorities call him mad for if he were king of england that might be the wisest thing for the existing authorities to do  or if a man says that he is jesus christ it is no answer to tell him that the world denies his divinity for the world denied christs       nevertheless he is wrong  but if we attempt to trace his error in exact terms we shall not find it quite so easy as we had supposed perhaps the nearest we can get to expressing it is to say this that his mind moves in a perfect but narrow circle  a small circle is quite as infinite as a large circle but though it is quite as infinite it is not so large  in the same way the insane explanation is quite as complete as the sane one but it is not so large a bullet is quite as round as the world but it is not the world there is such a thing as a narrow universality there is such a thing as a small and cramped eternity you may see it in many modern religions  now speaking quite externally and empirically we may say that the strongest and most unmistakable mark of madness is this combination between a logical completeness and a spiritual contraction  the lunatics theory explains a large number of things but it does not explain them in a large way  i mean that if you or i were dealing with a mind that was growing morbid we should be chiefly concerned not so much to give it arguments as to give it air to convince it that there was something cleaner and cooler outside the suffocation of a single argument  suppose for instance it were the first case that i took as typical suppose it were the case of a man who accused everybody of conspiring against him if we could express our deepest feelings of protest and appeal against this obsession i suppose we should say something like this oh i admit that you have your case and have it by heart and that many things do fit into other things as you say  i admit that your explanation explains a great deal but what a great deal it leaves out  are there no other stories in the world except yours and are all men busy with your business  suppose we grant the details perhaps when the man in the street did not seem to see you it was only his cunning perhaps when the policeman asked you your name it was only because he knew it already  but how much happier you would be if you only knew that these people cared nothing about you how much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it if you could really look at other men with common curiosity and pleasure if you could see them walking as they are in their sunny selfishness and their virile indifference  you would begin to be interested in them because they were not interested in you you would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played and you would find yourself under a freer sky in a street full of splendid strangers or suppose it were the second case of madness that of a man who claims the crown your impulse would be to answer all right perhaps you know that you are the king of england but why do you care make one magnificent effort and you will be a human being and look down on all the kings of the earth  or it might be the third case of the madman who called himself christ  if we said what we felt we should say so you are the creator and redeemer of the world but what a small world it must be  what a little heaven you must inhabit with angels no bigger than butterflies  how sad it must be to be god and an inadequate god  is there really no life fuller and no love more marvellous than yours and is it really in your small and painful pity that all flesh must put its faith  how much happier you would be how much more of you there would be if the hammer of a higher god could smash your small cosmos scattering the stars like spangles and leave you in the open free like other men to look up as well as down       and it must be remembered that the most purely practical science does take this view of mental evil it does not seek to argue with it like a heresy but simply to snap it like a spell  neither modern science nor ancient religion believes in complete free thought theology rebukes certain thoughts by calling them blasphemous science rebukes certain thoughts by calling them morbid  for example some religious societies discouraged men more or less from thinking about sex  the new scientific society definitely discourages men from thinking about death it is a fact but it is considered a morbid fact and in dealing with those whose morbidity has a touch of mania modern science cares far less for pure logic than a dancing dervish in these cases it is not enough that the unhappy man should desire truth he must desire health  nothing can save him but a blind hunger for normality like that of a beast  a man cannot think himself out of mental evil for it is actually the organ of thought that has become diseased ungovernable and as it were independent  he can only be saved by will or faith  the moment his mere reason moves it moves in the old circular rut he will go round and round his logical circle just as a man in a thirdclass carriage on the inner circle will go round and round the inner circle unless he performs the voluntary vigorous and mystical act of getting out at gower street decision is the whole business here a door must be shut for ever every remedy is a desperate remedy  every cure is a miraculous cure curing a madman is not arguing with a philosopher it is casting out a devil  and however quietly doctors and psychologists may go to work in the matter their attitude is profoundly intolerant as intolerant as bloody mary  their attitude is really this that the man must stop thinking if he is to go on living their counsel is one of intellectual amputation  if thy head offend thee cut it off for it is better not merely to enter the kingdom of heaven as a child but to enter it as an imbecile rather than with your whole intellect to be cast into hell or into hanwell       such is the madman of experience he is commonly a reasoner frequently a successful reasoner  doubtless he could be vanquished in mere reason and the case against him put logically  but it can be put much more precisely in more general and even aesthetic terms he is in the clean and welllit prison of one idea  he is sharpened to one painful point  he is without healthy hesitation and healthy complexity  now as i explain in the introduction i have determined in these early chapters to give not so much a diagram of a doctrine as some pictures of a point of view  and i have described at length my vision of the maniac for this reason that just as i am affected by the maniac so i am affected by most modern thinkers  that unmistakable mood or note that i hear from hanwell i hear also from half the chairs of science and seats of learning today and most of the mad doctors are mad doctors in more senses than one  they all have exactly that combination we have noted  the combination of an expansive and exhaustive reason with a contracted common sense  they are universal only in the sense that they take one thin explanation and carry it very far but a pattern can stretch for ever and still be a small pattern they see a chessboard white on black and if the universe is paved with it it is still white on black  like the lunatic they cannot alter their standpoint they cannot make a mental effort and suddenly see it black on white       take first the more obvious case of materialism  as an explanation of the world materialism has a sort of insane simplicity  it has just the quality of the madmans argument we have at once the sense of it covering everything and the sense of it leaving everything out contemplate some able and sincere materialist as for instance mr mccabe and you will have exactly this unique sensation he understands everything and everything does not seem worth understanding  his cosmos may be complete in every rivet and cogwheel but still his cosmos is smaller than our world somehow his scheme like the lucid scheme of the madman seems unconscious of the alien energies and the large indifference of the earth it is not thinking of the real things of the earth of fighting peoples or proud mothers or first love or fear upon the sea the earth is so very large and the cosmos is so very small the cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in       it must be understood that i am not now discussing the relation of these creeds to truth but for the present solely their relation to health  later in the argument i hope to attack the question of objective verity here i speak only of a phenomenon of psychology i do not for the present attempt to prove to haeckel that materialism is untrue any more than i attempted to prove to the man who thought he was christ that he was labouring under an error  i merely remark here on the fact that both cases have the same kind of completeness and the same kind of incompleteness  you can explain a mans detention at hanwell by an indifferent public by saying that it is the crucifixion of a god of whom the world is not worthy the explanation does explain  similarly you may explain the order in the universe by saying that all things even the souls of men are leaves inevitably unfolding on an utterly unconscious tree the blind destiny of matter  the explanation does explain though not of course so completely as the madmans but the point here is that the normal human mind not only objects to both but feels to both the same objection  its approximate statement is that if the man in hanwell is the real god he is not much of a god  and similarly if the cosmos of the materialist is the real cosmos it is not much of a cosmos  the thing has shrunk the deity is less divine than many men and according to haeckel the whole of life is something much more grey narrow and trivial than many separate aspects of it  the parts seem greater than the whole        for we must remember that the materialist philosophy whether true or not is certainly much more limiting than any religion in one sense of course all intelligent ideas are narrow they cannot be broader than themselves  a christian is only restricted in the same sense that an atheist is restricted he cannot think christianity false and continue to be a christian and the atheist cannot think atheism false and continue to be an atheist  but as it happens there is a very special sense in which materialism has more restrictions than spiritualism mr mccabe thinks me a slave because i am not allowed to believe in determinism  i think mr mccabe a slave because he is not allowed to believe in fairies  but if we examine the two vetoes we shall see that his is really much more of a pure veto than mine the christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe but the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle  poor mr mccabe is not allowed to retain even the tiniest imp though it might be hiding in a pimpernel  the christian admits that the universe is manifold and even miscellaneous just as a sane man knows that he is complex  the sane man knows that he has a touch of the beast a touch of the devil a touch of the saint a touch of the citizen nay the really sane man knows that he has a touch of the madman but the materialists world is quite simple and solid just as the madman is quite sure he is sane  the materialist is sure that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that he is simply and solely a chicken  materialists and madmen never have doubts       spiritual doctrines do not actually limit the mind as do materialistic denials  even if i believe in immortality i need not think about it  but if i disbelieve in immortality i must not think about it in the first case the road is open and i can go as far as i like in the second the road is shut  but the case is even stronger and the parallel with madness is yet more strange  for it was our case against the exhaustive and logical theory of the lunatic that right or wrong it gradually destroyed his humanity  now it is the charge against the main deductions of the materialist that right or wrong they gradually destroy his humanity i do not mean only kindness i mean hope courage poetry initiative all that is human for instance when materialism leads men to complete fatalism as it generally does it is quite idle to pretend that it is in any sense a liberating force  it is absurd to say that you are especially advancing freedom when you only use free thought to destroy free will the determinists come to bind not to loose  they may well call their law the chain of causation  it is the worst chain that ever fettered a human being  you may use the language of liberty if you like about materialistic teaching but it is obvious that this is just as inapplicable to it as a whole as the same language when applied to a man locked up in a madhouse you may say if you like that the man is free to think himself a poached egg  but it is surely a more massive and important fact that if he is a poached egg he is not free to eat drink sleep walk or smoke a cigarette similarly you may say if you like that the bold determinist speculator is free to disbelieve in the reality of the will but it is a much more massive and important fact that he is not free to raise to curse to thank to justify to urge to punish to resist temptations to incite mobs to make new year resolutions to pardon sinners to rebuke tyrants or even to say thank you for the mustard       in passing from this subject i may note that there is a queer fallacy to the effect that materialistic fatalism is in some way favourable to mercy to the abolition of cruel punishments or punishments of any kind  this is startlingly the reverse of the truth it is quite tenable that the doctrine of necessity makes no difference at all that it leaves the flogger flogging and the kind friend exhorting as before  but obviously if it stops either of them it stops the kind exhortation  that the sins are inevitable does not prevent punishment if it prevents anything it prevents persuasion determinism is quite as likely to lead to cruelty as it is certain to lead to cowardice  determinism is not inconsistent with the cruel treatment of criminals  what it is perhaps inconsistent with is the generous treatment of criminals with any appeal to their better feelings or encouragement in their moral struggle the determinist does not believe in appealing to the will but he does believe in changing the environment  he must not say to the sinner go and sin no more because the sinner cannot help it  but he can put him in boiling oil for boiling oil is an environment considered as a figure therefore the materialist has the fantastic outline of the figure of the madman  both take up a position at once unanswerable and intolerable       of course it is not only of the materialist that all this is true the same would apply to the other extreme of speculative logic there is a sceptic far more terrible than he who believes that everything began in matter  it is possible to meet the sceptic who believes that everything began in himself  he doubts not the existence of angels or devils but the existence of men and cows for him his own friends are a mythology made up by himself he created his own father and his own mother  this horrible fancy has in it something decidedly attractive to the somewhat mystical egoism of our day  that publisher who thought that men would get on if they believed in themselves those seekers after the superman who are always looking for him in the lookingglass those writers who talk about impressing their personalities instead of creating life for the world all these people have really only an inch between them and this awful emptiness  then when this kindly world all round the man has been blackened out like a lie when friends fade into ghosts and the foundations of the world fail then when the man believing in nothing and in no man is alone in his own nightmare then the great individualistic motto shall be written over him in avenging irony  the stars will be only dots in the blackness of his own brain his mothers face will be only a sketch from his own insane pencil on the walls of his cell but over his cell shall be written with dreadful truth he believes in himself        all that concerns us here however is to note that this panegoistic extreme of thought exhibits the same paradox as the other extreme of materialism  it is equally complete in theory and equally crippling in practice  for the sake of simplicity it is easier to state the notion by saying that a man can believe that he is always in a dream  now obviously there can be no positive proof given to him that he is not in a dream for the simple reason that no proof can be offered that might not be offered in a dream but if the man began to burn down london and say that his housekeeper would soon call him to breakfast we should take him and put him with other logicians in a place which has often been alluded to in the course of this chapter  the man who cannot believe his senses and the man who cannot believe anything else are both insane but their insanity is proved not by any error in their argument but by the manifest mistake of their whole lives  they have both locked themselves up in two boxes painted inside with the sun and stars they are both unable to get out the one into the health and happiness of heaven the other even into the health and happiness of the earth  their position is quite reasonable nay in a sense it is infinitely reasonable just as a threepenny bit is infinitely circular  but there is such a thing as a mean infinity a base and slavish eternity  it is amusing to notice that many of the moderns whether sceptics or mystics have taken as their sign a certain eastern symbol which is the very symbol of this ultimate nullity  when they wish to represent eternity they represent it by a serpent with his tail in his mouth  there is a startling sarcasm in the image of that very unsatisfactory meal the eternity of the material fatalists the eternity of the eastern pessimists the eternity of the supercilious theosophists and higher scientists of today is indeed very well presented by a serpent eating his tail a degraded animal who destroys even himself       this chapter is purely practical and is concerned with what actually is the chief mark and element of insanity we may say in summary that it is reason used without root reason in the void the man who begins to think without the proper first principles goes mad he begins to think at the wrong end  and for the rest of these pages we have to try and discover what is the right end  but we may ask in conclusion if this be what drives men mad what is it that keeps them sane  by the end of this book i hope to give a definite some will think a far too definite answer  but for the moment it is possible in the same solely practical manner to give a general answer touching what in actual human history keeps men sane mysticism keeps men sane  as long as you have mystery you have health when you destroy mystery you create morbidity  the ordinary man has always been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic he has permitted the twilight  he has always had one foot in earth and the other in fairyland  he has always left himself free to doubt his gods but unlike the agnostic of today free also to believe in them  he has always cared more for truth than for consistency if he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other he would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them his spiritual sight is stereoscopic like his physical sight he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that  thus he has always believed that there was such a thing as fate but such a thing as free will also  thus he believed that children were indeed the kingdom of heaven but nevertheless ought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth  he admired youth because it was young and age because it was not  it is exactly this balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole buoyancy of the healthy man  the whole secret of mysticism is this that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand  the morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid and succeeds in making everything mysterious  the mystic allows one thing to be mysterious and everything else becomes lucid the determinist makes the theory of causation quite clear and then finds that he cannot say if you please to the housemaid the christian permits free will to remain a sacred mystery but because of this his relations with the housemaid become of a sparkling and crystal clearness  he puts the seed of dogma in a central darkness but it branches forth in all directions with abounding natural health as we have taken the circle as the symbol of reason and madness we may very well take the cross as the symbol at once of mystery and of health  buddhism is centripetal but christianity is centrifugal it breaks out  for the circle is perfect and infinite in its nature but it is fixed for ever in its size it can never be larger or smaller  but the cross though it has at its heart a collision and a contradiction can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape  because it has a paradox in its centre it can grow without changing  the circle returns upon itself and is bound the cross opens its arms to the four winds it is a signpost for free travellers       symbols alone are of even a cloudy value in speaking of this deep matter and another symbol from physical nature will express sufficiently well the real place of mysticism before mankind the one created thing which we cannot look at is the one thing in the light of which we look at everything  like the sun at noonday mysticism explains everything else by the blaze of its own victorious invisibility  detached intellectualism is in the exact sense of a popular phrase all moonshine for it is light without heat and it is secondary light reflected from a dead world but the greeks were right when they made apollo the god both of imagination and of sanity for he was both the patron of poetry and the patron of healing  of necessary dogmas and a special creed i shall speak later  but that transcendentalism by which all men live has primarily much the position of the sun in the sky we are conscious of it as of a kind of splendid confusion it is something both shining and shapeless at once a blaze and a blur  but the circle of the moon is as clear and unmistakable as recurrent and inevitable as the circle of euclid on a blackboard for the moon is utterly reasonable and the moon is the mother of lunatics and has given to them all her name    iii the suicide of thought        the phrases of the street are not only forcible but subtle for a figure of speech can often get into a crack too small for a definition  phrases like put out or off colour might have been coined by mr henry james in an agony of verbal precision and there is no more subtle truth than that of the everyday phrase about a man having his heart in the right place  it involves the idea of normal proportion not only does a certain function exist but it is rightly related to other functions  indeed the negation of this phrase would describe with peculiar accuracy the somewhat morbid mercy and perverse tenderness of the most representative moderns if for instance i had to describe with fairness the character of mr bernard shaw i could not express myself more exactly than by saying that he has a heroically large and generous heart but not a heart in the right place  and this is so of the typical society of our time       the modern world is not evil in some ways the modern world is far too good  it is full of wild and wasted virtues when a religious scheme is shattered as christianity was shattered at the reformation it is not merely the vices that are let loose the vices are indeed let loose and they wander and do damage but the virtues are let loose also and the virtues wander more wildly and the virtues do more terrible damage  the modern world is full of the old christian virtues gone mad  the virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone  thus some scientists care for truth and their truth is pitiless  thus some humanitarians only care for pity and their pity i am sorry to say is often untruthful for example mr blatchford attacks christianity because he is mad on one christian virtue  the merely mystical and almost irrational virtue of charity  he has a strange idea that he will make it easier to forgive sins by saying that there are no sins to forgive mr blatchford is not only an early christian he is the only early christian who ought really to have been eaten by lions for in his case the pagan accusation is really true  his mercy would mean mere anarchy  he really is the enemy of the human race because he is so human  as the other extreme we may take the acrid realist who has deliberately killed in himself all human pleasure in happy tales or in the healing of the heart torquemada tortured people physically for the sake of moral truth zola tortured people morally for the sake of physical truth but in torquemadas time there was at least a system that could to some extent make righteousness and peace kiss each other now they do not even bow  but a much stronger case than these two of truth and pity can be found in the remarkable case of the dislocation of humility       it is only with one aspect of humility that we are here concerned humility was largely meant as a restraint upon the arrogance and infinity of the appetite of man  he was always outstripping his mercies with his own newly invented needs  his very power of enjoyment destroyed half his joys  by asking for pleasure he lost the chief pleasure for the chief pleasure is surprise hence it became evident that if a man would make his world large he must be always making himself small  even the haughty visions the tall cities and the toppling pinnacles are the creations of humility  giants that tread down forests like grass are the creations of humility  towers that vanish upwards above the loneliest star are the creations of humility  for towers are not tall unless we look up at them and giants are not giants unless they are larger than we  all this gigantesque imagination which is perhaps the mightiest of the pleasures of man is at bottom entirely humble  it is impossible without humility to enjoy anything even pride       but what we suffer from today is humility in the wrong place modesty has moved from the organ of ambition  modesty has settled upon the organ of conviction where it was never meant to be a man was meant to be doubtful about himself but undoubting about the truth this has been exactly reversed  nowadays the part of a man that a man does assert is exactly the part he ought not to asserthimself  the part he doubts is exactly the part he ought not to doubtthe divine reason  huxley preached a humility content to learn from nature  but the new sceptic is so humble that he doubts if he can even learn  thus we should be wrong if we had said hastily that there is no humility typical of our time the truth is that there is a real humility typical of our time but it so happens that it is practically a more poisonous humility than the wildest prostrations of the ascetic  the old humility was a spur that prevented a man from stopping not a nail in his boot that prevented him from going on  for the old humility made a man doubtful about his efforts which might make him work harder but the new humility makes a man doubtful about his aims which will make him stop working altogether       at any street corner we may meet a man who utters the frantic and blasphemous statement that he may be wrong  every day one comes across somebody who says that of course his view may not be the right one  of course his view must be the right one or it is not his view  we are on the road to producing a race of men too mentally modest to believe in the multiplication table we are in danger of seeing philosophers who doubt the law of gravity as being a mere fancy of their own  scoffers of old time were too proud to be convinced but these are too humble to be convinced the meek do inherit the earth but the modern sceptics are too meek even to claim their inheritance  it is exactly this intellectual helplessness which is our second problem       the last chapter has been concerned only with a fact of observation that what peril of morbidity there is for man comes rather from his reason than his imagination  it was not meant to attack the authority of reason rather it is the ultimate purpose to defend it for it needs defence  the whole modern world is at war with reason and the tower already reels       the sages it is often said can see no answer to the riddle of religion  but the trouble with our sages is not that they cannot see the answer it is that they cannot even see the riddle they are like children so stupid as to notice nothing paradoxical in the playful assertion that a door is not a door  the modern latitudinarians speak for instance about authority in religion not only as if there were no reason in it but as if there had never been any reason for it  apart from seeing its philosophical basis they cannot even see its historical cause  religious authority has often doubtless been oppressive or unreasonable just as every legal system and especially our present one has been callous and full of a cruel apathy  it is rational to attack the police nay it is glorious  but the modern critics of religious authority are like men who should attack the police without ever having heard of burglars  for there is a great and possible peril to the human mind  a peril as practical as burglary  against it religious authority was reared rightly or wrongly as a barrier and against it something certainly must be reared as a barrier if our race is to avoid ruin       that peril is that the human intellect is free to destroy itself just as one generation could prevent the very existence of the next generation by all entering a monastery or jumping into the sea so one set of thinkers can in some degree prevent further thinking by teaching the next generation that there is no validity in any human thought it is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith reason is itself a matter of faith  it is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all  if you are merely a sceptic you must sooner or later ask yourself the question why should anything go right even observation and deduction why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic they are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape the young sceptic says i have a right to think for myself but the old sceptic the complete sceptic says i have no right to think for myself  i have no right to think at all       there is a thought that stops thought  that is the only thought that ought to be stopped  that is the ultimate evil against which all religious authority was aimed  it only appears at the end of decadent ages like our own  and already mr hgwells has raised its ruinous banner he has written a delicate piece of scepticism called doubts of the instrument  in this he questions the brain itself and endeavours to remove all reality from all his own assertions past present and to come  but it was against this remote ruin that all the military systems in religion were originally ranked and ruled  the creeds and the crusades the hierarchies and the horrible persecutions were not organized as is ignorantly said for the suppression of reason  they were organized for the difficult defence of reason  man by a blind instinct knew that if once things were wildly questioned reason could be questioned first the authority of priests to absolve the authority of popes to define the authority even of inquisitors to terrify  these were all only dark defences erected round one central authority more undemonstrable more supernatural than allthe authority of a man to think we know now that this is so we have no excuse for not knowing it for we can hear scepticism crashing through the old ring of authorities and at the same moment we can see reason swaying upon her throne in so far as religion is gone reason is going  for they are both of the same primary and authoritative kind  they are both methods of proof which cannot themselves be proved  and in the act of destroying the idea of divine authority we have largely destroyed the idea of that human authority by which we do a longdivision sum with a long and sustained tug we have attempted to pull the mitre off pontifical man and his head has come off with it       lest this should be called loose assertion it is perhaps desirable though dull to run rapidly through the chief modern fashions of thought which have this effect of stopping thought itself materialism and the view of everything as a personal illusion have some such effect for if the mind is mechanical thought cannot be very exciting and if the cosmos is unreal there is nothing to think about  but in these cases the effect is indirect and doubtful  in some cases it is direct and clear notably in the case of what is generally called evolution       evolution is a good example of that modern intelligence which if it destroys anything destroys itself  evolution is either an innocent scientific description of how certain earthly things came about or if it is anything more than this it is an attack upon thought itself  if evolution destroys anything it does not destroy religion but rationalism  if evolution simply means that a positive thing called an ape turned very slowly into a positive thing called a man then it is stingless for the most orthodox for a personal god might just as well do things slowly as quickly especially if like the christian god he were outside time but if it means anything more it means that there is no such thing as an ape to change and no such thing as a man for him to change into  it means that there is no such thing as a thing at best there is only one thing and that is a flux of everything and anything  this is an attack not upon the faith but upon the mind you cannot think if there are no things to think about you cannot think if you are not separate from the subject of thought descartes said i think therefore i am  the philosophic evolutionist reverses and negatives the epigram  he says i am not therefore i cannot think       then there is the opposite attack on thought  that urged by mr hgwells when he insists that every separate thing is unique and there are no categories at all  this also is merely destructive thinking means connecting things and stops if they cannot be connected it need hardly be said that this scepticism forbidding thought necessarily forbids speech a man cannot open his mouth without contradicting it  thus when mr wells says as he did somewhere all chairs are quite different he utters not merely a misstatement but a contradiction in terms  if all chairs were quite different you could not call them all chairs       akin to these is the false theory of progress which maintains that we alter the test instead of trying to pass the test we often hear it said for instance what is right in one age is wrong in another  this is quite reasonable if it means that there is a fixed aim and that certain methods attain at certain times and not at other times  if women say desire to be elegant it may be that they are improved at one time by growing fatter and at another time by growing thinner  but you cannot say that they are improved by ceasing to wish to be elegant and beginning to wish to be oblong  if the standard changes how can there be improvement which implies a standard  nietzsche started a nonsensical idea that men had once sought as good what we now call evil if it were so we could not talk of surpassing or even falling short of them how can you overtake jones if you walk in the other direction you cannot discuss whether one people has succeeded more in being miserable than another succeeded in being happy  it would be like discussing whether milton was more puritanical than a pig is fat       it is true that a man a silly man might make change itself his object or ideal  but as an ideal change itself becomes unchangeable if the changeworshipper wishes to estimate his own progress he must be sternly loyal to the ideal of change he must not begin to flirt gaily with the ideal of monotony  progress itself cannot progress it is worth remark in passing that when tennyson in a wild and rather weak manner welcomed the idea of infinite alteration in society he instinctively took a metaphor which suggests an imprisoned tedium he wrote       let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change  he thought of change itself as an unchangeable groove and so it is change is about the narrowest and hardest groove that a man can get into       the main point here however is that this idea of a fundamental alteration in the standard is one of the things that make thought about the past or future simply impossible  the theory of a complete change of standards in human history does not merely deprive us of the pleasure of honouring our fathers it deprives us even of the more modern and aristocratic pleasure of despising them       this bald summary of the thoughtdestroying forces of our time would not be complete without some reference to pragmatism for though i have here used and should everywhere defend the pragmatist method as a preliminary guide to truth there is an extreme application of it which involves the absence of all truth whatever my meaning can be put shortly thus  i agree with the pragmatists that apparent objective truth is not the whole matter that there is an authoritative need to believe the things that are necessary to the human mind  but i say that one of those necessities precisely is a belief in objective truth  the pragmatist tells a man to think what he must think and never mind the absolute but precisely one of the things that he must think is the absolute this philosophy indeed is a kind of verbal paradox  pragmatism is a matter of human needs and one of the first of human needs is to be something more than a pragmatist  extreme pragmatism is just as inhuman as the determinism it so powerfully attacks the determinist who to do him justice does not pretend to be a human being makes nonsense of the human sense of actual choice the pragmatist who professes to be specially human makes nonsense of the human sense of actual fact       to sum up our contention so far we may say that the most characteristic current philosophies have not only a touch of mania but a touch of suicidal mania  the mere questioner has knocked his head against the limits of human thought and cracked it this is what makes so futile the warnings of the orthodox and the boasts of the advanced about the dangerous boyhood of free thought what we are looking at is not the boyhood of free thought it is the old age and ultimate dissolution of free thought  it is vain for bishops and pious bigwigs to discuss what dreadful things will happen if wild scepticism runs its course  it has run its course it is vain for eloquent atheists to talk of the great truths that will be revealed if once we see free thought begin  we have seen it end  it has no more questions to ask it has questioned itself you cannot call up any wilder vision than a city in which men ask themselves if they have any selves  you cannot fancy a more sceptical world than that in which men doubt if there is a world it might certainly have reached its bankruptcy more quickly and cleanly if it had not been feebly hampered by the application of indefensible laws of blasphemy or by the absurd pretence that modern england is christian  but it would have reached the bankruptcy anyhow  militant atheists are still unjustly persecuted but rather because they are an old minority than because they are a new one  free thought has exhausted its own freedom it is weary of its own success  if any eager freethinker now hails philosophic freedom as the dawn he is only like the man in mark twain who came out wrapped in blankets to see the sun rise and was just in time to see it set  if any frightened curate still says that it will be awful if the darkness of free thought should spread we can only answer him in the high and powerful words of mr belloc do not i beseech you be troubled about the increase of forces already in dissolution  you have mistaken the hour of the night it is already morning  we have no more questions left to ask we have looked for questions in the darkest corners and on the wildest peaks  we have found all the questions that can be found it is time we gave up looking for questions and began looking for answers       but one more word must be added  at the beginning of this preliminary negative sketch i said that our mental ruin has been wrought by wild reason not by wild imagination  a man does not go mad because he makes a statue a mile high but he may go mad by thinking it out in square inches  now one school of thinkers has seen this and jumped at it as a way of renewing the pagan health of the world  they see that reason destroys but will they say creates  the ultimate authority they say is in will not in reason  the supreme point is not why a man demands a thing but the fact that he does demand it i have no space to trace or expound this philosophy of will it came i suppose through nietzsche who preached something that is called egoism  that indeed was simpleminded enough for nietzsche denied egoism simply by preaching it  to preach anything is to give it away  first the egoist calls life a war without mercy and then he takes the greatest possible trouble to drill his enemies in war  to preach egoism is to practise altruism but however it began the view is common enough in current literature the main defence of these thinkers is that they are not thinkers they are makers  they say that choice is itself the divine thing thus mr bernard shaw has attacked the old idea that mens acts are to be judged by the standard of the desire of happiness he says that a man does not act for his happiness but from his will he does not say jam will make me happy but i want jam and in all this others follow him with yet greater enthusiasm mr john davidson a remarkable poet is so passionately excited about it that he is obliged to write prose  he publishes a short play with several long prefaces  this is natural enough in mr shaw for all his plays are prefaces  mr shaw is i suspect the only man on earth who has never written any poetry  but that mr davidson who can write excellent poetry should write instead laborious metaphysics in defence of this doctrine of will does show that the doctrine of will has taken hold of men  even mr hgwells has half spoken in its language saying that one should test acts not like a thinker but like an artist saying i feel this curve is right or that line shall go thus  they are all excited and well they may be for by this doctrine of the divine authority of will they think they can break out of the doomed fortress of rationalism  they think they can escape       but they cannot escape  this pure praise of volition ends in the same break up and blank as the mere pursuit of logic exactly as complete free thought involves the doubting of thought itself so the acceptation of mere willing really paralyzes the will mr bernard shaw has not perceived the real difference between the old utilitarian test of pleasure clumsy of course and easily misstated and that which he propounds  the real difference between the test of happiness and the test of will is simply that the test of happiness is a test and the other isnt you can discuss whether a mans act in jumping over a cliff was directed towards happiness you cannot discuss whether it was derived from will  of course it was  you can praise an action by saying that it is calculated to bring pleasure or pain to discover truth or to save the soul but you cannot praise an action because it shows will for to say that is merely to say that it is an action  by this praise of will you cannot really choose one course as better than another  and yet choosing one course as better than another is the very definition of the will you are praising       the worship of will is the negation of will  to admire mere choice is to refuse to choose  if mr bernard shaw comes up to me and says will something that is tantamount to saying i do not mind what you will and that is tantamount to saying i have no will in the matter  you cannot admire will in general because the essence of will is that it is particular a brilliant anarchist like mr john davidson feels an irritation against ordinary morality and therefore he invokes willwill to anything  he only wants humanity to want something but humanity does want something  it wants ordinary morality he rebels against the law and tells us to will something or anything but we have willed something  we have willed the law against which he rebels       all the willworshippers from nietzsche to mr davidson are really quite empty of volition  they cannot will they can hardly wish  and if any one wants a proof of this it can be found quite easily  it can be found in this fact  that they always talk of will as something that expands and breaks out  but it is quite the opposite  every act of will is an act of selflimitation to desire action is to desire limitation  in that sense every act is an act of selfsacrifice when you choose anything you reject everything else  that objection which men of this school used to make to the act of marriage is really an objection to every act every act is an irrevocable selection and exclusion  just as when you marry one woman you give up all the others so when you take one course of action you give up all the other courses  if you become king of england you give up the post of beadle in brompton if you go to rome you sacrifice a rich suggestive life in wimbledon it is the existence of this negative or limiting side of will that makes most of the talk of the anarchic willworshippers little better than nonsense  for instance mr john davidson tells us to have nothing to do with thou shalt not but it is surely obvious that thou shalt not is only one of the necessary corollaries of i will  i will go to the lord mayors show and thou shalt not stop me  anarchism adjures us to be bold creative artists and care for no laws or limits  but it is impossible to be an artist and not care for laws and limits  art is limitation the essence of every picture is the frame  if you draw a giraffe you must draw him with a long neck  if in your bold creative way you hold yourself free to draw a giraffe with a short neck you will really find that you are not free to draw a giraffe the moment you step into the world of facts you step into a world of limits  you can free things from alien or accidental laws but not from the laws of their own nature  you may if you like free a tiger from his bars but do not free him from his stripes do not free a camel of the burden of his hump  you may be freeing him from being a camel  do not go about as a demagogue encouraging triangles to break out of the prison of their three sides  if a triangle breaks out of its three sides its life comes to a lamentable end somebody wrote a work called the loves of the triangles i never read it but i am sure that if triangles ever were loved they were loved for being triangular  this is certainly the case with all artistic creation which is in some ways the most decisive example of pure will  the artist loves his limitations they constitute the thing he is doing  the painter is glad that the canvas is flat  the sculptor is glad that the clay is colourless       in case the point is not clear an historic example may illustrate it  the french revolution was really an heroic and decisive thing because the jacobins willed something definite and limited they desired the freedoms of democracy but also all the vetoes of democracy  they wished to have votes and not to have titles republicanism had an ascetic side in franklin or robespierre as well as an expansive side in danton or wilkes  therefore they have created something with a solid substance and shape the square social equality and peasant wealth of france  but since then the revolutionary or speculative mind of europe has been weakened by shrinking from any proposal because of the limits of that proposal liberalism has been degraded into liberality  men have tried to turn revolutionise from a transitive to an intransitive verb the jacobin could tell you not only the system he would rebel against but what was more important the system he would not rebel against the system he would trust  but the new rebel is a sceptic and will not entirely trust anything  he has no loyalty therefore he can never be really a revolutionist  and the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything for all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces but the doctrine by which he denounces it  thus he writes one book complaining that imperial oppression insults the purity of women and then he writes another book about the sex problem in which he insults it himself  he curses the sultan because christian girls lose their virginity and then curses mrs grundy because they keep it as a politician he will cry out that war is a waste of life and then as a philosopher that all life is waste of time a russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself  a man denounces marriage as a lie and then denounces aristocratic profligates for treating it as a lie  he calls a flag a bauble and then blames the oppressors of poland or ireland because they take away that bauble the man of this school goes first to a political meeting where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting where he proves that they practically are beasts  in short the modern revolutionist being an infinite sceptic is always engaged in undermining his own mines  in his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men  therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt by rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel against anything       it may be added that the same blank and bankruptcy can be observed in all fierce and terrible types of literature especially in satire satire may be mad and anarchic but it presupposes an admitted superiority in certain things over others it presupposes a standard when little boys in the street laugh at the fatness of some distinguished journalist they are unconsciously assuming a standard of greek sculpture  they are appealing to the marble apollo and the curious disappearance of satire from our literature is an instance of the fierce things fading for want of any principle to be fierce about  nietzsche had some natural talent for sarcasm he could sneer though he could not laugh but there is always something bodiless and without weight in his satire simply because it has not any mass of common morality behind it  he is himself more preposterous than anything he denounces  but indeed nietzsche will stand very well as the type of the whole of this failure of abstract violence the softening of the brain which ultimately overtook him was not a physical accident  if nietzsche had not ended in imbecility nietzscheism would end in imbecility  thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot  every man who will not have softening of the heart must at last have softening of the brain       this last attempt to evade intellectualism ends in intellectualism and therefore in death  the sortie has failed  the wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void nietzsche scales staggering mountains but he turns up ultimately in tibet  he sits down beside tolstoy in the land of nothing and nirvana  they are both helplessone because he must not grasp anything and the other because he must not let go of anything the tolstoyans will is frozen by a buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil  but the nietzscheites will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good for if all special actions are good none of them are special they stand at the crossroads and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads  the result iswell some things are not hard to calculate  they stand at the crossroads       here i end thank god the first and dullest business of this bookthe rough review of recent thought  after this i begin to sketch a view of life which may not interest my reader but which at any rate interests me  in front of me as i close this page is a pile of modern books that i have been turning over for the purposea pile of ingenuity a pile of futility by the accident of my present detachment i can see the inevitable smash of the philosophies of schopenhauer and tolstoy nietzsche and shaw as clearly as an inevitable railway smash could be seen from a balloon  they are all on the road to the emptiness of the asylum for madness may be defined as using mental activity so as to reach mental helplessness and they have nearly reached it  he who thinks he is made of glass thinks to the destruction of thought for glass cannot think  so he who wills to reject nothing wills the destruction of will for will is not only the choice of something but the rejection of almost everything  and as i turn and tumble over the clever wonderful tiresome and useless modern books the title of one of them rivets my eye  it is called jeanne darc by anatole france  i have only glanced at it but a glance was enough to remind me of renans vie de jesus it has the same strange method of the reverent sceptic  it discredits supernatural stories that have some foundation simply by telling natural stories that have no foundation  because we cannot believe in what a saint did we are to pretend that we know exactly what he felt  but i do not mention either book in order to criticise it but because the accidental combination of the names called up two startling images of sanity which blasted all the books before me joan of arc was not stuck at the crossroads either by rejecting all the paths like tolstoy or by accepting them all like nietzsche she chose a path and went down it like a thunderbolt  yet joan when i came to think of her had in her all that was true either in tolstoy or nietzsche all that was even tolerable in either of them i thought of all that is noble in tolstoy the pleasure in plain things especially in plain pity the actualities of the earth the reverence for the poor the dignity of the bowed back joan of arc had all that and with this great addition that she endured poverty as well as admiring it whereas tolstoy is only a typical aristocrat trying to find out its secret  and then i thought of all that was brave and proud and pathetic in poor nietzsche and his mutiny against the emptiness and timidity of our time i thought of his cry for the ecstatic equilibrium of danger his hunger for the rush of great horses his cry to arms  well joan of arc had all that and again with this difference that she did not praise fighting but fought  we know that she was not afraid of an army while nietzsche for all we know was afraid of a cow tolstoy only praised the peasant she was the peasant  nietzsche only praised the warrior she was the warrior  she beat them both at their own antagonistic ideals she was more gentle than the one more violent than the other  yet she was a perfectly practical person who did something while they are wild speculators who do nothing it was impossible that the thought should not cross my mind that she and her faith had perhaps some secret of moral unity and utility that has been lost  and with that thought came a larger one and the colossal figure of her master had also crossed the theatre of my thoughts  the same modern difficulty which darkened the subjectmatter of anatole france also darkened that of ernest renan renan also divided his heros pity from his heros pugnacity renan even represented the righteous anger at jerusalem as a mere nervous breakdown after the idyllic expectations of galilee as if there were any inconsistency between having a love for humanity and having a hatred for inhumanity  altruists with thin weak voices denounce christ as an egoist  egoists with even thinner and weaker voices denounce him as an altruist in our present atmosphere such cavils are comprehensible enough the love of a hero is more terrible than the hatred of a tyrant the hatred of a hero is more generous than the love of a philanthropist there is a huge and heroic sanity of which moderns can only collect the fragments  there is a giant of whom we see only the lopped arms and legs walking about  they have torn the soul of christ into silly strips labelled egoism and altruism and they are equally puzzled by his insane magnificence and his insane meekness they have parted his garments among them and for his vesture they have cast lots though the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout    iv the ethics of elfland        when the business man rebukes the idealism of his officeboy it is commonly in some such speech as this  ah yes when one is young one has these ideals in the abstract and these castles in the air but in middle age they all break up like clouds and one comes down to a belief in practical politics to using the machinery one has and getting on with the world as it is  thus at least venerable and philanthropic old men now in their honoured graves used to talk to me when i was a boy  but since then i have grown up and have discovered that these philanthropic old men were telling lies  what has really happened is exactly the opposite of what they said would happen they said that i should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the methods of practical politicians  now i have not lost my ideals in the least my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was what i have lost is my old childlike faith in practical politics i am still as much concerned as ever about the battle of armageddon but i am not so much concerned about the general election as a babe i leapt up on my mothers knee at the mere mention of it  no the vision is always solid and reliable  the vision is always a fact  it is the reality that is often a fraud as much as i ever did more than i ever did i believe in liberalism but there was a rosy time of innocence when i believed in liberals       i take this instance of one of the enduring faiths because having now to trace the roots of my personal speculation this may be counted i think as the only positive bias i was brought up a liberal and have always believed in democracy in the elementary liberal doctrine of a selfgoverning humanity if any one finds the phrase vague or threadbare i can only pause for a moment to explain that the principle of democracy as i mean it can be stated in two propositions  the first is this that the things common to all men are more important than the things peculiar to any men  ordinary things are more valuable than extraordinary things nay they are more extraordinary man is something more awful than men something more strange the sense of the miracle of humanity itself should be always more vivid to us than any marvels of power intellect art or civilization the mere man on two legs as such should be felt as something more heartbreaking than any music and more startling than any caricature death is more tragic even than death by starvation  having a nose is more comic even than having a norman nose       this is the first principle of democracy  that the essential things in men are the things they hold in common not the things they hold separately  and the second principle is merely this that the political instinct or desire is one of these things which they hold in common  falling in love is more poetical than dropping into poetry  the democratic contention is that government helping to rule the tribe is a thing like falling in love and not a thing like dropping into poetry  it is not something analogous to playing the church organ painting on vellum discovering the north pole that insidious habit looping the loop being astronomer royal and so on  for these things we do not wish a man to do at all unless he does them well  it is on the contrary a thing analogous to writing ones own loveletters or blowing ones own nose  these things we want a man to do for himself even if he does them badly  i am not here arguing the truth of any of these conceptions i know that some moderns are asking to have their wives chosen by scientists and they may soon be asking for all i know to have their noses blown by nurses  i merely say that mankind does recognize these universal human functions and that democracy classes government among them  in short the democratic faith is this  that the most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselvesthe mating of the sexes the rearing of the young the laws of the state  this is democracy and in this i have always believed       but there is one thing that i have never from my youth up been able to understand  i have never been able to understand where people got the idea that democracy was in some way opposed to tradition it is obvious that tradition is only democracy extended through time it is trusting to a consensus of common human voices rather than to some isolated or arbitrary record  the man who quotes some german historian against the tradition of the catholic church for instance is strictly appealing to aristocracy  he is appealing to the superiority of one expert against the awful authority of a mob it is quite easy to see why a legend is treated and ought to be treated more respectfully than a book of history  the legend is generally made by the majority of people in the village who are sane the book is generally written by the one man in the village who is mad those who urge against tradition that men in the past were ignorant may go and urge it at the carlton club along with the statement that voters in the slums are ignorant  it will not do for us if we attach great importance to the opinion of ordinary men in great unanimity when we are dealing with daily matters there is no reason why we should disregard it when we are dealing with history or fable tradition may be defined as an extension of the franchise tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors  it is the democracy of the dead  tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about  all democrats object to men being disqualified by the accident of birth tradition objects to their being disqualified by the accident of death  democracy tells us not to neglect a good mans opinion even if he is our groom tradition asks us not to neglect a good mans opinion even if he is our father  i at any rate cannot separate the two ideas of democracy and tradition it seems evident to me that they are the same idea we will have the dead at our councils  the ancient greeks voted by stones these shall vote by tombstones  it is all quite regular and official for most tombstones like most ballot papers are marked with a cross       i have first to say therefore that if i have had a bias it was always a bias in favour of democracy and therefore of tradition before we come to any theoretic or logical beginnings i am content to allow for that personal equation i have always been more inclined to believe the ruck of hardworking people than to believe that special and troublesome literary class to which i belong i prefer even the fancies and prejudices of the people who see life from the inside to the clearest demonstrations of the people who see life from the outside  i would always trust the old wives fables against the old maids facts  as long as wit is mother wit it can be as wild as it pleases       now i have to put together a general position and i pretend to no training in such things  i propose to do it therefore by writing down one after another the three or four fundamental ideas which i have found for myself pretty much in the way that i found them  then i shall roughly synthesise them summing up my personal philosophy or natural religion then i shall describe my startling discovery that the whole thing had been discovered before  it had been discovered by christianity but of these profound persuasions which i have to recount in order the earliest was concerned with this element of popular tradition and without the foregoing explanation touching tradition and democracy i could hardly make my mental experience clear  as it is i do not know whether i can make it clear but i now propose to try       my first and last philosophy that which i believe in with unbroken certainty i learnt in the nursery  i generally learnt it from a nurse that is from the solemn and starappointed priestess at once of democracy and tradition  the things i believed most then the things i believe most now are the things called fairy tales they seem to me to be the entirely reasonable things  they are not fantasies  compared with them other things are fantastic compared with them religion and rationalism are both abnormal though religion is abnormally right and rationalism abnormally wrong fairyland is nothing but the sunny country of common sense it is not earth that judges heaven but heaven that judges earth so for me at least it was not earth that criticised elfland but elfland that criticised the earth  i knew the magic beanstalk before i had tasted beans i was sure of the man in the moon before i was certain of the moon  this was at one with all popular tradition modern minor poets are naturalists and talk about the bush or the brook but the singers of the old epics and fables were supernaturalists and talked about the gods of brook and bush  that is what the moderns mean when they say that the ancients did not appreciate nature because they said that nature was divine  old nurses do not tell children about the grass but about the fairies that dance on the grass and the old greeks could not see the trees for the dryads       but i deal here with what ethic and philosophy come from being fed on fairy tales  if i were describing them in detail i could note many noble and healthy principles that arise from them there is the chivalrous lesson of jack the giant killer that giants should be killed because they are gigantic  it is a manly mutiny against pride as such  for the rebel is older than all the kingdoms and the jacobin has more tradition than the jacobite  there is the lesson of cinderella which is the same as that of the magnificat exaltavit humiles  there is the great lesson of beauty and the beast that a thing must be loved before it is loveable  there is the terrible allegory of the sleeping beauty which tells how the human creature was blessed with all birthday gifts yet cursed with death and how death also may perhaps be softened to a sleep  but i am not concerned with any of the separate statutes of elfland but with the whole spirit of its law which i learnt before i could speak and shall retain when i cannot write  i am concerned with a certain way of looking at life which was created in me by the fairy tales but has since been meekly ratified by the mere facts       it might be stated this way  there are certain sequences or developments cases of one thing following another which are in the true sense of the word reasonable  they are in the true sense of the word necessary  such are mathematical and merely logical sequences  we in fairyland who are the most reasonable of all creatures admit that reason and that necessity for instance if the ugly sisters are older than cinderella it is in an iron and awful sense necessary that cinderella is younger than the ugly sisters  there is no getting out of it haeckel may talk as much fatalism about that fact as he pleases it really must be  if jack is the son of a miller a miller is the father of jack  cold reason decrees it from her awful throne and we in fairyland submit  if the three brothers all ride horses there are six animals and eighteen legs involved  that is true rationalism and fairyland is full of it  but as i put my head over the hedge of the elves and began to take notice of the natural world i observed an extraordinary thing  i observed that learned men in spectacles were talking of the actual things that happened dawn and death and so onas if they were rational and inevitable they talked as if the fact that trees bear fruit were just as necessary as the fact that two and one trees make three  but it is not there is an enormous difference by the test of fairyland which is the test of the imagination  you cannot imagine two and one not making three  but you can easily imagine trees not growing fruit you can imagine them growing golden candlesticks or tigers hanging on by the tail  these men in spectacles spoke much of a man named newton who was hit by an apple and who discovered a law but they could not be got to see the distinction between a true law a law of reason and the mere fact of apples falling  if the apple hit newtons nose newtons nose hit the apple  that is a true necessity because we cannot conceive the one occurring without the other but we can quite well conceive the apple not falling on his nose we can fancy it flying ardently through the air to hit some other nose of which it had a more definite dislike  we have always in our fairy tales kept this sharp distinction between the science of mental relations in which there really are laws and the science of physical facts in which there are no laws but only weird repetitions  we believe in bodily miracles but not in mental impossibilities  we believe that a beanstalk climbed up to heaven but that does not at all confuse our convictions on the philosophical question of how many beans make five       here is the peculiar perfection of tone and truth in the nursery tales  the man of science says cut the stalk and the apple will fall but he says it calmly as if the one idea really led up to the other  the witch in the fairy tale says blow the horn and the ogres castle will fall but she does not say it as if it were something in which the effect obviously arose out of the cause doubtless she has given the advice to many champions and has seen many castles fall but she does not lose either her wonder or her reason she does not muddle her head until it imagines a necessary mental connection between a horn and a falling tower  but the scientific men do muddle their heads until they imagine a necessary mental connection between an apple leaving the tree and an apple reaching the ground  they do really talk as if they had found not only a set of marvellous facts but a truth connecting those facts they do talk as if the connection of two strange things physically connected them philosophically  they feel that because one incomprehensible thing constantly follows another incomprehensible thing the two together somehow make up a comprehensible thing two black riddles make a white answer       in fairyland we avoid the word law but in the land of science they are singularly fond of it  thus they will call some interesting conjecture about how forgotten folks pronounced the alphabet grimms law  but grimms law is far less intellectual than grimms fairy tales  the tales are at any rate certainly tales while the law is not a law  a law implies that we know the nature of the generalisation and enactment not merely that we have noticed some of the effects  if there is a law that pickpockets shall go to prison it implies that there is an imaginable mental connection between the idea of prison and the idea of picking pockets and we know what the idea is  we can say why we take liberty from a man who takes liberties  but we cannot say why an egg can turn into a chicken any more than we can say why a bear could turn into a fairy prince  as ideas the egg and the chicken are further off from each other than the bear and the prince for no egg in itself suggests a chicken whereas some princes do suggest bears granted then that certain transformations do happen it is essential that we should regard them in the philosophic manner of fairy tales not in the unphilosophic manner of science and the laws of nature when we are asked why eggs turn to birds or fruits fall in autumn we must answer exactly as the fairy godmother would answer if cinderella asked her why mice turned to horses or her clothes fell from her at twelve oclock we must answer that it is magic it is not a law for we do not understand its general formula it is not a necessity for though we can count on it happening practically we have no right to say that it must always happen it is no argument for unalterable law as huxley fancied that we count on the ordinary course of things  we do not count on it we bet on it  we risk the remote possibility of a miracle as we do that of a poisoned pancake or a worlddestroying comet we leave it out of account not because it is a miracle and therefore an impossibility but because it is a miracle and therefore an exception  all the terms used in the science books law necessity order tendency and so on are really unintellectual because they assume an inner synthesis which we do not possess the only words that ever satisfied me as describing nature are the terms used in the fairy books charm spell enchantment they express the arbitrariness of the fact and its mystery a tree grows fruit because it is a magic tree  water runs downhill because it is bewitched  the sun shines because it is bewitched       i deny altogether that this is fantastic or even mystical we may have some mysticism later on but this fairytale language about things is simply rational and agnostic  it is the only way i can express in words my clear and definite perception that one thing is quite distinct from another that there is no logical connection between flying and laying eggs  it is the man who talks about a law that he has never seen who is the mystic nay the ordinary scientific man is strictly a sentimentalist he is a sentimentalist in this essential sense that he is soaked and swept away by mere associations  he has so often seen birds fly and lay eggs that he feels as if there must be some dreamy tender connection between the two ideas whereas there is none a forlorn lover might be unable to dissociate the moon from lost love so the materialist is unable to dissociate the moon from the tide in both cases there is no connection except that one has seen them together  a sentimentalist might shed tears at the smell of appleblossom because by a dark association of his own it reminded him of his boyhood  so the materialist professor though he conceals his tears is yet a sentimentalist because by a dark association of his own appleblossoms remind him of apples  but the cool rationalist from fairyland does not see why in the abstract the apple tree should not grow crimson tulips it sometimes does in his country       this elementary wonder however is not a mere fancy derived from the fairy tales on the contrary all the fire of the fairy tales is derived from this  just as we all like love tales because there is an instinct of sex we all like astonishing tales because they touch the nerve of the ancient instinct of astonishment this is proved by the fact that when we are very young children we do not need fairy tales  we only need tales  mere life is interesting enough  a child of seven is excited by being told that tommy opened a door and saw a dragon  but a child of three is excited by being told that tommy opened a door  boys like romantic tales but babies like realistic talesbecause they find them romantic in fact a baby is about the only person i should think to whom a modern realistic novel could be read without boring him this proves that even nursery tales only echo an almost prenatal leap of interest and amazement  these tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they were green  they make rivers run with wine only to make us remember for one wild moment that they run with water  i have said that this is wholly reasonable and even agnostic  and indeed on this point i am all for the higher agnosticism its better name is ignorance we have all read in scientific books and indeed in all romances the story of the man who has forgotten his name  this man walks about the streets and can see and appreciate everything only he cannot remember who he is  well every man is that man in the story every man has forgotten who he is  one may understand the cosmos but never the ego the self is more distant than any star thou shalt love the lord thy god but thou shalt not know thyself we are all under the same mental calamity we have all forgotten our names  we have all forgotten what we really are  all that we call common sense and rationality and practicality and positivism only means that for certain dead levels of our life we forget that we have forgotten  all that we call spirit and art and ecstasy only means that for one awful instant we remember that we forget       but though like the man without memory in the novel we walk the streets with a sort of halfwitted admiration still it is admiration it is admiration in english and not only admiration in latin the wonder has a positive element of praise  this is the next milestone to be definitely marked on our road through fairyland i shall speak in the next chapter about optimists and pessimists in their intellectual aspect so far as they have one  here i am only trying to describe the enormous emotions which cannot be described and the strongest emotion was that life was as precious as it was puzzling  it was an ecstasy because it was an adventure it was an adventure because it was an opportunity  the goodness of the fairy tale was not affected by the fact that there might be more dragons than princesses it was good to be in a fairy tale the test of all happiness is gratitude and i felt grateful though i hardly knew to whom  children are grateful when santa claus puts in their stockings gifts of toys or sweets  could i not be grateful to santa claus when he put in my stockings the gift of two miraculous legs  we thank people for birthday presents of cigars and slippers  can i thank no one for the birthday present of birth       there were then these two first feelings indefensible and indisputable  the world was a shock but it was not merely shocking existence was a surprise but it was a pleasant surprise  in fact all my first views were exactly uttered in a riddle that stuck in my brain from boyhood  the question was what did the first frog say  and the answer was lord how you made me jump that says succinctly all that i am saying  god made the frog jump but the frog prefers jumping  but when these things are settled there enters the second great principle of the fairy philosophy       any one can see it who will simply read grimms fairy tales or the fine collections of mr andrew lang  for the pleasure of pedantry i will call it the doctrine of conditional joy touchstone talked of much virtue in an if according to elfin ethics all virtue is in an if  the note of the fairy utterance always is you may live in a palace of gold and sapphire if you do not say the word cow or you may live happily with the kings daughter if you do not show her an onion  the vision always hangs upon a veto all the dizzy and colossal things conceded depend upon one small thing withheld  all the wild and whirling things that are let loose depend upon one thing that is forbidden  mr wbyeats in his exquisite and piercing elfin poetry describes the elves as lawless they plunge in innocent anarchy on the unbridled horses of the air       ride on the crest of the dishevelled tide      and dance upon the mountains like a flame  it is a dreadful thing to say that mr wbyeats does not understand fairyland  but i do say it  he is an ironical irishman full of intellectual reactions  he is not stupid enough to understand fairyland  fairies prefer people of the yokel type like myself people who gape and grin and do as they are told mr yeats reads into elfland all the righteous insurrection of his own race  but the lawlessness of ireland is a christian lawlessness founded on reason and justice  the fenian is rebelling against something he understands only too well but the true citizen of fairyland is obeying something that he does not understand at all in the fairy tale an incomprehensible happiness rests upon an incomprehensible condition  a box is opened and all evils fly out a word is forgotten and cities perish  a lamp is lit and love flies away  a flower is plucked and human lives are forfeited an apple is eaten and the hope of god is gone       this is the tone of fairy tales and it is certainly not lawlessness or even liberty though men under a mean modern tyranny may think it liberty by comparison  people out of portland gaol might think fleet street free but closer study will prove that both fairies and journalists are the slaves of duty fairy godmothers seem at least as strict as other godmothers cinderella received a coach out of wonderland and a coachman out of nowhere but she received a commandwhich might have come out of brixtonthat she should be back by twelve  also she had a glass slipper and it cannot be a coincidence that glass is so common a substance in folklore this princess lives in a glass castle that princess on a glass hill this one sees all things in a mirror they may all live in glass houses if they will not throw stones for this thin glitter of glass everywhere is the expression of the fact that the happiness is bright but brittle like the substance most easily smashed by a housemaid or a cat  and this fairytale sentiment also sank into me and became my sentiment towards the whole world i felt and feel that life itself is as bright as the diamond but as brittle as the windowpane and when the heavens were compared to the terrible crystal i can remember a shudder i was afraid that god would drop the cosmos with a crash       remember however that to be breakable is not the same as to be perishable  strike a glass and it will not endure an instant simply do not strike it and it will endure a thousand years such it seemed was the joy of man either in elfland or on earth the happiness depended on not doing something which you could at any moment do and which very often it was not obvious why you should not do  now the point here is that to me this did not seem unjust if the millers third son said to the fairy explain why i must not stand on my head in the fairy palace the other might fairly reply well if it comes to that explain the fairy palace if cinderella says how is it that i must leave the ball at twelve her godmother might answer how is it that you are going there till twelve  if i leave a man in my will ten talking elephants and a hundred winged horses he cannot complain if the conditions partake of the slight eccentricity of the gift  he must not look a winged horse in the mouth  and it seemed to me that existence was itself so very eccentric a legacy that i could not complain of not understanding the limitations of the vision when i did not understand the vision they limited  the frame was no stranger than the picture  the veto might well be as wild as the vision it might be as startling as the sun as elusive as the waters as fantastic and terrible as the towering trees       for this reason we may call it the fairy godmother philosophy i never could join the young men of my time in feeling what they called the general sentiment of revolt  i should have resisted let us hope any rules that were evil and with these and their definition i shall deal in another chapter  but i did not feel disposed to resist any rule merely because it was mysterious estates are sometimes held by foolish forms the breaking of a stick or the payment of a peppercorn  i was willing to hold the huge estate of earth and heaven by any such feudal fantasy  it could not well be wilder than the fact that i was allowed to hold it at all at this stage i give only one ethical instance to show my meaning i could never mix in the common murmur of that rising generation against monogamy because no restriction on sex seemed so odd and unexpected as sex itself  to be allowed like endymion to make love to the moon and then to complain that jupiter kept his own moons in a harem seemed to me bred on fairy tales like endymions a vulgar anticlimax keeping to one woman is a small price for so much as seeing one woman  to complain that i could only be married once was like complaining that i had only been born once it was incommensurate with the terrible excitement of which one was talking  it showed not an exaggerated sensibility to sex but a curious insensibility to it  a man is a fool who complains that he cannot enter eden by five gates at once  polygamy is a lack of the realization of sex it is like a man plucking five pears in mere absence of mind  the aesthetes touched the last insane limits of language in their eulogy on lovely things  the thistledown made them weep a burnished beetle brought them to their knees yet their emotion never impressed me for an instant for this reason that it never occurred to them to pay for their pleasure in any sort of symbolic sacrifice  men i felt might fast forty days for the sake of hearing a blackbird sing  men might go through fire to find a cowslip  yet these lovers of beauty could not even keep sober for the blackbird  they would not go through common christian marriage by way of recompense to the cowslip  surely one might pay for extraordinary joy in ordinary morals  oscar wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets but oscar wilde was wrong we can pay for sunsets  we can pay for them by not being oscar wilde       well i left the fairy tales lying on the floor of the nursery and i have not found any books so sensible since  i left the nurse guardian of tradition and democracy and i have not found any modern type so sanely radical or so sanely conservative but the matter for important comment was here  that when i first went out into the mental atmosphere of the modern world i found that the modern world was positively opposed on two points to my nurse and to the nursery tales  it has taken me a long time to find out that the modern world is wrong and my nurse was right the really curious thing was this  that modern thought contradicted this basic creed of my boyhood on its two most essential doctrines i have explained that the fairy tales founded in me two convictions first that this world is a wild and startling place which might have been quite different but which is quite delightful second that before this wildness and delight one may well be modest and submit to the queerest limitations of so queer a kindness  but i found the whole modern world running like a high tide against both my tendernesses and the shock of that collision created two sudden and spontaneous sentiments which i have had ever since and which crude as they were have since hardened into convictions       first i found the whole modern world talking scientific fatalism saying that everything is as it must always have been being unfolded without fault from the beginning  the leaf on the tree is green because it could never have been anything else  now the fairytale philosopher is glad that the leaf is green precisely because it might have been scarlet  he feels as if it had turned green an instant before he looked at it  he is pleased that snow is white on the strictly reasonable ground that it might have been black every colour has in it a bold quality as of choice the red of garden roses is not only decisive but dramatic like suddenly spilt blood he feels that something has been done  but the great determinists of the nineteenth century were strongly against this native feeling that something had happened an instant before  in fact according to them nothing ever really had happened since the beginning of the world  nothing ever had happened since existence had happened and even about the date of that they were not very sure       the modern world as i found it was solid for modern calvinism for the necessity of things being as they are  but when i came to ask them i found they had really no proof of this unavoidable repetition in things except the fact that the things were repeated now the mere repetition made the things to me rather more weird than more rational  it was as if having seen a curiously shaped nose in the street and dismissed it as an accident i had then seen six other noses of the same astonishing shape  i should have fancied for a moment that it must be some local secret society so one elephant having a trunk was odd but all elephants having trunks looked like a plot  i speak here only of an emotion and of an emotion at once stubborn and subtle  but the repetition in nature seemed sometimes to be an excited repetition like that of an angry schoolmaster saying the same thing over and over again the grass seemed signalling to me with all its fingers at once the crowded stars seemed bent upon being understood  the sun would make me see him if he rose a thousand times  the recurrences of the universe rose to the maddening rhythm of an incantation and i began to see an idea       all the towering materialism which dominates the modern mind rests ultimately upon one assumption a false assumption  it is supposed that if a thing goes on repeating itself it is probably dead a piece of clockwork  people feel that if the universe was personal it would vary if the sun were alive it would dance  this is a fallacy even in relation to known fact  for the variation in human affairs is generally brought into them not by life but by death by the dying down or breaking off of their strength or desire a man varies his movements because of some slight element of failure or fatigue  he gets into an omnibus because he is tired of walking or he walks because he is tired of sitting still  but if his life and joy were so gigantic that he never tired of going to islington he might go to islington as regularly as the thames goes to sheerness the very speed and ecstasy of his life would have the stillness of death  the sun rises every morning  i do not rise every morning but the variation is due not to my activity but to my inaction now to put the matter in a popular phrase it might be true that the sun rises regularly because he never gets tired of rising his routine might be due not to a lifelessness but to a rush of life  the thing i mean can be seen for instance in children when they find some game or joke that they specially enjoy  a child kicks his legs rhythmically through excess not absence of life because children have abounding vitality because they are in spirit fierce and free therefore they want things repeated and unchanged they always say do it again and the grownup person does it again until he is nearly dead  for grownup people are not strong enough to exult in monotony  but perhaps god is strong enough to exult in monotony  it is possible that god says every morning do it again to the sun and every evening do it again to the moon it may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike it may be that god makes every daisy separately but has never got tired of making them  it may be that he has the eternal appetite of infancy for we have sinned and grown old and our father is younger than we the repetition in nature may not be a mere recurrence it may be a theatrical encore  heaven may encore the bird who laid an egg if the human being conceives and brings forth a human child instead of bringing forth a fish or a bat or a griffin the reason may not be that we are fixed in an animal fate without life or purpose it may be that our little tragedy has touched the gods that they admire it from their starry galleries and that at the end of every human drama man is called again and again before the curtain repetition may go on for millions of years by mere choice and at any instant it may stop  man may stand on the earth generation after generation and yet each birth be his positively last appearance       this was my first conviction made by the shock of my childish emotions meeting the modern creed in midcareer i had always vaguely felt facts to be miracles in the sense that they are wonderful now i began to think them miracles in the stricter sense that they were wilful  i mean that they were or might be repeated exercises of some will  in short i had always believed that the world involved magic  now i thought that perhaps it involved a magician and this pointed a profound emotion always present and subconscious that this world of ours has some purpose and if there is a purpose there is a person  i had always felt life first as a story and if there is a story there is a storyteller       but modern thought also hit my second human tradition it went against the fairy feeling about strict limits and conditions the one thing it loved to talk about was expansion and largeness herbert spencer would have been greatly annoyed if any one had called him an imperialist and therefore it is highly regrettable that nobody did  but he was an imperialist of the lowest type he popularized this contemptible notion that the size of the solar system ought to overawe the spiritual dogma of man  why should a man surrender his dignity to the solar system any more than to a whale  if mere size proves that man is not the image of god then a whale may be the image of god a somewhat formless image what one might call an impressionist portrait  it is quite futile to argue that man is small compared to the cosmos for man was always small compared to the nearest tree  but herbert spencer in his headlong imperialism would insist that we had in some way been conquered and annexed by the astronomical universe he spoke about men and their ideals exactly as the most insolent unionist talks about the irish and their ideals  he turned mankind into a small nationality  and his evil influence can be seen even in the most spirited and honourable of later scientific authors notably in the early romances of mr hgwells many moralists have in an exaggerated way represented the earth as wicked but mr wells and his school made the heavens wicked we should lift up our eyes to the stars from whence would come our ruin       but the expansion of which i speak was much more evil than all this i have remarked that the materialist like the madman is in prison in the prison of one thought  these people seemed to think it singularly inspiring to keep on saying that the prison was very large the size of this scientific universe gave one no novelty no relief the cosmos went on for ever but not in its wildest constellation could there be anything really interesting anything for instance such as forgiveness or free will  the grandeur or infinity of the secret of its cosmos added nothing to it  it was like telling a prisoner in reading gaol that he would be glad to hear that the gaol now covered half the county  the warder would have nothing to show the man except more and more long corridors of stone lit by ghastly lights and empty of all that is human so these expanders of the universe had nothing to show us except more and more infinite corridors of space lit by ghastly suns and empty of all that is divine       in fairyland there had been a real law a law that could be broken for the definition of a law is something that can be broken but the machinery of this cosmic prison was something that could not be broken for we ourselves were only a part of its machinery we were either unable to do things or we were destined to do them the idea of the mystical condition quite disappeared one can neither have the firmness of keeping laws nor the fun of breaking them the largeness of this universe had nothing of that freshness and airy outbreak which we have praised in the universe of the poet this modern universe is literally an empire that is it was vast but it is not free  one went into larger and larger windowless rooms rooms big with babylonian perspective but one never found the smallest window or a whisper of outer air       their infernal parallels seemed to expand with distance but for me all good things come to a point swords for instance so finding the boast of the big cosmos so unsatisfactory to my emotions i began to argue about it a little and i soon found that the whole attitude was even shallower than could have been expected according to these people the cosmos was one thing since it had one unbroken rule  only they would say while it is one thing it is also the only thing there is  why then should one worry particularly to call it large  there is nothing to compare it with it would be just as sensible to call it small  a man may say i like this vast cosmos with its throng of stars and its crowd of varied creatures  but if it comes to that why should not a man say i like this cosy little cosmos with its decent number of stars and as neat a provision of live stock as i wish to see one is as good as the other they are both mere sentiments it is mere sentiment to rejoice that the sun is larger than the earth it is quite as sane a sentiment to rejoice that the sun is no larger than it is  a man chooses to have an emotion about the largeness of the world why should he not choose to have an emotion about its smallness       it happened that i had that emotion  when one is fond of anything one addresses it by diminutives even if it is an elephant or a lifeguardsman the reason is that anything however huge that can be conceived of as complete can be conceived of as small if military moustaches did not suggest a sword or tusks a tail then the object would be vast because it would be immeasurable  but the moment you can imagine a guardsman you can imagine a small guardsman the moment you really see an elephant you can call it tiny if you can make a statue of a thing you can make a statuette of it these people professed that the universe was one coherent thing but they were not fond of the universe  but i was frightfully fond of the universe and wanted to address it by a diminutive  i often did so and it never seemed to mind  actually and in truth i did feel that these dim dogmas of vitality were better expressed by calling the world small than by calling it large  for about infinity there was a sort of carelessness which was the reverse of the fierce and pious care which i felt touching the pricelessness and the peril of life they showed only a dreary waste but i felt a sort of sacred thrift for economy is far more romantic than extravagance  to them stars were an unending income of halfpence but i felt about the golden sun and the silver moon as a schoolboy feels if he has one sovereign and one shilling       these subconscious convictions are best hit off by the colour and tone of certain tales  thus i have said that stories of magic alone can express my sense that life is not only a pleasure but a kind of eccentric privilege  i may express this other feeling of cosmic cosiness by allusion to another book always read in boyhood robinson crusoe which i read about this time and which owes its eternal vivacity to the fact that it celebrates the poetry of limits nay even the wild romance of prudence  crusoe is a man on a small rock with a few comforts just snatched from the sea the best thing in the book is simply the list of things saved from the wreck  the greatest of poems is an inventory  every kitchen tool becomes ideal because crusoe might have dropped it in the sea it is a good exercise in empty or ugly hours of the day to look at anything the coalscuttle or the bookcase and think how happy one could be to have brought it out of the sinking ship on to the solitary island  but it is a better exercise still to remember how all things have had this hairbreadth escape everything has been saved from a wreck  every man has had one horrible adventure  as a hidden untimely birth he had not been as infants that never see the light  men spoke much in my boyhood of restricted or ruined men of genius  and it was common to say that many a man was a great mighthavebeen to me it is a more solid and startling fact that any man in the street is a great mightnothavebeen       but i really felt the fancy may seem foolish as if all the order and number of things were the romantic remnant of crusoes ship that there are two sexes and one sun was like the fact that there were two guns and one axe  it was poignantly urgent that none should be lost but somehow it was rather fun that none could be added the trees and the planets seemed like things saved from the wreck and when i saw the matterhorn i was glad that it had not been overlooked in the confusion  i felt economical about the stars as if they were sapphires they are called so in miltons eden i hoarded the hills for the universe is a single jewel and while it is a natural cant to talk of a jewel as peerless and priceless of this jewel it is literally true  this cosmos is indeed without peer and without price for there cannot be another one       thus ends in unavoidable inadequacy the attempt to utter the unutterable things  these are my ultimate attitudes towards life the soils for the seeds of doctrine  these in some dark way i thought before i could write and felt before i could think that we may proceed more easily afterwards i will roughly recapitulate them now  i felt in my bones first that this world does not explain itself  it may be a miracle with a supernatural explanation it may be a conjuring trick with a natural explanation but the explanation of the conjuring trick if it is to satisfy me will have to be better than the natural explanations i have heard the thing is magic true or false  second i came to feel as if magic must have a meaning and meaning must have some one to mean it there was something personal in the world as in a work of art whatever it meant it meant violently  third i thought this purpose beautiful in its old design in spite of its defects such as dragons  fourth that the proper form of thanks to it is some form of humility and restraint  we should thank god for beer and burgundy by not drinking too much of them  we owed also an obedience to whatever made us  and last and strangest there had come into my mind a vague and vast impression that in some way all good was a remnant to be stored and held sacred out of some primordial ruin  man had saved his good as crusoe saved his goods he had saved them from a wreck  all this i felt and the age gave me no encouragement to feel it  and all this time i had not even thought of christian theology    v the flag of the world        when i was a boy there were two curious men running about who were called the optimist and the pessimist  i constantly used the words myself but i cheerfully confess that i never had any very special idea of what they meant  the only thing which might be considered evident was that they could not mean what they said for the ordinary verbal explanation was that the optimist thought this world as good as it could be while the pessimist thought it as bad as it could be  both these statements being obviously raving nonsense one had to cast about for other explanations an optimist could not mean a man who thought everything right and nothing wrong  for that is meaningless it is like calling everything right and nothing left  upon the whole i came to the conclusion that the optimist thought everything good except the pessimist and that the pessimist thought everything bad except himself it would be unfair to omit altogether from the list the mysterious but suggestive definition said to have been given by a little girl an optimist is a man who looks after your eyes and a pessimist is a man who looks after your feet  i am not sure that this is not the best definition of all  there is even a sort of allegorical truth in it  for there might perhaps be a profitable distinction drawn between that more dreary thinker who thinks merely of our contact with the earth from moment to moment and that happier thinker who considers rather our primary power of vision and of choice of road       but this is a deep mistake in this alternative of the optimist and the pessimist  the assumption of it is that a man criticises this world as if he were househunting as if he were being shown over a new suite of apartments  if a man came to this world from some other world in full possession of his powers he might discuss whether the advantage of midsummer woods made up for the disadvantage of mad dogs just as a man looking for lodgings might balance the presence of a telephone against the absence of a sea view but no man is in that position  a man belongs to this world before he begins to ask if it is nice to belong to it  he has fought for the flag and often won heroic victories for the flag long before he has ever enlisted  to put shortly what seems the essential matter he has a loyalty long before he has any admiration       in the last chapter it has been said that the primary feeling that this world is strange and yet attractive is best expressed in fairy tales  the reader may if he likes put down the next stage to that bellicose and even jingo literature which commonly comes next in the history of a boy  we all owe much sound morality to the penny dreadfuls  whatever the reason it seemed and still seems to me that our attitude towards life can be better expressed in terms of a kind of military loyalty than in terms of criticism and approval  my acceptance of the universe is not optimism it is more like patriotism  it is a matter of primary loyalty the world is not a lodginghouse at brighton which we are to leave because it is miserable  it is the fortress of our family with the flag flying on the turret and the more miserable it is the less we should leave it  the point is not that this world is too sad to love or too glad not to love the point is that when you do love a thing its gladness is a reason for loving it and its sadness a reason for loving it more  all optimistic thoughts about england and all pessimistic thoughts about her are alike reasons for the english patriot  similarly optimism and pessimism are alike arguments for the cosmic patriot       let us suppose we are confronted with a desperate thingsay pimlico  if we think what is really best for pimlico we shall find the thread of thought leads to the throne or the mystic and the arbitrary  it is not enough for a man to disapprove of pimlico in that case he will merely cut his throat or move to chelsea nor certainly is it enough for a man to approve of pimlico for then it will remain pimlico which would be awful the only way out of it seems to be for somebody to love pimlico to love it with a transcendental tie and without any earthly reason if there arose a man who loved pimlico then pimlico would rise into ivory towers and golden pinnacles pimlico would attire herself as a woman does when she is loved  for decoration is not given to hide horrible things but to decorate things already adorable a mother does not give her child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it  a lover does not give a girl a necklace to hide her neck if men loved pimlico as mothers love children arbitrarily because it is theirs pimlico in a year or two might be fairer than florence some readers will say that this is a mere fantasy  i answer that this is the actual history of mankind  this as a fact is how cities did grow great  go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well  people first paid honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it  men did not love rome because she was great she was great because they had loved her       the eighteenthcentury theories of the social contract have been exposed to much clumsy criticism in our time in so far as they meant that there is at the back of all historic government an idea of content and cooperation they were demonstrably right but they really were wrong in so far as they suggested that men had ever aimed at order or ethics directly by a conscious exchange of interests  morality did not begin by one man saying to another i will not hit you if you do not hit me there is no trace of such a transaction  there is a trace of both men having said we must not hit each other in the holy place  they gained their morality by guarding their religion  they did not cultivate courage they fought for the shrine and found they had become courageous they did not cultivate cleanliness  they purified themselves for the altar and found that they were clean  the history of the jews is the only early document known to most englishmen and the facts can be judged sufficiently from that  the ten commandments which have been found substantially common to mankind were merely military commands a code of regimental orders issued to protect a certain ark across a certain desert  anarchy was evil because it endangered the sanctity and only when they made a holy day for god did they find they had made a holiday for men       if it be granted that this primary devotion to a place or thing is a source of creative energy we can pass on to a very peculiar fact let us reiterate for an instant that the only right optimism is a sort of universal patriotism  what is the matter with the pessimist i think it can be stated by saying that he is the cosmic antipatriot and what is the matter with the antipatriot i think it can be stated without undue bitterness by saying that he is the candid friend and what is the matter with the candid friend  there we strike the rock of real life and immutable human nature       i venture to say that what is bad in the candid friend is simply that he is not candid  he is keeping something back his own gloomy pleasure in saying unpleasant things  he has a secret desire to hurt not merely to help  this is certainly i think what makes a certain sort of antipatriot irritating to healthy citizens  i do not speak of course of the antipatriotism which only irritates feverish stockbrokers and gushing actresses that is only patriotism speaking plainly  a man who says that no patriot should attack the boer war until it is over is not worth answering intelligently he is saying that no good son should warn his mother off a cliff until she has fallen over it but there is an antipatriot who honestly angers honest men and the explanation of him is i think what i have suggested he is the uncandid candid friend the man who says i am sorry to say we are ruined and is not sorry at all  and he may be said without rhetoric to be a traitor for he is using that ugly knowledge which was allowed him to strengthen the army to discourage people from joining it  because he is allowed to be pessimistic as a military adviser he is being pessimistic as a recruiting sergeant just in the same way the pessimist who is the cosmic antipatriot uses the freedom that life allows to her counsellors to lure away the people from her flag  granted that he states only facts it is still essential to know what are his emotions what is his motive it may be that twelve hundred men in tottenham are down with smallpox but we want to know whether this is stated by some great philosopher who wants to curse the gods or only by some common clergyman who wants to help the men       the evil of the pessimist is then not that he chastises gods and men but that he does not love what he chastiseshe has not this primary and supernatural loyalty to things  what is the evil of the man commonly called an optimist  obviously it is felt that the optimist wishing to defend the honour of this world will defend the indefensible  he is the jingo of the universe he will say my cosmos right or wrong  he will be less inclined to the reform of things more inclined to a sort of frontbench official answer to all attacks soothing every one with assurances he will not wash the world but whitewash the world  all this which is true of a type of optimist leads us to the one really interesting point of psychology which could not be explained without it       we say there must be a primal loyalty to life  the only question is shall it be a natural or a supernatural loyalty if you like to put it so shall it be a reasonable or an unreasonable loyalty  now the extraordinary thing is that the bad optimism the whitewashing the weak defence of everything comes in with the reasonable optimism  rational optimism leads to stagnation  it is irrational optimism that leads to reform let me explain by using once more the parallel of patriotism the man who is most likely to ruin the place he loves is exactly the man who loves it with a reason  the man who will improve the place is the man who loves it without a reason  if a man loves some feature of pimlico which seems unlikely he may find himself defending that feature against pimlico itself  but if he simply loves pimlico itself he may lay it waste and turn it into the new jerusalem i do not deny that reform may be excessive i only say that it is the mystic patriot who reforms  mere jingo selfcontentment is commonest among those who have some pedantic reason for their patriotism the worst jingoes do not love england but a theory of england if we love england for being an empire we may overrate the success with which we rule the hindoos  but if we love it only for being a nation we can face all events  for it would be a nation even if the hindoos ruled us  thus also only those will permit their patriotism to falsify history whose patriotism depends on history a man who loves england for being english will not mind how she arose but a man who loves england for being anglosaxon may go against all facts for his fancy  he may end like carlyle and freeman by maintaining that the norman conquest was a saxon conquest he may end in utter unreasonbecause he has a reason  a man who loves france for being military will palliate the army of 1870 but a man who loves france for being france will improve the army of 1870  this is exactly what the french have done and france is a good instance of the working paradox  nowhere else is patriotism more purely abstract and arbitrary and nowhere else is reform more drastic and sweeping  the more transcendental is your patriotism the more practical are your politics       perhaps the most everyday instance of this point is in the case of women and their strange and strong loyalty  some stupid people started the idea that because women obviously back up their own people through everything therefore women are blind and do not see anything  they can hardly have known any women  the same women who are ready to defend their men through thick and thin are in their personal intercourse with the man almost morbidly lucid about the thinness of his excuses or the thickness of his head a mans friend likes him but leaves him as he is  his wife loves him and is always trying to turn him into somebody else  women who are utter mystics in their creed are utter cynics in their criticism thackeray expressed this well when he made pendennis mother who worshipped her son as a god yet assume that he would go wrong as a man  she underrated his virtue though she overrated his value the devotee is entirely free to criticise the fanatic can safely be a sceptic  love is not blind that is the last thing that it is love is bound and the more it is bound the less it is blind       this at least had come to be my position about all that was called optimism pessimism and improvement  before any cosmic act of reform we must have a cosmic oath of allegiance a man must be interested in life then he could be disinterested in his views of it  my son give me thy heart the heart must be fixed on the right thing  the moment we have a fixed heart we have a free hand  i must pause to anticipate an obvious criticism it will be said that a rational person accepts the world as mixed of good and evil with a decent satisfaction and a decent endurance but this is exactly the attitude which i maintain to be defective it is i know very common in this age it was perfectly put in those quiet lines of matthew arnold which are more piercingly blasphemous than the shrieks of schopenhauer  enough we liveand if a life with large results so little rife though bearable seem hardly worth this pomp of worlds this pain of birth       i know this feeling fills our epoch and i think it freezes our epoch  for our titanic purposes of faith and revolution what we need is not the cold acceptance of the world as a compromise but some way in which we can heartily hate and heartily love it we do not want joy and anger to neutralize each other and produce a surly contentment we want a fiercer delight and a fiercer discontent we have to feel the universe at once as an ogres castle to be stormed and yet as our own cottage to which we can return at evening       no one doubts that an ordinary man can get on with this world but we demand not strength enough to get on with it but strength enough to get it on  can he hate it enough to change it and yet love it enough to think it worth changing  can he look up at its colossal good without once feeling acquiescence can he look up at its colossal evil without once feeling despair can he in short be at once not only a pessimist and an optimist but a fanatical pessimist and a fanatical optimist  is he enough of a pagan to die for the world and enough of a christian to die to it in this combination i maintain it is the rational optimist who fails the irrational optimist who succeeds  he is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself       i put these things not in their mature logical sequence but as they came  and this view was cleared and sharpened by an accident of the time  under the lengthening shadow of ibsen an argument arose whether it was not a very nice thing to murder ones self grave moderns told us that we must not even say poor fellow of a man who had blown his brains out since he was an enviable person and had only blown them out because of their exceptional excellence mr william archer even suggested that in the golden age there would be pennyintheslot machines by which a man could kill himself for a penny  in all this i found myself utterly hostile to many who called themselves liberal and humane  not only is suicide a sin it is the sin  it is the ultimate and absolute evil the refusal to take an interest in existence the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life  the man who kills a man kills a man the man who kills himself kills all men as far as he is concerned he wipes out the world  his act is worse symbolically considered than any rape or dynamite outrage  for it destroys all buildings it insults all women  the thief is satisfied with diamonds but the suicide is not  that is his crime  he cannot be bribed even by the blazing stones of the celestial city  the thief compliments the things he steals if not the owner of them but the suicide insults everything on earth by not stealing it he defiles every flower by refusing to live for its sake there is not a tiny creature in the cosmos at whom his death is not a sneer  when a man hangs himself on a tree the leaves might fall off in anger and the birds fly away in fury for each has received a personal affront  of course there may be pathetic emotional excuses for the act  there often are for rape and there almost always are for dynamite  but if it comes to clear ideas and the intelligent meaning of things then there is much more rational and philosophic truth in the burial at the crossroads and the stake driven through the body than in mr archers suicidal automatic machines  there is a meaning in burying the suicide apart the mans crime is different from other crimesfor it makes even crimes impossible       about the same time i read a solemn flippancy by some free thinker he said that a suicide was only the same as a martyr  the open fallacy of this helped to clear the question  obviously a suicide is the opposite of a martyr  a martyr is a man who cares so much for something outside him that he forgets his own personal life a suicide is a man who cares so little for anything outside him that he wants to see the last of everything  one wants something to begin  the other wants everything to end  in other words the martyr is noble exactly because however he renounces the world or execrates all humanity he confesses this ultimate link with life he sets his heart outside himself  he dies that something may live the suicide is ignoble because he has not this link with being he is a mere destroyer spiritually he destroys the universe and then i remembered the stake and the crossroads and the queer fact that christianity had shown this weird harshness to the suicide for christianity had shown a wild encouragement of the martyr historic christianity was accused not entirely without reason of carrying martyrdom and asceticism to a point desolate and pessimistic  the early christian martyrs talked of death with a horrible happiness  they blasphemed the beautiful duties of the body  they smelt the grave afar off like a field of flowers all this has seemed to many the very poetry of pessimism  yet there is the stake at the crossroads to show what christianity thought of the pessimist       this was the first of the long train of enigmas with which christianity entered the discussion  and there went with it a peculiarity of which i shall have to speak more markedly as a note of all christian notions but which distinctly began in this one the christian attitude to the martyr and the suicide was not what is so often affirmed in modern morals  it was not a matter of degree it was not that a line must be drawn somewhere and that the selfslayer in exaltation fell within the line the selfslayer in sadness just beyond it  the christian feeling evidently was not merely that the suicide was carrying martyrdom too far the christian feeling was furiously for one and furiously against the other  these two things that looked so much alike were at opposite ends of heaven and hell  one man flung away his life he was so good that his dry bones could heal cities in pestilence another man flung away life he was so bad that his bones would pollute his brethrens i am not saying this fierceness was right but why was it so fierce       here it was that i first found that my wandering feet were in some beaten track  christianity had also felt this opposition of the martyr to the suicide  had it perhaps felt it for the same reason  had christianity felt what i felt but could not and cannot expressthis need for a first loyalty to things and then for a ruinous reform of things  then i remembered that it was actually the charge against christianity that it combined these two things which i was wildly trying to combine christianity was accused at one and the same time of being too optimistic about the universe and of being too pessimistic about the world  the coincidence made me suddenly stand still       an imbecile habit has arisen in modern controversy of saying that such and such a creed can be held in one age but cannot be held in another  some dogma we are told was credible in the twelfth century but is not credible in the twentieth you might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed on mondays but cannot be believed on tuesdays  you might as well say of a view of the cosmos that it was suitable to halfpast three but not suitable to halfpast four  what a man can believe depends upon his philosophy not upon the clock or the century if a man believes in unalterable natural law he cannot believe in any miracle in any age  if a man believes in a will behind law he can believe in any miracle in any age  suppose for the sake of argument we are concerned with a case of thaumaturgic healing a materialist of the twelfth century could not believe it any more than a materialist of the twentieth century  but a christian scientist of the twentieth century can believe it as much as a christian of the twelfth century  it is simply a matter of a mans theory of things  therefore in dealing with any historical answer the point is not whether it was given in our time but whether it was given in answer to our question  and the more i thought about when and how christianity had come into the world the more i felt that it had actually come to answer this question       it is commonly the loose and latitudinarian christians who pay quite indefensible compliments to christianity  they talk as if there had never been any piety or pity until christianity came a point on which any mediaeval would have been eager to correct them they represent that the remarkable thing about christianity was that it was the first to preach simplicity or selfrestraint or inwardness and sincerity  they will think me very narrow whatever that means if i say that the remarkable thing about christianity was that it was the first to preach christianity  its peculiarity was that it was peculiar and simplicity and sincerity are not peculiar but obvious ideals for all mankind  christianity was the answer to a riddle not the last truism uttered after a long talk only the other day i saw in an excellent weekly paper of puritan tone this remark that christianity when stripped of its armour of dogma as who should speak of a man stripped of his armour of bones turned out to be nothing but the quaker doctrine of the inner light now if i were to say that christianity came into the world specially to destroy the doctrine of the inner light that would be an exaggeration  but it would be very much nearer to the truth the last stoics like marcus aurelius were exactly the people who did believe in the inner light  their dignity their weariness their sad external care for others their incurable internal care for themselves were all due to the inner light and existed only by that dismal illumination  notice that marcus aurelius insists as such introspective moralists always do upon small things done or undone it is because he has not hate or love enough to make a moral revolution  he gets up early in the morning just as our own aristocrats living the simple life get up early in the morning because such altruism is much easier than stopping the games of the amphitheatre or giving the english people back their land marcus aurelius is the most intolerable of human types  he is an unselfish egoist  an unselfish egoist is a man who has pride without the excuse of passion  of all conceivable forms of enlightenment the worst is what these people call the inner light  of all horrible religions the most horrible is the worship of the god within any one who knows any body knows how it would work any one who knows any one from the higher thought centre knows how it does work that jones shall worship the god within him turns out ultimately to mean that jones shall worship jones  let jones worship the sun or moon anything rather than the inner light let jones worship cats or crocodiles if he can find any in his street but not the god within  christianity came into the world firstly in order to assert with violence that a man had not only to look inwards but to look outwards to behold with astonishment and enthusiasm a divine company and a divine captain  the only fun of being a christian was that a man was not left alone with the inner light but definitely recognized an outer light fair as the sun clear as the moon terrible as an army with banners       all the same it will be as well if jones does not worship the sun and moon  if he does there is a tendency for him to imitate them to say that because the sun burns insects alive he may burn insects alive  he thinks that because the sun gives people sunstroke he may give his neighbour measles  he thinks that because the moon is said to drive men mad he may drive his wife mad  this ugly side of mere external optimism had also shown itself in the ancient world about the time when the stoic idealism had begun to show the weaknesses of pessimism the old nature worship of the ancients had begun to show the enormous weaknesses of optimism  nature worship is natural enough while the society is young or in other words pantheism is all right as long as it is the worship of pan but nature has another side which experience and sin are not slow in finding out and it is no flippancy to say of the god pan that he soon showed the cloven hoof  the only objection to natural religion is that somehow it always becomes unnatural  a man loves nature in the morning for her innocence and amiability and at nightfall if he is loving her still it is for her darkness and her cruelty he washes at dawn in clear water as did the wise man of the stoics yet somehow at the dark end of the day he is bathing in hot bulls blood as did julian the apostate  the mere pursuit of health always leads to something unhealthy  physical nature must not be made the direct object of obedience it must be enjoyed not worshipped  stars and mountains must not be taken seriously if they are we end where the pagan nature worship ended because the earth is kind we can imitate all her cruelties because sexuality is sane we can all go mad about sexuality mere optimism had reached its insane and appropriate termination the theory that everything was good had become an orgy of everything that was bad       on the other side our idealist pessimists were represented by the old remnant of the stoics  marcus aurelius and his friends had really given up the idea of any god in the universe and looked only to the god within  they had no hope of any virtue in nature and hardly any hope of any virtue in society  they had not enough interest in the outer world really to wreck or revolutionise it they did not love the city enough to set fire to it  thus the ancient world was exactly in our own desolate dilemma  the only people who really enjoyed this world were busy breaking it up and the virtuous people did not care enough about them to knock them down  in this dilemma the same as ours christianity suddenly stepped in and offered a singular answer which the world eventually accepted as the answer  it was the answer then and i think it is the answer now       this answer was like the slash of a sword it sundered it did not in any sense sentimentally unite  briefly it divided god from the cosmos  that transcendence and distinctness of the deity which some christians now want to remove from christianity was really the only reason why any one wanted to be a christian it was the whole point of the christian answer to the unhappy pessimist and the still more unhappy optimist  as i am here only concerned with their particular problem i shall indicate only briefly this great metaphysical suggestion  all descriptions of the creating or sustaining principle in things must be metaphorical because they must be verbal  thus the pantheist is forced to speak of god in all things as if he were in a box  thus the evolutionist has in his very name the idea of being unrolled like a carpet all terms religious and irreligious are open to this charge the only question is whether all terms are useless or whether one can with such a phrase cover a distinct idea about the origin of things i think one can and so evidently does the evolutionist or he would not talk about evolution  and the root phrase for all christian theism was this that god was a creator as an artist is a creator a poet is so separate from his poem that he himself speaks of it as a little thing he has thrown off  even in giving it forth he has flung it away  this principle that all creation and procreation is a breaking off is at least as consistent through the cosmos as the evolutionary principle that all growth is a branching out  a woman loses a child even in having a child  all creation is separation birth is as solemn a parting as death       it was the prime philosophic principle of christianity that this divorce in the divine act of making such as severs the poet from the poem or the mother from the newborn child was the true description of the act whereby the absolute energy made the world according to most philosophers god in making the world enslaved it according to christianity in making it he set it free god had written not so much a poem but rather a play a play he had planned as perfect but which had necessarily been left to human actors and stagemanagers who had since made a great mess of it i will discuss the truth of this theorem later  here i have only to point out with what a startling smoothness it passed the dilemma we have discussed in this chapter  in this way at least one could be both happy and indignant without degrading ones self to be either a pessimist or an optimist  on this system one could fight all the forces of existence without deserting the flag of existence one could be at peace with the universe and yet be at war with the world  st george could still fight the dragon however big the monster bulked in the cosmos though he were bigger than the mighty cities or bigger than the everlasting hills  if he were as big as the world he could yet be killed in the name of the world st george had not to consider any obvious odds or proportions in the scale of things but only the original secret of their design he can shake his sword at the dragon even if it is everything even if the empty heavens over his head are only the huge arch of its open jaws       and then followed an experience impossible to describe it was as if i had been blundering about since my birth with two huge and unmanageable machines of different shapes and without apparent connectionthe world and the christian tradition i had found this hole in the world  the fact that one must somehow find a way of loving the world without trusting it somehow one must love the world without being worldly  i found this projecting feature of christian theology like a sort of hard spike the dogmatic insistence that god was personal and had made a world separate from himself  the spike of dogma fitted exactly into the hole in the worldit had evidently been meant to go there and then the strange thing began to happen  when once these two parts of the two machines had come together one after another all the other parts fitted and fell in with an eerie exactitude i could hear bolt after bolt over all the machinery falling into its place with a kind of click of relief  having got one part right all the other parts were repeating that rectitude as clock after clock strikes noon  instinct after instinct was answered by doctrine after doctrine  or to vary the metaphor i was like one who had advanced into a hostile country to take one high fortress  and when that fort had fallen the whole country surrendered and turned solid behind me  the whole land was lit up as it were back to the first fields of my childhood  all those blind fancies of boyhood which in the fourth chapter i have tried in vain to trace on the darkness became suddenly transparent and sane i was right when i felt that roses were red by some sort of choice it was the divine choice  i was right when i felt that i would almost rather say that grass was the wrong colour than say it must by necessity have been that colour  it might verily have been any other  my sense that happiness hung on the crazy thread of a condition did mean something when all was said  it meant the whole doctrine of the fall  even those dim and shapeless monsters of notions which i have not been able to describe much less defend stepped quietly into their places like colossal caryatides of the creed  the fancy that the cosmos was not vast and void but small and cosy had a fulfilled significance now for anything that is a work of art must be small in the sight of the artist to god the stars might be only small and dear like diamonds and my haunting instinct that somehow good was not merely a tool to be used but a relic to be guarded like the goods from crusoes ship even that had been the wild whisper of something originally wise for according to christianity we were indeed the survivors of a wreck the crew of a golden ship that had gone down before the beginning of the world       but the important matter was this that it entirely reversed the reason for optimism  and the instant the reversal was made it felt like the abrupt ease when a bone is put back in the socket i had often called myself an optimist to avoid the too evident blasphemy of pessimism  but all the optimism of the age had been false and disheartening for this reason that it had always been trying to prove that we fit in to the world  the christian optimism is based on the fact that we do not fit in to the world i had tried to be happy by telling myself that man is an animal like any other which sought its meat from god  but now i really was happy for i had learnt that man is a monstrosity  i had been right in feeling all things as odd for i myself was at once worse and better than all things  the optimists pleasure was prosaic for it dwelt on the naturalness of everything the christian pleasure was poetic for it dwelt on the unnaturalness of everything in the light of the supernatural  the modern philosopher had told me again and again that i was in the right place and i had still felt depressed even in acquiescence  but i had heard that i was in the wrong place and my soul sang for joy like a bird in spring the knowledge found out and illuminated forgotten chambers in the dark house of infancy  i knew now why grass had always seemed to me as queer as the green beard of a giant and why i could feel homesick at home    vi the paradoxes of christianity        the real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world nor even that it is a reasonable one  the commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable but not quite life is not an illogicality yet it is a trap for logicians it looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is its exactitude is obvious but its inexactitude is hidden its wildness lies in wait  i give one coarse instance of what i mean suppose some mathematical creature from the moon were to reckon up the human body he would at once see that the essential thing about it was that it was duplicate  a man is two men he on the right exactly resembling him on the left  having noted that there was an arm on the right and one on the left a leg on the right and one on the left he might go further and still find on each side the same number of fingers the same number of toes twin eyes twin ears twin nostrils and even twin lobes of the brain at last he would take it as a law and then where he found a heart on one side would deduce that there was another heart on the other and just then where he most felt he was right he would be wrong       it is this silent swerving from accuracy by an inch that is the uncanny element in everything  it seems a sort of secret treason in the universe  an apple or an orange is round enough to get itself called round and yet is not round after all the earth itself is shaped like an orange in order to lure some simple astronomer into calling it a globe  a blade of grass is called after the blade of a sword because it comes to a point but it doesnt everywhere in things there is this element of the quiet and incalculable  it escapes the rationalists but it never escapes till the last moment  from the grand curve of our earth it could easily be inferred that every inch of it was thus curved it would seem rational that as a man has a brain on both sides he should have a heart on both sides  yet scientific men are still organizing expeditions to find the north pole because they are so fond of flat country  scientific men are also still organizing expeditions to find a mans heart and when they try to find it they generally get on the wrong side of him       now actual insight or inspiration is best tested by whether it guesses these hidden malformations or surprises  if our mathematician from the moon saw the two arms and the two ears he might deduce the two shoulderblades and the two halves of the brain  but if he guessed that the mans heart was in the right place then i should call him something more than a mathematician  now this is exactly the claim which i have since come to propound for christianity not merely that it deduces logical truths but that when it suddenly becomes illogical it has found so to speak an illogical truth it not only goes right about things but it goes wrong if one may say so exactly where the things go wrong  its plan suits the secret irregularities and expects the unexpected  it is simple about the simple truth but it is stubborn about the subtle truth it will admit that a man has two hands it will not admit though all the modernists wail to it the obvious deduction that he has two hearts it is my only purpose in this chapter to point this out to show that whenever we feel there is something odd in christian theology we shall generally find that there is something odd in the truth       i have alluded to an unmeaning phrase to the effect that such and such a creed cannot be believed in our age  of course anything can be believed in any age  but oddly enough there really is a sense in which a creed if it is believed at all can be believed more fixedly in a complex society than in a simple one if a man finds christianity true in birmingham he has actually clearer reasons for faith than if he had found it true in mercia  for the more complicated seems the coincidence the less it can be a coincidence if snowflakes fell in the shape say of the heart of midlothian it might be an accident  but if snowflakes fell in the exact shape of the maze at hampton court i think one might call it a miracle it is exactly as of such a miracle that i have since come to feel of the philosophy of christianity  the complication of our modern world proves the truth of the creed more perfectly than any of the plain problems of the ages of faith  it was in notting hill and battersea that i began to see that christianity was true this is why the faith has that elaboration of doctrines and details which so much distresses those who admire christianity without believing in it  when once one believes in a creed one is proud of its complexity as scientists are proud of the complexity of science  it shows how rich it is in discoveries  if it is right at all it is a compliment to say that its elaborately right a stick might fit a hole or a stone a hollow by accident but a key and a lock are both complex  and if a key fits a lock you know it is the right key       but this involved accuracy of the thing makes it very difficult to do what i now have to do to describe this accumulation of truth it is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced  it is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced  he is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing and he can expound it but a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it  he is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it  and the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up  thus if one asked an ordinary intelligent man on the spur of the moment why do you prefer civilization to savagery he would look wildly round at object after object and would only be able to answer vaguely why there is that bookcase    and the coals in the coalscuttle    and pianos    and policemen the whole case for civilization is that the case for it is complex it has done so many things  but that very multiplicity of proof which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible       there is therefore about all complete conviction a kind of huge helplessness  the belief is so big that it takes a long time to get it into action  and this hesitation chiefly arises oddly enough from an indifference about where one should begin all roads lead to rome which is one reason why many people never get there  in the case of this defence of the christian conviction i confess that i would as soon begin the argument with one thing as another i would begin it with a turnip or a taximeter cab but if i am to be at all careful about making my meaning clear it will i think be wiser to continue the current arguments of the last chapter which was concerned to urge the first of these mystical coincidences or rather ratifications  all i had hitherto heard of christian theology had alienated me from it i was a pagan at the age of twelve and a complete agnostic by the age of sixteen and i cannot understand any one passing the age of seventeen without having asked himself so simple a question i did indeed retain a cloudy reverence for a cosmic deity and a great historical interest in the founder of christianity but i certainly regarded him as a man though perhaps i thought that even in that point he had an advantage over some of his modern critics i read the scientific and sceptical literature of my timeall of it at least that i could find written in english and lying about and i read nothing else i mean i read nothing else on any other note of philosophy  the penny dreadfuls which i also read were indeed in a healthy and heroic tradition of christianity but i did not know this at the time  i never read a line of christian apologetics  i read as little as i can of them now it was huxley and herbert spencer and bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology  they sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt  our grandmothers were quite right when they said that tom paine and the freethinkers unsettled the mind  they do they unsettled mine horribly  the rationalist made me question whether reason was of any use whatever and when i had finished herbert spencer i had got as far as doubting for the first time whether evolution had occurred at all  as i laid down the last of colonel ingersolls atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke across my mind almost thou persuadest me to be a christian  i was in a desperate way       this odd effect of the great agnostics in arousing doubts deeper than their own might be illustrated in many ways i take only one  as i read and reread all the nonchristian or antichristian accounts of the faith from huxley to bradlaugh a slow and awful impression grew gradually but graphically upon my mindthe impression that christianity must be a most extraordinary thing  for not only as i understood had christianity the most flaming vices but it had apparently a mystical talent for combining vices which seemed inconsistent with each other it was attacked on all sides and for all contradictory reasons no sooner had one rationalist demonstrated that it was too far to the east than another demonstrated with equal clearness that it was much too far to the west  no sooner had my indignation died down at its angular and aggressive squareness than i was called up again to notice and condemn its enervating and sensual roundness in case any reader has not come across the thing i mean i will give such instances as i remember at random of this selfcontradiction in the sceptical attack  i give four or five of them there are fifty more       thus for instance i was much moved by the eloquent attack on christianity as a thing of inhuman gloom for i thought and still think sincere pessimism the unpardonable sin insincere pessimism is a social accomplishment rather agreeable than otherwise and fortunately nearly all pessimism is insincere but if christianity was as these people said a thing purely pessimistic and opposed to life then i was quite prepared to blow up st pauls cathedral  but the extraordinary thing is this they did prove to me in chapter i to my complete satisfaction that christianity was too pessimistic and then in chapter ii they began to prove to me that it was a great deal too optimistic one accusation against christianity was that it prevented men by morbid tears and terrors from seeking joy and liberty in the bosom of nature  but another accusation was that it comforted men with a fictitious providence and put them in a pinkandwhite nursery one great agnostic asked why nature was not beautiful enough and why it was hard to be free  another great agnostic objected that christian optimism the garment of makebelieve woven by pious hands hid from us the fact that nature was ugly and that it was impossible to be free  one rationalist had hardly done calling christianity a nightmare before another began to call it a fools paradise  this puzzled me the charges seemed inconsistent christianity could not at once be the black mask on a white world and also the white mask on a black world  the state of the christian could not be at once so comfortable that he was a coward to cling to it and so uncomfortable that he was a fool to stand it if it falsified human vision it must falsify it one way or another it could not wear both green and rosecoloured spectacles i rolled on my tongue with a terrible joy as did all young men of that time the taunts which swinburne hurled at the dreariness of the creed       thou hast conquered o pale galilaean the world has grown gray with thy breath  but when i read the same poets accounts of paganism as in atalanta i gathered that the world was if possible more gray before the galilean breathed on it than afterwards the poet maintained indeed in the abstract that life itself was pitch dark  and yet somehow christianity had darkened it the very man who denounced christianity for pessimism was himself a pessimist  i thought there must be something wrong  and it did for one wild moment cross my mind that perhaps those might not be the very best judges of the relation of religion to happiness who by their own account had neither one nor the other       it must be understood that i did not conclude hastily that the accusations were false or the accusers fools  i simply deduced that christianity must be something even weirder and wickeder than they made out  a thing might have these two opposite vices but it must be a rather queer thing if it did  a man might be too fat in one place and too thin in another but he would be an odd shape at this point my thoughts were only of the odd shape of the christian religion i did not allege any odd shape in the rationalistic mind       here is another case of the same kind  i felt that a strong case against christianity lay in the charge that there is something timid monkish and unmanly about all that is called christian especially in its attitude towards resistance and fighting the great sceptics of the nineteenth century were largely virile bradlaugh in an expansive way huxley in a reticent way were decidedly men  in comparison it did seem tenable that there was something weak and over patient about christian counsels the gospel paradox about the other cheek the fact that priests never fought a hundred things made plausible the accusation that christianity was an attempt to make a man too like a sheep i read it and believed it and if i had read nothing different i should have gone on believing it  but i read something very different i turned the next page in my agnostic manual and my brain turned upside down  now i found that i was to hate christianity not for fighting too little but for fighting too much  christianity it seemed was the mother of wars  christianity had deluged the world with blood i had got thoroughly angry with the christian because he never was angry  and now i was told to be angry with him because his anger had been the most huge and horrible thing in human history because his anger had soaked the earth and smoked to the sun the very people who reproached christianity with the meekness and nonresistance of the monasteries were the very people who reproached it also with the violence and valour of the crusades  it was the fault of poor old christianity somehow or other both that edward the confessor did not fight and that richard coeur de leon did the quakers we were told were the only characteristic christians and yet the massacres of cromwell and alva were characteristic christian crimes  what could it all mean  what was this christianity which always forbade war and always produced wars  what could be the nature of the thing which one could abuse first because it would not fight and second because it was always fighting in what world of riddles was born this monstrous murder and this monstrous meekness  the shape of christianity grew a queerer shape every instant       i take a third case the strangest of all because it involves the one real objection to the faith  the one real objection to the christian religion is simply that it is one religion  the world is a big place full of very different kinds of people  christianity it may reasonably be said is one thing confined to one kind of people it began in palestine it has practically stopped with europe i was duly impressed with this argument in my youth and i was much drawn towards the doctrine often preached in ethical societies i mean the doctrine that there is one great unconscious church of all humanity founded on the omnipresence of the human conscience creeds it was said divided men but at least morals united them the soul might seek the strangest and most remote lands and ages and still find essential ethical common sense  it might find confucius under eastern trees and he would be writing thou shalt not steal  it might decipher the darkest hieroglyphic on the most primeval desert and the meaning when deciphered would be little boys should tell the truth  i believed this doctrine of the brotherhood of all men in the possession of a moral sense and i believe it stillwith other things  and i was thoroughly annoyed with christianity for suggesting as i supposed that whole ages and empires of men had utterly escaped this light of justice and reason  but then i found an astonishing thing i found that the very people who said that mankind was one church from plato to emerson were the very people who said that morality had changed altogether and that what was right in one age was wrong in another  if i asked say for an altar i was told that we needed none for men our brothers gave us clear oracles and one creed in their universal customs and ideals  but if i mildly pointed out that one of mens universal customs was to have an altar then my agnostic teachers turned clean round and told me that men had always been in darkness and the superstitions of savages i found it was their daily taunt against christianity that it was the light of one people and had left all others to die in the dark but i also found that it was their special boast for themselves that science and progress were the discovery of one people and that all other peoples had died in the dark  their chief insult to christianity was actually their chief compliment to themselves and there seemed to be a strange unfairness about all their relative insistence on the two things  when considering some pagan or agnostic we were to remember that all men had one religion when considering some mystic or spiritualist we were only to consider what absurd religions some men had  we could trust the ethics of epictetus because ethics had never changed  we must not trust the ethics of bossuet because ethics had changed  they changed in two hundred years but not in two thousand       this began to be alarming  it looked not so much as if christianity was bad enough to include any vices but rather as if any stick was good enough to beat christianity with what again could this astonishing thing be like which people were so anxious to contradict that in doing so they did not mind contradicting themselves  i saw the same thing on every side i can give no further space to this discussion of it in detail but lest any one supposes that i have unfairly selected three accidental cases i will run briefly through a few others thus certain sceptics wrote that the great crime of christianity had been its attack on the family it had dragged women to the loneliness and contemplation of the cloister away from their homes and their children  but then other sceptics slightly more advanced said that the great crime of christianity was forcing the family and marriage upon us that it doomed women to the drudgery of their homes and children and forbade them loneliness and contemplation the charge was actually reversed  or again certain phrases in the epistles or the marriage service were said by the antichristians to show contempt for womans intellect  but i found that the antichristians themselves had a contempt for womans intellect for it was their great sneer at the church on the continent that only women went to it  or again christianity was reproached with its naked and hungry habits with its sackcloth and dried peas but the next minute christianity was being reproached with its pomp and its ritualism its shrines of porphyry and its robes of gold it was abused for being too plain and for being too coloured again christianity had always been accused of restraining sexuality too much when bradlaugh the malthusian discovered that it restrained it too little  it is often accused in the same breath of prim respectability and of religious extravagance  between the covers of the same atheistic pamphlet i have found the faith rebuked for its disunion one thinks one thing and one another and rebuked also for its union it is difference of opinion that prevents the world from going to the dogs  in the same conversation a freethinker a friend of mine blamed christianity for despising jews and then despised it himself for being jewish       i wished to be quite fair then and i wish to be quite fair now and i did not conclude that the attack on christianity was all wrong i only concluded that if christianity was wrong it was very wrong indeed  such hostile horrors might be combined in one thing but that thing must be very strange and solitary  there are men who are misers and also spendthrifts but they are rare  there are men sensual and also ascetic but they are rare  but if this mass of mad contradictions really existed quakerish and bloodthirsty too gorgeous and too threadbare austere yet pandering preposterously to the lust of the eye the enemy of women and their foolish refuge a solemn pessimist and a silly optimist if this evil existed then there was in this evil something quite supreme and unique for i found in my rationalist teachers no explanation of such exceptional corruption  christianity theoretically speaking was in their eyes only one of the ordinary myths and errors of mortals they gave me no key to this twisted and unnatural badness such a paradox of evil rose to the stature of the supernatural it was indeed almost as supernatural as the infallibility of the pope an historic institution which never went right is really quite as much of a miracle as an institution that cannot go wrong the only explanation which immediately occurred to my mind was that christianity did not come from heaven but from hell  really if jesus of nazareth was not christ he must have been antichrist       and then in a quiet hour a strange thought struck me like a still thunderbolt  there had suddenly come into my mind another explanation suppose we heard an unknown man spoken of by many men  suppose we were puzzled to hear that some men said he was too tall and some too short some objected to his fatness some lamented his leanness some thought him too dark and some too fair  one explanation as has been already admitted would be that he might be an odd shape but there is another explanation  he might be the right shape outrageously tall men might feel him to be short  very short men might feel him to be tall  old bucks who are growing stout might consider him insufficiently filled out old beaux who were growing thin might feel that he expanded beyond the narrow lines of elegance perhaps swedes who have pale hair like tow called him a dark man while negroes considered him distinctly blonde  perhaps in short this extraordinary thing is really the ordinary thing at least the normal thing the centre  perhaps after all it is christianity that is sane and all its critics that are madin various ways i tested this idea by asking myself whether there was about any of the accusers anything morbid that might explain the accusation i was startled to find that this key fitted a lock  for instance it was certainly odd that the modern world charged christianity at once with bodily austerity and with artistic pomp  but then it was also odd very odd that the modern world itself combined extreme bodily luxury with an extreme absence of artistic pomp the modern man thought beckets robes too rich and his meals too poor but then the modern man was really exceptional in history no man before ever ate such elaborate dinners in such ugly clothes  the modern man found the church too simple exactly where modern life is too complex he found the church too gorgeous exactly where modern life is too dingy the man who disliked the plain fasts and feasts was mad on entrees the man who disliked vestments wore a pair of preposterous trousers and surely if there was any insanity involved in the matter at all it was in the trousers not in the simply falling robe  if there was any insanity at all it was in the extravagant entrees not in the bread and wine       i went over all the cases and i found the key fitted so far the fact that swinburne was irritated at the unhappiness of christians and yet more irritated at their happiness was easily explained it was no longer a complication of diseases in christianity but a complication of diseases in swinburne  the restraints of christians saddened him simply because he was more hedonist than a healthy man should be  the faith of christians angered him because he was more pessimist than a healthy man should be in the same way the malthusians by instinct attacked christianity not because there is anything especially antimalthusian about christianity but because there is something a little antihuman about malthusianism       nevertheless it could not i felt be quite true that christianity was merely sensible and stood in the middle  there was really an element in it of emphasis and even frenzy which had justified the secularists in their superficial criticism  it might be wise i began more and more to think that it was wise but it was not merely worldly wise it was not merely temperate and respectable its fierce crusaders and meek saints might balance each other still the crusaders were very fierce and the saints were very meek meek beyond all decency  now it was just at this point of the speculation that i remembered my thoughts about the martyr and the suicide  in that matter there had been this combination between two almost insane positions which yet somehow amounted to sanity this was just such another contradiction and this i had already found to be true  this was exactly one of the paradoxes in which sceptics found the creed wrong and in this i had found it right madly as christians might love the martyr or hate the suicide they never felt these passions more madly than i had felt them long before i dreamed of christianity  then the most difficult and interesting part of the mental process opened and i began to trace this idea darkly through all the enormous thoughts of our theology the idea was that which i had outlined touching the optimist and the pessimist that we want not an amalgam or compromise but both things at the top of their energy love and wrath both burning here i shall only trace it in relation to ethics  but i need not remind the reader that the idea of this combination is indeed central in orthodox theology  for orthodox theology has specially insisted that christ was not a being apart from god and man like an elf nor yet a being half human and half not like a centaur but both things at once and both things thoroughly very man and very god now let me trace this notion as i found it       all sane men can see that sanity is some kind of equilibrium that one may be mad and eat too much or mad and eat too little some moderns have indeed appeared with vague versions of progress and evolution which seeks to destroy the meson or balance of aristotle they seem to suggest that we are meant to starve progressively or to go on eating larger and larger breakfasts every morning for ever but the great truism of the meson remains for all thinking men and these people have not upset any balance except their own but granted that we have all to keep a balance the real interest comes in with the question of how that balance can be kept that was the problem which paganism tried to solve  that was the problem which i think christianity solved and solved in a very strange way       paganism declared that virtue was in a balance christianity declared it was in a conflict  the collision of two passions apparently opposite  of course they were not really inconsistent but they were such that it was hard to hold simultaneously let us follow for a moment the clue of the martyr and the suicide and take the case of courage  no quality has ever so much addled the brains and tangled the definitions of merely rational sages courage is almost a contradiction in terms  it means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die  he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes  it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers  it might be printed in an alpine guide or a drill book  this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage  a man cut off by the sea may save his life if he will risk it on the precipice       he can only get away from death by continually stepping within an inch of it  a soldier surrounded by enemies if he is to cut his way out needs to combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness about dying  he must not merely cling to life for then he will be a coward and will not escape  he must not merely wait for death for then he will be a suicide and will not escape he must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine no philosopher i fancy has ever expressed this romantic riddle with adequate lucidity and i certainly have not done so but christianity has done more  it has marked the limits of it in the awful graves of the suicide and the hero showing the distance between him who dies for the sake of living and him who dies for the sake of dying  and it has held up ever since above the european lances the banner of the mystery of chivalry  the christian courage which is a disdain of death not the chinese courage which is a disdain of life       and now i began to find that this duplex passion was the christian key to ethics everywhere  everywhere the creed made a moderation out of the still crash of two impetuous emotions  take for instance the matter of modesty of the balance between mere pride and mere prostration  the average pagan like the average agnostic would merely say that he was content with himself but not insolently selfsatisfied that there were many better and many worse that his deserts were limited but he would see that he got them in short he would walk with his head in the air but not necessarily with his nose in the air  this is a manly and rational position but it is open to the objection we noted against the compromise between optimism and pessimismthe resignation of matthew arnold being a mixture of two things it is a dilution of two things neither is present in its full strength or contributes its full colour this proper pride does not lift the heart like the tongue of trumpets you cannot go clad in crimson and gold for this  on the other hand this mild rationalist modesty does not cleanse the soul with fire and make it clear like crystal it does not like a strict and searching humility make a man as a little child who can sit at the feet of the grass  it does not make him look up and see marvels for alice must grow small if she is to be alice in wonderland  thus it loses both the poetry of being proud and the poetry of being humble christianity sought by this same strange expedient to save both of them       it separated the two ideas and then exaggerated them both in one way man was to be haughtier than he had ever been before in another way he was to be humbler than he had ever been before in so far as i am man i am the chief of creatures  in so far as i am a man i am the chief of sinners  all humility that had meant pessimism that had meant man taking a vague or mean view of his whole destinyall that was to go  we were to hear no more the wail of ecclesiastes that humanity had no preeminence over the brute or the awful cry of homer that man was only the saddest of all the beasts of the field  man was a statue of god walking about the garden  man had preeminence over all the brutes man was only sad because he was not a beast but a broken god the greek had spoken of men creeping on the earth as if clinging to it  now man was to tread on the earth as if to subdue it christianity thus held a thought of the dignity of man that could only be expressed in crowns rayed like the sun and fans of peacock plumage yet at the same time it could hold a thought about the abject smallness of man that could only be expressed in fasting and fantastic submission in the gray ashes of st dominic and the white snows of st bernard when one came to think of ones self there was vista and void enough for any amount of bleak abnegation and bitter truth  there the realistic gentleman could let himself goas long as he let himself go at himself  there was an open playground for the happy pessimist let him say anything against himself short of blaspheming the original aim of his being let him call himself a fool and even a damned fool though that is calvinistic but he must not say that fools are not worth saving  he must not say that a man qua man can be valueless  here again in short christianity got over the difficulty of combining furious opposites by keeping them both and keeping them both furious  the church was positive on both points one can hardly think too little of ones self  one can hardly think too much of ones soul       take another case  the complicated question of charity which some highly uncharitable idealists seem to think quite easy charity is a paradox like modesty and courage  stated baldly charity certainly means one of two thingspardoning unpardonable acts or loving unlovable people  but if we ask ourselves as we did in the case of pride what a sensible pagan would feel about such a subject we shall probably be beginning at the bottom of it a sensible pagan would say that there were some people one could forgive and some one couldnt a slave who stole wine could be laughed at a slave who betrayed his benefactor could be killed and cursed even after he was killed  in so far as the act was pardonable the man was pardonable  that again is rational and even refreshing but it is a dilution  it leaves no place for a pure horror of injustice such as that which is a great beauty in the innocent  and it leaves no place for a mere tenderness for men as men such as is the whole fascination of the charitable  christianity came in here as before it came in startlingly with a sword and clove one thing from another it divided the crime from the criminal  the criminal we must forgive unto seventy times seven  the crime we must not forgive at all it was not enough that slaves who stole wine inspired partly anger and partly kindness  we must be much more angry with theft than before and yet much kinder to thieves than before  there was room for wrath and love to run wild  and the more i considered christianity the more i found that while it had established a rule and order the chief aim of that order was to give room for good things to run wild       mental and emotional liberty are not so simple as they look really they require almost as careful a balance of laws and conditions as do social and political liberty  the ordinary aesthetic anarchist who sets out to feel everything freely gets knotted at last in a paradox that prevents him feeling at all  he breaks away from home limits to follow poetry  but in ceasing to feel home limits he has ceased to feel the odyssey  he is free from national prejudices and outside patriotism  but being outside patriotism he is outside henry v such a literary man is simply outside all literature he is more of a prisoner than any bigot  for if there is a wall between you and the world it makes little difference whether you describe yourself as locked in or as locked out  what we want is not the universality that is outside all normal sentiments we want the universality that is inside all normal sentiments it is all the difference between being free from them as a man is free from a prison and being free of them as a man is free of a city  i am free from windsor castle that is i am not forcibly detained there but i am by no means free of that building how can man be approximately free of fine emotions able to swing them in a clear space without breakage or wrong  this was the achievement of this christian paradox of the parallel passions granted the primary dogma of the war between divine and diabolic the revolt and ruin of the world their optimism and pessimism as pure poetry could be loosened like cataracts       st francis in praising all good could be a more shouting optimist than walt whitman  st jerome in denouncing all evil could paint the world blacker than schopenhauer  both passions were free because both were kept in their place  the optimist could pour out all the praise he liked on the gay music of the march the golden trumpets and the purple banners going into battle but he must not call the fight needless  the pessimist might draw as darkly as he chose the sickening marches or the sanguine wounds but he must not call the fight hopeless  so it was with all the other moral problems with pride with protest and with compassion by defining its main doctrine the church not only kept seemingly inconsistent things side by side but what was more allowed them to break out in a sort of artistic violence otherwise possible only to anarchists  meekness grew more dramatic than madness historic christianity rose into a high and strange coup de theatre of moralitythings that are to virtue what the crimes of nero are to vice  the spirits of indignation and of charity took terrible and attractive forms ranging from that monkish fierceness that scourged like a dog the first and greatest of the plantagenets to the sublime pity of st catherine who in the official shambles kissed the bloody head of the criminal  poetry could be acted as well as composed  this heroic and monumental manner in ethics has entirely vanished with supernatural religion  they being humble could parade themselves  but we are too proud to be prominent our ethical teachers write reasonably for prison reform but we are not likely to see mr cadbury or any eminent philanthropist go into reading gaol and embrace the strangled corpse before it is cast into the quicklime  our ethical teachers write mildly against the power of millionaires but we are not likely to see mr rockefeller or any modern tyrant publicly whipped in westminster abbey       thus the double charges of the secularists though throwing nothing but darkness and confusion on themselves throw a real light on the faith  it is true that the historic church has at once emphasised celibacy and emphasised the family has at once if one may put it so been fiercely for having children and fiercely for not having children it has kept them side by side like two strong colours red and white like the red and white upon the shield of st george  it has always had a healthy hatred of pink  it hates that combination of two colours which is the feeble expedient of the philosophers it hates that evolution of black into white which is tantamount to a dirty gray  in fact the whole theory of the church on virginity might be symbolized in the statement that white is a colour not merely the absence of a colour  all that i am urging here can be expressed by saying that christianity sought in most of these cases to keep two colours coexistent but pure  it is not a mixture like russet or purple it is rather like a shot silk for a shot silk is always at right angles and is in the pattern of the cross       so it is also of course with the contradictory charges of the antichristians about submission and slaughter  it is true that the church told some men to fight and others not to fight and it is true that those who fought were like thunderbolts and those who did not fight were like statues  all this simply means that the church preferred to use its supermen and to use its tolstoyans  there must be some good in the life of battle for so many good men have enjoyed being soldiers  there must be some good in the idea of nonresistance for so many good men seem to enjoy being quakers  all that the church did so far as that goes was to prevent either of these good things from ousting the other they existed side by side  the tolstoyans having all the scruples of monks simply became monks  the quakers became a club instead of becoming a sect  monks said all that tolstoy says they poured out lucid lamentations about the cruelty of battles and the vanity of revenge  but the tolstoyans are not quite right enough to run the whole world and in the ages of faith they were not allowed to run it  the world did not lose the last charge of sir james douglas or the banner of joan the maid  and sometimes this pure gentleness and this pure fierceness met and justified their juncture the paradox of all the prophets was fulfilled and in the soul of st louis the lion lay down with the lamb  but remember that this text is too lightly interpreted  it is constantly assured especially in our tolstoyan tendencies that when the lion lies down with the lamb the lion becomes lamblike but that is brutal annexation and imperialism on the part of the lamb  that is simply the lamb absorbing the lion instead of the lion eating the lamb the real problem iscan the lion lie down with the lamb and still retain his royal ferocity  that is the problem the church attempted that is the miracle she achieved       this is what i have called guessing the hidden eccentricities of life  this is knowing that a mans heart is to the left and not in the middle  this is knowing not only that the earth is round but knowing exactly where it is flat  christian doctrine detected the oddities of life  it not only discovered the law but it foresaw the exceptions  those underrate christianity who say that it discovered mercy any one might discover mercy  in fact every one did  but to discover a plan for being merciful and also severe that was to anticipate a strange need of human nature  for no one wants to be forgiven for a big sin as if it were a little one any one might say that we should be neither quite miserable nor quite happy  but to find out how far one may be quite miserable without making it impossible to be quite happythat was a discovery in psychology  any one might say neither swagger nor grovel and it would have been a limit  but to say here you can swagger and there you can grovelthat was an emancipation       this was the big fact about christian ethics the discovery of the new balance  paganism had been like a pillar of marble upright because proportioned with symmetry  christianity was like a huge and ragged and romantic rock which though it sways on its pedestal at a touch yet because its exaggerated excrescences exactly balance each other is enthroned there for a thousand years in a gothic cathedral the columns were all different but they were all necessary  every support seemed an accidental and fantastic support every buttress was a flying buttress  so in christendom apparent accidents balanced  becket wore a hair shirt under his gold and crimson and there is much to be said for the combination for becket got the benefit of the hair shirt while the people in the street got the benefit of the crimson and gold  it is at least better than the manner of the modern millionaire who has the black and the drab outwardly for others and the gold next his heart but the balance was not always in one mans body as in beckets the balance was often distributed over the whole body of christendom because a man prayed and fasted on the northern snows flowers could be flung at his festival in the southern cities and because fanatics drank water on the sands of syria men could still drink cider in the orchards of england  this is what makes christendom at once so much more perplexing and so much more interesting than the pagan empire just as amiens cathedral is not better but more interesting than the parthenon  if any one wants a modern proof of all this let him consider the curious fact that under christianity europe while remaining a unity has broken up into individual nations patriotism is a perfect example of this deliberate balancing of one emphasis against another emphasis  the instinct of the pagan empire would have said you shall all be roman citizens and grow alike let the german grow less slow and reverent the frenchmen less experimental and swift  but the instinct of christian europe says let the german remain slow and reverent that the frenchman may the more safely be swift and experimental we will make an equipoise out of these excesses  the absurdity called germany shall correct the insanity called france       last and most important it is exactly this which explains what is so inexplicable to all the modern critics of the history of christianity  i mean the monstrous wars about small points of theology the earthquakes of emotion about a gesture or a word it was only a matter of an inch but an inch is everything when you are balancing  the church could not afford to swerve a hairs breadth on some things if she was to continue her great and daring experiment of the irregular equilibrium  once let one idea become less powerful and some other idea would become too powerful  it was no flock of sheep the christian shepherd was leading but a herd of bulls and tigers of terrible ideals and devouring doctrines each one of them strong enough to turn to a false religion and lay waste the world remember that the church went in specifically for dangerous ideas she was a lion tamer  the idea of birth through a holy spirit of the death of a divine being of the forgiveness of sins or the fulfilment of prophecies are ideas which any one can see need but a touch to turn them into something blasphemous or ferocious the smallest link was let drop by the artificers of the mediterranean and the lion of ancestral pessimism burst his chain in the forgotten forests of the north  of these theological equalisations i have to speak afterwards  here it is enough to notice that if some small mistake were made in doctrine huge blunders might be made in human happiness  a sentence phrased wrong about the nature of symbolism would have broken all the best statues in europe a slip in the definitions might stop all the dances might wither all the christmas trees or break all the easter eggs  doctrines had to be defined within strict limits even in order that man might enjoy general human liberties  the church had to be careful if only that the world might be careless       this is the thrilling romance of orthodoxy  people have fallen into a foolish habit of speaking of orthodoxy as something heavy humdrum and safe  there never was anything so perilous or so exciting as orthodoxy  it was sanity  and to be sane is more dramatic than to be mad  it was the equilibrium of a man behind madly rushing horses seeming to stoop this way and to sway that yet in every attitude having the grace of statuary and the accuracy of arithmetic the church in its early days went fierce and fast with any warhorse yet it is utterly unhistoric to say that she merely went mad along one idea like a vulgar fanaticism  she swerved to left and right so exactly as to avoid enormous obstacles  she left on one hand the huge bulk of arianism buttressed by all the worldly powers to make christianity too worldly  the next instant she was swerving to avoid an orientalism which would have made it too unworldly the orthodox church never took the tame course or accepted the conventions the orthodox church was never respectable  it would have been easier to have accepted the earthly power of the arians it would have been easy in the calvinistic seventeenth century to fall into the bottomless pit of predestination  it is easy to be a madman  it is easy to be a heretic  it is always easy to let the age have its head the difficult thing is to keep ones own it is always easy to be a modernist as it is easy to be a snob to have fallen into any of those open traps of error and exaggeration which fashion after fashion and sect after sect set along the historic path of christendomthat would indeed have been simple it is always simple to fall there are an infinity of angles at which one falls only one at which one stands  to have fallen into any one of the fads from gnosticism to christian science would indeed have been obvious and tame  but to have avoided them all has been one whirling adventure and in my vision the heavenly chariot flies thundering through the ages the dull heresies sprawling and prostrate the wild truth reeling but erect    vii the eternal revolution        the following propositions have been urged  first that some faith in our life is required even to improve it second that some dissatisfaction with things as they are is necessary even in order to be satisfied third that to have this necessary content and necessary discontent it is not sufficient to have the obvious equilibrium of the stoic  for mere resignation has neither the gigantic levity of pleasure nor the superb intolerance of pain there is a vital objection to the advice merely to grin and bear it the objection is that if you merely bear it you do not grin greek heroes do not grin  but gargoyles dobecause they are christian and when a christian is pleased he is in the most exact sense frightfully pleased his pleasure is frightful  christ prophesied the whole of gothic architecture in that hour when nervous and respectable people such people as now object to barrel organs objected to the shouting of the guttersnipes of jerusalem he said if these were silent the very stones would cry out under the impulse of his spirit arose like a clamorous chorus the facades of the mediaeval cathedrals thronged with shouting faces and open mouths  the prophecy has fulfilled itself  the very stones cry out       if these things be conceded though only for argument we may take up where we left it the thread of the thought of the natural man called by the scotch with regrettable familiarity the old man  we can ask the next question so obviously in front of us  some satisfaction is needed even to make things better but what do we mean by making things better  most modern talk on this matter is a mere argument in a circlethat circle which we have already made the symbol of madness and of mere rationalism evolution is only good if it produces good good is only good if it helps evolution  the elephant stands on the tortoise and the tortoise on the elephant       obviously it will not do to take our ideal from the principle in nature for the simple reason that except for some human or divine theory there is no principle in nature  for instance the cheap antidemocrat of today will tell you solemnly that there is no equality in nature  he is right but he does not see the logical addendum  there is no equality in nature also there is no inequality in nature  inequality as much as equality implies a standard of value  to read aristocracy into the anarchy of animals is just as sentimental as to read democracy into it both aristocracy and democracy are human ideals  the one saying that all men are valuable the other that some men are more valuable but nature does not say that cats are more valuable than mice nature makes no remark on the subject  she does not even say that the cat is enviable or the mouse pitiable  we think the cat superior because we have or most of us have a particular philosophy to the effect that life is better than death  but if the mouse were a german pessimist mouse he might not think that the cat had beaten him at all  he might think he had beaten the cat by getting to the grave first  or he might feel that he had actually inflicted frightful punishment on the cat by keeping him alive just as a microbe might feel proud of spreading a pestilence so the pessimistic mouse might exult to think that he was renewing in the cat the torture of conscious existence  it all depends on the philosophy of the mouse  you cannot even say that there is victory or superiority in nature unless you have some doctrine about what things are superior  you cannot even say that the cat scores unless there is a system of scoring  you cannot even say that the cat gets the best of it unless there is some best to be got       we cannot then get the ideal itself from nature and as we follow here the first and natural speculation we will leave out for the present the idea of getting it from god we must have our own vision  but the attempts of most moderns to express it are highly vague       some fall back simply on the clock  they talk as if mere passage through time brought some superiority so that even a man of the first mental calibre carelessly uses the phrase that human morality is never up to date  how can anything be up to date a date has no character  how can one say that christmas celebrations are not suitable to the twentyfifth of a month what the writer meant of course was that the majority is behind his favourite minorityor in front of it  other vague modern people take refuge in material metaphors in fact this is the chief mark of vague modern people  not daring to define their doctrine of what is good they use physical figures of speech without stint or shame and what is worst of all seem to think these cheap analogies are exquisitely spiritual and superior to the old morality thus they think it intellectual to talk about things being high it is at least the reverse of intellectual it is a mere phrase from a steeple or a weathercock  tommy was a good boy is a pure philosophical statement worthy of plato or aquinas  tommy lived the higher life is a gross metaphor from a tenfoot rule       this incidentally is almost the whole weakness of nietzsche whom some are representing as a bold and strong thinker no one will deny that he was a poetical and suggestive thinker but he was quite the reverse of strong  he was not at all bold he never put his own meaning before himself in bald abstract words as did aristotle and calvin and even karl marx the hard fearless men of thought  nietzsche always escaped a question by a physical metaphor like a cheery minor poet  he said beyond good and evil because he had not the courage to say more good than good and evil or more evil than good and evil had he faced his thought without metaphors he would have seen that it was nonsense  so when he describes his hero he does not dare to say the purer man or the happier man or the sadder man for all these are ideas and ideas are alarming  he says the upper man or over man a physical metaphor from acrobats or alpine climbers nietzsche is truly a very timid thinker  he does not really know in the least what sort of man he wants evolution to produce and if he does not know certainly the ordinary evolutionists who talk about things being higher do not know either       then again some people fall back on sheer submission and sitting still  nature is going to do something some day nobody knows what and nobody knows when  we have no reason for acting and no reason for not acting  if anything happens it is right if anything is prevented it was wrong  again some people try to anticipate nature by doing something by doing anything because we may possibly grow wings they cut off their legs yet nature may be trying to make them centipedes for all they know       lastly there is a fourth class of people who take whatever it is that they happen to want and say that that is the ultimate aim of evolution  and these are the only sensible people this is the only really healthy way with the word evolution to work for what you want and to call that evolution  the only intelligible sense that progress or advance can have among men is that we have a definite vision and that we wish to make the whole world like that vision  if you like to put it so the essence of the doctrine is that what we have around us is the mere method and preparation for something that we have to create this is not a world but rather the material for a world god has given us not so much the colours of a picture as the colours of a palette  but he has also given us a subject a model a fixed vision  we must be clear about what we want to paint this adds a further principle to our previous list of principles we have said we must be fond of this world even in order to change it we now add that we must be fond of another world real or imaginary in order to have something to change it to       we need not debate about the mere words evolution or progress personally i prefer to call it reform  for reform implies form it implies that we are trying to shape the world in a particular image to make it something that we see already in our minds  evolution is a metaphor from mere automatic unrolling  progress is a metaphor from merely walking along a roadvery likely the wrong road  but reform is a metaphor for reasonable and determined men  it means that we see a certain thing out of shape and we mean to put it into shape and we know what shape       now here comes in the whole collapse and huge blunder of our age we have mixed up two different things two opposite things progress should mean that we are always changing the world to suit the vision  progress does mean just now that we are always changing the vision  it should mean that we are slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men  it does mean that we are very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy  a wild page from any prussian sophist makes men doubt it  progress should mean that we are always walking towards the new jerusalem  it does mean that the new jerusalem is always walking away from us  we are not altering the real to suit the ideal  we are altering the ideal it is easier       silly examples are always simpler let us suppose a man wanted a particular kind of world say a blue world  he would have no cause to complain of the slightness or swiftness of his task he might toil for a long time at the transformation he could work away in every sense until all was blue  he could have heroic adventures the putting of the last touches to a blue tiger he could have fairy dreams the dawn of a blue moon  but if he worked hard that highminded reformer would certainly from his own point of view leave the world better and bluer than he found it if he altered a blade of grass to his favourite colour every day he would get on slowly  but if he altered his favourite colour every day he would not get on at all  if after reading a fresh philosopher he started to paint everything red or yellow his work would be thrown away  there would be nothing to show except a few blue tigers walking about specimens of his early bad manner this is exactly the position of the average modern thinker it will be said that this is avowedly a preposterous example but it is literally the fact of recent history  the great and grave changes in our political civilization all belonged to the early nineteenth century not to the later  they belonged to the black and white epoch when men believed fixedly in toryism in protestantism in calvinism in reform and not unfrequently in revolution and whatever each man believed in he hammered at steadily without scepticism  and there was a time when the established church might have fallen and the house of lords nearly fell it was because radicals were wise enough to be constant and consistent it was because radicals were wise enough to be conservative but in the existing atmosphere there is not enough time and tradition in radicalism to pull anything down  there is a great deal of truth in lord hugh cecils suggestion made in a fine speech that the era of change is over and that ours is an era of conservation and repose but probably it would pain lord hugh cecil if he realized what is certainly the case that ours is only an age of conservation because it is an age of complete unbelief  let beliefs fade fast and frequently if you wish institutions to remain the same the more the life of the mind is unhinged the more the machinery of matter will be left to itself  the net result of all our political suggestions collectivism tolstoyanism neofeudalism communism anarchy scientific bureaucracythe plain fruit of all of them is that the monarchy and the house of lords will remain the net result of all the new religions will be that the church of england will not for heaven knows how long be disestablished it was karl marx nietzsche tolstoy cunninghame grahame bernard shaw and auberon herbert who between them with bowed gigantic backs bore up the throne of the archbishop of canterbury       we may say broadly that free thought is the best of all the safeguards against freedom  managed in a modern style the emancipation of the slaves mind is the best way of preventing the emancipation of the slave  teach him to worry about whether he wants to be free and he will not free himself  again it may be said that this instance is remote or extreme  but again it is exactly true of the men in the streets around us  it is true that the negro slave being a debased barbarian will probably have either a human affection of loyalty or a human affection for liberty  but the man we see every daythe worker in mr gradgrinds factory the little clerk in mr gradgrinds officehe is too mentally worried to believe in freedom  he is kept quiet with revolutionary literature he is calmed and kept in his place by a constant succession of wild philosophies  he is a marxian one day a nietzscheite the next day a superman probably the next day and a slave every day the only thing that remains after all the philosophies is the factory the only man who gains by all the philosophies is gradgrind it would be worth his while to keep his commercial helotry supplied with sceptical literature  and now i come to think of it of course gradgrind is famous for giving libraries  he shows his sense all modern books are on his side  as long as the vision of heaven is always changing the vision of earth will be exactly the same no ideal will remain long enough to be realized or even partly realized the modern young man will never change his environment for he will always change his mind       this therefore is our first requirement about the ideal towards which progress is directed it must be fixed  whistler used to make many rapid studies of a sitter it did not matter if he tore up twenty portraits  but it would matter if he looked up twenty times and each time saw a new person sitting placidly for his portrait so it does not matter comparatively speaking how often humanity fails to imitate its ideal for then all its old failures are fruitful but it does frightfully matter how often humanity changes its ideal for then all its old failures are fruitless  the question therefore becomes this  how can we keep the artist discontented with his pictures while preventing him from being vitally discontented with his art how can we make a man always dissatisfied with his work yet always satisfied with working  how can we make sure that the portrait painter will throw the portrait out of window instead of taking the natural and more human course of throwing the sitter out of window       a strict rule is not only necessary for ruling it is also necessary for rebelling  this fixed and familiar ideal is necessary to any sort of revolution  man will sometimes act slowly upon new ideas but he will only act swiftly upon old ideas  if i am merely to float or fade or evolve it may be towards something anarchic but if i am to riot it must be for something respectable  this is the whole weakness of certain schools of progress and moral evolution they suggest that there has been a slow movement towards morality with an imperceptible ethical change in every year or at every instant there is only one great disadvantage in this theory  it talks of a slow movement towards justice but it does not permit a swift movement a man is not allowed to leap up and declare a certain state of things to be intrinsically intolerable  to make the matter clear it is better to take a specific example  certain of the idealistic vegetarians such as mr salt say that the time has now come for eating no meat by implication they assume that at one time it was right to eat meat and they suggest in words that could be quoted that some day it may be wrong to eat milk and eggs  i do not discuss here the question of what is justice to animals  i only say that whatever is justice ought under given conditions to be prompt justice if an animal is wronged we ought to be able to rush to his rescue but how can we rush if we are perhaps in advance of our time  how can we rush to catch a train which may not arrive for a few centuries how can i denounce a man for skinning cats if he is only now what i may possibly become in drinking a glass of milk  a splendid and insane russian sect ran about taking all the cattle out of all the carts how can i pluck up courage to take the horse out of my hansomcab when i do not know whether my evolutionary watch is only a little fast or the cabmans a little slow  suppose i say to a sweater slavery suited one stage of evolution  and suppose he answers and sweating suits this stage of evolution  how can i answer if there is no eternal test  if sweaters can be behind the current morality why should not philanthropists be in front of it  what on earth is the current morality except in its literal sensethe morality that is always running away       thus we may say that a permanent ideal is as necessary to the innovator as to the conservative it is necessary whether we wish the kings orders to be promptly executed or whether we only wish the king to be promptly executed  the guillotine has many sins but to do it justice there is nothing evolutionary about it the favourite evolutionary argument finds its best answer in the axe  the evolutionist says where do you draw the line the revolutionist answers i draw it here  exactly between your head and body  there must at any given moment be an abstract right and wrong if any blow is to be struck there must be something eternal if there is to be anything sudden  therefore for all intelligible human purposes for altering things or for keeping things as they are for founding a system for ever as in china or for altering it every month as in the early french revolution it is equally necessary that the vision should be a fixed vision this is our first requirement       when i had written this down i felt once again the presence of something else in the discussion  as a man hears a church bell above the sound of the street  something seemed to be saying my ideal at least is fixed for it was fixed before the foundations of the world  my vision of perfection assuredly cannot be altered for it is called eden  you may alter the place to which you are going but you cannot alter the place from which you have come to the orthodox there must always be a case for revolution for in the hearts of men god has been put under the feet of satan in the upper world hell once rebelled against heaven  but in this world heaven is rebelling against hell  for the orthodox there can always be a revolution for a revolution is a restoration at any instant you may strike a blow for the perfection which no man has seen since adam  no unchanging custom no changing evolution can make the original good any thing but good man may have had concubines as long as cows have had horns still they are not a part of him if they are sinful  men may have been under oppression ever since fish were under water still they ought not to be if oppression is sinful  the chain may seem as natural to the slave or the paint to the harlot as does the plume to the bird or the burrow to the fox still they are not if they are sinful  i lift my prehistoric legend to defy all your history  your vision is not merely a fixture  it is a fact i paused to note the new coincidence of christianity  but i passed on       i passed on to the next necessity of any ideal of progress some people as we have said seem to believe in an automatic and impersonal progress in the nature of things  but it is clear that no political activity can be encouraged by saying that progress is natural and inevitable that is not a reason for being active but rather a reason for being lazy  if we are bound to improve we need not trouble to improve  the pure doctrine of progress is the best of all reasons for not being a progressive  but it is to none of these obvious comments that i wish primarily to call attention       the only arresting point is this  that if we suppose improvement to be natural it must be fairly simple  the world might conceivably be working towards one consummation but hardly towards any particular arrangement of many qualities  to take our original simile  nature by herself may be growing more blue that is a process so simple that it might be impersonal  but nature cannot be making a careful picture made of many picked colours unless nature is personal  if the end of the world were mere darkness or mere light it might come as slowly and inevitably as dusk or dawn  but if the end of the world is to be a piece of elaborate and artistic chiaroscuro then there must be design in it either human or divine  the world through mere time might grow black like an old picture or white like an old coat but if it is turned into a particular piece of black and white art then there is an artist       if the distinction be not evident i give an ordinary instance  we constantly hear a particularly cosmic creed from the modern humanitarians  i use the word humanitarian in the ordinary sense as meaning one who upholds the claims of all creatures against those of humanity they suggest that through the ages we have been growing more and more humane that is to say that one after another groups or sections of beings slaves children women cows or what not have been gradually admitted to mercy or to justice  they say that we once thought it right to eat men we didnt but i am not here concerned with their history which is highly unhistorical as a fact anthropophagy is certainly a decadent thing not a primitive one  it is much more likely that modern men will eat human flesh out of affectation than that primitive man ever ate it out of ignorance  i am here only following the outlines of their argument which consists in maintaining that man has been progressively more lenient first to citizens then to slaves then to animals and then presumably to plants  i think it wrong to sit on a man  soon i shall think it wrong to sit on a horse eventually i suppose i shall think it wrong to sit on a chair that is the drive of the argument  and for this argument it can be said that it is possible to talk of it in terms of evolution or inevitable progress  a perpetual tendency to touch fewer and fewer things mightone feels be a mere brute unconscious tendency like that of a species to produce fewer and fewer children this drift may be really evolutionary because it is stupid       darwinism can be used to back up two mad moralities but it cannot be used to back up a single sane one  the kinship and competition of all living creatures can be used as a reason for being insanely cruel or insanely sentimental but not for a healthy love of animals  on the evolutionary basis you may be inhumane or you may be absurdly humane but you cannot be human  that you and a tiger are one may be a reason for being tender to a tiger or it may be a reason for being as cruel as the tiger  it is one way to train the tiger to imitate you it is a shorter way to imitate the tiger  but in neither case does evolution tell you how to treat a tiger reasonably that is to admire his stripes while avoiding his claws       if you want to treat a tiger reasonably you must go back to the garden of eden  for the obstinate reminder continued to recur only the supernatural has taken a sane view of nature  the essence of all pantheism evolutionism and modern cosmic religion is really in this proposition  that nature is our mother  unfortunately if you regard nature as a mother you discover that she is a stepmother the main point of christianity was this  that nature is not our mother nature is our sister  we can be proud of her beauty since we have the same father but she has no authority over us we have to admire but not to imitate  this gives to the typically christian pleasure in this earth a strange touch of lightness that is almost frivolity nature was a solemn mother to the worshippers of isis and cybele nature was a solemn mother to wordsworth or to emerson but nature is not solemn to francis of assisi or to george herbert to st francis nature is a sister and even a younger sister a little dancing sister to be laughed at as well as loved       this however is hardly our main point at present i have admitted it only in order to show how constantly and as it were accidentally the key would fit the smallest doors  our main point is here that if there be a mere trend of impersonal improvement in nature it must presumably be a simple trend towards some simple triumph one can imagine that some automatic tendency in biology might work for giving us longer and longer noses  but the question is do we want to have longer and longer noses  i fancy not i believe that we most of us want to say to our noses thus far and no farther and here shall thy proud point be stayed we require a nose of such length as may ensure an interesting face but we cannot imagine a mere biological trend towards producing interesting faces because an interesting face is one particular arrangement of eyes nose and mouth in a most complex relation to each other  proportion cannot be a drift  it is either an accident or a design  so with the ideal of human morality and its relation to the humanitarians and the antihumanitarians it is conceivable that we are going more and more to keep our hands off things  not to drive horses not to pick flowers  we may eventually be bound not to disturb a mans mind even by argument not to disturb the sleep of birds even by coughing  the ultimate apotheosis would appear to be that of a man sitting quite still nor daring to stir for fear of disturbing a fly nor to eat for fear of incommoding a microbe  to so crude a consummation as that we might perhaps unconsciously drift  but do we want so crude a consummation  similarly we might unconsciously evolve along the opposite or nietzschian line of developmentsuperman crushing superman in one tower of tyrants until the universe is smashed up for fun  but do we want the universe smashed up for fun is it not quite clear that what we really hope for is one particular management and proposition of these two things a certain amount of restraint and respect a certain amount of energy and mastery if our life is ever really as beautiful as a fairytale we shall have to remember that all the beauty of a fairytale lies in this that the prince has a wonder which just stops short of being fear if he is afraid of the giant there is an end of him but also if he is not astonished at the giant there is an end of the fairytale the whole point depends upon his being at once humble enough to wonder and haughty enough to defy  so our attitude to the giant of the world must not merely be increasing delicacy or increasing contempt it must be one particular proportion of the twowhich is exactly right we must have in us enough reverence for all things outside us to make us tread fearfully on the grass  we must also have enough disdain for all things outside us to make us on due occasion spit at the stars  yet these two things if we are to be good or happy must be combined not in any combination but in one particular combination  the perfect happiness of men on the earth if it ever comes will not be a flat and solid thing like the satisfaction of animals  it will be an exact and perilous balance like that of a desperate romance  man must have just enough faith in himself to have adventures and just enough doubt of himself to enjoy them       this then is our second requirement for the ideal of progress first it must be fixed second it must be composite  it must not if it is to satisfy our souls be the mere victory of some one thing swallowing up everything else love or pride or peace or adventure it must be a definite picture composed of these elements in their best proportion and relation  i am not concerned at this moment to deny that some such good culmination may be by the constitution of things reserved for the human race  i only point out that if this composite happiness is fixed for us it must be fixed by some mind for only a mind can place the exact proportions of a composite happiness if the beatification of the world is a mere work of nature then it must be as simple as the freezing of the world or the burning up of the world  but if the beatification of the world is not a work of nature but a work of art then it involves an artist and here again my contemplation was cloven by the ancient voice which said i could have told you all this a long time ago if there is any certain progress it can only be my kind of progress the progress towards a complete city of virtues and dominations where righteousness and peace contrive to kiss each other an impersonal force might be leading you to a wilderness of perfect flatness or a peak of perfect height  but only a personal god can possibly be leading you if indeed you are being led to a city with just streets and architectural proportions a city in which each of you can contribute exactly the right amount of your own colour to the many coloured coat of joseph       twice again therefore christianity had come in with the exact answer that i required  i had said the ideal must be fixed and the church had answered mine is literally fixed for it existed before anything else  i said secondly it must be artistically combined like a picture and the church answered mine is quite literally a picture for i know who painted it then i went on to the third thing which as it seemed to me was needed for an utopia or goal of progress  and of all the three it is infinitely the hardest to express  perhaps it might be put thus that we need watchfulness even in utopia lest we fall from utopia as we fell from eden       we have remarked that one reason offered for being a progressive is that things naturally tend to grow better  but the only real reason for being a progressive is that things naturally tend to grow worse  the corruption in things is not only the best argument for being progressive it is also the only argument against being conservative  the conservative theory would really be quite sweeping and unanswerable if it were not for this one fact but all conservatism is based upon the idea that if you leave things alone you leave them as they are  but you do not if you leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change if you leave a white post alone it will soon be a black post  if you particularly want it to be white you must be always painting it again that is you must be always having a revolution  briefly if you want the old white post you must have a new white post  but this which is true even of inanimate things is in a quite special and terrible sense true of all human things  an almost unnatural vigilance is really required of the citizen because of the horrible rapidity with which human institutions grow old  it is the custom in passing romance and journalism to talk of men suffering under old tyrannies but as a fact men have almost always suffered under new tyrannies under tyrannies that had been public liberties hardly twenty years before  thus england went mad with joy over the patriotic monarchy of elizabeth and then almost immediately afterwards went mad with rage in the trap of the tyranny of charles the first so again in france the monarchy became intolerable not just after it had been tolerated but just after it had been adored the son of louis the wellbeloved was louis the guillotined so in the same way in england in the nineteenth century the radical manufacturer was entirely trusted as a mere tribune of the people until suddenly we heard the cry of the socialist that he was a tyrant eating the people like bread  so again we have almost up to the last instant trusted the newspapers as organs of public opinion just recently some of us have seen not slowly but with a start that they are obviously nothing of the kind  they are by the nature of the case the hobbies of a few rich men  we have not any need to rebel against antiquity we have to rebel against novelty it is the new rulers the capitalist or the editor who really hold up the modern world  there is no fear that a modern king will attempt to override the constitution it is more likely that he will ignore the constitution and work behind its back he will take no advantage of his kingly power it is more likely that he will take advantage of his kingly powerlessness of the fact that he is free from criticism and publicity  for the king is the most private person of our time  it will not be necessary for any one to fight again against the proposal of a censorship of the press we do not need a censorship of the press  we have a censorship by the press       this startling swiftness with which popular systems turn oppressive is the third fact for which we shall ask our perfect theory of progress to allow  it must always be on the look out for every privilege being abused for every working right becoming a wrong in this matter i am entirely on the side of the revolutionists they are really right to be always suspecting human institutions they are right not to put their trust in princes nor in any child of man  the chieftain chosen to be the friend of the people becomes the enemy of the people the newspaper started to tell the truth now exists to prevent the truth being told  here i say i felt that i was really at last on the side of the revolutionary and then i caught my breath again  for i remembered that i was once again on the side of the orthodox       christianity spoke again and said  i have always maintained that men were naturally backsliders that human virtue tended of its own nature to rust or to rot i have always said that human beings as such go wrong especially happy human beings especially proud and prosperous human beings  this eternal revolution this suspicion sustained through centuries you being a vague modern call the doctrine of progress  if you were a philosopher you would call it as i do the doctrine of original sin  you may call it the cosmic advance as much as you like i call it what it isthe fall       i have spoken of orthodoxy coming in like a sword here i confess it came in like a battleaxe for really when i came to think of it christianity is the only thing left that has any real right to question the power of the wellnurtured or the wellbred i have listened often enough to socialists or even to democrats saying that the physical conditions of the poor must of necessity make them mentally and morally degraded  i have listened to scientific men and there are still scientific men not opposed to democracy saying that if we give the poor healthier conditions vice and wrong will disappear  i have listened to them with a horrible attention with a hideous fascination  for it was like watching a man energetically sawing from the tree the branch he is sitting on if these happy democrats could prove their case they would strike democracy dead  if the poor are thus utterly demoralized it may or may not be practical to raise them  but it is certainly quite practical to disfranchise them  if the man with a bad bedroom cannot give a good vote then the first and swiftest deduction is that he shall give no vote  the governing class may not unreasonably say it may take us some time to reform his bedroom  but if he is the brute you say it will take him very little time to ruin our country therefore we will take your hint and not give him the chance it fills me with horrible amusement to observe the way in which the earnest socialist industriously lays the foundation of all aristocracy expatiating blandly upon the evident unfitness of the poor to rule it is like listening to somebody at an evening party apologising for entering without evening dress and explaining that he had recently been intoxicated had a personal habit of taking off his clothes in the street and had moreover only just changed from prison uniform  at any moment one feels the host might say that really if it was as bad as that he need not come in at all so it is when the ordinary socialist with a beaming face proves that the poor after their smashing experiences cannot be really trustworthy  at any moment the rich may say very well then we wont trust them and bang the door in his face on the basis of mr blatchfords view of heredity and environment the case for the aristocracy is quite overwhelming  if clean homes and clean air make clean souls why not give the power for the present at any rate to those who undoubtedly have the clean air if better conditions will make the poor more fit to govern themselves why should not better conditions already make the rich more fit to govern them  on the ordinary environment argument the matter is fairly manifest  the comfortable class must be merely our vanguard in utopia       is there any answer to the proposition that those who have had the best opportunities will probably be our best guides is there any answer to the argument that those who have breathed clean air had better decide for those who have breathed foul as far as i know there is only one answer and that answer is christianity  only the christian church can offer any rational objection to a complete confidence in the rich  for she has maintained from the beginning that the danger was not in mans environment but in man  further she has maintained that if we come to talk of a dangerous environment the most dangerous environment of all is the commodious environment  i know that the most modern manufacture has been really occupied in trying to produce an abnormally large needle i know that the most recent biologists have been chiefly anxious to discover a very small camel  but if we diminish the camel to his smallest or open the eye of the needle to its largestif in short we assume the words of christ to have meant the very least that they could mean his words must at the very least mean this that rich men are not very likely to be morally trustworthy christianity even when watered down is hot enough to boil all modern society to rags  the mere minimum of the church would be a deadly ultimatum to the world  for the whole modern world is absolutely based on the assumption not that the rich are necessary which is tenable but that the rich are trustworthy which for a christian is not tenable  you will hear everlastingly in all discussions about newspapers companies aristocracies or party politics this argument that the rich man cannot be bribed  the fact is of course that the rich man is bribed he has been bribed already that is why he is a rich man  the whole case for christianity is that a man who is dependent upon the luxuries of this life is a corrupt man spiritually corrupt politically corrupt financially corrupt there is one thing that christ and all the christian saints have said with a sort of savage monotony  they have said simply that to be rich is to be in peculiar danger of moral wreck it is not demonstrably unchristian to kill the rich as violators of definable justice  it is not demonstrably unchristian to crown the rich as convenient rulers of society  it is not certainly unchristian to rebel against the rich or to submit to the rich but it is quite certainly unchristian to trust the rich to regard the rich as more morally safe than the poor  a christian may consistently say i respect that mans rank although he takes bribes but a christian cannot say as all modern men are saying at lunch and breakfast a man of that rank would not take bribes for it is a part of christian dogma that any man in any rank may take bribes  it is a part of christian dogma it also happens by a curious coincidence that it is a part of obvious human history when people say that a man in that position would be incorruptible there is no need to bring christianity into the discussion  was lord bacon a bootblack  was the duke of marlborough a crossing sweeper in the best utopia i must be prepared for the moral fall of any man in any position at any moment especially for my fall from my position at this moment       much vague and sentimental journalism has been poured out to the effect that christianity is akin to democracy and most of it is scarcely strong or clear enough to refute the fact that the two things have often quarrelled  the real ground upon which christianity and democracy are one is very much deeper  the one specially and peculiarly unchristian idea is the idea of carlyle the idea that the man should rule who feels that he can rule whatever else is christian this is heathen  if our faith comments on government at all its comment must be thisthat the man should rule who does not think that he can rule  carlyles hero may say i will be king but the christian saint must say nolo episcopari if the great paradox of christianity means anything it means this that we must take the crown in our hands and go hunting in dry places and dark corners of the earth until we find the one man who feels himself unfit to wear it  carlyle was quite wrong we have not got to crown the exceptional man who knows he can rule rather we must crown the much more exceptional man who knows he cant       now this is one of the two or three vital defences of working democracy  the mere machinery of voting is not democracy though at present it is not easy to effect any simpler democratic method but even the machinery of voting is profoundly christian in this practical sensethat it is an attempt to get at the opinion of those who would be too modest to offer it  it is a mystical adventure it is specially trusting those who do not trust themselves that enigma is strictly peculiar to christendom  there is nothing really humble about the abnegation of the buddhist the mild hindoo is mild but he is not meek  but there is something psychologically christian about the idea of seeking for the opinion of the obscure rather than taking the obvious course of accepting the opinion of the prominent  to say that voting is particularly christian may seem somewhat curious  to say that canvassing is christian may seem quite crazy  but canvassing is very christian in its primary idea it is encouraging the humble it is saying to the modest man friend go up higher  or if there is some slight defect in canvassing that is in its perfect and rounded piety it is only because it may possibly neglect to encourage the modesty of the canvasser       aristocracy is not an institution  aristocracy is a sin generally a very venial one  it is merely the drift or slide of men into a sort of natural pomposity and praise of the powerful which is the most easy and obvious affair in the world       it is one of the hundred answers to the fugitive perversion of modern force that the promptest and boldest agencies are also the most fragile or full of sensibility  the swiftest things are the softest things  a bird is active because a bird is soft a stone is helpless because a stone is hard  the stone must by its own nature go downwards because hardness is weakness the bird can of its nature go upwards because fragility is force in perfect force there is a kind of frivolity an airiness that can maintain itself in the air  modern investigators of miraculous history have solemnly admitted that a characteristic of the great saints is their power of levitation  they might go further a characteristic of the great saints is their power of levity angels can fly because they can take themselves lightly this has been always the instinct of christendom and especially the instinct of christian art  remember how fra angelico represented all his angels not only as birds but almost as butterflies remember how the most earnest mediaeval art was full of light and fluttering draperies of quick and capering feet  it was the one thing that the modern preraphaelites could not imitate in the real preraphaelites burnejones could never recover the deep levity of the middle ages  in the old christian pictures the sky over every figure is like a blue or gold parachute every figure seems ready to fly up and float about in the heavens the tattered cloak of the beggar will bear him up like the rayed plumes of the angels  but the kings in their heavy gold and the proud in their robes of purple will all of their nature sink downwards for pride cannot rise to levity or levitation  pride is the downward drag of all things into an easy solemnity  one settles down into a sort of selfish seriousness but one has to rise to a gay selfforgetfulness a man falls into a brown study he reaches up at a blue sky  seriousness is not a virtue  it would be a heresy but a much more sensible heresy to say that seriousness is a vice it is really a natural trend or lapse into taking ones self gravely because it is the easiest thing to do  it is much easier to write a good times leading article than a good joke in punch for solemnity flows out of men naturally but laughter is a leap it is easy to be heavy  hard to be light  satan fell by the force of gravity       now it is the peculiar honour of europe since it has been christian that while it has had aristocracy it has always at the back of its heart treated aristocracy as a weaknessgenerally as a weakness that must be allowed for  if any one wishes to appreciate this point let him go outside christianity into some other philosophical atmosphere let him for instance compare the classes of europe with the castes of india  there aristocracy is far more awful because it is far more intellectual  it is seriously felt that the scale of classes is a scale of spiritual values that the baker is better than the butcher in an invisible and sacred sense  but no christianity not even the most ignorant or perverse ever suggested that a baronet was better than a butcher in that sacred sense  no christianity however ignorant or extravagant ever suggested that a duke would not be damned  in pagan society there may have been i do not know some such serious division between the free man and the slave but in christian society we have always thought the gentleman a sort of joke though i admit that in some great crusades and councils he earned the right to be called a practical joke but we in europe never really and at the root of our souls took aristocracy seriously  it is only an occasional noneuropean alien such as dr oscar levy the only intelligent nietzscheite who can even manage for a moment to take aristocracy seriously it may be a mere patriotic bias though i do not think so but it seems to me that the english aristocracy is not only the type but is the crown and flower of all actual aristocracies it has all the oligarchical virtues as well as all the defects  it is casual it is kind it is courageous in obvious matters but it has one great merit that overlaps even these  the great and very obvious merit of the english aristocracy is that nobody could possibly take it seriously       in short i had spelled out slowly as usual the need for an equal law in utopia and as usual i found that christianity had been there before me  the whole history of my utopia has the same amusing sadness  i was always rushing out of my architectural study with plans for a new turret only to find it sitting up there in the sunlight shining and a thousand years old  for me in the ancient and partly in the modern sense god answered the prayer prevent us o lord in all our doings  without vanity i really think there was a moment when i could have invented the marriage vow as an institution out of my own head but i discovered with a sigh that it had been invented already  but since it would be too long a business to show how fact by fact and inch by inch my own conception of utopia was only answered in the new jerusalem i will take this one case of the matter of marriage as indicating the converging drift i may say the converging crash of all the rest       when the ordinary opponents of socialism talk about impossibilities and alterations in human nature they always miss an important distinction  in modern ideal conceptions of society there are some desires that are possibly not attainable  but there are some desires that are not desirable  that all men should live in equally beautiful houses is a dream that may or may not be attained but that all men should live in the same beautiful house is not a dream at all it is a nightmare  that a man should love all old women is an ideal that may not be attainable  but that a man should regard all old women exactly as he regards his mother is not only an unattainable ideal but an ideal which ought not to be attained i do not know if the reader agrees with me in these examples but i will add the example which has always affected me most i could never conceive or tolerate any utopia which did not leave to me the liberty for which i chiefly care the liberty to bind myself complete anarchy would not merely make it impossible to have any discipline or fidelity it would also make it impossible to have any fun  to take an obvious instance it would not be worth while to bet if a bet were not binding  the dissolution of all contracts would not only ruin morality but spoil sport now betting and such sports are only the stunted and twisted shapes of the original instinct of man for adventure and romance of which much has been said in these pages  and the perils rewards punishments and fulfilments of an adventure must be real or the adventure is only a shifting and heartless nightmare  if i bet i must be made to pay or there is no poetry in betting  if i challenge i must be made to fight or there is no poetry in challenging if i vow to be faithful i must be cursed when i am unfaithful or there is no fun in vowing  you could not even make a fairy tale from the experiences of a man who when he was swallowed by a whale might find himself at the top of the eiffel tower or when he was turned into a frog might begin to behave like a flamingo for the purpose even of the wildest romance results must be real results must be irrevocable  christian marriage is the great example of a real and irrevocable result and that is why it is the chief subject and centre of all our romantic writing and this is my last instance of the things that i should ask and ask imperatively of any social paradise i should ask to be kept to my bargain to have my oaths and engagements taken seriously i should ask utopia to avenge my honour on myself       all my modern utopian friends look at each other rather doubtfully for their ultimate hope is the dissolution of all special ties but again i seem to hear like a kind of echo an answer from beyond the world  you will have real obligations and therefore real adventures when you get to my utopia  but the hardest obligation and the steepest adventure is to get there    viii the romance of orthodoxy        it is customary to complain of the bustle and strenuousness of our epoch  but in truth the chief mark of our epoch is a profound laziness and fatigue and the fact is that the real laziness is the cause of the apparent bustle  take one quite external case the streets are noisy with taxicabs and motorcars but this is not due to human activity but to human repose there would be less bustle if there were more activity if people were simply walking about  our world would be more silent if it were more strenuous  and this which is true of the apparent physical bustle is true also of the apparent bustle of the intellect most of the machinery of modern language is laboursaving machinery and it saves mental labour very much more than it ought scientific phrases are used like scientific wheels and pistonrods to make swifter and smoother yet the path of the comfortable long words go rattling by us like long railway trains  we know they are carrying thousands who are too tired or too indolent to walk and think for themselves  it is a good exercise to try for once in a way to express any opinion one holds in words of one syllable if you say the social utility of the indeterminate sentence is recognized by all criminologists as a part of our sociological evolution towards a more humane and scientific view of punishment you can go on talking like that for hours with hardly a movement of the gray matter inside your skull  but if you begin i wish jones to go to gaol and brown to say when jones shall come out you will discover with a thrill of horror that you are obliged to think  the long words are not the hard words it is the short words that are hard  there is much more metaphysical subtlety in the word damn than in the word degeneration       but these long comfortable words that save modern people the toil of reasoning have one particular aspect in which they are especially ruinous and confusing  this difficulty occurs when the same long word is used in different connections to mean quite different things thus to take a wellknown instance the word idealist has one meaning as a piece of philosophy and quite another as a piece of moral rhetoric  in the same way the scientific materialists have had just reason to complain of people mixing up materialist as a term of cosmology with materialist as a moral taunt so to take a cheaper instance the man who hates progressives in london always calls himself a progressive in south africa       a confusion quite as unmeaning as this has arisen in connection with the word liberal as applied to religion and as applied to politics and society  it is often suggested that all liberals ought to be freethinkers because they ought to love everything that is free  you might just as well say that all idealists ought to be high churchmen because they ought to love everything that is high you might as well say that low churchmen ought to like low mass or that broad churchmen ought to like broad jokes  the thing is a mere accident of words  in actual modern europe a freethinker does not mean a man who thinks for himself  it means a man who having thought for himself has come to one particular class of conclusions the material origin of phenomena the impossibility of miracles the improbability of personal immortality and so on and none of these ideas are particularly liberal  nay indeed almost all these ideas are definitely illiberal as it is the purpose of this chapter to show       in the few following pages i propose to point out as rapidly as possible that on every single one of the matters most strongly insisted on by liberalisers of theology their effect upon social practice would be definitely illiberal  almost every contemporary proposal to bring freedom into the church is simply a proposal to bring tyranny into the world  for freeing the church now does not even mean freeing it in all directions  it means freeing that peculiar set of dogmas loosely called scientific dogmas of monism of pantheism or of arianism or of necessity and every one of these and we will take them one by one can be shown to be the natural ally of oppression  in fact it is a remarkable circumstance indeed not so very remarkable when one comes to think of it that most things are the allies of oppression there is only one thing that can never go past a certain point in its alliance with oppressionand that is orthodoxy  i may it is true twist orthodoxy so as partly to justify a tyrant but i can easily make up a german philosophy to justify him entirely       now let us take in order the innovations that are the notes of the new theology or the modernist church  we concluded the last chapter with the discovery of one of them  the very doctrine which is called the most oldfashioned was found to be the only safeguard of the new democracies of the earth  the doctrine seemingly most unpopular was found to be the only strength of the people in short we found that the only logical negation of oligarchy was in the affirmation of original sin  so it is i maintain in all the other cases       i take the most obvious instance first the case of miracles for some extraordinary reason there is a fixed notion that it is more liberal to disbelieve in miracles than to believe in them  why i cannot imagine nor can anybody tell me for some inconceivable cause a broad or liberal clergyman always means a man who wishes at least to diminish the number of miracles it never means a man who wishes to increase that number  it always means a man who is free to disbelieve that christ came out of his grave it never means a man who is free to believe that his own aunt came out of her grave  it is common to find trouble in a parish because the parish priest cannot admit that st peter walked on water yet how rarely do we find trouble in a parish because the clergyman says that his father walked on the serpentine  and this is not because as the swift secularist debater would immediately retort miracles cannot be believed in our experience  it is not because miracles do not happen as in the dogma which matthew arnold recited with simple faith  more supernatural things are alleged to have happened in our time than would have been possible eighty years ago men of science believe in such marvels much more than they did the most perplexing and even horrible prodigies of mind and spirit are always being unveiled in modern psychology  things that the old science at least would frankly have rejected as miracles are hourly being asserted by the new science  the only thing which is still oldfashioned enough to reject miracles is the new theology but in truth this notion that it is free to deny miracles has nothing to do with the evidence for or against them  it is a lifeless verbal prejudice of which the original life and beginning was not in the freedom of thought but simply in the dogma of materialism the man of the nineteenth century did not disbelieve in the resurrection because his liberal christianity allowed him to doubt it he disbelieved in it because his very strict materialism did not allow him to believe it  tennyson a very typical nineteenth century man uttered one of the instinctive truisms of his contemporaries when he said that there was faith in their honest doubt  there was indeed those words have a profound and even a horrible truth  in their doubt of miracles there was a faith in a fixed and godless fate a deep and sincere faith in the incurable routine of the cosmos the doubts of the agnostic were only the dogmas of the monist       of the fact and evidence of the supernatural i will speak afterwards  here we are only concerned with this clear point that in so far as the liberal idea of freedom can be said to be on either side in the discussion about miracles it is obviously on the side of miracles  reform or in the only tolerable sense progress means simply the gradual control of matter by mind a miracle simply means the swift control of matter by mind  if you wish to feed the people you may think that feeding them miraculously in the wilderness is impossiblebut you cannot think it illiberal if you really want poor children to go to the seaside you cannot think it illiberal that they should go there on flying dragons you can only think it unlikely  a holiday like liberalism only means the liberty of man  a miracle only means the liberty of god you may conscientiously deny either of them but you cannot call your denial a triumph of the liberal idea  the catholic church believed that man and god both had a sort of spiritual freedom calvinism took away the freedom from man but left it to god scientific materialism binds the creator himself it chains up god as the apocalypse chained the devil  it leaves nothing free in the universe  and those who assist this process are called the liberal theologians       this as i say is the lightest and most evident case the assumption that there is something in the doubt of miracles akin to liberality or reform is literally the opposite of the truth if a man cannot believe in miracles there is an end of the matter he is not particularly liberal but he is perfectly honourable and logical which are much better things  but if he can believe in miracles he is certainly the more liberal for doing so because they mean first the freedom of the soul and secondly its control over the tyranny of circumstance  sometimes this truth is ignored in a singularly naive way even by the ablest men for instance mr bernard shaw speaks with hearty oldfashioned contempt for the idea of miracles as if they were a sort of breach of faith on the part of nature  he seems strangely unconscious that miracles are only the final flowers of his own favourite tree the doctrine of the omnipotence of will  just in the same way he calls the desire for immortality a paltry selfishness forgetting that he has just called the desire for life a healthy and heroic selfishness how can it be noble to wish to make ones life infinite and yet mean to wish to make it immortal  no if it is desirable that man should triumph over the cruelty of nature or custom then miracles are certainly desirable we will discuss afterwards whether they are possible       but i must pass on to the larger cases of this curious error the notion that the liberalising of religion in some way helps the liberation of the world  the second example of it can be found in the question of pantheismor rather of a certain modern attitude which is often called immanentism and which often is buddhism but this is so much more difficult a matter that i must approach it with rather more preparation       the things said most confidently by advanced persons to crowded audiences are generally those quite opposite to the fact it is actually our truisms that are untrue  here is a case there is a phrase of facile liberality uttered again and again at ethical societies and parliaments of religion  the religions of the earth differ in rites and forms but they are the same in what they teach  it is false it is the opposite of the fact the religions of the earth do not greatly differ in rites and forms they do greatly differ in what they teach  it is as if a man were to say do not be misled by the fact that the church times and the freethinker look utterly different that one is painted on vellum and the other carved on marble that one is triangular and the other hectagonal read them and you will see that they say the same thing  the truth is of course that they are alike in everything except in the fact that they dont say the same thing an atheist stockbroker in surbiton looks exactly like a swedenborgian stockbroker in wimbledon  you may walk round and round them and subject them to the most personal and offensive study without seeing anything swedenborgian in the hat or anything particularly godless in the umbrella  it is exactly in their souls that they are divided  so the truth is that the difficulty of all the creeds of the earth is not as alleged in this cheap maxim  that they agree in meaning but differ in machinery  it is exactly the opposite they agree in machinery almost every great religion on earth works with the same external methods with priests scriptures altars sworn brotherhoods special feasts  they agree in the mode of teaching what they differ about is the thing to be taught pagan optimists and eastern pessimists would both have temples just as liberals and tories would both have newspapers  creeds that exist to destroy each other both have scriptures just as armies that exist to destroy each other both have guns       the great example of this alleged identity of all human religions is the alleged spiritual identity of buddhism and christianity those who adopt this theory generally avoid the ethics of most other creeds except indeed confucianism which they like because it is not a creed  but they are cautious in their praises of mahommedanism generally confining themselves to imposing its morality only upon the refreshment of the lower classes they seldom suggest the mahommedan view of marriage for which there is a great deal to be said and towards thugs and fetish worshippers their attitude may even be called cold  but in the case of the great religion of gautama they feel sincerely a similarity       students of popular science like mr blatchford are always insisting that christianity and buddhism are very much alike especially buddhism  this is generally believed and i believed it myself until i read a book giving the reasons for it the reasons were of two kinds  resemblances that meant nothing because they were common to all humanity and resemblances which were not resemblances at all  the author solemnly explained that the two creeds were alike in things in which all creeds are alike or else he described them as alike in some point in which they are quite obviously different  thus as a case of the first class he said that both christ and buddha were called by the divine voice coming out of the sky as if you would expect the divine voice to come out of the coalcellar or again it was gravely urged that these two eastern teachers by a singular coincidence both had to do with the washing of feet  you might as well say that it was a remarkable coincidence that they both had feet to wash  and the other class of similarities were those which simply were not similar thus this reconciler of the two religions draws earnest attention to the fact that at certain religious feasts the robe of the lama is rent in pieces out of respect and the remnants highly valued but this is the reverse of a resemblance for the garments of christ were not rent in pieces out of respect but out of derision and the remnants were not highly valued except for what they would fetch in the rag shops  it is rather like alluding to the obvious connection between the two ceremonies of the sword  when it taps a mans shoulder and when it cuts off his head  it is not at all similar for the man  these scraps of puerile pedantry would indeed matter little if it were not also true that the alleged philosophical resemblances are also of these two kinds either proving too much or not proving anything  that buddhism approves of mercy or of selfrestraint is not to say that it is specially like christianity it is only to say that it is not utterly unlike all human existence buddhists disapprove in theory of cruelty or excess because all sane human beings disapprove in theory of cruelty or excess but to say that buddhism and christianity give the same philosophy of these things is simply false  all humanity does agree that we are in a net of sin  most of humanity agrees that there is some way out but as to what is the way out i do not think that there are two institutions in the universe which contradict each other so flatly as buddhism and christianity       even when i thought with most other wellinformed though unscholarly people that buddhism and christianity were alike there was one thing about them that always perplexed me i mean the startling difference in their type of religious art i do not mean in its technical style of representation but in the things that it was manifestly meant to represent no two ideals could be more opposite than a christian saint in a gothic cathedral and a buddhist saint in a chinese temple the opposition exists at every point but perhaps the shortest statement of it is that the buddhist saint always has his eyes shut while the christian saint always has them very wide open the buddhist saint has a sleek and harmonious body but his eyes are heavy and sealed with sleep  the mediaeval saints body is wasted to its crazy bones but his eyes are frightfully alive there cannot be any real community of spirit between forces that produced symbols so different as that  granted that both images are extravagances are perversions of the pure creed it must be a real divergence which could produce such opposite extravagances the buddhist is looking with a peculiar intentness inwards the christian is staring with a frantic intentness outwards  if we follow that clue steadily we shall find some interesting things       a short time ago mrs besant in an interesting essay announced that there was only one religion in the world that all faiths were only versions or perversions of it and that she was quite prepared to say what it was  according to mrs besant this universal church is simply the universal self  it is the doctrine that we are really all one person that there are no real walls of individuality between man and man  if i may put it so she does not tell us to love our neighbours she tells us to be our neighbours that is mrs besants thoughtful and suggestive description of the religion in which all men must find themselves in agreement and i never heard of any suggestion in my life with which i more violently disagree  i want to love my neighbour not because he is i but precisely because he is not i i want to adore the world not as one likes a lookingglass because it is ones self but as one loves a woman because she is entirely different if souls are separate love is possible  if souls are united love is obviously impossible  a man may be said loosely to love himself but he can hardly fall in love with himself or if he does it must be a monotonous courtship  if the world is full of real selves they can be really unselfish selves  but upon mrs besants principle the whole cosmos is only one enormously selfish person       it is just here that buddhism is on the side of modern pantheism and immanence  and it is just here that christianity is on the side of humanity and liberty and love  love desires personality therefore love desires division  it is the instinct of christianity to be glad that god has broken the universe into little pieces because they are living pieces  it is her instinct to say little children love one another rather than to tell one large person to love himself  this is the intellectual abyss between buddhism and christianity that for the buddhist or theosophist personality is the fall of man for the christian it is the purpose of god the whole point of his cosmic idea  the worldsoul of the theosophists asks man to love it only in order that man may throw himself into it but the divine centre of christianity actually threw man out of it in order that he might love it  the oriental deity is like a giant who should have lost his leg or hand and be always seeking to find it but the christian power is like some giant who in a strange generosity should cut off his right hand so that it might of its own accord shake hands with him  we come back to the same tireless note touching the nature of christianity all modern philosophies are chains which connect and fetter christianity is a sword which separates and sets free  no other philosophy makes god actually rejoice in the separation of the universe into living souls but according to orthodox christianity this separation between god and man is sacred because this is eternal  that a man may love god it is necessary that there should be not only a god to be loved but a man to love him  all those vague theosophical minds for whom the universe is an immense meltingpot are exactly the minds which shrink instinctively from that earthquake saying of our gospels which declare that the son of god came not with peace but with a sundering sword  the saying rings entirely true even considered as what it obviously is the statement that any man who preaches real love is bound to beget hate  it is as true of democratic fraternity as a divine love sham love ends in compromise and common philosophy but real love has always ended in bloodshed  yet there is another and yet more awful truth behind the obvious meaning of this utterance of our lord  according to himself the son was a sword separating brother and brother that they should for an aeon hate each other but the father also was a sword which in the black beginning separated brother and brother so that they should love each other at last       this is the meaning of that almost insane happiness in the eyes of the mediaeval saint in the picture  this is the meaning of the sealed eyes of the superb buddhist image  the christian saint is happy because he has verily been cut off from the world he is separate from things and is staring at them in astonishment but why should the buddhist saint be astonished at things since there is really only one thing and that being impersonal can hardly be astonished at itself  there have been many pantheist poems suggesting wonder but no really successful ones  the pantheist cannot wonder for he cannot praise god or praise anything as really distinct from himself  our immediate business here however is with the effect of this christian admiration which strikes outwards towards a deity distinct from the worshipper upon the general need for ethical activity and social reform  and surely its effect is sufficiently obvious  there is no real possibility of getting out of pantheism any special impulse to moral action for pantheism implies in its nature that one thing is as good as another whereas action implies in its nature that one thing is greatly preferable to another  swinburne in the high summer of his scepticism tried in vain to wrestle with this difficulty in songs before sunrise written under the inspiration of garibaldi and the revolt of italy he proclaimed the newer religion and the purer god which should wither up all the priests of the world  what doest thou now      looking godward to cry      i am i thou art thou      i am low thou art high      i am thou that thou seekest to find him find thou but thyself thou art i       of which the immediate and evident deduction is that tyrants are as much the sons of god as garibaldis and that king bomba of naples having with the utmost success found himself is identical with the ultimate good in all things  the truth is that the western energy that dethrones tyrants has been directly due to the western theology that says i am i thou art thou the same spiritual separation which looked up and saw a good king in the universe looked up and saw a bad king in naples  the worshippers of bombas god dethroned bomba  the worshippers of swinburnes god have covered asia for centuries and have never dethroned a tyrant the indian saint may reasonably shut his eyes because he is looking at that which is i and thou and we and they and it it is a rational occupation  but it is not true in theory and not true in fact that it helps the indian to keep an eye on lord curzon that external vigilance which has always been the mark of christianity the command that we should watch and pray has expressed itself both in typical western orthodoxy and in typical western politics but both depend on the idea of a divinity transcendent different from ourselves a deity that disappears  certainly the most sagacious creeds may suggest that we should pursue god into deeper and deeper rings of the labyrinth of our own ego  but only we of christendom have said that we should hunt god like an eagle upon the mountains and we have killed all monsters in the chase       here again therefore we find that in so far as we value democracy and the selfrenewing energies of the west we are much more likely to find them in the old theology than the new if we want reform we must adhere to orthodoxy  especially in this matter so much disputed in the counsels of mr rjcampbell the matter of insisting on the immanent or the transcendent deity by insisting specially on the immanence of god we get introspection selfisolation quietism social indifferencetibet  by insisting specially on the transcendence of god we get wonder curiosity moral and political adventure righteous indignationchristendom insisting that god is inside man man is always inside himself by insisting that god transcends man man has transcended himself       if we take any other doctrine that has been called oldfashioned we shall find the case the same  it is the same for instance in the deep matter of the trinity  unitarians a sect never to be mentioned without a special respect for their distinguished intellectual dignity and high intellectual honour are often reformers by the accident that throws so many small sects into such an attitude but there is nothing in the least liberal or akin to reform in the substitution of pure monotheism for the trinity  the complex god of the athanasian creed may be an enigma for the intellect but he is far less likely to gather the mystery and cruelty of a sultan than the lonely god of omar or mahomet  the god who is a mere awful unity is not only a king but an eastern king the heart of humanity especially of european humanity is certainly much more satisfied by the strange hints and symbols that gather round the trinitarian idea the image of a council at which mercy pleads as well as justice the conception of a sort of liberty and variety existing even in the inmost chamber of the world for western religion has always felt keenly the idea it is not well for man to be alone  the social instinct asserted itself everywhere as when the eastern idea of hermits was practically expelled by the western idea of monks  so even asceticism became brotherly and the trappists were sociable even when they were silent if this love of a living complexity be our test it is certainly healthier to have the trinitarian religion than the unitarian for to us trinitarians if i may say it with reverenceto us god himself is a society  it is indeed a fathomless mystery of theology and even if i were theologian enough to deal with it directly it would not be relevant to do so here  suffice it to say here that this triple enigma is as comforting as wine and open as an english fireside that this thing that bewilders the intellect utterly quiets the heart but out of the desert from the dry places and the dreadful suns come the cruel children of the lonely god the real unitarians who with scimitar in hand have laid waste the world  for it is not well for god to be alone       again the same is true of that difficult matter of the danger of the soul which has unsettled so many just minds  to hope for all souls is imperative and it is quite tenable that their salvation is inevitable  it is tenable but it is not specially favourable to activity or progress  our fighting and creative society ought rather to insist on the danger of everybody on the fact that every man is hanging by a thread or clinging to a precipice to say that all will be well anyhow is a comprehensible remark but it cannot be called the blast of a trumpet  europe ought rather to emphasize possible perdition and europe always has emphasized it here its highest religion is at one with all its cheapest romances to the buddhist or the eastern fatalist existence is a science or a plan which must end up in a certain way  but to a christian existence is a story which may end up in any way  in a thrilling novel that purely christian product the hero is not eaten by cannibals but it is essential to the existence of the thrill that he might be eaten by cannibals  the hero must so to speak be an eatable hero  so christian morals have always said to the man not that he would lose his soul but that he must take care that he didnt in christian morals in short it is wicked to call a man damned but it is strictly religious and philosophic to call him damnable       all christianity concentrates on the man at the crossroads the vast and shallow philosophies the huge syntheses of humbug all talk about ages and evolution and ultimate developments the true philosophy is concerned with the instant  will a man take this road or thatthat is the only thing to think about if you enjoy thinking  the aeons are easy enough to think about any one can think about them  the instant is really awful and it is because our religion has intensely felt the instant that it has in literature dealt much with battle and in theology dealt much with hell  it is full of danger like a boys book it is at an immortal crisis  there is a great deal of real similarity between popular fiction and the religion of the western people if you say that popular fiction is vulgar and tawdry you only say what the dreary and wellinformed say also about the images in the catholic churches  life according to the faith is very like a serial story in a magazine  life ends with the promise or menace to be continued in our next  also with a noble vulgarity life imitates the serial and leaves off at the exciting moment for death is distinctly an exciting moment       but the point is that a story is exciting because it has in it so strong an element of will of what theology calls freewill you cannot finish a sum how you like  but you can finish a story how you like  when somebody discovered the differential calculus there was only one differential calculus he could discover but when shakespeare killed romeo he might have married him to juliets old nurse if he had felt inclined  and christendom has excelled in the narrative romance exactly because it has insisted on the theological freewill it is a large matter and too much to one side of the road to be discussed adequately here but this is the real objection to that torrent of modern talk about treating crime as disease about making a prison merely a hygienic environment like a hospital of healing sin by slow scientific methods the fallacy of the whole thing is that evil is a matter of active choice whereas disease is not  if you say that you are going to cure a profligate as you cure an asthmatic my cheap and obvious answer is produce the people who want to be asthmatics as many people want to be profligates  a man may lie still and be cured of a malady but he must not lie still if he wants to be cured of a sin on the contrary he must get up and jump about violently the whole point indeed is perfectly expressed in the very word which we use for a man in hospital patient is in the passive mood sinner is in the active  if a man is to be saved from influenza he may be a patient  but if he is to be saved from forging he must be not a patient but an impatient  he must be personally impatient with forgery  all moral reform must start in the active not the passive will       here again we reach the same substantial conclusion  in so far as we desire the definite reconstructions and the dangerous revolutions which have distinguished european civilization we shall not discourage the thought of possible ruin we shall rather encourage it if we want like the eastern saints merely to contemplate how right things are of course we shall only say that they must go right but if we particularly want to make them go right we must insist that they may go wrong       lastly this truth is yet again true in the case of the common modern attempts to diminish or to explain away the divinity of christ the thing may be true or not that i shall deal with before i end but if the divinity is true it is certainly terribly revolutionary that a good man may have his back to the wall is no more than we knew already but that god could have his back to the wall is a boast for all insurgents for ever  christianity is the only religion on earth that has felt that omnipotence made god incomplete christianity alone has felt that god to be wholly god must have been a rebel as well as a king  alone of all creeds christianity has added courage to the virtues of the creator for the only courage worth calling courage must necessarily mean that the soul passes a breaking pointand does not break in this indeed i approach a matter more dark and awful than it is easy to discuss and i apologise in advance if any of my phrases fall wrong or seem irreverent touching a matter which the greatest saints and thinkers have justly feared to approach but in that terrific tale of the passion there is a distinct emotional suggestion that the author of all things in some unthinkable way went not only through agony but through doubt  it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god  no but the lord thy god may tempt himself and it seems as if this was what happened in gethsemane in a garden satan tempted man  and in a garden god tempted god he passed in some superhuman manner through our human horror of pessimism  when the world shook and the sun was wiped out of heaven it was not at the crucifixion but at the cry from the cross the cry which confessed that god was forsaken of god  and now let the revolutionists choose a creed from all the creeds and a god from all the gods of the world carefully weighing all the gods of inevitable recurrence and of unalterable power  they will not find another god who has himself been in revolt  nay the matter grows too difficult for human speech but let the atheists themselves choose a god they will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation only one religion in which god seemed for an instant to be an atheist       these can be called the essentials of the old orthodoxy of which the chief merit is that it is the natural fountain of revolution and reform and of which the chief defect is that it is obviously only an abstract assertion  its main advantage is that it is the most adventurous and manly of all theologies its chief disadvantage is simply that it is a theology  it can always be urged against it that it is in its nature arbitrary and in the air but it is not so high in the air but that great archers spend their whole lives in shooting arrows at ityes and their last arrows there are men who will ruin themselves and ruin their civilization if they may ruin also this old fantastic tale  this is the last and most astounding fact about this faith that its enemies will use any weapon against it the swords that cut their own fingers and the firebrands that burn their own homes  men who begin to fight the church for the sake of freedom and humanity end by flinging away freedom and humanity if only they may fight the church this is no exaggeration i could fill a book with the instances of it mr blatchford set out as an ordinary biblesmasher to prove that adam was guiltless of sin against god in manoeuvring so as to maintain this he admitted as a mere side issue that all the tyrants from nero to king leopold were guiltless of any sin against humanity i know a man who has such a passion for proving that he will have no personal existence after death that he falls back on the position that he has no personal existence now  he invokes buddhism and says that all souls fade into each other in order to prove that he cannot go to heaven he proves that he cannot go to hartlepool i have known people who protested against religious education with arguments against any education saying that the childs mind must grow freely or that the old must not teach the young  i have known people who showed that there could be no divine judgment by showing that there can be no human judgment even for practical purposes they burned their own corn to set fire to the church they smashed their own tools to smash it any stick was good enough to beat it with though it were the last stick of their own dismembered furniture we do not admire we hardly excuse the fanatic who wrecks this world for love of the other  but what are we to say of the fanatic who wrecks this world out of hatred of the other  he sacrifices the very existence of humanity to the nonexistence of god he offers his victims not to the altar but merely to assert the idleness of the altar and the emptiness of the throne he is ready to ruin even that primary ethic by which all things live for his strange and eternal vengeance upon some one who never lived at all       and yet the thing hangs in the heavens unhurt  its opponents only succeed in destroying all that they themselves justly hold dear they do not destroy orthodoxy they only destroy political and common courage sense  they do not prove that adam was not responsible to god how could they prove it  they only prove from their premises that the czar is not responsible to russia they do not prove that adam should not have been punished by god they only prove that the nearest sweater should not be punished by men with their oriental doubts about personality they do not make certain that we shall have no personal life hereafter they only make certain that we shall not have a very jolly or complete one here with their paralysing hints of all conclusions coming out wrong they do not tear the book of the recording angel they only make it a little harder to keep the books of marshall  snelgrove not only is the faith the mother of all worldly energies but its foes are the fathers of all worldly confusion  the secularists have not wrecked divine things but the secularists have wrecked secular things if that is any comfort to them  the titans did not scale heaven but they laid waste the world    ix authority and the adventurer        the last chapter has been concerned with the contention that orthodoxy is not only as is often urged the only safe guardian of morality or order but is also the only logical guardian of liberty innovation and advance  if we wish to pull down the prosperous oppressor we cannot do it with the new doctrine of human perfectibility we can do it with the old doctrine of original sin  if we want to uproot inherent cruelties or lift up lost populations we cannot do it with the scientific theory that matter precedes mind we can do it with the supernatural theory that mind precedes matter if we wish specially to awaken people to social vigilance and tireless pursuit of practise we cannot help it much by insisting on the immanent god and the inner light  for these are at best reasons for contentment we can help it much by insisting on the transcendent god and the flying and escaping gleam for that means divine discontent  if we wish particularly to assert the idea of a generous balance against that of a dreadful autocracy we shall instinctively be trinitarian rather than unitarian  if we desire european civilization to be a raid and a rescue we shall insist rather that souls are in real peril than that their peril is ultimately unreal  and if we wish to exalt the outcast and the crucified we shall rather wish to think that a veritable god was crucified rather than a mere sage or hero  above all if we wish to protect the poor we shall be in favour of fixed rules and clear dogmas the rules of a club are occasionally in favour of the poor member the drift of a club is always in favour of the rich one       and now we come to the crucial question which truly concludes the whole matter  a reasonable agnostic if he has happened to agree with me so far may justly turn round and say you have found a practical philosophy in the doctrine of the fall very well you have found a side of democracy now dangerously neglected wisely asserted in original sin all right  you have found a truth in the doctrine of hell i congratulate you  you are convinced that worshippers of a personal god look outwards and are progressive i congratulate them  but even supposing that those doctrines do include those truths why cannot you take the truths and leave the doctrines  granted that all modern society is trusting the rich too much because it does not allow for human weakness granted that orthodox ages have had a great advantage because believing in the fall they did allow for human weakness why cannot you simply allow for human weakness without believing in the fall if you have discovered that the idea of damnation represents a healthy idea of danger why can you not simply take the idea of danger and leave the idea of damnation  if you see clearly the kernel of commonsense in the nut of christian orthodoxy why cannot you simply take the kernel and leave the nut why cannot you to use that cant phrase of the newspapers which i as a highly scholarly agnostic am a little ashamed of using why cannot you simply take what is good in christianity what you can define as valuable what you can comprehend and leave all the rest all the absolute dogmas that are in their nature incomprehensible this is the real question this is the last question and it is a pleasure to try to answer it       the first answer is simply to say that i am a rationalist i like to have some intellectual justification for my intuitions if i am treating man as a fallen being it is an intellectual convenience to me to believe that he fell and i find for some odd psychological reason that i can deal better with a mans exercise of freewill if i believe that he has got it  but i am in this matter yet more definitely a rationalist  i do not propose to turn this book into one of ordinary christian apologetics i should be glad to meet at any other time the enemies of christianity in that more obvious arena  here i am only giving an account of my own growth in spiritual certainty  but i may pause to remark that the more i saw of the merely abstract arguments against the christian cosmology the less i thought of them  i mean that having found the moral atmosphere of the incarnation to be common sense i then looked at the established intellectual arguments against the incarnation and found them to be common nonsense  in case the argument should be thought to suffer from the absence of the ordinary apologetic i will here very briefly summarise my own arguments and conclusions on the purely objective or scientific truth of the matter       if i am asked as a purely intellectual question why i believe in christianity i can only answer for the same reason that an intelligent agnostic disbelieves in christianity  i believe in it quite rationally upon the evidence  but the evidence in my case as in that of the intelligent agnostic is not really in this or that alleged demonstration it is in an enormous accumulation of small but unanimous facts  the secularist is not to be blamed because his objections to christianity are miscellaneous and even scrappy it is precisely such scrappy evidence that does convince the mind i mean that a man may well be less convinced of a philosophy from four books than from one book one battle one landscape and one old friend  the very fact that the things are of different kinds increases the importance of the fact that they all point to one conclusion  now the nonchristianity of the average educated man today is almost always to do him justice made up of these loose but living experiences  i can only say that my evidences for christianity are of the same vivid but varied kind as his evidences against it  for when i look at these various antichristian truths i simply discover that none of them are true i discover that the true tide and force of all the facts flows the other way  let us take cases  many a sensible modern man must have abandoned christianity under the pressure of three such converging convictions as these  first that men with their shape structure and sexuality are after all very much like beasts a mere variety of the animal kingdom second that primeval religion arose in ignorance and fear third that priests have blighted societies with bitterness and gloom  those three antichristian arguments are very different but they are all quite logical and legitimate and they all converge  the only objection to them i discover is that they are all untrue  if you leave off looking at books about beasts and men if you begin to look at beasts and men then if you have any humour or imagination any sense of the frantic or the farcical you will observe that the startling thing is not how like man is to the brutes but how unlike he is  it is the monstrous scale of his divergence that requires an explanation that man and brute are like is in a sense a truism but that being so like they should then be so insanely unlike that is the shock and the enigma  that an ape has hands is far less interesting to the philosopher than the fact that having hands he does next to nothing with them does not play knucklebones or the violin does not carve marble or carve mutton  people talk of barbaric architecture and debased art  but elephants do not build colossal temples of ivory even in a roccoco style camels do not paint even bad pictures though equipped with the material of many camelshair brushes certain modern dreamers say that ants and bees have a society superior to ours  they have indeed a civilization but that very truth only reminds us that it is an inferior civilization  who ever found an anthill decorated with the statues of celebrated ants who has seen a beehive carved with the images of gorgeous queens of old  no the chasm between man and other creatures may have a natural explanation but it is a chasm  we talk of wild animals but man is the only wild animal  it is man that has broken out all other animals are tame animals following the rugged respectability of the tribe or type  all other animals are domestic animals man alone is ever undomestic either as a profligate or a monk so that this first superficial reason for materialism is if anything a reason for its opposite it is exactly where biology leaves off that all religion begins       it would be the same if i examined the second of the three chance rationalist arguments the argument that all that we call divine began in some darkness and terror  when i did attempt to examine the foundations of this modern idea i simply found that there were none  science knows nothing whatever about prehistoric man for the excellent reason that he is prehistoric a few professors choose to conjecture that such things as human sacrifice were once innocent and general and that they gradually dwindled but there is no direct evidence of it and the small amount of indirect evidence is very much the other way  in the earliest legends we have such as the tales of isaac and of iphigenia human sacrifice is not introduced as something old but rather as something new as a strange and frightful exception darkly demanded by the gods history says nothing and legends all say that the earth was kinder in its earliest time  there is no tradition of progress but the whole human race has a tradition of the fall  amusingly enough indeed the very dissemination of this idea is used against its authenticity learned men literally say that this prehistoric calamity cannot be true because every race of mankind remembers it  i cannot keep pace with these paradoxes       and if we took the third chance instance it would be the same the view that priests darken and embitter the world  i look at the world and simply discover that they dont those countries in europe which are still influenced by priests are exactly the countries where there is still singing and dancing and coloured dresses and art in the openair catholic doctrine and discipline may be walls but they are the walls of a playground  christianity is the only frame which has preserved the pleasure of paganism  we might fancy some children playing on the flat grassy top of some tall island in the sea  so long as there was a wall round the cliffs edge they could fling themselves into every frantic game and make the place the noisiest of nurseries  but the walls were knocked down leaving the naked peril of the precipice  they did not fall over but when their friends returned to them they were all huddled in terror in the centre of the island and their song had ceased       thus these three facts of experience such facts as go to make an agnostic are in this view turned totally round  i am left saying give me an explanation first of the towering eccentricity of man among the brutes second of the vast human tradition of some ancient happiness third of the partial perpetuation of such pagan joy in the countries of the catholic church  one explanation at any rate covers all three  the theory that twice was the natural order interrupted by some explosion or revelation such as people now call psychic  once heaven came upon the earth with a power or seal called the image of god whereby man took command of nature and once again when in empire after empire men had been found wanting heaven came to save mankind in the awful shape of a man this would explain why the mass of men always look backwards and why the only corner where they in any sense look forwards is the little continent where christ has his church  i know it will be said that japan has become progressive  but how can this be an answer when even in saying japan has become progressive we really only mean japan has become european but i wish here not so much to insist on my own explanation as to insist on my original remark i agree with the ordinary unbelieving man in the street in being guided by three or four odd facts all pointing to something only when i came to look at the facts i always found they pointed to something else       i have given an imaginary triad of such ordinary antichristian arguments if that be too narrow a basis i will give on the spur of the moment another  these are the kind of thoughts which in combination create the impression that christianity is something weak and diseased  first for instance that jesus was a gentle creature sheepish and unworldly a mere ineffectual appeal to the world second that christianity arose and flourished in the dark ages of ignorance and that to these the church would drag us back third that the people still strongly religious or if you will superstitioussuch people as the irishare weak unpractical and behind the times i only mention these ideas to affirm the same thing  that when i looked into them independently i found not that the conclusions were unphilosophical but simply that the facts were not facts instead of looking at books and pictures about the new testament i looked at the new testament  there i found an account not in the least of a person with his hair parted in the middle or his hands clasped in appeal but of an extraordinary being with lips of thunder and acts of lurid decision flinging down tables casting out devils passing with the wild secrecy of the wind from mountain isolation to a sort of dreadful demagogy a being who often acted like an angry god and always like a god  christ had even a literary style of his own not to be found i think elsewhere it consists of an almost furious use of the a fortiori  his how much more is piled one upon another like castle upon castle in the clouds  the diction used about christ has been and perhaps wisely sweet and submissive but the diction used by christ is quite curiously gigantesque it is full of camels leaping through needles and mountains hurled into the sea  morally it is equally terrific he called himself a sword of slaughter and told men to buy swords if they sold their coats for them  that he used other even wilder words on the side of nonresistance greatly increases the mystery but it also if anything rather increases the violence  we cannot even explain it by calling such a being insane for insanity is usually along one consistent channel  the maniac is generally a monomaniac  here we must remember the difficult definition of christianity already given christianity is a superhuman paradox whereby two opposite passions may blaze beside each other  the one explanation of the gospel language that does explain it is that it is the survey of one who from some supernatural height beholds some more startling synthesis       i take in order the next instance offered  the idea that christianity belongs to the dark ages  here i did not satisfy myself with reading modern generalisations i read a little history and in history i found that christianity so far from belonging to the dark ages was the one path across the dark ages that was not dark it was a shining bridge connecting two shining civilizations if any one says that the faith arose in ignorance and savagery the answer is simple  it didnt it arose in the mediterranean civilization in the full summer of the roman empire  the world was swarming with sceptics and pantheism was as plain as the sun when constantine nailed the cross to the mast  it is perfectly true that afterwards the ship sank but it is far more extraordinary that the ship came up again  repainted and glittering with the cross still at the top  this is the amazing thing the religion did it turned a sunken ship into a submarine  the ark lived under the load of waters after being buried under the debris of dynasties and clans we arose and remembered rome  if our faith had been a mere fad of the fading empire fad would have followed fad in the twilight and if the civilization ever reemerged and many such have never reemerged it would have been under some new barbaric flag but the christian church was the last life of the old society and was also the first life of the new  she took the people who were forgetting how to make an arch and she taught them to invent the gothic arch  in a word the most absurd thing that could be said of the church is the thing we have all heard said of it  how can we say that the church wishes to bring us back into the dark ages the church was the only thing that ever brought us out of them       i added in this second trinity of objections an idle instance taken from those who feel such people as the irish to be weakened or made stagnant by superstition  i only added it because this is a peculiar case of a statement of fact that turns out to be a statement of falsehood  it is constantly said of the irish that they are impractical  but if we refrain for a moment from looking at what is said about them and look at what is done about them we shall see that the irish are not only practical but quite painfully successful  the poverty of their country the minority of their members are simply the conditions under which they were asked to work but no other group in the british empire has done so much with such conditions  the nationalists were the only minority that ever succeeded in twisting the whole british parliament sharply out of its path  the irish peasants are the only poor men in these islands who have forced their masters to disgorge  these people whom we call priestridden are the only britons who will not be squireridden and when i came to look at the actual irish character the case was the same  irishmen are best at the specially hard professionsthe trades of iron the lawyer and the soldier in all these cases therefore i came back to the same conclusion the sceptic was quite right to go by the facts only he had not looked at the facts  the sceptic is too credulous he believes in newspapers or even in encyclopedias  again the three questions left me with three very antagonistic questions  the average sceptic wanted to know how i explained the nambypamby note in the gospel the connection of the creed with mediaeval darkness and the political impracticability of the celtic christians  but i wanted to ask and to ask with an earnestness amounting to urgency what is this incomparable energy which appears first in one walking the earth like a living judgment and this energy which can die with a dying civilization and yet force it to a resurrection from the dead this energy which last of all can inflame a bankrupt peasantry with so fixed a faith in justice that they get what they ask while others go empty away so that the most helpless island of the empire can actually help itself       there is an answer  it is an answer to say that the energy is truly from outside the world that it is psychic or at least one of the results of a real psychical disturbance  the highest gratitude and respect are due to the great human civilizations such as the old egyptian or the existing chinese  nevertheless it is no injustice for them to say that only modern europe has exhibited incessantly a power of selfrenewal recurring often at the shortest intervals and descending to the smallest facts of building or costume all other societies die finally and with dignity  we die daily we are always being born again with almost indecent obstetrics it is hardly an exaggeration to say that there is in historic christendom a sort of unnatural life  it could be explained as a supernatural life  it could be explained as an awful galvanic life working in what would have been a corpse  for our civilization ought to have died by all parallels by all sociological probability in the ragnorak of the end of rome  that is the weird inspiration of our estate  you and i have no business to be here at all  we are all revenants all living christians are dead pagans walking about just as europe was about to be gathered in silence to assyria and babylon something entered into its body  and europe has had a strange lifeit is not too much to say that it has had the jumps ever since       i have dealt at length with such typical triads of doubt in order to convey the main contentionthat my own case for christianity is rational but it is not simple  it is an accumulation of varied facts like the attitude of the ordinary agnostic but the ordinary agnostic has got his facts all wrong he is a nonbeliever for a multitude of reasons but they are untrue reasons  he doubts because the middle ages were barbaric but they werent because darwinism is demonstrated but it isnt because miracles do not happen but they do because monks were lazy but they were very industrious because nuns are unhappy but they are particularly cheerful because christian art was sad and pale but it was picked out in peculiarly bright colours and gay with gold because modern science is moving away from the supernatural but it isnt it is moving towards the supernatural with the rapidity of a railway train       but among these million facts all flowing one way there is of course one question sufficiently solid and separate to be treated briefly but by itself i mean the objective occurrence of the supernatural  in another chapter i have indicated the fallacy of the ordinary supposition that the world must be impersonal because it is orderly  a person is just as likely to desire an orderly thing as a disorderly thing  but my own positive conviction that personal creation is more conceivable than material fate is i admit in a sense undiscussable  i will not call it a faith or an intuition for those words are mixed up with mere emotion it is strictly an intellectual conviction but it is a primary intellectual conviction like the certainty of self of the good of living any one who likes therefore may call my belief in god merely mystical the phrase is not worth fighting about  but my belief that miracles have happened in human history is not a mystical belief at all i believe in them upon human evidences as i do in the discovery of america upon this point there is a simple logical fact that only requires to be stated and cleared up  somehow or other an extraordinary idea has arisen that the disbelievers in miracles consider them coldly and fairly while believers in miracles accept them only in connection with some dogma  the fact is quite the other way the believers in miracles accept them rightly or wrongly because they have evidence for them  the disbelievers in miracles deny them rightly or wrongly because they have a doctrine against them the open obvious democratic thing is to believe an old applewoman when she bears testimony to a miracle just as you believe an old applewoman when she bears testimony to a murder  the plain popular course is to trust the peasants word about the ghost exactly as far as you trust the peasants word about the landlord being a peasant he will probably have a great deal of healthy agnosticism about both  still you could fill the british museum with evidence uttered by the peasant and given in favour of the ghost if it comes to human testimony there is a choking cataract of human testimony in favour of the supernatural  if you reject it you can only mean one of two things  you reject the peasants story about the ghost either because the man is a peasant or because the story is a ghost story  that is you either deny the main principle of democracy or you affirm the main principle of materialism the abstract impossibility of miracle  you have a perfect right to do so but in that case you are the dogmatist  it is we christians who accept all actual evidenceit is you rationalists who refuse actual evidence being constrained to do so by your creed but i am not constrained by any creed in the matter and looking impartially into certain miracles of mediaeval and modern times i have come to the conclusion that they occurred  all argument against these plain facts is always argument in a circle  if i say mediaeval documents attest certain miracles as much as they attest certain battles they answer but mediaevals were superstitious if i want to know in what they were superstitious the only ultimate answer is that they believed in the miracles  if i say a peasant saw a ghost i am told but peasants are so credulous if i ask why credulous the only answer isthat they see ghosts iceland is impossible because only stupid sailors have seen it and the sailors are only stupid because they say they have seen iceland it is only fair to add that there is another argument that the unbeliever may rationally use against miracles though he himself generally forgets to use it       he may say that there has been in many miraculous stories a notion of spiritual preparation and acceptance  in short that the miracle could only come to him who believed in it it may be so and if it is so how are we to test it  if we are inquiring whether certain results follow faith it is useless to repeat wearily that if they happen they do follow faith if faith is one of the conditions those without faith have a most healthy right to laugh  but they have no right to judge being a believer may be if you like as bad as being drunk still if we were extracting psychological facts from drunkards it would be absurd to be always taunting them with having been drunk suppose we were investigating whether angry men really saw a red mist before their eyes  suppose sixty excellent householders swore that when angry they had seen this crimson cloud  surely it would be absurd to answer oh but you admit you were angry at the time they might reasonably rejoin in a stentorian chorus how the blazes could we discover without being angry whether angry people see red so the saints and ascetics might rationally reply suppose that the question is whether believers can see visionseven then if you are interested in visions it is no point to object to believers you are still arguing in a circlein that old mad circle with which this book began       the question of whether miracles ever occur is a question of common sense and of ordinary historical imagination  not of any final physical experiment  one may here surely dismiss that quite brainless piece of pedantry which talks about the need for scientific conditions in connection with alleged spiritual phenomena  if we are asking whether a dead soul can communicate with a living it is ludicrous to insist that it shall be under conditions in which no two living souls in their senses would seriously communicate with each other the fact that ghosts prefer darkness no more disproves the existence of ghosts than the fact that lovers prefer darkness disproves the existence of love  if you choose to say i will believe that miss brown called her fiance a periwinkle or any other endearing term if she will repeat the word before seventeen psychologists then i shall reply very well if those are your conditions you will never get the truth for she certainly will not say it it is just as unscientific as it is unphilosophical to be surprised that in an unsympathetic atmosphere certain extraordinary sympathies do not arise  it is as if i said that i could not tell if there was a fog because the air was not clear enough or as if i insisted on perfect sunlight in order to see a solar eclipse       as a commonsense conclusion such as those to which we come about sex or about midnight well knowing that many details must in their own nature be concealed i conclude that miracles do happen i am forced to it by a conspiracy of facts  the fact that the men who encounter elves or angels are not the mystics and the morbid dreamers but fishermen farmers and all men at once coarse and cautious the fact that we all know men who testify to spiritualistic incidents but are not spiritualists the fact that science itself admits such things more and more every day  science will even admit the ascension if you call it levitation and will very likely admit the resurrection when it has thought of another word for it i suggest the regalvanisation  but the strongest of all is the dilemma above mentioned that these supernatural things are never denied except on the basis either of antidemocracy or of materialist dogmatismi may say materialist mysticism  the sceptic always takes one of the two positions either an ordinary man need not be believed or an extraordinary event must not be believed for i hope we may dismiss the argument against wonders attempted in the mere recapitulation of frauds of swindling mediums or trick miracles  that is not an argument at all good or bad a false ghost disproves the reality of ghosts exactly as much as a forged banknote disproves the existence of the bank of england if anything it proves its existence       given this conviction that the spiritual phenomena do occur my evidence for which is complex but rational we then collide with one of the worst mental evils of the age  the greatest disaster of the nineteenth century was this  that men began to use the word spiritual as the same as the word good they thought that to grow in refinement and uncorporeality was to grow in virtue  when scientific evolution was announced some feared that it would encourage mere animality  it did worse it encouraged mere spirituality  it taught men to think that so long as they were passing from the ape they were going to the angel but you can pass from the ape and go to the devil  a man of genius very typical of that time of bewilderment expressed it perfectly benjamin disraeli was right when he said he was on the side of the angels  he was indeed he was on the side of the fallen angels he was not on the side of any mere appetite or animal brutality but he was on the side of all the imperialism of the princes of the abyss he was on the side of arrogance and mystery and contempt of all obvious good  between this sunken pride and the towering humilities of heaven there are one must suppose spirits of shapes and sizes  man in encountering them must make much the same mistakes that he makes in encountering any other varied types in any other distant continent  it must be hard at first to know who is supreme and who is subordinate if a shade arose from the under world and stared at piccadilly that shade would not quite understand the idea of an ordinary closed carriage  he would suppose that the coachman on the box was a triumphant conqueror dragging behind him a kicking and imprisoned captive  so if we see spiritual facts for the first time we may mistake who is uppermost  it is not enough to find the gods they are obvious we must find god the real chief of the gods we must have a long historic experience in supernatural phenomena in order to discover which are really natural  in this light i find the history of christianity and even of its hebrew origins quite practical and clear  it does not trouble me to be told that the hebrew god was one among many  i know he was without any research to tell me so  jehovah and baal looked equally important just as the sun and the moon looked the same size  it is only slowly that we learn that the sun is immeasurably our master and the small moon only our satellite  believing that there is a world of spirits i shall walk in it as i do in the world of men looking for the thing that i like and think good just as i should seek in a desert for clean water or toil at the north pole to make a comfortable fire so i shall search the land of void and vision until i find something fresh like water and comforting like fire until i find some place in eternity where i am literally at home  and there is only one such place to be found       i have now said enough to show to any one to whom such an explanation is essential that i have in the ordinary arena of apologetics a ground of belief  in pure records of experiment if these be taken democratically without contempt or favour there is evidence first that miracles happen and second that the nobler miracles belong to our tradition  but i will not pretend that this curt discussion is my real reason for accepting christianity instead of taking the moral good of christianity as i should take it out of confucianism       i have another far more solid and central ground for submitting to it as a faith instead of merely picking up hints from it as a scheme  and that is this  that the christian church in its practical relation to my soul is a living teacher not a dead one it not only certainly taught me yesterday but will almost certainly teach me tomorrow once i saw suddenly the meaning of the shape of the cross some day i may see suddenly the meaning of the shape of the mitre  one fine morning i saw why windows were pointed some fine morning i may see why priests were shaven  plato has told you a truth but plato is dead  shakespeare has startled you with an image but shakespeare will not startle you with any more but imagine what it would be to live with such men still living to know that plato might break out with an original lecture tomorrow or that at any moment shakespeare might shatter everything with a single song  the man who lives in contact with what he believes to be a living church is a man always expecting to meet plato and shakespeare tomorrow at breakfast  he is always expecting to see some truth that he has never seen before  there is one only other parallel to this position and that is the parallel of the life in which we all began  when your father told you walking about the garden that bees stung or that roses smelt sweet you did not talk of taking the best out of his philosophy  when the bees stung you you did not call it an entertaining coincidence when the rose smelt sweet you did not say my father is a rude barbaric symbol enshrining perhaps unconsciously the deep delicate truths that flowers smell  no you believed your father because you had found him to be a living fountain of facts a thing that really knew more than you a thing that would tell you truth tomorrow as well as today and if this was true of your father it was even truer of your mother at least it was true of mine to whom this book is dedicated  now when society is in a rather futile fuss about the subjection of women will no one say how much every man owes to the tyranny and privilege of women to the fact that they alone rule education until education becomes futile for a boy is only sent to be taught at school when it is too late to teach him anything  the real thing has been done already and thank god it is nearly always done by women  every man is womanised merely by being born  they talk of the masculine woman but every man is a feminised man  and if ever men walk to westminster to protest against this female privilege i shall not join their procession       for i remember with certainty this fixed psychological fact that the very time when i was most under a womans authority i was most full of flame and adventure  exactly because when my mother said that ants bit they did bite and because snow did come in winter as she said therefore the whole world was to me a fairyland of wonderful fulfilments and it was like living in some hebraic age when prophecy after prophecy came true  i went out as a child into the garden and it was a terrible place to me precisely because i had a clue to it  if i had held no clue it would not have been terrible but tame  a mere unmeaning wilderness is not even impressive  but the garden of childhood was fascinating exactly because everything had a fixed meaning which could be found out in its turn  inch by inch i might discover what was the object of the ugly shape called a rake or form some shadowy conjecture as to why my parents kept a cat       so since i have accepted christendom as a mother and not merely as a chance example i have found europe and the world once more like the little garden where i stared at the symbolic shapes of cat and rake i look at everything with the old elvish ignorance and expectancy  this or that rite or doctrine may look as ugly and extraordinary as a rake but i have found by experience that such things end somehow in grass and flowers  a clergyman may be apparently as useless as a cat but he is also as fascinating for there must be some strange reason for his existence  i give one instance out of a hundred i have not myself any instinctive kinship with that enthusiasm for physical virginity which has certainly been a note of historic christianity  but when i look not at myself but at the world i perceive that this enthusiasm is not only a note of christianity but a note of paganism a note of high human nature in many spheres  the greeks felt virginity when they carved artemis the romans when they robed the vestals the worst and wildest of the great elizabethan playwrights clung to the literal purity of a woman as to the central pillar of the world above all the modern world even while mocking sexual innocence has flung itself into a generous idolatry of sexual innocence the great modern worship of children  for any man who loves children will agree that their peculiar beauty is hurt by a hint of physical sex with all this human experience allied with the christian authority i simply conclude that i am wrong and the church right or rather that i am defective while the church is universal  it takes all sorts to make a church she does not ask me to be celibate but the fact that i have no appreciation of the celibates i accept like the fact that i have no ear for music  the best human experience is against me as it is on the subject of bach celibacy is one flower in my fathers garden of which i have not been told the sweet or terrible name  but i may be told it any day       this therefore is in conclusion my reason for accepting the religion and not merely the scattered and secular truths out of the religion  i do it because the thing has not merely told this truth or that truth but has revealed itself as a truthtelling thing all other philosophies say the things that plainly seem to be true only this philosophy has again and again said the thing that does not seem to be true but is true  alone of all creeds it is convincing where it is not attractive it turns out to be right like my father in the garden  theosophists for instance will preach an obviously attractive idea like reincarnation but if we wait for its logical results they are spiritual superciliousness and the cruelty of caste  for if a man is a beggar by his own prenatal sins people will tend to despise the beggar  but christianity preaches an obviously unattractive idea such as original sin but when we wait for its results they are pathos and brotherhood and a thunder of laughter and pity for only with original sin we can at once pity the beggar and distrust the king  men of science offer us health an obvious benefit it is only afterwards that we discover that by health they mean bodily slavery and spiritual tedium orthodoxy makes us jump by the sudden brink of hell it is only afterwards that we realise that jumping was an athletic exercise highly beneficial to our health  it is only afterwards that we realise that this danger is the root of all drama and romance the strongest argument for the divine grace is simply its ungraciousness the unpopular parts of christianity turn out when examined to be the very props of the people  the outer ring of christianity is a rigid guard of ethical abnegations and professional priests but inside that inhuman guard you will find the old human life dancing like children and drinking wine like men for christianity is the only frame for pagan freedom  but in the modern philosophy the case is opposite it is its outer ring that is obviously artistic and emancipated its despair is within       and its despair is this that it does not really believe that there is any meaning in the universe therefore it cannot hope to find any romance its romances will have no plots  a man cannot expect any adventures in the land of anarchy  but a man can expect any number of adventures if he goes travelling in the land of authority  one can find no meanings in a jungle of scepticism but the man will find more and more meanings who walks through a forest of doctrine and design  here everything has a story tied to its tail like the tools or pictures in my fathers house for it is my fathers house  i end where i beganat the right end i have entered at last the gate of all good philosophy  i have come into my second childhood       but this larger and more adventurous christian universe has one final mark difficult to express yet as a conclusion of the whole matter i will attempt to express it  all the real argument about religion turns on the question of whether a man who was born upside down can tell when he comes right way up  the primary paradox of christianity is that the ordinary condition of man is not his sane or sensible condition that the normal itself is an abnormality that is the inmost philosophy of the fall  in sir oliver lodges interesting new catechism the first two questions were what are you and what then is the meaning of the fall of man i remember amusing myself by writing my own answers to the questions but i soon found that they were very broken and agnostic answers to the question what are you  i could only answer god knows and to the question what is meant by the fall  i could answer with complete sincerity that whatever i am i am not myself this is the prime paradox of our religion something that we have never in any full sense known is not only better than ourselves but even more natural to us than ourselves  and there is really no test of this except the merely experimental one with which these pages began the test of the padded cell and the open door  it is only since i have known orthodoxy that i have known mental emancipation but in conclusion it has one special application to the ultimate idea of joy       it is said that paganism is a religion of joy and christianity of sorrow it would be just as easy to prove that paganism is pure sorrow and christianity pure joy  such conflicts mean nothing and lead nowhere  everything human must have in it both joy and sorrow the only matter of interest is the manner in which the two things are balanced or divided  and the really interesting thing is this that the pagan was in the main happier and happier as he approached the earth but sadder and sadder as he approached the heavens the gaiety of the best paganism as in the playfulness of catullus or theocritus is indeed an eternal gaiety never to be forgotten by a grateful humanity  but it is all a gaiety about the facts of life not about its origin  to the pagan the small things are as sweet as the small brooks breaking out of the mountain but the broad things are as bitter as the sea  when the pagan looks at the very core of the cosmos he is struck cold  behind the gods who are merely despotic sit the fates who are deadly  nay the fates are worse than deadly they are dead  and when rationalists say that the ancient world was more enlightened than the christian from their point of view they are right  for when they say enlightened they mean darkened with incurable despair  it is profoundly true that the ancient world was more modern than the christian  the common bond is in the fact that ancients and moderns have both been miserable about existence about everything while mediaevals were happy about that at least i freely grant that the pagans like the moderns were only miserable about everythingthey were quite jolly about everything else i concede that the christians of the middle ages were only at peace about everythingthey were at war about everything else but if the question turn on the primary pivot of the cosmos then there was more cosmic contentment in the narrow and bloody streets of florence than in the theatre of athens or the open garden of epicurus  giotto lived in a gloomier town than euripides but he lived in a gayer universe       the mass of men have been forced to be gay about the little things but sad about the big ones  nevertheless i offer my last dogma defiantly it is not native to man to be so  man is more himself man is more manlike when joy is the fundamental thing in him and grief the superficial  melancholy should be an innocent interlude a tender and fugitive frame of mind praise should be the permanent pulsation of the soul  pessimism is at best an emotional halfholiday joy is the uproarious labour by which all things live  yet according to the apparent estate of man as seen by the pagan or the agnostic this primary need of human nature can never be fulfilled joy ought to be expansive but for the agnostic it must be contracted it must cling to one corner of the world  grief ought to be a concentration but for the agnostic its desolation is spread through an unthinkable eternity  this is what i call being born upside down  the sceptic may truly be said to be topsyturvy for his feet are dancing upwards in idle ecstasies while his brain is in the abyss  to the modern man the heavens are actually below the earth  the explanation is simple he is standing on his head which is a very weak pedestal to stand on  but when he has found his feet again he knows it  christianity satisfies suddenly and perfectly mans ancestral instinct for being the right way up satisfies it supremely in this that by its creed joy becomes something gigantic and sadness something special and small the vault above us is not deaf because the universe is an idiot the silence is not the heartless silence of an endless and aimless world rather the silence around us is a small and pitiful stillness like the prompt stillness in a sickroom we are perhaps permitted tragedy as a sort of merciful comedy  because the frantic energy of divine things would knock us down like a drunken farce  we can take our own tears more lightly than we could take the tremendous levities of the angels  so we sit perhaps in a starry chamber of silence while the laughter of the heavens is too loud for us to hear       joy which was the small publicity of the pagan is the gigantic secret of the christian  and as i close this chaotic volume i open again the strange small book from which all christianity came and i am again haunted by a kind of confirmation  the tremendous figure which fills the gospels towers in this respect as in every other above all the thinkers who ever thought themselves tall  his pathos was natural almost casual  the stoics ancient and modern were proud of concealing their tears  he never concealed his tears he showed them plainly on his open face at any daily sight such as the far sight of his native city  yet he concealed something solemn supermen and imperial diplomatists are proud of restraining their anger  he never restrained his anger  he flung furniture down the front steps of the temple and asked men how they expected to escape the damnation of hell  yet he restrained something i say it with reverence there was in that shattering personality a thread that must be called shyness  there was something that he hid from all men when he went up a mountain to pray  there was something that he covered constantly by abrupt silence or impetuous isolation there was some one thing that was too great for god to show us when he walked upon our earth and i have sometimes fancied that it was his mirth
