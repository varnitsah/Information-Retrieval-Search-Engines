standard treesfor whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessarywho in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach of most women it may be said that it would be well for them that they should marryas indeed of most men also seeing that man and wife will each lend the other strength and yet in lending lose none but to the women of whom i now speak some kind of marriage is quite indispensable and by them some kind of marriage is always made though the union is often unnatural a woman in want of a wall against which to nail herself will swear conjugal obedience sometimes to her cook sometimes to her grandchild sometimes to her lawyer any standing corner post or stump strong enough to bear her weight will suffice but to some standing corner post or stump she will find her way and attach herself and there will she be married  such a woman was our mrs ray as her name imports she had been married in the way most popular among ladies with bell book and parson she had been like a young peach tree that in its early days is carefully taught to grow against a propitious southern wall her natural prop had been found for her and all had been well but her heaven had been made black with storms the heavy winds had come and the warm sheltering covert against which she had felt herself so safe had been torn away from her branches as they were spreading themselves forth to the fulness of life she had been married at eighteen and then after ten years of wedded security she had become a widow  her husband had been some years older than herselfa steady sober hardworking earnest man well fitted to act as a protecting screen to such a woman as he had chosen they had lived in exeter both of them having belonged to devonshire from their birth and mr ray though not a clergyman himself had been employed in matters ecclesiastical he was a lawyerbut a lawyer of that sort that is so nearly akin to the sacerdotal profession as to make him quite clerical and almost a clergyman he managed the property of the dean and chapter and knew what were the rights and also what were the wrongs of prebendaries and minor canonsof vicars choral and even of choristers but he had been dead many years before our story commences and so much as this is now said of him simply to explain under what circumstances mrs ray had received the first tinge of that colouring which was given to her life by church matters  they had been married somewhat over ten years when he died and she was left with two surviving daughters the eldest and the youngest of the children she had borne the eldest dorothea was then more than nine years old and as she took much after her father being stern sober and steady mrs ray immediately married herself to her eldest child dorothea became the prop against which she would henceforth grow and against dorothea she had grown ever since with the exception of one short year in that year dorothea had taken a husband to herself and had lost himso that there were two widows in the same house she like her mother had married early having joined her lot to that of a young clergyman near baslehurst but he had lived but a few months and mrs rays eldest child had come back to her mothers cottage black and stiff and stern in widows weedsmrs prime by name black and stiff and stern in widows weeds she had remained since for nine years following and those nine years will bring us to the beginning of our story  as regards mrs ray herself i think it was well that poor mr prime had died it assured to her the support which she needed it must however be acknowledged that mrs prime was a harder taskmaster than dorothea ray had been and that the mother might have undergone a gentler ruling had the daughter never become a wife i think there was much in the hardness of the weeds she wore it seemed as though mrs prime in selecting her crape her bombazine and the models of her caps had resolved to repress all ideas of feminine softnessas though she had sworn to herself with a great oath that man should never again look on her with gratified eyes the materials she wore have made other widows very pleasant to be seenwith a sad thoughtful pleasantness indeed but still very pleasant there was nothing of that with mrs prime when she came back to her mothers cottage near baslehurst she was not yet twenty years old but she was rough with weeds her caps were lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care the very stuff of which they were made was brown rather than white and her dress was always the same it was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any woman which is worn day after day through all hours by nature and education mrs prime was a prim tidy woman but it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance and this was her lot in life before she had yet reached her twentieth year  dorothea ray had not been wanting in some feminine attraction she had ever been brown and homely but her features had been wellformed and her eyes had been bright now as she approached to thirty years of age she might have been as welllooking as at any earlier period of her life if it had been her wish to possess good looks but she had had no such wish on the contrary her desire had been to be ugly forbidding unattractive almost repulsive so that in very truth she might be known to be a widow indeed and here i must not be misunderstood there was nothing hypocritical about mrs prime nor did she make any attempt to appear before men to be weighted with a deeper sorrow than that which she truly bore hypocrisy was by no means her fault her fault was this that she had taught herself to believe that cheerfulness was a sin and that the more she became morose the nearer would she be to the fruition of those hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set in all her words and thoughts she was genuine but then in so very many of them she was mistaken this was the wall against which mrs ray had allowed herself to be fastened for many years past and though the support was strong it must be admitted that it could hardly have been at all times pleasant  mrs ray had become a widow before she was thirty and she had grieved for her husband with truest sorrow pouring herself out at first in tears and afterwards expending herself in long hours of vain regrets but she had never been rough or hard in her widowhood it had ever been her nature to be soft she was a woman all over and had about her so much of a womans prettiness that she had not altogether divested herself of it even when her weepers had been of the broadest to obtain favour in mens eyes had never been in her mind since she had first obtained favour in the eyes of him who had been her lord but yet she had never absolutely divested herself of her woman charms of that look half retreating half beseeching which had won the heart of the ecclesiastical lawyer gradually her weeds and her deep heavy crapes had fallen away from her and then without much thought on the matter she dressed herself much as did other women of forty or fortyfivebeing driven however on certain occasions by her daughter to a degree of dinginess not by any means rivalling that of the daughter herself but which she would not have achieved had she been left to her own devices she was a sweettempered goodhumoured loving timid woman ever listening and believing and learning with a certain aptitude for gentle mirth at her heart which however was always being repressed and controlled by the circumstances of her life she could gossip over a cup of tea and enjoy buttered toast and hot cake very thoroughly if only there was no one near her to whisper into her ear that any such enjoyment was wicked in spite of the sorrows she had suffered she would have taught herself to believe this world to be a pleasant place were it not so often preached into her ears that it is a vale of tribulation in which no satisfaction can abide and it may be said of mrs ray that her religion though it sufficed her tormented her grievously it sufficed her and if on such a subject i may venture to give an opinion i think it was of a nature to suffice her in that great strait for which it had been prepared but in this world it tormented her carrying her hither and thither and leaving her in grievous doubt not as to its own truth in any of its details but as to her own conduct under its injunctions and also as to her own mode of believing in it in truth she believed too much she could never divide the minister from the biblenay the very clerk in the church was sacred to her while exercising his functions therein it never occurred to her to question any word that was said to her if a linendraper were to tell her that one coloured calico was better for her than another she would take that point as settled by the mans word and for the time would be free from all doubt on that heading so also when the clergyman in his sermon told her that she should live simply and altogether for heaven that all thoughts as to this world were wicked thoughts and that nothing belonging to this world could be other than painful full of sorrow and vexations she would go home believing him absolutely and with tearladen eyes would bethink herself how utterly she was a castaway because of that tea and cake and innocent tittle tattle with which the hours of her saturday evening had been beguiled she would weakly resolve that she would laugh no more and that she would live in truth in a valley of tears but then as the bright sun came upon her and the birds sang around her and some one that she loved would cling to her and kiss her she would be happy in her own despite and would laugh with a low musical sweet tone forgetting that such laughter was a sin  and then that very clergyman himself would torment herhe that told her from the pulpit on sundays how frightfully vain were all attempts at worldly happiness he would come to her on the monday with a goodnatured rather rubicund face and would ask after all her little worldly belongingsfor he knew of her history and her meansand he would joke with her and tell her comfortably of his grown sons and daughters who were prospering in worldly matters and express the fondest solicitude as to their worldly advancement twice or thrice a year mrs ray would go to the parsonage and such evenings would be by no means hours of wailing tea and buttered toast on such occasions would be very manifestly in the ascendant mrs ray never questioned the propriety of her clergymans life nor taught herself to see a discrepancy between his doctrine and his conduct but she believed in both and was unconsciously troubled at having her belief so varied she never thought about it or discovered that her friend allowed himself to be carried away in his sermons by his zeal and that he condemned this world in all things hoping that he might thereby teach his hearers to condemn it in some things mrs ray would allow herself the privilege of no such argument as that it was all gospel to her the parson in the church and the parson out of the church were alike gospels to her sweet white credulous mind but these differing gospels troubled her and tormented her  of that particular clergyman i may as well here say that he was the rev charles comfort and that he was rector of cawston a parish in devonshire about two miles out of baslehurst mr prime had for a year or two been his curate and during that term of curacy he had married dorothea ray then he had died and his widow had returned from the house her husband had occupied near the church to her mothers cottage mr prime had been possessed of some property and when he died he left his widow in the uncontrolled possession of two hundred a year as it was well known that mrs rays income was considerably less than this the people of baslehurst and cawston had declared how comfortable for mrs ray would be this accession of wealth to the family but mrs ray had not become much the richer mrs prime did no doubt pay her fair quota towards the maintenance of the humble cottage at braggs end for such was the name of the spot at which mrs ray lived but she did not do more than this she established a dorcas society at baslehurst of which she became permanent president and spent her money in carrying on this institution in the manner most pleasing to herself i fear that mrs prime liked to be more powerful at these charitable meetings than her sister labourers in the same vineyard and that she achieved this power by the means of her money i do not bring this as a heavy accusation against her in such institutions there is generally need of a strong stirring leading mind if some one would not assume power the power needed would not be exercised such a one as mrs prime is often necessary but we all have our own pet temptations and i think that mrs primes temptation was a love of power  it will be understood that baslehurst is a towna town with a market and hotels and a big brewery and a square and street whereas cawston is a village or rather a rural parish three miles out of baslehurst north of it lying on the river avon but braggs end though within the parish of cawston lies about a mile and a half from the church and village on the road to baslehurst and partakes therefore almost as much of the township of baslehurst as it does of the rusticity of cawston how bragg came to such an end or why this corner of the parish came to be thus united for ever to braggs name no one in the parish knew the place consisted of a little green and a little wooden bridge over a little stream that trickled away into the avon here were clustered half a dozen labourers cottages and a beer or cider shop standing back from the green was the house and homestead of farmer sturt and close upon the green with its garden hedge running down to the bridge was the pretty cottage of mrs ray mr comfort had known her husband and he had found for her this quiet home it was a pretty place with one small sittingroom opening back upon the little garden and with another somewhat larger fronting towards the road and the green in the front room mrs ray lived looking out upon so much of the world as braggs end green afforded to her view the other seemed to be kept with some faint expectation of company that never came many of the widows neatest belongings were here preserved in most perfect order but one may say that they were altogether thrown awayunless indeed they afforded solace to their owner in the very act of dusting them here there were four or five books prettily bound with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table here also was deposited a spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glass strung together it must have taken care and time in its manufacture but was i should say but of little efficacy either for domestic use or domestic ornament there were shells on the chimneypiece and two or three china figures there was a birdcage hung in the window but without a bird it was all very clean but the room conveyed at the first glance an overpowering idea of its own absolute inutility and vanity it was capable of answering no purpose for which men and women use rooms but he who could have said so to mrs ray must have been a cruel and a hardhearted man  the other room which looked out upon the green was snug enough and sufficed for all the widows wants there was a little bookcase laden with books there was the family table at which they ate their meals and there was the little table near the window at which mrs ray worked there was an old sofa and an old armchair and there was also a carpet alas so old that the poor woman had become painfully aware that she must soon have either no carpet or a new one a word or two had already been said between her and mrs prime on that matter but the word or two had not as yet been comfortable then over the fire there was an old round mirror and having told of that i believe i need not further describe the furniture of the sitting room at braggs end  but i have not as yet described the whole of mrs rays family had i done so her life would indeed have been sour and sorrowful for she was a woman who especially needed companionship though i have hitherto spoken but of one daughter i have said that two had been left with her when her husband died she had one whom she feared and obeyed seeing that a master was necessary to her but she had another whom she loved and caressed and i may declare that some such object for her tenderness was as necessary to her as the master she could not have lived without something to kiss something to tend something to which she might speak in short loving pet terms of affection this youngest girl rachel had been only two years old when her father died and now at the time of this story was not yet quite twenty her sister was in truth only seven years her senior but in all the facts and ways of life she seemed to be the elder by at least half a century rachel indeed at the time felt herself to be much nearer of an age with her mother with her mother she could laugh and talk ay and form little wicked whispered schemes behind the tyrants back during some of those dorcas hours in which mrs prime would be employed at baslehurst schemes however for the final perpetration of which the courage of the elder widow would too frequently be found insufficient  rachel ray was a fairhaired wellgrown comely girlvery like her mother in all but this that whereas about the mothers eyes there was always a look of weakness there was a shadowing of coming strength of character round those of the daughter on her brow there was written a capacity for sustained purpose which was wanting to mrs ray not that the reader is to suppose that she was masterful like her sister she had been brought up under mrs primes directions and had not as yet learned to rebel nor was she in any way prone to domineer a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermonthese were her sins and when rebuked for them by her sister she would of late toss her head and look slily across to her mother with an eye that was not penitent then mrs prime would become black and angry and would foretell hard things for her sister denouncing her as fashioning herself wilfully in the worlds ways on such occasions mrs ray would become very unhappy believing first in the one child and then in the other she would defend rachel till her weak defence would be knocked to shivers and her poor vacillating words taken from out of her mouth then when forced to acknowledge that rachel was in danger of backsliding she would kiss her and cry over her and beg her to listen to the sermons rachel hitherto had never rebelled she had never declared that a walk into baslehurst was better than a sermon she had never said out boldly that she liked the world and its wickednesses but an observer of physiognomy had such observer been there might have seen that the days of such rebellion were coming  she was a fairhaired girl with hair not flaxen but of lightbrown tintthick and full and glossy so that its charms could not all be hidden away let mrs prime do what she would to effect such hiding she was well made being tall and straight with great appearance of health and strength she walked as though the motion were pleasant to her and easyas though the very act of walking were a pleasure she was bright too and clever in their little cottage striving hard with her needle to make things look well and not sparing her strength in giving household assistance one little maiden mrs ray employed and a gardener came to her for half a day once a weekbut i doubt whether the maiden in the house or the gardener out of the house did as much hard work as rachel how she had toiled over that carpet patching it and piecing it even dorothea could not accuse her of idleness therefore dorothea accused her of profitless industry because she would not attend more frequently at those dorcas meetings  but dolly how on earth am i to make my own things and look after mammas charity begins at home then had dorothea put down her huge dorcas basket and explained to her sister at considerable length her reading of that text of scripture ones own clothes must be made all the same rachel said when the female preacher had finished and i dont suppose even you would like mamma to go to church without a decent gown then dorothea had seized up her huge basket angrily and had trudged off into baslehurst at a quick paceat a pace much too quick when the summers heat is consideredand as she went unhappy thoughts filled her mind a coloured dress belonging to rachel herself had met her eye and she had heard tidings ofa young man  such tidings to her ears were tidings of iniquity of vanity of terrible sin they were tidings which hardly admitted of being discussed with decency and which had to be spoken of below the breath a young man could it be that such disgrace had fallen upon her sister she had not as yet mentioned the subject to rachel but she had given a dark hint to their afflicted mother  no i didnt see it myself but i heard it from miss pucker  she that was to have been married to william whitecoat the bakers son only he went away to torquay and picked up with somebody else people said he did it because she does squint so dreadfully  motherand dorothea spoke very sternly as she answeredwhat does it matter to us about william whitecoat or miss puckers squint she is a woman eager in doing good  its only since he left baslehurst my dear  motherdoes that matter to rachel will that save her if she be in danger i tell you that miss pucker saw her walking with that young man from the brewery  though mrs ray had been strongly inclined to throw what odium she could upon miss pucker and though she hated miss pucker in her heartat this special momentfor having carried tales against her darling she could not deny even to herself that a terrible state of things had arrived if it were really true that rachel had been seen walking with a young man she was not bitter on the subject as was mrs prime and poor miss pucker but she was filled full of indefinite horror with regard to young men in general they were all regarded by her as wolvesas wolves either with or without sheeps clothing i doubt whether she ever brought it home to herself that those whom she now recognized as the established and wellcredited lords of the creation had ever been young men themselves when she heard of a weddingwhen she learned that some struggling son of adam had taken to himself a wife and had settled himself down to the sober work of the world she rejoiced greatly thinking that the son of adam had done well to get himself married but whenever it was whispered into her ear that any young man was looking after a young womanthat he was taking the only step by which he could hope to find a wife for himselfshe was instantly shocked at the wickedness of the world and prayed inwardly that the girl at least might be saved like a brand from the burning a young man in her estimation was a wicked wild beast seeking after young women to devour them as a cat seeks after mice this at least was her established ideathe idea on which she worked unless some other idea on any special occasion were put into her head when young butler cornbury the eldest son of the neighbouring squire came to cawston after pretty patty comfortfor patty comfort was said to have been the prettiest girl in devonshireand when patty comfort had been allowed to go to the assemblies at torquay almost on purpose to meet him mrs ray had thought it all right because it had been presented to her mind as all right by the rector butler cornbury had married patty comfort and it was all right but had she heard of pattys dancings without the assistance of a few hints from mr comfort himself her mind would have worked in a different way  she certainly desired that her own child rachel should some day find a husband and rachel was already older than she had been when she married or than mrs prime had been at her wedding but nevertheless there was something terrible in the very thought ofa young man and she though she would fain have defended her child hardly knew how to do so otherwise than by discrediting the words of miss pucker she always was very illnatured you know mrs ray ventured to hint  mother said mrs prime in that peculiarly stern voice of hers there can be no reason for supposing that miss pucker wishes to malign the child it is my belief that rachel will be in baslehurst this evening if so she probably intends to meet him again  i know she is going into baslehurst after tea said mrs ray because she has promised to walk with the miss tappitts she told me so  exactlywith the brewery girls oh mother now it is certainly true that the three miss tappitts were the daughters of bungall and tappitt the oldestablished brewers of baslehurst they were at least the actual children of mr tappitt who was the sole surviving partner in the brewery the name of bungall had for many years been used merely to give solidity and standing to the tappitt family the miss tappitts certainly came from the brewery and miss pucker had said that the young man came from the same quarter there was ground in this for much suspicion and mrs ray became uneasy this conversation between the two widows had occurred before dinner at the cottage on a saturdayand it was after dinner that the elder sister had endeavoured to persuade the younger one to accompany her to the dorcas workshopbut had endeavoured in vain     chapter ii  the young man from the brewery   there were during the summer months four dorcas afternoons held weekly in baslehurst at all of which mrs prime presided it was her custom to start soon after dinner so as to reach the working room before three oclock and there she would remain till nine or as long as the daylight remained the meeting was held in a sitting room belonging to miss pucker for the use of which the institution paid some moderate rent the other ladies all belonging to baslehurst were accustomed to go home to tea in the middle of their labours but as mrs prime could not do this because of the distance she remained with miss pucker paying for such refreshment as she needed in this way there came to be a great friendship between mrs prime and miss puckeror rather perhaps mrs prime thus obtained the services of a most obedient minister rachel had on various occasions gone with her sister to the dorcas meetings and once or twice had remained at miss puckers house drinking tea there but this she greatly disliked she was aware when she did so that her sister paid for her and she thought that dorothea showed by her behaviour that she was mistress of the entertainment and then rachel greatly disliked miss pucker she disliked that ladys squint she disliked the tone of her voice she disliked her subservience to mrs prime and she especially disliked the vehemence of her objection toyoung men when rachel had last left miss puckers room she had resolved that she would never again drink tea there she had not said to herself positively that she would attend no more of the dorcas meetingsbut as regarded their summer arrangement this resolve against the teadrinking amounted almost to the same thing  it was on this account i protest and by no means on account of that young man from the brewery that rachel had with determination opposed her sisters request on this special saturday and the refusal had been made in an unaccustomed manner owing to the request also having been pressed with unusual vigour  rachel i particularly wish it and i think that you ought to come dorothea had said  i had rather not come dolly  that means continued mrs prime that you prefer your pleasure to your dutythat you boldly declare yourself determined to neglect that which you know you ought to do  i dont know any such thing said rachel  if you think of it you will know it said mrs prime  at any rate i dont mean to go to miss puckers this afternoonthen rachel left the room  it was immediately after this conversation that mrs prime uttered to mrs ray that terrible hint about the young man and at the same time uttered another hint by which she strove to impress upon her mother that rachel ought to be kept in subordinationin fact that the power should not belong to rachel of choosing whether she would or would not go to dorcas meetings in all such matters according to dorotheas view of the case rachel should do as she was bidden but then how was rachel to be made to do as she was bidden how was her sister to enforce her attendance obedience in this world depends as frequently on the weakness of him who is governed as on the strength of him who governs that man who was going to the left is ordered by you with some voice of command to go to the right when he hesitates you put more command into your voice more command into your eyesand then he obeys mrs prime had tried this but rachel had not turned to the right when mrs prime applied for aid to their mother it was a sign that the power of command was going from herself after dinner the elder sister made another little futile attempt and then when she had again failed she trudged off with her basket  mrs ray and rachel were left sitting at the open window looking out upon the mignionette it was now in july when the summer sun is at the hottestand in those southern parts of devonshire the summer sun in july is very hot there is no other part of england like it the lanes are low and narrow and not a breath of air stirs through them the ground rises in hills on all sides so that every spot is a sheltered nook the rich red earth drinks in the heat and holds it and no breezes come up from the southern torpid sea of all counties in england devonshire is the fairest to the eye but having known it in its summer glory i must confess that those southern regions are not fitted for much noonday summer walking  im afraid shell find it very hot with that big basket said mrs ray after a short pause it must not be supposed that either she or rachel were idle because they remained at home they both had their needles in their hands and rachel was at work not on that coloured frock of her own which had roused her sisters suspicion but on needful aid to her mothers sunday gown  she might have left it in baslehurst if she liked said rachel or i would have carried it for her as far as the bridge only that she was so angry with me when she went  i dont think she was exactly angry rachel  oh but she was mammavery angry i know by her way of flinging out of the house  i think she was sorry because you would not go with her  but i dont like going there mamma i dont like that miss pucker i cant go without staying to tea and i dont like drinking tea there then there was a little pause you dont want me to godo you mamma how would the things get done here and you cant like having your tea alone  no i dont like that at all said mrs ray but she hardly thought of what she was saying her mind was away working on the subject of that young man she felt that it was her duty to say something to rachel and yet she did not know what to say was she to quote miss pucker it went moreover sorely against the grain with her to disturb the comfort of their present happy moments by any disagreeable allusion the world gave her nothing better than those hours in which rachel was alone with herin which rachel tended her and comforted her no word had been said on a subject so wicked and full of vanity but mrs ray knew that her evening meal would be brought in at halfpast five in the shape of a little feasta feast which would not be spread if mrs prime had remained at home at five oclock rachel would slip away and make hot toast and would run over the green to farmer sturts wife for a little thick cream and there would be a batter cake and so there would be a feast rachel was excellent at the preparation of such banquets knowing how to coax the teapot into a good drawing humour and being very clever in little comforts and she would hover about her mother in a way very delightful to that lady making the widow feel for the time that there was a gleam of sunshine in the valley of tribulation all that must be over for this afternoon if she spoke of miss pucker and the young man yes and must it not be over for many an afternoon to come if there were to be distrust between her and rachel what would her life be worth to her  but yet there was her duty as she sat there looking out into the garden indistinct ideas of what were a mothers duties to her child lay heavy on her mindideas which were very indistinct but which were not on that account the less powerful in their operation she knew that it behoved her to sacrifice everything to her childs welfare but she did not know what special sacrifice she was at this moment called upon to make would it be well that she should leave this matter altogether in the hands of mrs prime and thus as it were abdicate her own authority mrs prime would undertake such a task with much more skill and power of language than she could use but then would this be fair to rachel and would rachel obey her sister any explicit direction from herselfif only she could bring herself to give anyrachel would she thought obey in this way she resolved that she would break the ice and do her duty  are you going into baslehurst this evening dear she said  yes mamma i shall walk in after teathat is if you dont want me i told the miss tappitts i would meet them  no i shant want you but rachel  well mamma  mrs ray did not know how to do it the matter was surrounded with difficulties how was she to begin so as to introduce the subject of the young man without shocking her child and showing an amount of distrust which she did not feel do you like those miss tappitts she said  yesin a sort of a way they are very goodnatured and one likes to know somebody i think they are nicer than miss pucker  oh yesi never did like miss pucker myself but rachel  what is it mamma i know youve something to say and that you dont half like to say it dolly has been telling tales about me and you want to lecture me only you havent got the heart isnt that it mamma then she put down her work and coming close up to her mother knelt before her and looked up into her face you want to scold me and you havent got the heart to do it  my darling my darling said the mother stroking her childs soft smooth hair i dont want to scold youi never want to scold you i hate scolding anybody  i know you do mamma  but they have told me something which has frightened me  they who are they  your sister told me and miss pucker told her  oh miss pucker what business has miss pucker with me if she is to come between us all our happiness will be over then rachel rose from her knees and began to look angry whereupon her mother was more frightened than ever but let me hear it mamma ive no doubt it is something very awful  mrs ray looked at her daughter with beseeching eyes as though praying to be forgiven for having introduced a subject so disagreeable dorothea says that on wednesday evening you were walking under the churchyard elms withthat young man from the brewery  at any rate everything had been said now the extent of the depravity with which rachel was to be charged had been made known to her in the very plainest terms mrs ray as she uttered the terrible words turned first pale and then redpale with fear and red with shame as soon as she had spoken them she wished the words unsaid her dislike to miss pucker amounted almost to hatred she felt bitterly even towards her own eldest daughter she looked timidly into rachels face and unconsciously construed into their true meaning those lines which formed themselves on the girls brow and over her eyes  well mamma and what else said rachel  dorothea thinks that perhaps you are going into baslehurst to meet him again  and suppose i am  from the tone in which this question was asked it was clear to mrs ray that she was expected to answer it and yet what answer could she make  it had never occurred to her that her child would take upon herself to defend such conduct as that imputed to her or that any question would be raised as to the propriety or impropriety of the proceeding she was by no means prepared to show why it was so very terrible and iniquitous she regarded it as a sinknown to be a sin generallyas is stealing or lying suppose i am going to walk with him again what then  oh rachel who is he i dont even know his name i didnt believe it when dorothea told me only as she did tell me i thought i ought to mention it oh dear oh dear i hope there is nothing wrong you were always so goodi cant believe anything wrong of you  no mammadont dont think evil of me  i never did my darling  i am not going into baslehurst to walk with mr rowanfor i suppose it is him you mean  i dont know my dear i never heard the young mans name  it is mr rowan i did walk with him along the churchyard path when that woman with her sharp squinting eyes saw me he does belong to the brewery he is related in some way to the tappitts and was a nephew of old mrs bungalls he is there as a clerk and they say he is to be a partneronly i dont think he ever will for he quarrels with mr tappitt  dear dear said mrs ray  and now mamma you know as much about him as i do only this that he went to exeter this morning and does not come back till monday so that it is impossible that i should meet him in baslehurst this eveningand it was very unkind of dolly to say so very unkind indeed then rachel gave way and began to cry  it certainly did seem to mrs ray that rachel knew a good deal about mr rowan she knew of his kith and kin she knew of his prospects and what was like to mar his prospects and she knew also of his immediate proceedings whereabouts and intentions mrs ray did not logically draw any conclusion from these premises but she became uncomfortably assured that there did exist a considerable intimacy between mr rowan and her daughter and how had it come to pass that this had been allowed to form itself without any knowledge on her part miss pucker might be odious and disagreeablemrs ray was inclined to think that the lady in question was very odious and disagreeablebut must it not be admitted that her little story about the young man had proved itself to be true  i never will go to those nasty rag meetings any more  oh rachel dont speak in that way  but i wont i will never put my foot in that womans room again they talk nothing but scandal all the time they are there and speak any ill they can of the poor young girls whom they talk about if you dont mind my knowing mr rowan what is it to them  but this was assuming a great deal mrs ray was by no means prepared to say that she did not object to her daughters acquaintance with mr rowan but i dont know anything about him my dear i never heard his name before  no mamma you never did and i know very little of him so little that there has been nothing to tellat least next to nothing i dont want to have any secrets from you mamma  but rachelhe isnt is he i mean there isnt anything particular between him and you how was it you were walking with him alone  i wasnt walking with him aloneat least only for a little way he had been out with his cousins and we had all been together and when they went in of course i was obliged to come home i couldnt help his coming along the churchyard path with me and what if he did mamma he couldnt bite me  but my dear  oh mammadont be afraid of me then she came across and again knelt at her mothers feet if youll trust me ill tell you everything  upon hearing this assurance mrs ray of course promised rachel that she would trust her and expected in return to be told everything then at the moment but she perceived that her daughter did not mean to tell her anything further at that time rachel when she had received her mothers promise embraced her warmly caressing her and petting her as was her custom and then after a while she resumed her work mrs ray was delighted to have the evil thing over but she could not but feel that the conversation had not terminated as it should have done  soon after that the hour arrived for their little feast and rachel went about her work just as merrily and kindly as though there had been no words about the young man she went across for the cream and stayed gossiping for some few minutes with mrs sturt then she bustled about the kitchen making the tea and toasting the bread she had never been more anxious to make everything comfortable for her mother and never more eager in her coaxing way of doing honour to the good things which she had prepared but through it all her mother was aware that everything was not right there was something in rachels voice which betrayed inward uneasinesssomething in the vivacity of her movements that was not quite true to her usual nature mrs ray felt that it was so and could not therefore be altogether at her ease she pretended to enjoy herselfbut rachel knew that her joy was not real nothing further however was said either regarding that evenings walk into baslehurst or touching that other walk as to which miss puckers tale had been told mrs ray had done as much as her courage enabled her to attempt on that occasion  when the teadrinking was over and the cups and spoons had been tidily put away rachel prepared herself for her walk she had been very careful that nothing should be hurriedthat there should be no apparent anxiety on her part to leave her mother quickly and even when all was done she would not go without some assurance of her mothers goodwill if you have any wish that i should stay mamma i dont care in the least about going  no my dear i dont want you to stay at all  your dress is finished  thank you my dear you have been very good  i havent been good at all but i will be good if youll trust me  i will trust you  at any rate you need not be afraid tonight for i am only going to take a walk with those three girls across the church meadows theyre always very civil and i dont like to turn my back upon them  i dont wish you to turn your back upon them  its stupid not to know anybody isnt it  i dare say it is said mrs ray then rachel had finished tying on her hat and she walked forth  for more than two hours after that the widow sat alone thinking of her children as regarded mrs prime there was at any rate no cause for trembling timid thoughts she might be regarded as being safe from the worlds wicked allurements she was founded like a strong rock and was with her stedfast earnestness a staff on which her weaker mother might lean with security but then she was so sternand her very strength was so oppressive rachel was weaker more worldly given terribly to vain desires and thoughts that were almost wicked but then it was so pleasant to live with her and rachel though weak and worldly and almost wicked was so very good and kind and sweet as mrs ray thought of this she began to doubt whether after all the world was so very bad a place and whether the wickedness of tea and toast and of other creature comforts could be so very great i wonder what sort of a young man he is she said to herself  mrs primes return was always timed with the regularity of clockwork at this period of the year she invariably came in exactly at halfpast nine mrs ray was very anxious that rachel should come in first so that nothing should be said of her walk on this evening she had been unwilling to imply distrust by making any special request on this occasion and had therefore said nothing on the subject as rachel went but she had carefully watched the clock and had become uneasy as the time came round for mrs primes appearance exactly at halfpast nine she entered the house bringing with her the heavy basket laden with work and bringing with her also a face full of the deepest displeasure she said nothing as she seated herself wearily on a chair against the wall but her manner was such as to make it impossible that her mother should not notice it is there anything wrong dorothea she said  rachel has not come home yet of course said mrs prime  no not yet she is with the miss tappitts  no mother she is not with the miss tappitts and her voice as she said these words was dreadful to the mothers ears  isnt she i thought she was do you know where she is  who is to say where she is half an hour since i saw her alone with  with whom not with that young man from the brewery for he is at exeter  mother he is herein baslehurst half an hour since he and rachel were standing alone together beneath the elms in the churchyard i saw them with my own eyes     chapter iii  the arm in the clouds   there was plenty of time for full inquiry and full reply between mrs ray and mrs prime before rachel opened the cottage door and interrupted them it was then nearly halfpast ten rachel had never been so late before the last streak of the suns reflection in the east had vanished the last ruddy line of evening light had gone and the darkness of the coming night was upon them the hour was late for any girl such as rachel ray to be out alone  there had been a long discussion between the mother and the elder daughter and mrs ray believing implicitly in the last announcements made to her was full of fears for her child the utmost rigour of selfdenying propriety should have been exercised by rachel whereas her conduct had been too dreadful almost to be described two or three hours since mrs ray had fondly promised that she would trust her younger daughter and had let her forth alone proud in seeing her so comely as she went an idea had almost entered her mind that if the young man was very steady such an acquaintance might perhaps be not altogether wicked but everything was changed now all the happiness of her trust was gone all her sweet hopes were crushed her heart was filled with fear and her face was pale with sorrow  why should she know where he was to be dorothea had asked but he is not at exeterhe is here and she was with him then the two had sat gloomily together till rachel returned as she came in there was a little forced laugh upon her face i am late am i not she said oh rachel very late said her mother it is halfpast ten said mrs prime oh dolly dont speak with that terrible voice as though the world were coming to an end said rachel and she looked up almost savagely showing that she was resolved to fight  but it may be as well to say a few words about the firm of messrs bungall and tappitt about the tappitt family generally and about mr luke rowan before any further portion of the history of that evening is written  why there should have been any brewery at all at baslehurst seeing that everybody in that part of the world drinks cider or how under such circumstances messrs bungall and tappitt had managed to live upon the proceeds of their trade i cannot pretend to say baslehurst is in the heart of the devonshire cider country it is surrounded by orchards and farmers talk there of their apples as they do of their cheese in cheshire or their wheat in essex or their sheep in lincolnshire men drink cider by the gallonby the gallon daily cider presses are to be found at every squires house at every parsonage and every farm homestead the trade of a brewer at baslehurst would seem to be as profitless as that of a breechesmaker in the highlands or a shoemaker in connaughtbut nevertheless bungall and tappitt had been brewers in baslehurst for the last fifty years and had managed to live out of their brewery  it is not to be supposed that they were great men like the mighty men of beer known of oldsuch as barclay and perkins or reid and co nor were they new and pink and prosperous going into parliament for this borough and that just as they pleased like the modern heroes of the bitter cask when the student at oxford was asked what man had most benefited humanity and when he answered bass i think that he should not have been plucked it was a fair average answer but no student at any university could have said as much for bungall and tappitt without deserving utter disgrace and whatever penance an outraged examiner could inflict it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from their vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stomach who drank it i could never learn it was to be found at no respectable inn it was admitted at no private gentlemans table the farmers knew nothing of it the labourers drenched themselves habitually with cider nevertheless the brewery of messrs bungall and tappitt was kept going and the large ugly square brick house in which the tappitt family lived was warm and comfortable there is something in the very name of beer that makes money  old bungall he who first established the house was still remembered by the seniors of baslehurst but he had been dead more than twenty years before the period of my story he had been a short fat old man not much above five feet high very silent very hard and very ignorant but he had understood business and had established the firm on a solid foundation late in life he had taken into partnership his nephew tappitt and during his life had been a severe taskmaster to his partner indeed the firm had only assumed its present name on the demise of bungall as long as he had lived it had been bungalls brewery when the days of mourning were over thenand not till thenmr tappitt had put up a board with the joint names of the firm as at present called  it was believed in baslehurst that mr bungall had not bequeathed his undivided interest in the concern to his nephew indeed people went so far as to say that he had left away from mr tappitt all that he could leave the truth in that respect may as well be told at once his widow had possessed a third of the profits of the concern in lieu of her right to a full half share in the concern which would have carried with it the onus of a full half share of the work that third and those rights she had left to her nephewor rather to her greatnephew luke rowan it was not however in this young mans power to walk into the brewery and claim a seat there as a partner it was not in his power to do so even if such should be his wish when old mrs bungall died at dawlish at the very advanced age of ninetyseven there came to be as was natural some little dispute between mr tappitt and his distant connection luke rowan mr tappitt suggested that luke should take a thousand pounds down and walk forth free from all contamination of malt and hops lukes attorney asked for ten thousand luke rowan at the time was articled to a lawyer in london and as the dinginess of the chambers which he frequented in lincolns inn fields appeared to him less attractive than the beautiful rivers of devonshire he offered to go into the brewery as a partner it was at last settled that he should place himself there as a clerk for twelve months drawing a certain moderate income out of the concern and that if at the end of the year he should show himself to be able and feel himself to be willing to act as a partner the firm should be changed to tappitt and rowan and he should be established permanently as a baslehurst brewer some information however beyond this has already been given to the reader respecting mr rowans prospects i dont think he ever will be a partner rachel had said to her mother because he quarrels with mr tappitt she had been very accurate in her statement mr rowan had now been three months at baslehurst and had not altogether found the ways of his relative pleasant mr tappitt wished to treat him as a clerk whereas he wished to be treated as a partner and mr tappitt had by no means found the ways of the young man to be pleasant young rowan was not idle nor did he lack intelligence indeed he possessed more energy and cleverness than in tappitts opinion were necessary to the position of a brewer in baslehurst but he was by no means willing to use these good gifts in the manner indicated by the sole existing owner of the concern mr tappitt wished that rowan should learn brewing seated on a stool and that the lessons should be purely arithmetical luke was instructed as to the use of certain dull dingy disagreeable ledgers and informed that in them lay the natural work of a brewer but he desired to learn the chemical action of malt and hops upon each other and had not been a fortnight in the concern before he suggested to mr tappitt that by a salutary process which he described the liquor might be made less muddy let us brew good beer he had said and then tappitt had known that it would not do yes said tappitt and sell for twopence a pint what will cost you threepence to make thats what weve got to look to said rowan i believe it can be done for the moneyonly one must learn how to do it ive been at it all my life tappitt said yes mr tappitt but it is only now that men are beginning to appreciate all that chemistry can do for them if youll allow me ill make an experiment on a small scale after that mr tappitt had declared emphatically to his wife that luke rowan should never become a partner of his he would ruin any business in the world said tappitt and as to conceit it is true that rowan was conceited and perhaps true also that he would have ruined the brewery had he been allowed to have his own way  but mrs tappitt by no means held him in such aversion as did her husband he was a wellgrown goodlooking young man for whom his friends had made comfortable provision and mrs tappitt had three marriageable daughters her ideas on the subject of young men in general were by no means identical with those held by mrs ray she was aware how frequently it happened that a young partner would marry a daughter of the senior in the house and it seemed to her that special provision for such an arrangement was made in this case young rowan was living in her house and was naturally thrown into great intimacy with her girls it was clear to her quick eye that he was of a susceptible disposition fond of ladies society and altogether prone to those pleasant prematrimonial conversations from the effects of which it is so difficult for an inexperienced young man to make his escape mrs tappitt was minded to devote to him augusta the second of her flockbut not so minded with any obstinacy of resolution if luke should prefer martha the elder or cherry the younger girl mrs tappitt would make no objection but she expected that he should do his duty by taking one of them laws t dont be so foolish she said to her husband when he made his complaint to her she always called her husband t unless when the solemnity of some special occasion justified her in addressing him as mr tappitt to have called him tom or thomas would in her estimation have been very vulgar dont be so foolish did you never have to do with a young man before those tantrums will all blow off when he gets himself into harness the tantrums spoken of were rowans insane desire to brew good beer but they were of so fatal a nature that tappitt was determined not to submit himself to them luke rowan should never be partner of hisnot though he had twenty daughters waiting to be married  rachel had been acquainted with the tappitts before young rowan had come to baslehurst and had been made known to him by them all collectively had they shared their mothers prudence they would probably not have done anything so rash rachel was betterlooking than either of themthough that fact perhaps might not have been known to them but in justice to them all i must say that they lacked their mothers prudence they were goodhumoured laughing ordinary girlsvery much alike with long brown curls fresh complexions large mouths and thick noses augusta was rather the taller of the three and therefore in her mothers eyes the beauty but the girls themselves when their distant cousin had come amongst them had not thought of appropriating him when after the first day they became intimate with him they promised to introduce him to the beauties of the neighbourhood and cherry had declared her conviction that he would fall in love with rachel ray directly he saw her she is tall you know said cherry a great deal taller than us then im sure i shant like her luke had said oh but you must like her because she is a friend of ours cherry had answered and i shouldnt be a bit surprised if you fell violently in love with her mrs tappitt did not hear all this but nevertheless she began to entertain a dislike to rachel it must not be supposed that she admitted her daughter augusta to any participation in her plans mrs tappitt could scheme for her child but she could not teach her child to scheme as regarded the girl it must all fall out after the natural pleasant everyday fashion of such things but mrs tappitt considered that her own natural advantages were so great that she could make the thing fall out as she wished when she was informed about a fortnight after rowans arrival in baslehurst that rachel ray had been walking with the party from the brewery she could not prevent herself from saying an illnatured word or two rachel ray is all very well she said but she is not the person whom you should show off to a stranger as your particular friend  why not mamma said cherry  why not my dear there are reasons why not mrs ray is very well in her way but  her husband was a gentleman said martha and a great friend of mr comforts  my dear i have nothing to say against her said the mother only this that she does not go among the people we know there is mrs prime the other daughter her great friend is miss pucker i dont suppose you want to be very intimate with miss pucker the brewers wife had a position in baslehurst and wished that her daughters should maintain it  it will now be understood in what way rachel had formed her acquaintance with luke rowan and i think it may certainly be admitted that she had been guilty of no great improprietyunless indeed she had been wrong in saying nothing of the acquaintance to her mother previous to those illnatured tidings brought home as to the first churchyard meeting rachel had seen him but twice on the first occasion she had thought but little of itbut little of luke himself or of her acquaintance with him in simple truth the matter had passed from her mind and therefore she had not spoken of it when they met the second time luke had walked much of the way home with herwith her alonehaving joined himself to her when the tappitt girls went into their house as rachel had afterwards described to her mother in all that she had said she had spoken absolutely the truth but it cannot be pleaded on her behalf that after this second meeting with mr rowan she had said nothing of him because she had thought nothing she had indeed thought much but it had seemed well to her to keep her thoughts to herself  the tappitt girls had by no means given up their friend because their mother had objected to miss pucker and when rachel met them on that saturday eveningthat fatal saturdaythey were very gracious to her the brewery at baslehurst stood on the outskirts of the town in a narrow lane which led from the church into the highstreet this lanebrewerylane as it was calledwas not the main approach to the church but from the lane there was a stile into the churchyard and a gate opened on sundays by which people on that side reached the church from the opposite side of the churchyard a road led away to the foot of the highstreet and out towards the bridge which divided the town from the parish of cawston along one side of this road there was a double row of elms having a footpath beneath them this old avenue began within the churchyard running across the lower end of it and was continued for some two hundred yards beyond its precincts this then would be the way which rachel would naturally take in going home after leaving the miss tappitts at their door but it was by no means the way which was the nearest for mrs prime after leaving miss puckers lodgings in the highstreet seeing that the highstreet itself ran direct to cawston bridge  and it must also be explained that there was a third path out of the churchyard not leading into any road but going right away across the fields the church stood rather high so that the land sloped away from it towards the west and the view there was very pretty the path led down through a small field with high hedgerows and by orchards to two little hamlets belonging to baslehurst and this was a favourite walk with the people of the town it was here that rachel had walked with the miss tappitts on that evening when luke rowan had first accompanied her as far as cawston bridge and it was here that they agreed to walk again on the saturday when rowan was supposed to be away at exeter rachel was to come along under the elms and was to meet her friends there or in the churchyard or if not so then she was to call for them at the brewery  she found the three girls leaning against the rails near the churchyard stile we have been waiting ever so long said cherry who was more specially rachels friend  oh but i said you were not to wait said rachel for i never am quite sure whether i can come  we knew youd come said augusta because  because what asked rachel  because nothing said cherry shes only joking  rachel said nothing more not having understood the point of the joke the joke was thisthat luke rowan had come back from exeter and that rachel was supposed to have heard of his return and therefore that her coming for the walk was certain but augusta had not intended to be illnatured and had not really believed what she had been about to insinuate the fact is said martha that mr rowan has come home but i dont suppose we shall see anything of him this evening as he is busy with papa  rachel for a few minutes became silent and thoughtful her mind had not yet freed itself from the effects of her conversation with her mother and she had been thinking of this young man during the whole of her solitary walk into town but she had been thinking of him as we think of matters which need not put us to any immediate trouble he was away at exeter and she would have time to decide whether or no she would admit his proffered intimacy before she should see him again i do so hope we shall be friends he had said to her as he gave her his hand when they parted on cawston bridge and then he had muttered something which she had not quite caught as to baslehurst being altogether another place to him since he had seen her she had hurried home on that occasion with a feeling half pleasant and half painful that something out of the usual course had occurred to her but after all it amounted to nothing what was there that she could tell her mother she had no special tale to tell and yet she could not speak of young rowan as she would have spoken of a chance acquaintance was she not conscious that he had pressed her hand warmly as he parted from her  rachel herself entertained much of that indefinite fear of young men which so strongly pervaded her mothers mind and which as regarded her sister had altogether ceased to be indefinite rachel knew that they were the natural enemies of her special class and that any kind of friendship might be allowed to her except a friendship with any of them and as she was a good girl loving her mother anxious to do well guided by pure thoughts she felt aware that mr rowan should be shunned had it not been that he himself had told her that he was to be in exeter she would not have come out to walk with the brewery girls on that evening what she might hereafter decide upon doing how these affairs might be made to arrange themselves she by no means could foreseebut on that evening she had thought she would be safe and therefore she had come out to walk  what do you think said cherry we are going to have a party next week  it wont be till the week after said augusta  at any rate we are going to have a party and you must come youll get a regular invite you know when theyre sent out mr rowans mother and sister are coming down on a visit to us for a few days and so were going to be quite smart  i dont know about going to a party i suppose it is for a dance  of course it is for a dance said martha  and of course youll come and dance with luke rowan said cherry nothing could be more imprudent than cherry tappitt and augusta was beginning to be aware of this though she had not been allowed to participate in her mothers schemes after that there was much talking about the party but the conversation was chiefly kept up by the tappitt girls rachel was almost sure that her mother would not like her to go to a dance and was quite sure that her sister would oppose such iniquity with all her power therefore she made no promise but she listened as the list was repeated of those who were expected to come and asked some few questions as to mrs rowan and her daughter then at a sudden turn of a lane a lane that led back to the town by another route they met luke rowan himself  he was a cousin of the tappitts and therefore though the relationship was not near he had already assumed the privilege of calling them by their christian names and martha who was nearly thirty years old and four years his senior had taught herself to call him luke with the other two he was as yet mr rowan the greeting was of course very friendly and he returned with them on their path to rachel he raised his hat and then offered his hand she had felt herself to be confused the moment she saw himso confused that she was not able to ask him how he was with ordinary composure she was very angry with herself and heartily wished that she was seated with the dorcas women at miss puckers any position would have been better for her than this in which she was disgracing herself and showing that she could not bear herself before this young man as though he were no more than an ordinary acquaintance her mind would revert to that handsqueezing to those muttered words and to her mothers caution when he remarked to her that he had come back earlier than he expected she could not take his words as though they signified nothing his sudden return was a momentous fact to her putting her out of her usual quiet mode of thought she said little or nothing and he at any rate did not observe that she was confused but she was herself so conscious of it that it seemed to her that all of them must have seen it  thus they sauntered along back to the outskirts of the town and so into the brewery lane by a route opposite to that of the churchyard the whole way they talked of nothing but the party was miss rowan fond of dancing then by degrees the girls called her mary declaring that as she was a cousin they intended so to do and luke said that he ought to be called by his christian name and the two younger girls agreed that he was entitled to the privilege only they would ask mamma first and in this way they were becoming very intimate rachel said but little and perhaps not much that was said was addressed specially to her but she seemed to feel that she was included in the friendliness of the gathering every now and then luke rowan would address her and his voice was pleasant to her ears he had made an effort to walk next to heran attempt almost too slight to be called an effort which she had almost unconsciously frustrated by so placing herself that augusta should be between them augusta was not quite in a good humour and said one or two words which were slightly snubbing in their tendency but this was more than atoned for by cherrys high goodhumour  when they reached the brewery they all declared themselves to be very much astonished on learning that it was already past nine rachels surprise at any rate was real i must go home at once she said i dont know what mamma will think of me and then wishing them all goodbye without further delay she hurried on into the churchyard  ill see you safe through the ghosts at any rate said rowan  im not a bit afraid of churchyard ghosts said rachel moving on but rowan followed her  ive got to go into town to meet your father said he to the other girls and ill be back with him  augusta saw with some annoyance that he had overtaken rachel before she had passed over the stile and stood lingering at the door long enough to be aware that luke was over first that girl is a flirt after all she said to her sister martha  luke was over the stile first and then turned round to assist miss ray she could not refuse him her hand in such a position or if she could have done so she lacked the presence of mind that was necessary for such refusal you must let me walk home with you he said  indeed i will do no such thing you told augusta that you were going to her papa in the town  so i am but i will see you first as far as the bridge you cant refuse me that  indeed i can and indeed i will i beg you wont come i am sure you would not wish to annoy me  look said he pointing to the west did you ever see such a setting sun as that did you ever see such bloodred colour the light was very wonderful for the sun had just gone down and all the western heavens were crimson with its departing glory in the few moments that they stood there gazing it might almost have been believed that some portentous miracle had happened so deep and dark and yet so bright were the hues of the horizon it seemed as though the lands below the hill were bathed in blood the elm trees interrupted their view so that they could only look out through the spaces between their trunks come to the stile said he if you were to live a thousand years you might never again see such a sunset as that you would never forgive yourself if you missed it just that you might save three minutes  rachel stepped with him towards the stile but it was not solely his entreaty that made her do so as he spoke of the suns glory her sharp ear caught the sound of a womans foot close to the stile over which she had passed and knowing that she could not escape at once from luke rowan she had left the main path through the churchyard in order that the new comer might not see her there talking to him so she accompanied him on till they stood between the trees and then they remained encompassed as it were in the full light of the suns rays but if her ears had been sharp so were the eyes of this new comer and while she stood there with rowan beneath the elms her sister stood a while also on the churchyard path and recognized the figures of them both  rachel said he after they had remained there in silence for a moment live as long as you may never on gods earth will you look on any sight more lovely than that ah do you see the mans arm as it were the deep purple cloud like a huge hand stretched out from some other world to take you do you see it  the sound of his voice was very pleasant his words to her young ears seemed full of poetry and sweet mysterious romance he spoke to her as no oneno man or womanhad ever spoken to her before she had a feeling as painful as it was delicious that the mans words were sweet with a sweetness which she had known in her dreams he had asked her a question and repeated it so that she was all but driven to answer him but still she was full of the one great fact that he had called her rachel and that he must be rebuked for so calling her but how could she rebuke a man who had bid her look at gods beautiful works in such language as he had used  yes i see it it is very grand but  there were the fingers but you see how they are melting away the arm is there still but the hand is gone you and i can trace it because we saw it when it was clear but we could not now show it to another i wonder whether any one else saw that hand and arm or only you and i i should like to think that it was shown to us and us only  it was impossible for her now to go back upon that word rachel she must pass it by as though she had not heard it all the world might have seen it had they looked said she  perhaps not do you think that all eyes can see alike  well yes i suppose so  all eyes will see a loaf of bread alike or a churchyard stile but all eyes will not see the clouds alike do you not often find worlds among the clouds i do  worlds she said amazed at his energy and then she bethought herself that he was right she would never have seen that hand and arm had he not been there to show it her so she gazed down upon the changing colours of the horizon and almost forgot that she should not have lingered there a moment  and yet there was a strong feeling upon her that she was sinkingsinkingsinking away into iniquity she ought not to have stood there an instant she ought not to have been there with him at alland yet she lingered now that she was there she hardly knew how to move herself away  yes worlds among the clouds he continued but before he did so there had been silence between them for a minute or two do you never feel that you look into other worlds beyond this one in which you eat and drink and sleep have you no other worlds in your dreams yes such dreams she had known and now she almost thought that she could remember to have seen strange forms in the clouds she knew that henceforth she would watch the clouds and find them there she looked down into the flood of light beneath her with a full consciousness that he was close to her touching her with a full consciousness that every moment that she lingered there was a new sin with a full consciousness too that the beauty of those fading colours seen thus in his presence possessed a charm a sense of soft delight which she had never known before at last she uttered a long sigh  why what ails you said he  oh i must go i have been so wrong to stand here goodbye pray pray do not come with me  but you will shake hands with me then he got her hand and held it why should it be wrong for you to stand and look at the sunset am i an ogre have i done anything that should make you afraid of me  do not hold me mr rowan i did not think you would behave like that the gloom of the evening was now coming on and though but a few minutes had passed since mrs prime had walked through the churchyard she would not have been able to recognize them had she walked there now it is getting dark and i must go instantly  let me go with you then as far as the bridge  no no no pray do not vex me  i will not you shall go alone but stand while i say one word to you why should you be afraid of me  i am not afraid of youat leastyou know what i mean  i wonderi wonder whetheryou dislike me  i dont dislike anybody goodnight  he had however again got her hand ill tell you why i askbecause i like you so much so very much why should we not be friends well there i will not trouble you now i will not stir from here till you are out of sight but mindremember this i intend that you shall like me  she was gone from him fleeing away along the path in a run while the last words were being spoken and yet though they were spoken in a low voice she heard and remembered every syllable what did the man mean by saying that he intended that she should like him like him how could she fail of liking him only was it not incumbent on her to take some steps which might save her from ever seeing him again like him indeed what was the meaning of the word had he intended to ask her to love him and if so what answer must she make  how beautiful had been those clouds as soon as she was beyond the church wall so that she could look again to the west she gazed with all her eyes to see if there were still a remnant left of that arm no it had all melted into a monstrous shape indistinct and gloomy partaking of the darkness of night the brightness of the vision was gone but he bade her look into the clouds for new worlds and she seemed to feel that there was a hidden meaning in his words as she looked out into the coming darkness a mystery crept over her a sense of something wonderful that was out there awayof something so full of mystery that she could not tell whether she was thinking of the hidden distances of the horizon or of the distances of her own future life which were still further off and more closely hidden she found herself trembling sighing almost sobbing and then she ran again he had wrapped her in his influence and filled her full of the magnetism of his own being her womans weaknessthe peculiar susceptibility of her nature had never before been touched she had now heard the first word of romance that had ever reached her ears and it had fallen upon her with so great a power that she was overwhelmed  words of romance words direct from the evil one mrs prime would have called them and in saying so she would have spoken the belief of many a good woman and many a good man she herself was a good womana sincere honest hardworking selfdenying woman a woman who struggled hard to do her duty as she believed it had been taught to her she as she walked through the churchyardhaving come down the brewery lane with some inkling that her sister might be therehad been struck with horror at seeing rachel standing with that man what should she do she paused a moment to ask herself whether she should return for her but she said to herself that her sister was obstinate that a scene would be occasioned that she would do no goodand so she passed on words of romance indeed must not all such words be words from the father of lies seeing that they are words of falseness some such thoughts passed through her mind as she walked home thinking of her sisters iniquityof her sister who must be saved like a brand from the fire but whose saving could now be effected only by the sternest of discipline the hours at the dorcas meetings must be made longer and rachel must always be there  in the mean time rachel hurried home with her spirits all atremble of her immediatelycoming encounter with her mother and her sister she hardly thought much before she reached the door she thought only of him how beautiful he was how grandand how dangerous of him and of his words how beautiful they were how grand and how terribly dangerous she knew that it was very late and she hurried her steps she knew that her mother must be appeased and her sister must be opposedbut neither to her mother or to her sister was given the depth of her thoughts she was still thinking of him and of the mans arm in the clouds when she opened the door of the cottage at braggs end     chapter iv  what shall be done about it   rachel was still thinking of luke rowan and of the mans arm when she opened the cottage door but the sight of her sisters face and the tone of her sisters voice soon brought her back to a full consciousness of her immediate present position oh dolly do not speak with that terrible voice as though the world were coming to an end she said in answer to the first note of objurgation that was uttered but the notes that came afterwards were so much more terrible so much more severe that rachel found herself quite unable to stop them by any wouldbe joking tone  mrs prime was desirous that her mother should speak the words of censure that must be spoken she would have preferred herself to remain silent knowing that she could be as severe in her silence as in her speech if only her mother would use the occasion as it should be used mrs ray had been made to feel how great was the necessity for outspoken severity but when the moment came and her dear beautiful child stood there before her she could not utter the words with which she had been already prompted oh rachel she said dorothea tells me and then she stopped  what has dorothea told you asked rachel  i have told her said mrs prime now speaking out that i saw you standing alone an hour since with that young manin the churchyard and yet you had said that he was to have been away in exeter  rachels cheeks and forehead were now suffused with red we used to think when we pretended to read the faces of our neighbours that a rising blush betrayed a conscious falsehood for the most part we know better now and have learned to decipher more accurately the outward signs which are given by the impulses of the heart an unmerited accusation of untruth will ever bring the blood to the face of the young and innocent but mrs ray was among the ignorant in this matter and she groaned inwardly when she saw her childs confusion  oh rachel is it true she said  is what true mamma it is true that mr rowan spoke to me in the churchyard though i did not know that dorothea was acting as a spy on me  rachel rachel said the mother  it is very necessary that some one should act the spy on you said the sister a spy indeed you think to anger me by using such a word but i will not be angered by any words i went there to look after you fearing that there was occasionfearing it but hardly thinking it now we know that there was occasion  there was no occasion said rachel looking into her sisters face with eyes of which the incipient strength was becoming manifest there was no occasion oh mamma you do not think there was an occasion for watching me  why did you say that that young man was at exeter asked mrs prime  because he had told me that he would be therehe had told us all so as we were walking together he came today instead of coming tomorrow what would you say if i questioned you in that way about your friends then when the words had passed from her lips she remembered that she should not have called mr rowan her friend she had never called him so in thinking of him to herself she had never admitted that she had any regard for him she had acknowledged to herself that it would be very dangerous to entertain friendship for such as he  friend rachel said mrs prime if you look for such friendship as that who can say what will come to you  i havent looked for it i havent looked for anything people do get to know each other without any looking and they cant help it  then mrs prime took off her bonnet and her shawl and rachel laid down her hat and her little light summer cloak but it must not be supposed that the war was suspended during these operations mrs prime was aware that a great deal more must be said but she was very anxious that her mother should say it rachel also knew that much more would be said and she was by no means anxious that the subject should be dropped if only she could talk her mother over to her side  if mother thinks it right exclaimed mrs prime that you should be standing alone with a young man after nightfall in the churchyard then i have done in that case i will say no more but i must tell her and i must tell you also that if it is to be so i cannot remain at the cottage any longer  oh dorothea said mrs ray  indeed mother i cannot if rachel is not hindered from such meetings by her own sense of what is right she must be hindered by the authority of those older than herself  hinderedhindered from what said rachel who felt that her tears were coming but struggled hard to retain them mamma i have done nothing that was wrong mamma you will believe me will you not  mrs ray did not know what to say she strove to believe both of them though the words of one were directly at variance with the words of the other  do you mean to claim it as your right said mrs prime to be standing out there alone at any hour of the night with any young man that you please if so you cannot be my sister  i do not want to be your sister if you think such hard things said rachel whose tears now could no longer be restrained honi soit qui mal y pense she did not at the moment remember the words to speak them but they contain exactly the purport of her thought and now having become conscious of her own weakness by reason of these tears which would overwhelm her she determined that she would say nothing further till she pleaded her cause before her mother alone how could she describe before her sister the way in which that interview at the churchyard stile had been brought about but she could kneel at her mothers feet and tell her everythingshe thought at least that she could tell her mother everything she occupied generally the same bedroom as her sister but on certain occasionsif her mother was unwell or the likeshe would sleep in her mothers room mamma she said you will let me sleep with you tonight i will go now and when you come i will tell you everything good night to you dolly  good night rachel and the voice of mrs prime as she bade her sister adieu for the evening sounded as the voice of the ravens  the two widows sat in silence for a while each waiting for the other to speak then mrs prime got up and folded her shawl very carefully and carefully put her bonnet and gloves down upon it it was her habit to be very careful with her clothes but in her anger she had almost thrown them upon the little sofa will you have anything before you go to bed dorothea said mrs ray nothing thank you said mrs prime and her voice was very like the voice of the ravens then mrs ray began to think it possible that she might escape away to rachel without any further words i am very tired she said and i think i will go dorothea  mother said mrs prime something must be done about this  yes my dear she will talk to me tonight and tell it me all  but will she tell you the truth  she never told me a falsehood yet dorothea im sure she didnt know that the young man was to be here you know if he did come back from exeter before he said he would she couldnt help it  and do you mean that she couldnt help being with him thereall alone mother what would you think of any other girl of whom you heard such a thing  mrs ray shuddered and then some thought some shadow perhaps of a remembrance flitted across her mind which seemed to have the effect of palliating her childs iniquity suppose she said suppose what said mrs prime sternly but mrs ray did not dare to go on with her supposition she did not dare to suggest that mr rowan might perhaps be a very proper young man and that the two young people might be growing fond of each other in a proper sort of way she hardly believed in any such propriety herself and she knew that her daughter would scout it to the winds suppose what said mrs prime again more sternly than before if the other girls left her and went away to the brewery perhaps she could not have helped it said mrs ray  but she was not walking with him her face was not turned towards home even they were standing together under the trees and judging from the time at which i got home they must have remained together for nearly half an hour afterwards and this with a perfect stranger mothera man whose name she had never mentioned to us till she was told how miss pucker had seen them together you cannot suppose that i want to make her out worse than she is she is your child and my sister and we are bound together for weal or for woe  you talked about going away and leaving us said mrs ray speaking in soreness rather than in anger  so i did and so i must unless something be done it could not be right that i should remain here seeing such things if my voice is not allowed to be heard but though i did go she would still be my sister i should still share the sorrowand the shame  oh dorothea do not say such words  but they must be said mother is it not from such meetings that shame comesshame and sorrow and sin you love her dearly and so do i and are we therefore to allow her to be a castaway those whom you love you must chastise i have no authority over heras she has told me more than once alreadyand therefore i say again that unless all this be stopped i must leave the cottage good night now mother i hope you will speak to her in earnest then mrs prime took her candle and went her way  for ten minutes the mother sat herself down thinking of the condition of her youngest daughter and trying to think what words she would use when she found herself in her daughters presence sorrow and shame and sin her child a castaway what terrible words they were and yet there had been nothing that she could allege in answer to them that comfortable idea of a decent husband for her child had been banished from her mind almost before it had been entertained then she thought of rachels eyes and knew that she would not be able to assume a perfect mastery over her girl when the ten minutes were over she had made up her mind to nothing and then she also took up her candle and went to her room when she first entered it she did not see rachel she had silently closed the door and come some steps within the chamber before her child showed herself from behind the bed mamma she said put down the candle that i may speak to you whereupon mrs ray put down the candle and rachel took hold of both her arms mamma you do not believe ill of me do you you do not think of me the things that dorothea says say that you do not or i shall die  my darling i have never thought anything bad of you before  and do you think bad of me now did you not tell me before i went out that you would trust me and have you so soon forgotten your trust look at me mamma what have i ever done that you should think me to be such as she says  i do not think that you have done anything but you are very young rachel  young mamma i am older than you were when you married and older than dolly was i am old enough to know what is wrong shall i tell you what happened this evening he came and met us all in the fields i knew before that he had come back for the girls had said so but i thought that he was in exeter when i left here had i not believed that i should not have gone i think i should not have gone  then you are afraid of him  no mamma i am not afraid of him but he says such strange things to me and i would not purposely have gone out to meet him he came to us in the fields and then we returned up the lane to the brewery and there we left the girls as i went through the churchyard he came there too and then the sun was setting and he stopped me to look at it i did stop with himfor a few moments and i felt ashamed of myself but how was i to help it mamma if i could remember them i would tell you every word he said to me and every look of his face he asked me to be his friend mamma if you will believe in me i will tell you everything i will never deceive you  she was still holding her mothers arms while she spoke now she held her very close and nestled in against her bosom and gradually got her cheek against her mothers cheek and her lips against her mothers neck how could any mother refuse such a caress as that or remain hard and stern against such signs of love mrs ray at any rate was not possessed of strength to do so she was vanquished and put her arm round her girl and embraced her she spoke soft words and told rachel that she was her dear dear dearest darling she was still awed and dismayed by the tidings which she had heard of the young man she still thought there was some terrible danger against which it behoved them all to be on their guard but she no longer felt herself divided from her child and had ceased to believe in the necessity of those terrible words which mrs prime had used  you will believe me said rachel you will not think that i am making up stories to deceive you then the mother assured the daughter with many kisses that she would believe her  after that they sat long into the night discussing all that luke rowan had said and the discussion certainly took place after a fashion that would not have been considered satisfactory by mrs prime had she heard it mrs ray was soon led into talking about mr rowan as though he were not a wolfas though he might possibly be neither a wolf ravenous with his native wolfish fur and open wolfish greed or worse than that a wolf more ravenous still in sheeps clothing there was no word spoken of him as a lover but rachel told her mother that the man had called her by her christian name and mrs ray had fully understood the sign my darling you mustnt let him do that no mamma i wont but he went on talking so fast that i had not time to stop him and after that it was not worth while the project of the party was also told to mrs ray and rachel sitting now with her head upon her mothers lap owned that she would like to go to it parties are not always wicked mamma she said to this assertion mrs ray expressed an undecided assent but intimated her decided belief that very many parties were wicked there will be dancing and i do not like that said mrs ray yet i was taught dancing at school said rachel when the matter had gone so far as this it must be acknowledged that rachel had done much towards securing her share of mastery over her mother he will be there of course said mrs ray oh yes he will be there said rachel but why should i be afraid of him why should i live as though i were afraid to meet him dolly thinks that i should be shut up close to be taken care of but you do not think of me like that if i was minded to be bad shutting me up would not keep me from it such arguments as these from rachels mouth sounded at first very terrible to mrs ray but yet she yielded to them  on the next morning rachel was down first and was found by her sister fast engaged on the usual work of the house as though nothing out of the way had occurred on the previous evening good morning dolly she said and then went on arranging the things on the breakfasttable good morning rachel said mrs prime still speaking like a raven there was not a word said between them about the young man or the churchyard and at nine oclock mrs ray came down to them dressed ready for church they seated themselves and ate their breakfast together and still not a word was said  it was mrs primes custom to go to morning service at one of the churches in baslehurst not at the old parish church which stood in the churchyard near the brewery but at a new church which had been built as auxiliary to the other and at which the rev samuel prong was the ministering clergyman as we shall have occasion to know mr prong it may be as well to explain here that he was not simply a curate to old dr harford the rector of baslehurst he had a separate district of his own which had been divided from the old parish not exactly in accordance with the rectors good pleasure dr harford had held the living for more than forty years he had held it for nearly forty years before the division had been made and he had thought that the parish should remain a parish entiremore especially as the presentation to the new benefice was not conceded to him therefore dr harford did not love mr prong  but mrs prime did love himwith that sort of love which devout women bestow upon the church minister of their choice mr prong was an energetic severe hardworking and i fear intolerant young man who bestowed very much laudable care upon his sermons the care and industry were laudable but not so the pride with which he thought of them and their results he spoke much of preaching the gospel and was sincere beyond all doubt in his desire to do so but he allowed himself to be led away into a belief that his brethren in the ministry around him did not preach the gospelthat they were careless shepherds or shepherds dogs indifferent to the wolf and in this way he had made himself unpopular among the clergy and gentry of the neighbourhood it may well be understood that such a man coming down upon a district cut out almost from the centre of dr harfords parish would be a thorn in the side of that old man but mr prong had his circle of friends of very ardent friends and among them mrs prime was one of the most ardent for the last year or two she had always attended morning service at his church and very frequently had gone there twice in the day though the walk was long and tedious taking her the whole length of the town of baslehurst and there had been some little uneasiness between mrs ray and mrs prime on the matter of this church attendance mrs prime had wished her mother and sister to have the benefit of mr prongs eloquence but mrs ray though she was weak in morals was strong in her determination to adhere to mr comfort of cawston it had been matter of great sorrow to her that her daughter should leave mr comforts church and she had positively declined to be taken out of her own parish rachel had of course stuck to her mother in this controversy and had said some sharp things about mr prong she declared that mr prong had been educated at islington and that sometimes he forgot his hs when such things were said mrs prime would wax very angry and would declare that no one could be saved by the perfection of dr harfords pronunciation but there was no question as to dr harford and no justification for the introduction of his name into the dispute mrs prime however did not choose to say anything against mr comfort with whom her husband had been curate and who in her younger days had been a light to her own feet mr comfort was by no means such a one as dr harford though the two old men were friends mr comfort had been regarded as a calvinist when he was young as evangelical in middle life and was still known as a low churchman in his old age therefore mrs prime would spare him in her sneers though she left his ministry he had become lukewarm but not absolutely stone cold like the old rector at baslehurst so said mrs prime old men would become lukewarm and therefore she could pardon mr comfort but dr harford had never been warm at allhad never been warm with the warmth which she valued therefore she scorned him and sneered at him in return for which rachel scorned mr prong and sneered at him  but though it was mrs primes custom to go to church at baslehurst on this special sunday she declared her intention of accompanying her mother to cawston not a word had been said about the young man and they all started off on their walk together in silence and gloom with such thoughts as they had in their mind it was impossible that they should make the journey pleasantly rachel had counted on the walk with her mother and had determined that everything should be pleasant she would have said a word or two about luke rowan and would have gradually reconciled her mother to his name but as it was she said nothing and it may be feared that her mind during the period of her worship was not at charity with her sister mr comfort preached his halfhour as usual and then they all walked home dr harford never exceeded twenty minutes and had often been known to finish his discourse within ten what might be the length of a sermon of mr prongs no man or woman could foretell but he never spared himself or his congregation much under an hour  they all walked home gloomily to their dinner and ate their cold mutton and potatoes in sorrow and sadness it seemed as though no sort of conversation was open to them they could not talk of their usual sunday subjects their minds were full of one matter and it seemed that that matter was by common consent to be banished from their lips for the day in the evening after tea the two sisters again went up to cawston church leaving their mother with her biblebut hardly a word was spoken between them and in the same silence they sat till bedtime to mrs ray and to rachel it had been one of the saddest dreariest days that either of them had ever known i doubt whether the suffering of mrs prime was so great she was kept up by the excitement of feeling that some great crisis was at hand if rachel were not made amenable to authority she would leave the cottage  when rachel had run with hurrying steps from the stile in the churchyard she left luke rowan still standing there he watched her till she crossed into the lane and then he turned and again looked out upon the still ruddy line of the horizon the blaze of light was gone but there were left high up in the heavens those wonderful hues which tinge with softlychanging colour the edges of the clouds when the brightness of some glorious sunset has passed away he sat himself on the wooden rail watching till all of it should be over and thinking with lazy halfformed thoughts of rachel ray he did not ask himself what he meant by assuring her of his friendship and by claiming hers but he declared to himself that she was very lovelymore lovely than beautiful and then smiled inwardly at the prettiness of her perturbed spirit he remembered well that he had called her rachel and that she had allowed his doing so to pass by without notice but he understood also how and why she had done so he knew that she had been flurried and that she had skipped the thing because she had not known the moment at which to make her stand he gave himself credit for no undue triumph nor her discredit for any undue easiness what a woman she is he said to himself so womanly in everything then his mind rambled away to other subjects possibly to the practicability of making good beer instead of bad  he was a young man by no means of a bad sort meaning to do well with high hopes in life one who had never wronged a woman or been untrue to a friend full of energy and hope and pride but he was conceited prone to sarcasm sometimes cynical and perhaps sometimes affected it may be that he was not altogether devoid of that byronic weakness which was so much more prevalent among young men twenty years since than it is now his two trades had been those of an attorney and a brewer and yet he dabbled in romance and probably wrote poetry in his bedroom nevertheless there were worse young men about baslehurst than luke rowan  and now for mr tappitt said he as he slowly took his legs from off the railing     chapter v  mr comfort gives his advice   mrs tappitt was very full of her party it had grown in her mind as those things do grow till it had come to assume almost the dimensions of a ball when mrs tappitt first consulted her husband and obtained his permission for the gathering it was simply intended that a few of her daughters friends should be brought together to make the visit cheerful for miss rowan but the mistress of the house had become ambitious two fiddles with a german horn were to be introduced because the piano would be troublesome the drawingroom carpet was to be taken up and there was to be a supper in the diningroom the thing in its altered shape loomed large by degrees upon mr tappitt and he found himself unable to stop its growth the word ball would have been fatal but mrs tappitt was too good a general and the girls were too judicious as lieutenants to commit themselves by the presumption of any such term it was still mrs tappitts evening teaparty but it was understood in baslehurst that mrs tappitts evening teaparty was to be something considerable  a great success had attended this lady at the onset of her scheme mrs butler cornbury had called at the brewery and had promised that she would come and that she would bring some of the cornbury family now mr butler cornbury was the eldest son of the most puissant squire within five miles of baslehurst and was indeed almost as good as squire himself his father being a very old man mrs butler cornbury had it is true not been esteemed as holding any very high rank while shining as a beauty under the name of patty comfort but she had taken kindly to her new honours and was now reckoned as a considerable magnate in that part of the county she did not customarily join in the festivities of the town and held herself aloof from people even of higher standing than the tappitts but she was an ambitious woman and had inspired her lord with the desire of representing baslehurst in parliament there would be an election at baslehurst in the coming autumn and mrs cornbury was already preparing for the fight hence had arisen her visit at the brewery and hence also her ready acquiescence in mrs tappitts halfpronounced request  the party was to be celebrated on a tuesdaytuesday week after that sunday which was passed so uncomfortably at braggs end and on the monday mrs tappitt and her daughters sat conning over the list of their expected guests and preparing their invitations it must be understood that the rowan family had somewhat grown upon them in estimation since luke had been living with them they had not known much of him till he came among them and had been prepared to patronise him but they found him a young man not to be patronised by any means and imperceptibly they learned to feel that his mother and sister would have to be esteemed by them rather as great ladies luke was in nowise given to boasting and had no intention of magnifying his mother and sister but things had been said which made the tappitts feel that mrs rowan must have the best bedroom and that mary rowan must be provided with the best partners  and what shall we do about rachel ray said martha who was sitting with the list before her augusta who was leaning over her sister puckered up her mouth and said nothing she had watched from the house door on that saturday evening and had been perfectly aware that luke rowan had taken rachel off towards the stile under the trees she could not bring herself to say anything against rachel but she certainly wished that she might be excluded  of course she must be asked said cherry cherry was sitting opposite to the other girls writing on a lot of envelopes the addresses of the notes which were afterwards to be prepared we told her we should ask her and as she spoke she addressed a cover to miss ray braggs end cottage cawston  stop a moment my dear said mrs tappitt from the corner of the sofa on which she was sitting put that aside cherry rachel ray is all very well but considering all things i am not sure that she will quite do for tuesday night its not quite in her line i think  but we have mentioned it to her already mamma said martha  of course we did said cherry it would be the meanest thing in the world not to ask her now  i am not at all sure that mrs rowan would like it said mrs tappitt  and i dont think that rachel is quite up to what mary has been used to said augusta  if she has half a mind to flirt with luke already said mrs tappitt i ought not to encourage it  that is such nonsense mamma said cherry if he likes her hell find her somewhere if he doesnt find her here  my dear you shouldnt say that what i say is nonsense said mrs tappitt  but mamma when we have already asked herbesides she is a lady said cherry  i cant say that i think mrs butler cornbury would wish to meet her said mrs tappitt  mrs butler cornburys father is their particular friend said martha mrs ray always goes to mr comforts parties  in this way the matter was discussed and at last cherrys eagerness and marthas sense of justice carried the day the envelope which cherry had addressed was brought into use and the note to rachel was deposited in the post with all those other notes the destination of which was too far to be reached by the brewery boy without detrimental interference with the brewery work we will continue our story by following the note which was delivered by the cawston postman at braggs end about seven oclock on the tuesday morning it was delivered into rachels own hand and read by her as she stood by the kitchen dresser before either her mother or mrs prime had come down from their rooms there still was sadness and gloom at braggs end during all the monday there had been no comfort in the house and rachel had continued to share her mothers bedroom at intervals when rachel had been away much had been said between mrs ray and mrs prime but no conclusion had been reached no line of conduct had received their joint adhesion and the threat remained that mrs prime would leave the cottage mrs ray while listening to her elder daughters words still continued to fear that evil spirits were hovering around them but yet she would not consent to order rachel to become a devout attendant at the dorcas meetings monday had not been a dorcas day and therefore it had been very dull and very tedious  rachel stood a while with the note in her hand fearing that the contest must be brought on again and fought out to an end before she could send her answer to it she had told her mother that she was to be invited and mrs ray had lacked the courage at the moment which would have been necessary for an absolute and immediate rejection of the proposition if mrs prime had not been with them in the house rachel little doubted but that she might have gone to the party if mrs prime had not been there rachel as she was now gradually becoming aware might have had her own way almost in everything without the support which mrs prime gave her mrs ray would have gradually slid down from that stern code of morals which she had been induced to adopt by the teaching of those around her and would have entered upon a new school of teaching under rachels tutelage but mrs prime was still there and rachel herself was not inclined to fight if fighting could be avoided so she put the note into her pocket and neither answered it or spoke of it till mrs prime had started on her afterdinner walk into baslehurst then she brought it forth and read it to her mother i suppose i ought to answer it by the post this evening mamma  oh dear this evening thats very short  it can be put off till tomorrow if theres any good in putting it off said rachel mrs ray seemed to think that there might be good in putting it off or rather that there would be harm in doing it at once  do you particularly want to go my dear mrs ray said after a pause  yes mamma i should like to go then mrs ray uttered a little sound which betokened uneasiness and was again silent for a while  i cant understand why you want to go to this placeso particularly you never used to care about such things you know your sister wont like it and im not at all sure that you ought to go  ill tell you why i wish it particularly only  well my dear  i dont know whether i can make you understand just what i mean  if you tell me i shall understand i suppose  rachel considered her words for a moment or two before she spoke and then she endeavoured to explain herself it isnt that i care for this party especially mamma though i own that after what the girls have said i should like to be there but i feel  you feel what my dear  it is this mamma dolly and i do not agree about these things and i dont intend to let her manage me just in the way she thinks right  oh rachel  well mamma would you wish it if you could tell me that you really think it wrong to go to parties i would give them up indeed it wouldnt be very much to give up for i dont often get the chance but you dont say so you only say that i had better not go because dolly doesnt like it now i wont be ruled by her dont look at me in that way mamma is it right that i should be  you have heard what she says about going away  i shall be very sorry if she goes and i hope she wont but i cant think that her threatening you in that way ought to make any difference andill tell you more i do particularly wish to go to mrs tappitts because of all that dolly has said aboutabout mr rowan i wish to show her and you that i am not afraid to meet him why should i be afraid of any one  you should be afraid of doing wrong  yes and if it were wrong to meet any other young man i ought not to go but there is nothing specially wrong in my meeting him she has said very unkind things about it and i intend that she shall know that i will not notice them as rachel spoke mrs ray looked up at her and was surprised by the expression of unrelenting purpose which she saw there there had come over her face that motion in her eyes and that arching of her brows which mrs ray had seen before but which hitherto she had hardly construed into their true meaning now she was beginning to construe these signs aright and to understand that there would be difficulty in managing her little family  the conversation ended in an undertaking on rachels part that she would not answer the note till the following day of course that means said rachel that i am to answer it just as dolly thinks fit but she repented of these words as soon as they were spoken and repented of them almost in ashes when her mother declared with tears in her eyes that it was not her intention to be guided by dorothea in this matter you ought not to say such things as that rachel she said no mamma i ought not for there is no one so good as you are and if youll say that you think i ought not to go ill write to cherry and explain it to her at once i dont care a bit about the partyas far as the party is concerned but mrs ray would not now pronounce any injunction on the matter she had made up her mind as to what she would do she would call upon mr comfort at the parsonage explain the whole thing to him and be guided altogether by his counsel  not a word was said in the cottage about the invitation when mrs prime came back in the evening nor was a word said on the following morning mrs ray had declared her intention of going up to the parsonage and neither of her daughters had asked her why she was going rachel had no need to ask for she well understood her mothers purpose as to mrs prime she was in these days black and full of gloom asking but few questions watching the progress of events with the eyes of an evilsinging prophetess but keeping back her words till the moment should come in which she would be driven by her inner impulses to speak them forth with terrible strength when the breakfast was over mrs ray took her bonnet and started forth to the parsonage  i do not know that a widow circumstanced as was mrs ray could do better than go to her clergyman for advice but nevertheless when she got to mr comforts gate she felt that the task of explaining her purpose would not be without difficulty it would be necessary to tell everything how rachel had become suddenly an object of interest to mr luke rowan how dorothea suspected terrible things and how rachel was anxious for the worlds vanities the more she thought over it the more sure she felt that mr comfort would put an embargo upon the party it seemed but yesterday that he had been telling her with all his pulpit unction that the pleasures of this world should never be allowed to creep near the heart with doubting feet and doubting heart she walked up to the parsonage door and almost immediately found herself in the presence of her husbands old friend  whatever faults there might be in mr comforts character he was at any rate goodnatured and patient that he was sincere too no one who knew him well had ever doubtedsincere that is as far as his intentions went when he endeavoured to teach his flock that they should despise money he thought that he despised it himself when he told the little children that this world should be as nothing to them he did not remember that he himself enjoyed keenly the good things of this world if he had a fault it was perhaps thisthat he was a hard man at a bargain he liked to have all his temporalities and make them go as far as they could be stretched there was the less excuse for this seeing that his children were well and even richly settled in life and that his wife should she ever be left a widow would have ample provision for her few remaining years he had given his daughter a considerable fortune without which perhaps the cornbury grange people would not have welcomed her so kindly as they had done and now as he was still growing rich it was supposed that he would leave her more  he listened to mrs ray with the greatest attention having first begged her to recruit her strength with a glass of wine as she continued to tell her story he interrupted her from time to time with goodnatured little words and then when she had done he asked after luke rowans worldly means the young man has got something i suppose said he  got something repeated mrs ray not exactly catching his meaning  he has some share in the brewery hasnt he  i believe he has or is to have so rachel told me  yesyes ive heard of him before if tappitt doesnt take him into the concern hell have to give him a very serious bit of money theres no doubt about the young man having means well mrs ray i dont suppose rachel could do better than take him  take him  yeswhy not between you and me rachel is growing into a very handsome girla very handsome girl indeed id no idea shed be so tall and carry herself so well  oh mr comfort good looks are very dangerous for a young woman  well yes indeed they are but still you know handsome girls very often do very well and if this young man fancies miss rachel  but mr comfort there hasnt been anything of that i dont suppose he has ever thought of it and im sure she hasnt  but young people get to think of it i shouldnt be disposed to prevent their coming together in a proper sort of way i dont like night walkings in churchyards certainly but i really think that was only an accident  im sure rachel didnt mean it  im quite sure she didnt mean anything improper and as for him if he admires her it was natural enough that he should go after her if you ask my advice mrs ray i should just tell her to be cautious but i shouldnt be especially careful to separate them marriage is the happiest condition for a young woman and for a young man too and how are young people to get married if they are not allowed to see each other  and about the party mr comfort  oh let her go therell be no harm and ill tell you what mrs ray my daughter mrs cornbury is going from here and she shall pick her up and bring her home its always well for a young girl to go with a married woman then mrs ray did take her glass of sherry and walked back to braggs end wondering a good deal and not altogether at ease in her mind as to that great questionwhat line of moral conduct might best befit a devout christian  something also had been said at the interview about mrs prime mrs ray had intimated that mrs prime would separate herself from her mother and her sister unless her views were allowed to prevail in this question regarding the young man from the brewery but mr comfort in what few words he had said on this part of the subject had shown no consideration whatever for mrs prime then shell behave very wickedly he had said but im afraid mrs prime has learned to think too much of her own opinion lately if thats what she has got by going to mr prong she had better have remained in her own parish after that nothing more was said about mrs prime  oh let her go therell be no harm that had been mr comforts dictum about the evening party such as it was mrs ray felt herself bound to be guided by it she had told rachel that she would ask the clergymans advice and take it whatever it might be nevertheless she did not find herself to be easy as she walked home mr comforts latter teachings tended to upset all the convictions of her life according to his teaching as uttered in the sanctum of his own study young men were not to be regarded as ravening wolves and that meeting in the churchyard which had utterly overwhelmed dorothea by the weight of its iniquity and which even to her had been very terrible was a mere nothinga venial accident on rachels part and the most natural proceeding in the world on the part of luke rowan that it was natural enough for a wolf mrs ray could understand but she was now told that the lamb might go out and meet the wolf without any danger and then those questions about rowans share in the brewery and mr comforts ready assertion that the young wolfman or wolf as the case might bewas well to do in the world in fact mrs rays interview with her clergyman had not gone exactly as she had expected and she was bewildered and the path into evilif it was a path into evilwas made so easy and pleasant mrs ray had already considered the difficult question of rachels journey to the party and journey home again but provision was now made for all that in a way that was indeed very comfortable but which might make rachel very vain she was to be ushered into mrs tappitts drawingroom under the wing of the most august lady of the neighbourhood after that for the remaining halfhour of her walk home mrs ray gave her mind up to the consideration of what dress rachel should wear  when mrs ray reached her own gate rachel was in the garden waiting for her well mamma she said is dorothea at home mrs ray asked and on being informed that dorothea was at work within she desired rachel to follow her up to her bedroom when there she told her budget of newsnot stinting her child of the gratification which it was sure to give she said nothing about luke rowan and his means keeping that portion of mr comforts recommendation to herself but she declared it out as a fact that rachel was to accept the invitation and to be carried to the party by mrs butler cornbury oh mamma dear mamma said rachel who was leaning against the side of the bed then she gave a long sigh and a bright colour came over her facealmost as though she were blushing but she said no more at the moment but allowed her mind to run off and revel in its own thoughts she had indeed longed to go to this party though she had taught herself to believe that she could bear being told that she was not to go without disappointment and now we must let dorothea know said mrs ray yeswe must let her know said rachel but her mind was away straying i fear under the churchyard elms with luke rowan and looking at the arm amidst the clouds he had said that it was stretched out as though to take her and she had never shaken off from her imagination the idea that it was his arm on which she had been bidden to lookthe arm which had afterwards held her when she strove to go  it was teatime before courage was mustered for telling the facts to mrs prime mrs prime after dinner had gone into baslehurst but the meeting at miss puckers had not been a regular full gathering and mrs prime had come back to tea there was no hot toast and no clotted cream it may appear selfish on the part of mrs ray and rachel that they should have kept such good things for their only little private banquets but in truth such delicacies did not suit mrs prime nice things aggravated her spirits and made her fretful she liked the tea to be stringy and bitter and she liked the bread to be staleas she preferred also that her weeds should be battered and old she was approaching that stage of discipline at which ashes become pleasant eating and sackcloth is grateful to the skin the selfindulgences of the saints in this respect often exceed anything that is done by the sinners  dorothea said mrs ray and she looked down upon the dark dingy fluid in her cup as she spoke i have been up to mr comforts today  yes i heard you say you were going there  i went to ask him for advice  oh  as i was in much doubt i thought it right to go to the clergyman of my parish  i dont think much about parishes myself mr comfort is an old man now and i fear he does not give himself up to the gospel as he used to do if people were called upon to bind themselves down to parishes what would those poor creatures do who have over them such a pastor as dr harford  dr harford is a very good man i believe said rachel and he keeps two curates  im afraid rachel you know but little about it he does keep two curatesbut what are they they go to cricketmatches and among young women with bows and arrows if you had really wanted advice mamma i would sooner have heard that you had gone to mr prong  but i didnt go to mr prong my dearand i dont mean mr prong is all very well i dare say but ive known mr comfort for nearly thirty years and i dont like sudden changes then mrs ray stirred her tea with rather a quick motion of her hand rachel said not a word but her mothers sharp speech and spirited manner was very pleasant to her she was quite contented now that mr comfort should be regarded as the family counsellor she remembered how well she had loved mr comfort always and thought of days when patty comfort had been very goodnatured to her as a child  oh very well said mrs prime of course mamma you must judge for yourself  yes my dear i must or rather as i didnt wish to trust my own judgment i went to mr comfort for advice he says that he sees no harm in rachel going to this party  party what party almost screamed mrs prime mrs ray had forgotten that nothing had as yet been said to dorothea about the invitation  mrs tappitt is going to give a party at the brewery said rachel in her very softest voice and she has asked me  and you are going you mean to let her go mrs prime had asked two questions and she received two answers yes said rachel i suppose i shall go as mamma says so mr comfort says there is no harm in it said mrs ray and mrs butler cornbury is to come from the parsonage to take her up all question as to dorcas discipline to be inflicted daily upon rachel on account of that sin of which she had been guilty in standing under the elms with a young man was utterly lost in this terrible proposition instead of being sent to miss pucker in her oldest merino dress rachel was to be decked in muslin and finery and sent out to a dancing party at which this young man was to be the hero it was altogether too much for dorothea prime she slowly wiped the crumbs from off her dingy crape and with creaking noise pushed back her chair mother she said i couldnt have believed it i could not have believed it then she withdrew to her own chamber  mrs ray was much afflicted but not the less did rachel look out for the returning postman on his road into baslehurst that she might send her little note to mrs tappitt signifying her acceptance of that ladys kind invitation     chapter vi  preparations for mrs tappitts party   i am disposed to think that mrs butler cornbury did mrs tappitt an injury when she with so much ready goodnature accepted the invitation for the party and that mrs tappitt was aware of this before the night of the party arrived she was put on her mettle in a way that was disagreeable to her and forced into an amount of submissive supplication to mr tappitt for funds which was vexatious to her spirit mrs tappitt was a good wife who never ran her husband into debt and kept nothing secret from him in the management of her householdnothing at least which it behoved him to know but she understood the privileges of her position and could it have been possible for her to have carried through this party without extra household moneys or without any violent departure from her usual customs of life she could have snubbed her husbands objections comfortably and have put him into the background for the occasion without any inconvenience to herself or power of remonstrance from him but when mrs butler cornbury had been gracious and when the fiddles and horn had become a fact to be accomplished when mrs rowan and mary began to loom large on her imagination and a regular supper was projected then mrs tappitt felt the necessity of superior aid and found herself called upon to reconcile her lord  and this work was the more difficult and the more disagreeable to her feelings because she had already poohpoohed her husband when he asked a question about the party just a few friends got together by the girls she had said leave it all to them my dear its not very often they see anybody at home  i believe i see my friends as often as most people in baslehurst mr tappitt had replied indignantly and i suppose my friends are their friends so there had been a little soreness which made the ladys submission the more disagreeable to her  butler cornbury hes a puppy i dont want to see him and whats more i wont vote for him  you need not tell her so my dear and hes not coming i suppose you like your girls to hold their heads up in the place and if they show that theyve respectable people with them at home respectable people will be glad to notice them  respectable if our girls are to be made respectable by giving grand dances id rather not have them respectable how much is the whole thing to cost  well very little t not much more than one of your christmas dinnerparties therell be just the music and the lights and a bit of something to eat what people drink at such times comes to nothingjust a little negus and lemonade we might possibly have a bottle or two of champagne at the suppertable for the look of the thing  champagne exclaimed the brewer he had never yet incurred the cost of a bottle of champagne within his own house though he thought nothing of it at public dinners the idea was too much for him and mrs tappitt feeling how the ground lay gave that upat any rate for the present she gave up the champagne but in abandoning that she obtained the marital sanction a quasi sanction which he was too honourable as a husband afterwards to repudiate for the music and the eatables mrs tappitt knew that she had done well and prepared for his dinner that day a beefsteak pie made with her own hands tappitt was not altogether a dull man and understood these little signs ah said he i wonder how much that pie is to cost me  oh t how can you say such things as if you didnt have beefsteak pie as often as its good for you the pie however had its effect as also did the exceeding boilishness of the water which was brought in for his gintoddy that night and it was known throughout the establishment that papa was in a good humour and that mamma had been very clever  the girls must have had new dresses anyway before the month was out mrs tappitt said to her husband the next morning before he had left the conjugal chamber  do you mean to say that theyre to have gowns made on purpose for this party said the brewer and it seemed by the tone of his voice that the hot gin and water had lost its kindly effects  my dear they must be dressed you know im sure no girls in baslehurst cost less in the way of finery in the ordinary way theyd have had new frocks almost immediately  bother mr tappitt was shaving just at this moment and dashed aside his razor for a moment to utter this one word he intended to signify how perfectly well he was aware that a muslin frock prepared for an evening party would not fill the place of a substantial morning dress  well my dear im sure the girls aint unreasonable nor am i fiveandthirty shillings apiece for them would do it all and i shant want anything myself this year in september now mr tappitt who was a man of sentiment always gave his wife some costly article of raiment on the 1st of september calling her his partridge and his birdfor on that day they had been married mrs tappitt had frequently offered to intromit the ceremony when calling upon his generosity for other purposes but the september gift had always been forthcoming  will thirtyfive shillings apiece do it said he turning round with his face all covered with lather then again he went to work with his razor just under his right ear  well yes i think it will two pounds each for the three shall do it anyway  mr tappitt gave a little jump at this increased demand for fifteen shillings and not being in a good position for jumping encountered an unpleasant accident and uttered a somewhat vehement exclamation there said he now ive cut myself and its your fault oh dear oh dear when i cut myself there it never stops its no good doing that margaret it only makes it worse there now youve got the soap and blood all down inside my shirt  mrs tappitt on this occasion was subjected to some trouble for the wound on mr tappitts cheekbone declined to be stanched at once but she gained her object and got the dresses for her daughters it was not taken by them as a drawback on their happiness that they had to make the dresses themselves for they were accustomed to such work but this necessity joined to all other preparations for the party made them very busy till twelve at night on three evenings they sat with their smart new things in their laps and their needles in their hands but they did not begrudge this as mrs butler cornbury was coming to the brewery they were very anxious to get the heavy part of the work done before the rowans should arrive doubting whether they would become sufficiently intimate with mary to tell her all their little domestic secrets and do their work in the presence of their new friend during the first day of her sojourn in the house so they toiled like slaves on the wednesday and thursday in order that they might walk about like ladies on the friday and saturday  but the list of their guests gave them more trouble than aught else whom should they get to meet mrs butler cornbury at one time mrs tappitt had proposed to word certain of her invitations with a special view to this end had her idea been carried out people who might not otherwise have come were to be tempted by a notification that they were especially asked to meet mrs butler cornbury but martha had said that this she thought would not do for a dance people do do it my dear mrs tappitt had pleaded  not for dancing mamma said martha besides she would be sure to hear of it and perhaps she might not like it  well i dont know said mrs tappitt it would show that we appreciated her kindness the plan however was abandoned  of the baslehurst folk there were so few that were fitted to meet mrs butler cornbury there was old miss harford the rectors daughter she was fit to meet anybody in the county and as she was goodnatured might probably come but she was an old maid and was never very bright in her attire perhaps captain gordons lady would come mrs tappitt suggested but at this proposition all the girls shook their heads captain gordon had lately taken a villa close to baslehurst but had shown himself averse to any intercourse with the townspeople mrs tappitt had called on his lady and the call had not even been returned a card having been sent by post in an envelope  it would be no good mamma said martha and she would only make us uncomfortable if she did come  she is always awfully stuck up in church said augusta  and her nose is red at the end said cherry  therefore no invitation was sent to captain gordons house  if we could only get the fawcetts said augusta the fawcetts were a large family living in the centre of baslehurst in which there were four daughters all noted for dancing and noted also for being the merriest nicest and most popular girls in devonshire there was a fat goodnatured mother and a thin goodnatured father who had once been a banker at exeter everybody desired to know the fawcetts and they were the especial favourites of mrs butler cornbury but then mrs fawcett did not visit mrs tappitt the girls and the mothers had a bowing acquaintance and were always very gracious to each other old fawcett and old tappitt saw each other in town daily and knew each other as well as they knew the cross in the buttermarket but none of the two families ever went into each others houses it had been tacitly admitted among them that the fawcetts were above the tappitts and so the matter had rested but now if anything could be done mrs butler cornbury is all very well of course said augusta but it would be so nice for mary rowan to see the miss fawcetts dancing here  martha shook her head but at last she did write a note in the mothers name my girls are having a little dance to welcome a friend from london and they would feel so much obliged if your young ladies would come mrs butler cornbury has been kind enough to say that she would join us c c c mrs tappitt and augusta were in a seventh heaven of happiness when mrs fawcett wrote to say that three of her girls would be delighted to accept the invitation and even the discreet martha and the less ambitious cherry were well pleased  i declare i think weve been very fortunate said mrs tappitt  only the miss fawcetts will get all the best partners said cherry  im not so sure of that said augusta holding up her head  but there had been yet another trouble it was difficult for them to get people proper to meet mrs butler cornbury but what must they do as to those people who must come and who were by no means proper to meet her there were the griggses for instance who lived out of town in a wonderfully red brick house the family of a retired baslehurst grocer they had been asked before mrs cornburys call had been made or i fear their chance of coming to the party would have been small there was one young griggs a man very terrible in his vulgarity loud rampant conspicuous with villainous jewellery and odious with the worst abominations of perfumery he was loathsome even to the tappitt girls but then the griggses and the tappitts had known each other for half a century and among their ordinary acquaintances adolphus griggs might have been endured but what should they do when he asked to be introduced to josceline fawcett of all men he was the most unconscious of his own defects he had once shown some symptoms of admiration for cherry by whom he was hated with an intensity of dislike that had amounted to a passion she had begged that he might be omitted from the list but mrs tappitt had been afraid of angering their father  the rules also would be much in the way old joshua rule was a maltster living in cawston and his wife and daughter had been asked before the accession of the butler cornbury dignity old rule had supplied the brewery with malt almost ever since it had been a brewery and no more harmless people than mrs rule and her daughter existed in the neighbourhoodbut they were close neighbours of the comforts of mrs cornburys father and mother and mr comfort would have as soon asked his sexton to dine with him as the rules the rules never expected such a thing and therefore lived on very good terms with the clergyman im afraid she wont like meeting mrs rule augusta had said to her mother and then the mother had shaken her head  early in the week before rachel had accepted the invitation cherry had written to her friend of course youll come cherry had said and as you may have some difficulty in getting here and home again ill ask old mrs rule to call for you i know shell have a place in the fly and shes very goodnatured in answer to this rachel had written a separate note to cherry telling her friend in the least boastful words which she could use that provision had been already made for her coming and going mamma was up at mr comforts yesterday rachel wrote and he was so kind as to say that mrs butler cornbury would take me and bring me back i am very much obliged to you all the same and to mrs rule  what do you think said cherry who had received her note in the midst of one of the family conferences augusta said that mrs butler cornbury would not like to meet rachel ray but she is going to bring her in her own carriage  i never said anything of the kind said augusta  oh but you did augusta or mamma did or somebody how nice for rachel to be chaperoned by mrs butler cornbury  i wonder what shell wear said mrs tappitt who had on that morning achieved her victory over the wounded brewer in the matter of the three dresses  on the friday morning mrs rowan came with her daughter luke having met them at exeter on the thursday mrs rowan was a somewhat stately lady slow in her movements and careful in her speech so that the girls were at first very glad that they had valiantly worked up their finery before her coming but mary was by no means stately she was younger than them very willing to be pleased with pleasant round eager eyes and a kindly voice before she had been three hours in the house cherry had claimed mary for her own had told her all about the party all about the dresses all about mrs butler cornbury and the miss fawcetts and a word or two also about rachel ray i can tell you somebody thats almost in love with her you dont mean luke said mary yes but i do said cherry but of course im only in fun on the saturday mary was hard at work herself assisting in the decoration of the drawingroom and before the allimportant tuesday came even mrs rowan and mrs tappitt were confidential mrs rowan perceived at once that mrs tappitt was provincialas she told her son but she was a good motherly woman and on the whole mrs rowan condescended to be gracious to her  at braggs end the preparations for the party required almost as much thought as did those at the brewery and involved perhaps deeper care it may be remembered that mrs prime when her ears were first astounded by that unexpected revelation wiped the crumbs from out of her lap and walked off wounded in spirit to her own room on that evening rachel saw no more of her sister mrs ray went up to her daughters bedroom but stayed there only a minute or two what does she say asked rachel almost in a whisper she is very unhappy she says that unless i can be made to think better of this she must leave the cottage i told her what mr comfort says but she only sneers at mr comfort im sure im endeavouring to do the best i can  it wouldnt do mamma to say that she should manage everything otherwise im sure id give up the party  no my dear i dont want you to do thatnot after what mr comfort says mrs ray had in truth gone to the clergyman feeling sure that he would have given his word against the party and that so strengthened she could have taken a course that would have been offensive to neither of her daughters she had expected too that she would have returned home armed with such clerical thunders against the young man as would have quieted rachel and have satisfied dorothea but in all this she had beeni may hardly say disappointedbut dismayed and bewildered by advice the very opposite to that which she had expected it was perplexing but she seemed to be aware that she had no alternative now but to fight the battle on rachels side she had cut herself off from all anchorage except that given by mr comfort and therefore it behoved her to cling to that with absolute tenacity rachel must go to the party even though dorothea should carry out her threat on that night nothing more was said about dorothea and mrs ray allowed herself to be gradually drawn into a mild discussion about rachels dress  but there was nearly a week left to them of this sort of life early on the following morning mrs prime left the cottage saying that she should dine with miss pucker and betook herself at once to a small house in a back street of the town behind the new church in which lived mr prong have i as yet said that mr prong was a bachelor such was the fact and there were not wanting those in baslehurst who declared that he would amend the fault by marrying mrs prime but this rumour if it ever reached her had no effect upon her the world would be nothing to her if she were to be debarred by the wickedness of loose tongues from visiting the clergyman of her choice she went therefore in her present difficulty to mr prong  mr samuel prong was a little man over thirty with scanty lightbrown hair with a small rather upturned nose with eyes by no means deficient in light and expression but with a mean mouth his forehead was good and had it not been for his mouth his face would have been expressive of intellect and of some firmness but there was about his lips an assumption of character and dignity which his countenance and body generally failed to maintain and there was a something in the carriage of his head and in the occasional projection of his chin which was intended to add to his dignity but which did i think only make the failure more palpable he was a devout good man not selfindulgent perhaps not more selfambitious than it becomes a man to be sincere hardworking sufficiently intelligent true in most things to the instincts of his callingbut deficient in one vital qualification for a clergyman of the church of england he was not a gentleman may i not call it a necessary qualification for a clergyman of any church he was not a gentleman i do not mean to say that he was a thief or a liar nor do i mean hereby to complain that he picked his teeth with his fork and misplaced his hs i am by no means prepared to define what i do meanthinking however that most men and most women will understand me nor do i speak of this deficiency in his clerical aptitudes as being injurious to him simplyor even chieflyamong folk who are themselves gentle but that his efficiency for clerical purposes was marred altogether among high and low by his misfortune in this respect it is not the owner of a good coat that sees and admires its beauty it is not even they who have good coats themselves who recognize the article on the back of another they who have not good coats themselves have the keenest eyes for the coats of their betterclad neighbours as it is with coats so it is with that which we call gentility it is caught at a word it is seen at a glance it is appreciated unconsciously at a touch by those who have none of it themselves it is the greatest of all aids to the doctor the lawyer the member of parliamentthough in that position a man may perhaps prosper without itand to the statesman but to the clergyman it is a vital necessity now mr prong was not a gentleman  mrs prime told her tale to mr prong as mrs ray had told hers to mr comfort it need not be told again here i fear that she made the most of her sisters imprudence but she did not do so with intentional injustice she declared her conviction that rachel might still be made to go in a straight course if only she could be guided by a hand sufficiently strict and armed with absolute power then she went on to tell mr prong how mrs ray had gone off to mr comfort as she herself had now come to him it was hardwas it notfor poor rachel that the story of her few minutes whispering under the elm tree should thus be bruited about among the ecclesiastical councillors of the locality mr prong sat with patient face and with mild demeanour while the simple story of rachels conduct was being told but when to this was added the iniquity of mr comforts advice the mouth assumed the wouldbe grandeur the chin came out and to any one less infatuated than mrs prime it would have been apparent that the purse was not made of silk but that a coarser material had come to hand in the manufacture  what shall the sheep do said mr prong when the shepherd slumbers in the folds then he shook his head and puckered up his mouth  ah said mrs prime it is well for the sheep that there are still left a few who do not run from their work even in the heat of the noonday sun  mr prong closed his eyes and bowed his head and then reassumed that peculiarly disagreeable look about his mouth by which he thought to assert his dignity intending thereby to signify that he would willingly reject the compliment as unnecessary were he not forced to accept it as being true he knew himself to be a shepherd who did not fear the noonday heat but he was wrong in thisthat he suspected all other shepherds of stinting their work it appeared to him that no sheep could nibble his grass in wholesome content unless some shepherd were at work at him constantly with his crook it was for the shepherd as he thought to know what tufts of grass were rank and in what spots the herbage might be bitten down to the bare ground a shepherd who would allow his flock to feed at large under his eye merely watching his fences and folding his ewes and lambs at night was a truant who feared the noonday sun such a one had mr comfort become and therefore mr prong despised him in his heart all sheep will not endure such ardent shepherding as that practised by mr prong and therefore he was driven to seek out for himself a peculiar flock these to him were the elect of baslehurst and of his elect mrs prime was the most elect now this fault is not uncommon among young ardent clergymen  i will not repeat the conversation that took place between the two because they used holy words and spoke on holy subjects in doing so they were both sincere and not as regarded their language fairly subject to ridicule in their judgment i think they were defective he sustained mrs prime in her resolution to quit the cottage unless she could induce her mother to put a stop to that great iniquity of the brewery the tappitts he said were worldly peoplevery worldly people utterly unfit to be the associates of the sister of his friend as to the young man he thought that nothing further should be said at present but that rachel should be closely watchedvery closely watched mrs prime asked him to call upon her mother and explain his views but he declined to do this he would have been most willingso willing but he could not force himself where he would be unwelcome mrs prime was if necessary to quit the cottage and take up her temporary residence with miss pucker but mr prong was inclined to think knowing something of mrs rays customary softness of character that if mrs prime were firm things would not be driven to such a pass as that mrs prime said that she would be firm and she looked as though she intended to keep her word  mr prongs manner as he bade adieu to his favourite sheep was certainly of a nature to justify that rumour to which allusion has been made he pressed mrs primes hand very closely and invoked a blessing on her head in a warm whisper but such signs among such people do not bear the meaning which they have in the outer world these people are demonstrative and unctuouswhereas the outer world is reticent and dry they are perhaps too free with their love but the fault is better than that other fault of no love at all mr prong was a little free with his love but mrs prime took it all in good part and answered him with an equal fervour if i can help you dear friendand he still held her hand in hiscome to me always you never can come too often  you can help me and i will come always she said returning his pressure with mutual warmth but there was no touch of earthly affection in her pressure and if there was any in his at its close there had at any rate been none at its commencement  while mrs prime was thus employed rachel and her mother became warm upon the subject of the dress and when the younger widow returned home to the cottage the elder widow was actually engaged in baslehurst on the purchase of trappings and vanities her little hoard was opened and some pretty piece of muslin was purchased by aid of which with the needful ribbons rachel might be made not fit indeed for mrs butler cornburys carriageno such august fitness was at all contemplated by herselfbut nice and tidy so that her presence need not be a disgrace and it was pretty to see how mrs ray revelled in these little gauds for her daughter now that the barrier of her religious awe was broken down and that the waters of the world had made their way in upon her she still had a feeling that she was being drowned but she confessed that such drowning was very pleasant she almost felt that such drowning was good for her at any rate it had been ordered by mr comfort and if things went astray mr comfort must bear the blame when the bright muslin was laid out on the counter before her she looked at it with a pleased eye and touched it with a willing hand she held the ribbon against the muslin leaning her head on one side and enjoyed herself now and again she would turn her face upon rachels figure and she would almost indulge a wish that this young man might like her child in the new dress ahthat was surely wicked but if so how wicked are most mothers in this christian land  the morning had gone very comfortably with them during dorotheas absence mrs prime had hardly taken her departure before a note came from mrs butler cornbury confirming mr comforts offer as to the carriage oh papa what have you doneshe had said when her father first told her now i must stay there all the night for of course shell want to go on to the last dance but like her father she was goodnatured and therefore though she would hardly have chosen the task she resolved when her first groans were over to do it well she wrote a kind note saying how happy she should be naming her hourand saying that rachel should name the hour for her return  it will be very nice said rachel rejoicing more than she should have done in thinking of the comfortable grandeur of mrs butler cornburys carriage  and are you determined mrs prime asked her mother that evening  it is too late to go back now dorothea said mrs ray almost crying  then i cannot remain in the house said dorothea i shall go to miss puckersbut not till that morning so that if you think better of it all may be prevented yet  but mrs ray would not think better of it and it was thus that the preparations were made for mrs tappittsball the word party had now been dropped by common consent throughout baslehurst     chapter vii  an account of mrs tappitts ballcommenced   mrs butler cornbury was a very pretty woman she possessed that peculiar prettiness which is so often seen in england and which is rarely seen anywhere else she was bright wellfeatured with speaking lustrous eyes with perfect complexion and full bust with head of glorious shape and figure like a junoand yet with all her beauty she had ever about her an air of homeliness which made the sweetness of her womanhood almost more attractive than the loveliness of her personal charms i have seen in italy and in america women perhaps as beautiful as any that i have seen in england but in neither country does it seem that such beauty is intended for domestic use in italy the beauty is soft and of the flesh in america it is hard and of the mind here it is of the heart i think and as such is the happiest of the three i do not say that mrs butler cornbury was a woman of very strong feeling but her strongest feelings were home feelings she was going to mrs tappitts party because it might serve her husbands purposes she was going to burden herself with rachel ray because her father had asked her and her greatest ambition was to improve the worldly position of the squires of cornbury grange she was already calculating whether it might not some day be brought about that her little butler should sit in parliament for his county  at nine oclock exactly on that much to be remembered tuesday the cornbury carriage stopped at the gate of the cottage at braggs end and rachel ready dressed blushing nervous but yet happy came out and mounting on to the step was almost fearful to take her share of the seat make yourself comfortable my dear said mrs cornbury you cant crush me or rather i always make myself crushable on such occasions as this i suppose we are going to have a great crowd rachel merely said that she didnt know she supposed there would be a good many persons then she tried to thank mrs cornbury for being so good to her and of course broke down im delightedquite delighted said mrs cornbury its so good of you to come with me now that i dont dance myself theres nothing i like so much as taking out girls that do  and dont you dance at all  i stand up for a quadrille sometimes when a woman has five children i dont think she ought to do more than that  oh i shall not do more than that mrs cornbury  you mean to say you wont waltz  mamma never said anything about it but im sure she would not like it besides  well  i dont think i know how i did learn once when i was very little but ive forgotten  it will soon come again to you if you like to try i was very fond of waltzing before i was married and this was the daughter of mr comfort the clergyman who preached with such strenuous eloquence against worldly vanities even rachel was a little puzzled and was almost afraid that her head was sinking beneath the waters  there was a great fuss made when mrs butler cornburys carriage drove up to the brewery door and rachel almost felt that she could have made her way up to the drawingroom more comfortably under mrs rules mild protection all the servants seemed to rush at her and when she found herself in the hall and was conducted into some inner room she was not allowed to shake herself into shape without the aid of a maidservant mrs cornburywho took everything as a matter of course and was ready in a minutehad turned the maid over to the young lady with a kind idea that the young ladys toilet was more important than that of the married woman rachel was losing her head and knew that she was doing so when she was again taken into the hall she hardly remembered where she was and when mrs cornbury took her by the arm and began to walk upstairs with her her strongest feeling was a wish that she was at home again on the first landingfor the dancingroom was upstairsthey encountered mr tappitt conspicuous in a blue satin waistcoat and on the second landing they found mrs tappitt magnificent in a green irish poplin oh mrs cornbury we are so delighted the miss fawcetts are here they are just come how kind of you to bring rachel ray how do you do rachel then mrs cornbury moved easily on into the drawingroom and rachel still found herself carried with her she was half afraid that she ought to have slunk away from her magnificent chaperon as soon as she was conveyed safely within the house and that she was encroaching as she thus went on but still she could not find the moment in which to take herself off in the drawingroomthe room from which the carpets had been takenthey were at once encountered by the tappitt girls with whom the fawcett girls on the present occasion were so intermingled that rachel hardly knew who was who mrs butler cornbury was soon surrounded and a clatter of words went on rachel was in the middle of the fray and some voices were addressed also to her but her presence of mind was gone and she never could remember what she said on the occasion  there had already been a dancethe commencing operation of the nights worka thin quadrille in which the early comers had taken part without much animation and to which they had been driven up unwillingly at its close the fawcett girls had come in as had now mrs cornbury so that it may be said that the evening was beginning again what had been as yet done was but the tuning of the fiddles before the commencement of the opera no one likes to be in at the tuning but there are those who never are able to avoid this annoyance as it was rachel under mrs cornburys care had been brought upon the scene just at the right moment as soon as the great clatter had ceased she found herself taken by the hand by cherry and led a little on one side you must have a card you know said cherry handing her a ticket on which was printed the dances as they were to succeed each other that first one is over such a dull thing i danced with adolphus griggs just because i couldnt escape him for one quadrille rachel took the card but never having seen such a thing before did not in the least understand its object as you get engaged for the dances you must put down their names in this way you seeand cherry showed her card which already bore the designations of several cavaliers scrawled in hieroglyphics which were intelligible to herself havent you got a pencil well you can come to me i have one hanging here you know rachel was beginning to understand and to think that she should not have very much need for the pencil when mrs cornbury returned to her bringing a young man in her wake i want to introduce my cousin to you walter cornbury said she mrs cornbury was a woman who knew her duty as a chaperon and who would not neglect it he waltzes delightfully said mrs cornbury whispering and you neednt be afraid of being a little astray with him at first he always does what i tell him then the introduction was made but rachel had no opportunity of repeating her fears or of saying again that she thought she had better not waltz what to say to mr walter cornbury she hardly knew but before she had really said anything he had pricked her down for two dancesfor the first waltz which was just going to begin and some not long future quadrille she is very pretty mrs butler cornbury had said to her cousin and i want to be kind to her ill take her in hand and pull her through said walter what a tribe of people theyve got here havent they yes and you must dance with them all every time you stand up may be as good as a vote oh said walter im not particularill dance as long as they keep the house open then he went back to rachel who had already been at work with cherrys pencil  if there isnt rachel ray going to waltz with walter cornbury said augusta to her mother augusta had just refused the odious griggs and was about to stand up with a clerk in the brewery who was almost as odious  its because she came in the carriage said mrs tappitt but i dont think she can waltz then she hurried off to welcome other comers  rachel had hardly been left alone for a minute and had been so much bewildered by the lights and crowd and strangeness of everything around her that she had been unable to turn her thoughts to the one subject on which during the last week her mind had rested constantly she had not even looked round the room for luke rowan she had just seen mary rowan in the crowd but had not spoken to her she had only known her from the manner in which cherry tappitt had spoken to her and it must be explained that rachel had not seen young rowan since that parting under the elmtrees indeed since then she had seen none of the tappitt family her mother had said no word to her cautioning her that she had better not seek them in her evening walks but she had felt herself debarred from going into baslehurst by all that her sister had said and in avoiding luke rowan she had avoided the whole party from the brewery  now the room was partially cleared the nondancers being pressed back into a border round the walls and the music began rachel with her heart in her mouth was claimed by her partner and was carried forward towards the ground for dancing tacitly assenting to her fate because she lacked words in which to explain to mr cornbury how very much she would have preferred to be left in obscurity behind the wall of crinoline  pray wait a minute or two said she almost panting  oh certainly theres no hurry only well stand where we can get our place when we like it you need not be a bit afraid of going on with me patty has told me all about it and well make it right in a brace of turns there was something very goodnatured in his voice and she almost felt that she could ask him to let her sit down  i dont think i can she said  oh yes come well try then he took her by the waist and away they went twice round the room he took her very gently as he thought but her head had gone from her instantly in a whirl of amazement of her feet and their movements she had known nothing though she had followed the music with fair accuracy she had done so unconsciously and when he allowed her to stop she did not know which way she had been going or at which end of the room she stood and yet she had liked it and felt some little triumph as a conviction came upon her that she had not conspicuously disgraced herself  thats charming said he she essayed to speak a word in answer but her want of breath did not as yet permit it  charming he went on the musics perhaps a little slow but well hurry them up presently slow it seemed to her that she had been carried round in a vortex of which the rapidity though pleasant had been almost frightful come well have another start said he and she was carried away again before she had spoken a word id no idea that girl could waltz said mrs tappitt to old mrs rule i dont think her mother would like it if she saw it said mrs rule and what would mrs prime say said mrs tappitt however the ice was broken and rachel when she was given to understand that that dance was done felt herself to be aware that the world of waltzing was open to her at any rate for that night was it very wicked she had her doubts if anybody had suggested to her before mrs cornburys carriage had called for her that she would waltz on that evening she would have repudiated the idea almost with horror how easy is the path down the shores of the avernus but thenwas she going down the shores of the avernus  she was still walking through the crowd leaning on her partners arm and answering his goodnatured questions almost in monosyllables when she was gently touched on the arm by a fan and on turning found herself confronted by luke rowan and his sister ive been trying to get at you so long said he making some sort of half apology to cornbury and havent been able though once i very nearly danced you down without your knowing it  were so much obliged to you for letting us escape said cornbury are we not miss ray  we carried heavy metal i can tell you said rowan but i must introduce you to my sister where on earth have you been for these ten days then the introduction was made and young cornbury finding that his partner was in the hands of another lady slipped away  i have heard a great deal about you miss ray said mary rowan  have you i dont know who should say much about me the words sounded uncivil but she did not know what words to choose  oh from cherry especiallyandand from my brother  im very glad to make your acquaintance said rachel  he told me that you would have been sure to come and walk with us and we have all been saying that you had disappeared  i have been kept at home said rachel who could not help remembering all the words of the churchyard interview and feeling them down to her finger nails he must have known why she had not again joined the girls from the brewery in their walks or had he forgotten that he had called her rachel and held her fast by the hand perhaps he did these things so often to other girls that he thought nothing of them  you have been keeping yourself up for the ball said rowan precious people are right to make themselves scarce and now what vacancies have you got for me  vacancies said rachel  you dont mean to say youve got none look here ive kept all these on purpose for you although twenty girls have begged me to dispose of them in their favour  oh luke how can you tell such fibs said his sister  wellhere they are and he showed his card  im not engaged to anybody said rachel except for one quadrille to mr cornburythat gentleman who just went away  then youve no excuse for not filling up my vacancieskept on purpose for you mind and immediately her name was put down for she knew not what dances then he took her card and scrawled his own name on it in various places she knew that she was weak to let him thus have his way in everything but he was strong and she could not hinder him  she was soon left with mary rowan as luke went off to fulfil the first of his numerous engagements do you like my brother said she but of course i dont mean you to answer that question we all think him so very clever  im sure he is very clever  a great deal too clever to be a brewer but you mustnt say that i said so i wanted him to go into the army  i shouldnt at all like that for my brotherif i had one  and what would you like  oh i dont know i never had a brotherperhaps to be a clergyman  yes that would be very nice but luke would never be a clergyman he was going to be an attorney but he didnt like that at all he says theres a great deal of poetry in brewing beer but of course hes only quizzing us oh heres my partner i do so hope i shall see you very often while im at baslehurst then rachel was alone but mrs tappitt came up to her in a minute my dear said she mr griggs desires the honour of your hand for a quadrille and thus rachel found herself standing up with the odious mr griggs i do so pity you said cherry coming behind her for a moment remember you need not do it more than once i dont mean to do it again  after that she was allowed to sit still while a polka was being performed mrs cornbury came to her saying a word or two but she did not stay with her long so that rachel could think about luke rowan and try to make up her mind as to what words she should say to him she furtively looked down upon her card and found that he had written his own name to five dances ending with sir roger de coverley at the close of the evening it was quite impossible that she should dance five dances with him so she thought that she would mark out two with her nail the very next was one of them and during that she would explain to him what she had done the whole thing loomed large in her thoughts and made her feel anxious she would have been unhappy if he had not come to her at all and now she was unhappy because he had thrust himself upon her so violentlyor if not unhappy she was at any rate uneasy and what should she say about the elmtrees nothing unless he spoke to her about them she fancied that he would say something about the arm in the cloud and if so she must endeavour to make him understand thatthatthat she did not know how to fix her thoughts would it be possible to make him understand that he ought not to have called her rachel  while she was thinking of all this mr tappitt came and sat beside her very pretty isnt it said he very pretty indeed i call it  oh yes very pretty i had no idea it would be so nice to mr tappitt in his blue waistcoat she could speak without hesitation ah me it is the young men who receive all the reverence that the world has to payall the reverence that is worth receiving when a man is turned forty and has become fat anybody can speak to him without awe  yes it is nice said mr tappitt who however was not quite easy in his mind he had been into the supper room and had found the waiter handling longnecked bottles arranging them in rows apparently by the dozen whats that said he sharply the champagne sir there should have been ice sir but i suppose they forgot it where had mrs t procured all that wine it was very plain to him that she had got the better of him by some deceit he would smile and smile and smile during the evening but he would have it out with mrs tappitt before he would allow that lady to have any rest he lingered in the room pretending that he was overlooking the arrangements but in truth he was counting the bottles after all there was but a dozen he knew that at griggss they sold it for sixty shillings three pounds he said to himself three pounds more dear dear  yes it is nice he said to rachel mind you get a glass of champagne when you go in to supper bytheby shall i get a partner for you here buckett come and dance the next dance with miss ray buckett was the clerk in the brewery rachel had nothing to say for herself so bucketts name was put down on the card though she would rather not have danced with buckett a week or two ago before she had been taken up into mrs cornburys carriage or had waltzed with mrs cornburys cousin or had looked at the setting sun with luke rowan she would have been sufficiently contented to dance with mr buckettif in those days she had ever dreamed of dancing with any one then mrs cornbury came to her again bringing other cavaliers and rachels card began to be filled the quadrille before supper you dance with me said walter cornbury thats settled you know oh what a new world it was and so different from the dorcas meetings at miss puckers rooms  then came the moment of the evening which of all the moments was the most trying to her luke rowan came to claim her hand for the next quadrille she had already spoken to himor rather he to her but that had been in the presence of a third person when of course nothing could be said about the sunset and the cloudsnothing about that promise of friendship but now she would have to stand again with him in solitudea solitude of another kindin a solitude which was authorized during which he might whisper what words he pleased to her and from which she could not even run away it had been thought to be a great sin on her part to have remained a moment with him by the stile but now she was to stand up with him beneath the glare of the lights dressed in her best on purpose that he might whisper to her what words he pleased but she was sureshe thought that she was sure that he would utter no words so sweet so full of meaning as those in which he bade her watch the arm in the clouds  till the first figure was over for them he hardly spoke to her tell me said he then why has nobody seen you since saturday week last  i have been at home  ah but tell me the truth remember what we said as we partedabout being friends one tells ones friend the real truth but i suppose you do not remember what we said  i dont think i said anything mr rowan  did you not then i must have been dreaming i thought you promised me your friendship he paused for her answer but she said nothing she could not declare to him that she would not be his friend but you have not told me yet why it was that you remained at home comeanswer me a fair question fairly had i offended you again she paused and made him no reply it seemed to her that the room was going round her and that the music made her dizzy if she told him that he had not offended her would she not thereby justify him in having called her rachel  then i did offend you said he  oh mr rowannever mind now you must go on with the figure and thus for a moment she was saved from her difficulty when he had done his work of dancing she began hers and as she placed both her hands in his to make the final turn she flattered herself that he would not go back to the subject  nor did he while the quadrille lasted as they continued to dance he said very little to her and before the last figure was over she had almost settled down to enjoyment he merely spoke a word or two about mrs cornburys dress and another word about the singular arrangement of mr griggs jewellery at which word she almost laughed outright and then a third word laudatory of the tappitt girls as for cherry said he im quite in love with her for her pure goodnature and hearty manners and of all living female human beings martha is the most honest and just  oh ill tell her that said rachel she will so like it  no you mustnt you mustnt repeat any of the things i tell you in confidence that word confidence again silenced her and nothing more was said till he had offered her his arm at the end of the dance  come away and have some negus on the stairs he said the reason i like these sort of parties is that one is allowed to go into such queer places you see that little room with the door open thats where mr tappitt keeps his old boots and the whip with which he drives his grey horse there are four men playing cards there now and one is seated on the end of an upturned portmanteau  and where are the old boots  packed away on the top of mrs tappitts bed i helped to put them there some are stuck under the grate because there are no fires now look here theres a seat in the window then he placed her in the inclosure of an old window on the staircase landing and brought her lemonade and when she had drunk it he sat down beside her  hadnt we better go back to the dancing  they wont begin for a few minutes theyre only tuning up again you should always escape from the hot air for a moment or two besides you must answer me that question did i offend you  please dont talk of it please dont its all over now  ah but it is not all over i knew you were angry with me becauseshall i say why  no mr rowan dont say anything about it  at any rate i may think that you have forgiven me but what if i offend in the same way again what if i ask permission to do it so that it may be no offence only think if i am to live here in baslehurst all my life is it not reasonable that i should wish you to be my friend are you going to separate yourself from cherry tappitt because you are afraid of me  oh no  but is not that what you have done during the last week miss rayif it must be miss ray then he paused but still she said nothing rachel is such a pretty name  oh i think it so ugly  its the prettiest name in the bible and the name most fit for poetic use who does not remember rachel weeping for her children  thats the idea and not the name ruth is twice prettier and mary the sweetest of all  i never knew anybody before called rachel said he  and i never knew anybody called luke  thats a coincidence is it nota coincidence that ought to make us friends i may call you rachel then  oh no please dont what would people think  perhaps they would think the truth said he perhaps they would imagine that i called you so because i liked you but perhaps they might think also that you let me do so because you liked me people do make such mistakes  at this moment up came to them with flushed face mr buckett i have been looking for you everywhere said he to rachel its nearly over now  i am so sorry said rachel but i quite forgot  so i presume said mr buckett angrily but at the same time he gave his arm to rachel and led her away the fag end of some waltz remained and he might get a turn with her people in his hearing had spoken of her as the belle of the room and he did not like to lose his chance oh mr rowan said rachel looking back as she was being led away i must speak one word to mr rowan then she separated herself and returning a step or two almost whispered to her late partneryou have put me down for ever so many dances you must scratch out two or three of them  not one said he an engagement is an engagement  oh but i really cant  of course i cannot make you but i will scratch out nothingand forget nothing  then she rejoined mr buckett and was told by him that young rowan was not liked in the brewery at all we think him conceited you know he pretends to know more than anybody else     chapter viii  an account of mrs tappitts ballconcluded   it came to be voted by public acclamation that rachel ray was the belle of the evening i think this was brought about quite as much by mrs butler cornburys powerful influence as by rachels beauty mrs butler cornbury having begun the work of chaperon carried it on heartily and talked her young friend up to the top of the tree long before supper her card was quite full but filled in a manner that was not comfortable to herselffor she knew that she had made mistakes as to those spaces on which the letter r was written she kept them very sacred she was quite resolved that she would not stand up with him on all those occasionsthat she would omit at any rate two but she would accept no one else for those two dances not choosing to select any special period for throwing him over she endeavoured to explain this when she waltzed with him shortly before supper but her explanation did not come easy and she wanted all her attention for the immediate work she had in hand if youd only give yourself to it a little more eagerly he said youd waltz beautifully  i shall never do it well she answered i dont suppose i shall ever try again  but you like it  oh yes i like it excessively but one cant do everything that one likes  no i cant you wont let me do what i like  dont talk in that way mr rowan if you do youll destroy all my pleasure you should let me enjoy it while it lasts in this way she was becoming intimate with him  how very nicely your house does for a dance said mrs cornbury to mrs tappitt  oh deari dont think so our rooms are so small but its very kind of you to say so indeed i never can be sufficiently obliged  bytheby said mrs cornbury what a nice girl rachel ray has grown  yes indeed said mrs tappitt  and dances so well id no idea of it the young men seem rather taken with her dont you think so  i declare i think they are i always fancy that is rather a misfortune to a young girlparticularly when it must mean nothing as of course it cant with poor rachel  i dont see that at all  her mother you know mrs cornburythey are not in the way of seeing any company it was so kind of you to bring her here and really she does look very nice my girls are very goodnatured to her i only hope her head wont be turned heres mr tappitt you must go down mrs cornbury and eat a little bit of supper then mr tappitt in his blue waistcoat led mrs cornbury away  i am a very bad hand at supper said the lady  you must take just one glass of champagne said the gentleman now that the wine was there mr tappitt appreciated the importance of the occasion  for the last dance before supperor that which was intended to be the lastrachel had by long agreement been the partner of walter cornbury but now that it was over the majority of the performers could not go into the supperroom because of the crowd young cornbury therefore proposed that they should loiter about till their time came he was very well inclined for such loitering with rachel  youre flirting with that girl master walter said mrs cornbury  i suppose thats what she came for said the cousin  by no means and shes under my care therefore i beg youll talk no nonsense to her  walter cornbury probably did talk a little nonsense to her but it was very innocent nonsense most of such flirtations if they were done out loud would be very innocent young men are not nearly so pointed in their compliments as their elders and generally confine themselves to remarks of which neither mothers nor grandmothers could disapprove if they heard them the romance lies rather in the thoughts than in the words of those concerned walter cornbury believed that he was flirting and felt himself to be happy but he had uttered nothing warmer to rachel than a hope that he might meet her at the next torquay ball  i never go to public balls said rachel  but why not miss ray said walter  i never went to a dance of any description before this  but now that youve begun of course youll go on mr cornburys flirtation never reached a higher pitch than that  when he had got as far as that luke rowan played him a trickan inhospitable trick seeing that he rowan was in some sort at home and that the people about him were bound to obey him he desired the musicians to strike up again while the elders were eating their supperand then claimed rachels hand so that he might have the pleasure of serving her with cold chicken and champagne  miss ray is going into supper with me said cornbury  but supper is not ready said rowan and miss ray is engaged to dance with me  quite a mistake on your part said cornbury  no mistake at all said rowan  indeed it is come miss ray well take a turn down into the hall and see if places are ready for us cornbury rather despised rowan as being a brewer and mechanical and probably he showed that he did so  places are not ready so you need not trouble miss ray to go down as yet but a couple is wanted for a quadrille and therefore im sure shell stand up  come along rachel said cherry we just want you this will be the nicest of all because we shall have room  rachel had become unhappy seeing that the two men were in earnest had not cherry spoken she would have remained with mr cornbury thinking that to be her safer conduct but cherrys voice had overpowered her and she gave her arm to young rowan moving away with slow hesitating step  of course miss ray will do as she pleases said cornbury  of course she will said rowan  i am so sorry said rachel but i was engaged and it seems i am really wanted walter cornbury bowed very stiffly and there was an end of his flirtation thats the sort of thing that always happens when a fellow comes among this sort of people it was thus he consoled himself as he went down solitary to his supper  thats all right said rowan now weve cherry for our visàvis and after that well go down to supper comfortably  but i said id go with him  you cant now for he has gone without you what a brick cherry is do you know what she said of you  no do tell me  i wont it will make you vain  oh dear no but i want cherry to like me because i am so fond of her  she says youre by far but i wont tell you i hate compliments and that would look like one come whos forgetting the figure now i shouldnt wonder if young cornbury went into the brewery and drowned himself in one of the vats  it was very nicevery nice indeed this was her third dance with luke rowan and she was beginning to think that the other two might perhaps come off without any marked impropriety on her part she was a little unhappy about mr cornburyon his cousins account rather than on his own mrs cornbury had been so kind to her that she ought to have remained with walter when he desired it so she told herselfbut yet she liked being taken down to supper by luke rowan she had one other cause of uneasiness she constantly caught mrs tappitts eye fixed upon herself and whenever she did so mrs tappitts eye seemed to look unkindly at her she had also an instinctive feeling that augusta did not regard her with favour and that this disfavour arose from mr rowans attentions it was all very nice but still she felt that there was danger around her and sometimes she would pause a moment in her happiness and almost tremble as she thought of things she was dividing herself poles asunder from mrs prime  and now well go to supper said rowan come cherry do you and boyd go on first boyd was a friend of rowans do you know ive done such a clever trick this is my second descent among the eatables as i belong in a manner to the house i took down miss harford and hovered about her for five minutes then i managed to lose myself in the crowd and coming up here got the music up the fellows were just going off weve plenty of time now because theyre in the kitchen eating and drinking i contrived all that dodge that i might give you this glass of wine with my own hands  oh mr rowan it was very wrong  and thats my reward i dont care about its being wrong as long as its pleasant  what shocking morality  all is fair in well never mind youll own it is pleasant  oh yes its very pleasant  then im contented and will leave the moral of it for mr cornbury ill tell you something further if youll let me  pray dont tell me anything that you ought not  ive done all i could to get up this party on purpose that we might have you here  nonsense  but i have i have cared about it just because it would enable me to say one word to youand now im afraid to say it  she was sitting there close to him and she couldnt go away she couldnt run as she had done from the stile she couldnt show any feeling of offence before all those who were around her and yetwas it not her duty to do something to stop him pray dont say such things she whispered  i tell you that im afraid to say it here give me some wine youll take some more no well shall we go i am afraid to say it they were now out in the hall standing idly there with their backs to another door i wonder what answer you would make me  we had better go upstairs indeed we had  stop a moment miss ray why is it that you are so unwilling even to stay a moment with me  im not unwilling only we had better go now  do you remember when i held your arm at the stile  no i dont remember anything about it you ought not to have done it do you know i think you are very cruel as she made the accusation she looked down upon the floor and spoke in a low trembling voice that almost convinced him that she was in earnest  cruel said he thats hard too  or you wouldnt prevent me enjoying myself while i am here by saying things which you ought to know i dont like  i have hardly thought whether you would like what i say or not but i know this i would give anything in the world to make myself sure that you would ever look back upon this evening as a happy one  i will if youll come upstairs and  and what  and go on withoutwithout seeming to mind me so much  ah but i do mind you rachelno you shall not go for a minute listen to me for one moment then he tried to stand before her but she was off from him and ran upstairs by herself what was it that he wished to say to her she knew that she would have liked to have heard itnay that she was longing to hear it but she was startled and afraid of him and as she gently crept in at the door of the dancingroom she determined that she would tell mrs cornbury that she was quite ready for the carriage it was impossible that she should go through those other two dances with luke rowan and as for her other engagements they must be allowed to shift for themselves one had been made early in the evening with mr griggs it would be a great thing to escape dancing with mr griggs she would ask cherry to make her apologies to everybody as she entered the room she felt ashamed of herself and unable to take any place she was oppressed by an idea that she ought not to be walking about without some gentleman with her and that people would observe her she was still very near the door when she perceived that mr rowan was also coming in she determined to avoid him if she could feeling sure that she could not stop him in anything that he might say while so many people would be close around them and yet she felt almost disappointment when she heard his voice as he talked merrily with some one at the door at that moment mrs cornbury came up to her walking across the room on purpose to join her  what all alone i thought your hand was promised for every dance up to five oclock  i believe im engaged to some one now but i declare i dont know who it is i dare say he has forgotten  ah yes people do get confused a little just about this time will you come and sit down  thank you i should like that but mrs cornbury when youre ready to go away i amquite ready  go away why i thought you intended to dance at least for the next two hours  in answer to this rachel declared that she was tired and mrs cornbury i want to avoid that man and she pointed out mr griggs by a glance of her eye i think hell say im engaged to him for the next waltz andi dont like him  poor man he doesnt look very nice certainly but if thats all ill get you out of the scrape without running away then mr griggs came up and with a very low bow struck out the point of his elbow towards rachel expecting her immediately to put her hand within it  im afraid sir you must excuse miss ray just at present shes too tired to dance immediately  mr griggs looked at his card then looked at rachel then looked at mrs cornbury and stood twiddling the bunch of little gilt playthings that hung from his chain that is too hard said he deuced hard  im very sorry said rachel  so shall i beuncommon really mrs cornbury i think a turn or two would do her good dont you  i cant say i do she says she would rather not and of course you wont press her  i dont see it in that lighti really dont a gentleman has his rights you know mrs cornbury miss ray wont deny  miss ray will deny that she intends to stand up for this dance and one of the rights of a gentleman is to take a lady at her word  really mrs cornbury you are down upon one so hard  rachel said she would you mind coming across the room with me there are seats on the sofa on the other side then mrs cornbury sailed across the floor and rachel crept after her more dismayed than ever mr griggs the while stood transfixed to his place stroking his mustaches with his hand and showing plainly by his countenance that he didnt know what he ought to do next well thats cool said he confounded cool  anything wrong griggs my boy said a bank clerk slapping him on the back  i call it very wrong very wrong indeed said griggs but people do give themselves such airs miss cherry may i have the honour of waltzing with you  certainly not said cherry who was passing by then mr griggs made his way back to the door  rachel felt that things were going wrong with her it had so happened that she had parted on bad terms with three gentlemen she had offended mr cornbury and mr griggs and had done her best to make mr rowan understand that he had offended her she conceived that all the room would know of it and that mrs cornbury would become ashamed of her that mrs tappitt was already very angry with her she was quite sure she wished she had not come to the ball and began to think that perhaps her sister might be right it almost seemed to herself that she had not known how to behave herself for a short time she had been happyvery happy but she feared that she had in some way committed herself during the moments of her happiness i hope you are not angry with me she said about mr griggs appealing to her friend in a plaintive voice  angryoh dear no why should i be angry with you i should be angry with that man only im a person that never gets angry with anybody you were quite right not to dance with him never be made to dance with any man you dont like and remember that a young lady should always have her own way in a ballroom she doesnt get much of it anywhere else does she my dear and now ill go whenever you like it but im not the least in a hurry youre the young lady and youre to have your own way if youre quite in earnest ill get some one to order the carriagerachel said that she was quite in earnest and then walter was called so youre going are you said he miss ray has illtreated me so dreadfully that i cant express my regret illtreated you too has she upon my word my dear youve shown yourself quite great upon the occasion when i was a girl there was nothing i liked so much as offending all my partners but rachel was red with dismay and wretched that such an accusation should be made against her oh mrs cornbury i didnt mean to offend him ill explain it all in the carriage what will you think of me think my dearwhy i shall think that you are going to turn all the young mens heads in baslehurst but i shall hear all about it from walter tomorrow he tells me of all his loves and all his disappointments  while the carriage was being brought round rachel kept close to her chaperon but every now and again her eyes in spite of herself would wander away to mr rowan was he in any way affected by her leaving him or was it all a joke to him he was dancing now with cherry tappitt and rachel was sure that all of it was a joke but it was a cruel jokecruel because it exposed her to so much illnatured remark with him she would quarrelquarrel really she would let him know that he should not call her by her christian name just when it suited him to do so and then take himself off to play with others in the same way she would tell cherry and make cherry understand that all walks and visiting and friendly intercommunications must be abandoned because this young man would take advantage of her position to annoy her he should be made to understand that she was not in his power then as she thought of this she caught his eye as he made a sudden stop in the dance close to her and all her hard thoughts died away ah dear what was it that she wanted of him  at that moment they got up to go away such a person as mrs butler cornbury could not of course escape without a parade of adieux mr tappitt was searched up from the little room in which the cardparty held their meeting in order that he might hand the guest that had honoured him down to her carriage and mrs tappitt fluttered about profuse in her acknowledgments for the favour done to them and we do so hope mr cornbury will be successful she said as she bade her last farewell this was spoken close to mr tappitts ear and mrs cornbury flattered herself that after that mr tappitts vote would be secure mr tappitt said nothing about his vote but handed the lady down stairs in solemn silence  the tappitt girls came and clustered about rachel as she was going i cant conceive why you are off so early said martha no indeed said mrs tappitt only of course it would be very wrong to keep mrs cornbury waiting when she has been so excessively kind to you the naughty girl it isnt that at all said cherry its she that is hurrying mrs cornbury away good night said augusta very coldly and rachel said cherry mind you come up tomorrow and talk it all over we shall have so much to say then rachel turned to go and found luke rowan at her elbow waiting to take her down she had no alternativeshe must take his arm and thus they walked down stairs into the hall together  youll come up here tomorrow said he  no no tell cherry that i shall not come  then i shall go to braggs end will your mother let me call  no dont come pray dont  i certainly shallcertainly certainly what things have you got let me put your shawl on for you if you do not come up to the girls i shall certainly go down to you now goodnight goodnight mrs cornbury and luke getting hold of rachels reluctant hand pressed it with all his warmth  i dont want to ask indiscreet questions said mrs cornbury but that young man seems rather smitten i think  oh no said rachel not knowing what to say  but i sayoh yes a nice goodlooking man he is too and a gentleman which is more than i can say for all of them there what an escape you had of mr griggs my dear  yes i had but i was so sorry that you should have to speak to him  of course i spoke to him i was there to fight your battles for you thats why married ladies go to balls you were quite right not to dance with him a girl should always avoid any intimacy with such men as that it is not that he would have done you any harm but they stand in the way of your satisfaction and contentment balls are given specially for young ladies and it is my theory that they are to make themselves happy while they are there and not sacrifice themselves to men whom they dont wish to know you cant always refuse when youre asked but you can always get out of an engagement afterwards if you know what youre about that was my way when i was a girl and this was the daughter of mr comfort whose somewhat melancholy discourses against the worlds pleasures and vanities had so often filled rachels bosom with awe  rachel sat silent thinking of what had occurred at mrs tappitts and thinking also that she ought to make some little speech to her friend thanking her for all that she had done ought she not also to apologise in some way for her own conduct what was that between you and my cousin walter mrs cornbury asked after a few moments  i hope i wasnt to blame said rachel but  but what of course you werent to blameunless it was in being run after by so many gentlemen at once  he was going to take me down to supperand it was so kind of him and then while we were waiting because the room downstairs was full there was another quadrille and i was engaged to mr rowan  ah yes i understand and so master walter got thrown once his wrath in such matters never lasts very long here we are at braggs end ive been so glad to have you with me and i hope i may take you again with me somewhere before long remember me kindly to your mother there she is at the door waiting for you then rachel jumped out of the carriage and ran across the little gravelpath into the house  mrs ray had been waiting up for her daughter and had been listening eagerly for the wheels of the carriage it was not yet two oclock and by ballgoing people the hour of rachels return would have been considered early but to mrs ray anything after midnight was very late she was not however angry or even vexed but simply pleased that her girl had at last come back to her oh mamma im afraid it has been very hard upon you waiting for me said rachel but i did come away as soon as i could mrs ray declared that she had not found it all hard and thenwith a laudable curiosity seeing how little she had known about ballsdesired to have an immediate account of rachels doings  and did you get anybody to dance with you asked the mother feeling a mothers ambition that her daughter should have been respectit like the lave  oh yes plenty of people asked me to dance  and did you find it come easy  quite easy i was frightened about the waltzing at first  do you mean that you waltzed rachel  yes mamma everybody did it mrs cornbury said she always waltzed when she was a girl and as the things turned out i could not help myself i began with her cousin i didnt mean to do it but i got so ashamed of myself that i couldnt refuse  mrs ray still was not angry but she was surprised and perhaps a little dismayed and did you like it  yes mamma  were they all kind to you  yes mamma  you seem to have very little to say about it but i suppose youre tired  i am tired but it isnt that it seems that there is so much to think about ill tell you everything tomorrow when i get quiet again not that there is much to tell  then ill wish you goodnight dear  goodnight mamma mrs cornbury was so kindyou can have no idea how goodnatured she is  she always was a good creature  if id been her sister she couldnt have done more for me i feel as though i were really quite fond of her but she isnt a bit like what i expected she chooses to have her own way but then she is so goodhumoured and when i got into any little trouble she  well what else did she do and what trouble had you  i cant quite describe what i mean she seemed to make so much of mejust as she might have done if id been some grand young lady down from london or any anyyou know what i mean  mrs ray sat with her candle in her hand receiving great comfort from the knowledge that her daughter had been respectit she knew well what rachel meant and reflected with perhaps a pardonable pride that she herself had come of decent people the tappitts were higher than her in the world and so were the griggses but she knew that her forbears had been gentlefolk when there were so to speak no griggses and no tappitts in existence it was pleasant to her to think that her daughter had been treated as a lady  and she did do me such a kindness that horrid mr griggs was going to dance with me and she wouldnt let him  i dont like that young man at all  poor cherry you should hear her talk of him and she would have stayed ever so much longer if i had not pressed her to go and then she has such a nice way of saying things  she always had that when she was quite a young girl  i declare i feel that i quite love her and there was such a grand supper champagne  no  i got some cold turkey mr rowan took me down to supper these last words were spoken very mildly and rachel as she uttered them did not dare to look into her mothers face  did you dance with him  yes mamma three times i should have stayed later only i was engaged to dance with him twice more and i didnt choose to do so  was he did he  oh mamma i cant tell you i dont know how to tell you i wish you knew it all without my saying anything he says he shall come here tomorrow if i dont go up to the brewery and i cant possibly go there now after that  did he say anything more than that rachel  he calls me rachel and speaksi cant tell you how he speaks if you think it wrong mamma i wont ever see him again  mrs ray didnt know whether she ought to think it wrong or not she was inclined to wish that it was right and to believe that it was wrong a few minutes ago rachel was unable to open her mouth and was anxious to escape to bed but now that the ice was broken between her and her mother they sat up for more than an hour talking about luke rowan  i wonder whether he will really come rachel said to herself as she laid her head upon her pillowand why does he want to come     chapter ix  mr prong at home   mrs tappitts ball was celebrated on a tuesday and on the preceding monday mrs prime moved herself off bag and baggage to miss puckers lodgings miss pucker had been elated with a dismal joy when the proposition was first made to her oh yes it was very dreadful she would do anythingof course she would give up the front bedroom upstairs to mrs prime and get a stretcher for herself in the little room behind which looked out on the tiles of griggs sugar warehouse she hadnt thought such a thing would have been possible she really had not a ball mrs prime couldnt help coming awayof course not and there would be plenty of room for all her boxes in the small room behind the shop mrs rays daughter go to a ball and then some threatening words were said as to the destiny of wicked people which shall not be repeated here  that flitting had been a very dismal affair an old man out of baslehurst had come for mrs primes things with a donkeycart and the old man assisted by the girl had carried them out together rachel had remained secluded in her mothers room the two sisters had met at the same table at breakfast but had not spoken over their tea and bread and butter as rachel was taking the cloth away mrs prime had asked her solemnly whether she still persisted in bringing perdition upon herself and her mother you have no right to ask me such a question rachel had answered and taking herself upstairs had secluded herself till the old man with the donkey followed by mrs prime had taken himself away from braggs end mrs ray as her eldest daughter was leaving her stood at the door of her house with her handkerchief to her eyes it makes me very unhappy dorothea so it does and it makes me very unhappy too mother perhaps my sorrow in the matter is deeper than yours but i must do my duty then the two widows kissed each other with a cold unloving kiss and mrs prime had taken her departure from braggs end cottage it will make a great difference in the housekeeping mrs ray said to rachel and then she went to work at her little accounts  it was dorcasday at miss puckers and as the work of the meeting began soon after mrs prime had unpacked her boxes in the front bedroom and had made her little domestic arrangements with her friend that first day passed by without much tedium mrs prime was used to miss pucker and was not therefore grievously troubled by the ways and habits of that lady much as they were unlike those to which she had been accustomed at braggs end but on the next morning as she was sitting with her companion after breakfast an idea did come into her head that miss pucker would not be a pleasant companion for life she would talk incessantly of the wickednesses of the cottage and ask repeated questions about rachel and the young man mrs prime was undoubtedly very angry with her mother and much shocked at her sister but she did not relish the outspoken sympathy of her confidential friend hell never marry her you know he dont think of such a thing said miss pucker over and over again mrs prime did not find this pleasant when spoken of her sister and the young men im told goes on anyhow as they pleases at them dances said miss pucker who in the warmth of her intimacy forgot some of those little restrictions in speech with which she had burdened herself when first striving to acquire the friendship of mrs prime before dinner was over mrs prime had made up her mind that she must soon move her staff again and establish herself somewhere in solitude  after tea she took herself out for a walk having managed to decline miss puckers attendance and as she walked she thought of mr prong would it not be well for her to go to him and ask his further advice he would tell her in what way she had better live he would tell her also whether it was impossible that she should ever return to the cottage for already her heart was becoming somewhat more soft than was its wont and as she walked she met mr prong himself intent on his pastoral business i was thinking of coming to you tomorrow she said after their first salutation was over  do said he do come earlybefore the toil of the days work commences i also am specially anxious to see you will nine be too earlyor if you have not concluded your morning meal by that time halfpast nine  mrs prime assured him that her morning meal was always concluded before nine oclock and promised to be with him by that hour then as she slowly paced up the high street to the cawston bridge and back again she wondered within herself as to the matter on which mr prong could specially want to see her he might probably desire to claim her services for some womans work in his sheepfold he should have them willingly for she had begun to feel that she would sooner cooperate with mr prong than with miss pucker as she returned down the high street and came near to her own door she saw the cause of all her family troubles standing at the entrance to griggss winestore he was talking to the shopman within and as she passed she frowned grimly beneath her widows bonnet send them to the brewery at once said luke rowan to the man they are wanted this evening  i understand said the man  and tell your fellow to take them round to the back door  all right said the man winking with one eye he understood very well that young rowan was ordering the champagne for mrs tappitts supper and that it was thought desirable that mr tappitt shouldnt see the bottles going into the house  miss pucker possessed at any rate the virtue of being early so that mrs prime had no difficulty in concluding her morning meal and being at mr prongs house punctually at nine oclock mr prong it seemed had not been quite so steadfast to his purpose for his teapot was still upon the table together with the debris of a large dish of shrimps the eating of small shellfish being an innocent enjoyment to which he was much addicted  dear me so it is just nine well have these things away in a minute mrs mudge mrs mudge whereupon mrs mudge came forth and between the three the table was soon cleared i wish you hadnt caught me so late said mr prong it looks as though i hadnt been thinking of you then he picked up the stray shell of a shrimp and in order that he might get rid of it put it into his mouth mrs prime said she hoped she didnt trouble him and that of course she didnt expect him to be thinking about her particularly then mr prong looked at her in a way that was very particular out of the corner of his eyes and assured her that he had been thinking of her all night after that mrs prime sat down on a horsehairseated chair and mr prong sat on another opposite to her leaning back with his eyes nearly closed and his hands folded upon his lap  i dont think miss puckers will quite do for me said mrs prime beginning her story first  i never thought it would my friend said mr prong with his eyes still nearly closed  shes a very good womanan excellent woman and her heart is full of love and charity but  i quite understand it my friend she is not in all things the companion you desire  i am not quite sure that i shall want any companion  ah sighed mr prong shaking his head but still keeping his eyes closed  i think i would rather be alone if i do not return to them at the cottage i would fain return if only they  if only they would return too yes that would be a glorious end to the struggle you have made if you can bring them back with you from following after the evil one but you cannot return to them now if you are to countenance by your presence dancings and lovemakings in the open airwhy worse in the open air than in a close little parlour in a back street mr prong did not sayand loud revellings and the absence of all good works and rebellion against the spirit mr prong was becoming energetic in his language and at one time had raised himself in his chair and opened his eyes but he closed them at once and again fell back no my friend said he no it must not be so they must be rescued from the burning but not sonot so after that for a minute or two they both sat still in silence  i think i shall get two small rooms for myself in one of the quiet streets near the new church said she  ah yes perhaps sofor a time  till i may be able to go back to mother its a sad thing families being divided mr prong  yes it is sadunless it tends to the doing of the lords work  but i hopei do hope that all this may be changed rachel i know is obstinate but mother means well mr prong she means to do her duty if only she had good teaching near her  i hope she may i hope she may i trust that they may both be brought to see the true light we will wrestle for themyou and me we will wrestle for themtogether mrs prime my friend if you are prepared to hear me with attention i have a proposition to make which i think you will acknowledge to be one of importance then suddenly he sat bolt upright opened his eyes wide and dressed his mouth with all the solemn dignity of which he was the master are you prepared to listen to me mrs prime  mrs prime who was somewhat astonished said in a low voice that she was prepared to listen  because i must beg you to hear me out i shall fail altogether in reaching your intelligencewhatever effect i might possibly have upon your heartunless you will hear me to the end  i will hear you certainly mr prong  yes my friend for it will be necessary if i could convey to your mind all that is now passing through my own without any spoken word how glad should i be the words of men when taken at the best how weak they are they often tell a tale quite different from that which the creature means who uses them every minister has felt that in addressing his flock from the pulpit i feel it myself sadly but i never felt it so sadly as i do now  mrs prime did not quite understand him but she assured him again that she would give his words her best attention and that she would endeavour to gather from them no other meaning than that which seemed to be his ahseemed said he there is so much of seeming in this deceitful world but you will believe this of me that whatever i do i do as tending to the strengthening of my hands in the ministry mrs prime said that she would believe so much and then as she looked into her companions face she became aware that there was something of weakness displayed in that assuming mouth she did not argue about it within her own mind but the fact had in some way become revealed to her  my friend said heand as he spoke he drew his chair across the rug so as to bring it very near to that on which mrs prime was sittingour destinies in this world yours and mine are in many things alike we are both alone we both of us have our hands full of work and of work which in many respects is the same we are devoted to the same cause is it not so mrs prime who had been told that she was to listen and not to speak did not at first make any answer but she was pressed by a repetition of the question is it not so mrs prime  i can never make my work equal to that of a minister of the gospel said she  but you can share the work of such a minister you understand me now and let me assure you of this that in making this proposition to you i am not selfseeking it is not my own worldly comfort and happiness to which i am chiefly looking  ah said mrs prime i suppose not perhaps there was in her voice the slightest touch of soreness  nonot chiefly to that i want assistance confidential intercourse sympathy a congenial mind support when i am like to faint counsel when i am pressing on aid when the toil is too heavy for me a kind word when the days work is over and youdo you not desire the same are we not alike in that and would it not be well that we should come together mr prong as he spoke had put out his hand and rested it on the table with the palm upwards as though expecting that she would put hers within it and he had tilted his chair so as to bring his body closer to hers and had dropped from his face his assumed look of dignity he was quite in earnest and being so had fallen away into his natural dispositions of body  i do not quite understand you said mrs prime she did however understand him perfectly but thought it expedient that he should be required to speak a little further before she answered him she wanted time also to arrange her reply as yet she had not made up her mind whether she would say yes or no  mrs prime i am offering to make you my wife i have said nothing of love of that human affection which one of gods creatures entertains for anothernot i can assure you because i do not feel it but because i think that you and i should be governed in our conduct by a sense of duty rather than by the poor creaturelongings of the heart  the heart is very deceitful said mrs prime  that is truevery true but my heart in this matter is not deceitful i entertain for you all that deep love which a man should feel for her who is to be the wife of his bosom  but mr prong  let me finish before you give me your answer i have thought much of this as you may believe and by only one consideration have i been made to doubt the propriety of taking this step people will say that i am marrying you forfor your money in short it is an insinuation which would give me much pain but i have resolved within my own mind that it is my duty to bear it if my motives are purehere he paused a moment for a word or two of encouragement but received noneand if the thing itself be good i ought not to be deterred by any fear of what the wicked may say do you not agree with me in that  mrs prime still did not answer she felt that any word of assent though given by her to a minor proposition might be taken as involving some amount of assent towards the major proposition mr prong had enjoyed the advantage of thinking over his matrimonial prospects in undisturbed solitude but she had as yet possessed no such advantage as the idea had never before presented itself to her she did not feel inclined to commit herself hastily  and as regards money he continued  well said mrs prime looking down demurely upon the ground for mr prong had not at once gone on to say what were his ideas about money  and as regards moneyneed i hardly declare that my motives are pure and disinterested i am aware that in worldly affairs you are at present better off than i am my professional income from the pewrents is about a hundred and thirty pounds a yearit must be admitted that it was very hard work by this time mr prong had withdrawn his hand from the table finding that attempt to be hopeless and had resettled his chair upon its four feet he had commenced by requesting mrs prime to hear him patiently but he had probably not calculated that she would have listened with a patience so cruel and unrelenting she did not even speak a word when he communicated to her the amount of his income that is what i receive here he continued and you are probably aware that i have no private means of my own  i didnt know said mrs prime  no none but what then  oh dear no  money is but dross who feels that more strongly than you do  mr prong in all that he was saying intended to be honest and in asserting that money was dross he believed that he spoke his true mind he thought also that he was passing a just eulogium on mrs prime in declaring that she was of the same opinion but he was not quite correct in this either as regarded himself or as regarded her he did not covet money but he valued it very highly and as for mrs prime she had an almost unbounded satisfaction in her own independence she had after all but two hundred a year out of which she gave very much in charity but this giving in charity was her luxury fine raiment and dainty food tempted her not at all but nevertheless she was not free from temptations and did not perhaps always resist them to be mistress of her money and to superintend the gifts not only of herself but of others to be great among the poor and esteemed as a personage in her districtthat was her ambition when mr prong told her that money in her sight was dross she merely shook her head why was it that she wrote those terribly caustic notes to the agent in exeter if her quarterly payments were ever late by a single week defend me from a lone widow the agent used to say and especially if shes evangelical mrs prime delighted in the sight of the bit of paper which conveyed to her the possession of her periodical wealth to her money certainly was not dross and i doubt if it was truly so regarded by mr prong himself  any arrangements that you choose as to settlements or the like of that could of course be made mr prong when he began or rather when he made up his mind to begin had determined that he would use all his best power of language in pressing his suit but the work had been so hard that his fine language had got itself lost in the struggle i doubt whether this made much difference with mrs prime or it may be that he had sustained the propriety of his words as long as such propriety was needful and salutary to his purpose had he spoken of the like of that at the opening of the negotiation he might have shocked his hearer but now she was too deeply engaged in solid serious considerations to care much for the words which were used a hundred and thirty from pewrents she said to herself as he endeavoured unsuccessfully to look under her bonnet into her face  i think i have said it all now he continued if you will trust yourself into my keeping i will endeavour with gods assistance to do my duty by you i have said but little personally of myself or of my feelings hoping that it might be unnecessary  oh quite so said she  i have spoken rather of those duties which we should undertake together in sweet companionship if you will consent tototo be mrs prong in short then he waited for an answer  as she sat in her widows weeds there was not to the eye the promise in her of much sweet companionship her old crape bonnet had been lugged and battered aboutnot out of all shape as hats and bonnets are sometimes battered by young ladies in which guise if the young ladies themselves be pretty the battered hats and bonnets are often more becoming than ever they were in their proper shapesbut so as closely to fit her head and almost hide her face her dress was so made and so put on as to give to her the appearance of almost greater age than her mothers she had studied to divest herself of all outward show of sweet companionship but perhaps she was not the less on that account gratified to find that she had not altogether succeeded  i have done with the world and all the worlds vanities and cares she said shaking her head  no one can have done with the world as long as there is work in it for him or her to do the monks and nuns tried that and you know what they came to  but i am a widow  yes my friend and have shown yourself as such very willing to do your part but do you not know that you could be more active and more useful as a clergymans wife than you can be as a solitary woman  but my heart is buried mr prong  no not so while the body remains in this vale of tears the heart must remain with it mrs prime shook her head but in an anatomical point of view mr prong was no doubt strictly correct other hopes will ariseand perhaps too other cares but they will be sources of gentle happiness  mrs prime understood him as alluding to a small family and again shook her head at the allusion  what i have said may probably have taken you by surprise  yes it has mr prongvery much  and if so it may be that you would wish time for consideration before you give me an answer  perhaps that will be best mr prong  let it be so on what day shall we say will friday suit you if i come to you on friday morning perhaps miss pucker will be there  yes she will  and in the afternoon  we shall be at the dorcas meeting  i dont like to trouble you to come here again  mrs prime herself felt that there was a difficulty hitherto she had entertained no objection to calling on mr prong at his own house his little sittingroom had been as holy ground to heralmost as part of the church and she had taken herself there without scruple but things had now been put on a different footing it might be that that room would become her own peculiar property but she could never again regard it in a simply clerical light it had become as it were a bower of love and she could not take her steps thither with the express object of assenting to the proposition made to heror even with that of dissenting from it perhaps said she you could call at ten on saturday miss pucker will be out marketing to this mr prong agreed and then mrs prime got up and took her leave how fearfully wicked would rachel have been in her eyes had rachel made an appointment with a young man at some hour and some place in which she might be found alone but then it is so easy to trust oneself and so easy also to distrust others  goodmorning said mrs prime and as she went she gave her hand as a matter of course to her lover  goodbye said he and think well of this if you can do so if you believe that you will be more useful as my wife than you can be in your present positionthen  you think it would be my duty to  well i will leave that for you to decide i merely wish to put the matter before you but pray understand this money need be no hindrance then having said that last word he let her go  she walked away very slowly and did not return by the most direct road to miss puckers rooms there was much to be considered in the offer that had been made to her her lot in life would be very lonely if this separation from her mother and sister should become permanent she had already made up her mind that a continued residence with miss pucker would not suit her and although on that very morning she had felt that there would be much comfort in living by herself now as she looked forward to that loneliness it had for her very little attraction might it not be true also that she could do more good as a clergymans wife than could possibly come within her reach as a single woman she had tried that life once already but then she had been very young as that memory came upon her she looked back to her early life and thought of the hopes which had been hers as she stood at the altar now so many years ago how different had been everything with her then she remembered the sort of love she had felt in her heart and told herself that there could be no repetition of such love on mr prongs behalf she had come round in her walk to that very churchyard stile at which she had seen rachel standing with luke rowan and as she remembered some passages in her own girlish days she almost felt inclined to forgive her sister but then on a sudden she drew herself up almost with a gasp and went on quickly with her walk had she not herself in those days walked in darkness and had it not since that been vouchsafed to her to see the light in her few months of married happiness it had been given to her to do but little of that work which might now be possible to her then she had been married in the flesh now she would be married in the spiritshe would be married in the spirit if it should on final consideration seem good to her to accept mr prongs offer in that light then unconsciously she began to reflect on the rights of a married woman with regard to moneyand also on the wrongs she was not sure as to the law and asked herself whether it would be possible for her to consult an attorney finally she thought it would not be practicable to do so before giving her answer to mr prong  and she could not even ask her mother as to that too she questioned herself and resolved that she could not so far lower herself under existing circumstances there was no one to whom she could go for advice but we may say this of herlet her have asked whom she would she would have at least been guided by her own judgment if only she could have obtained some slight amount of legal information how useful it would have been     chapter x  luke rowan declares his plans as to the brewery   the truth is t there was some joking among the young people about the wine and then rowan went and ordered it this was mrs tappitts explanation about the champagne made to her husband on the night of the ball before she was allowed to go to sleep but this by no means satisfied him he did not choose as he declared that any young man should order whatever he might think necessary for his house then mrs tappitt made it worse to tell the truth t i think it was intended as a present to the girls we are doing a great deal to make him comfortable you know and i fancy he thought it right to make them this little return she should have known her husband better it was true that he grudged the cost of the wine but he would have preferred to endure that to the feeling that his table had been supplied by another manby a young man whom he wished to regard as subject to himself but who would not be subject and at whom he was beginning to look with very unfavourable eyes a present to the girls i tell you i wont have such presents and if it was so i think he has been very impertinentvery impertinent indeed i shall tell him soand i shall insist on paying for the wine and i must say you ought not to have taken it  oh dear t i have been working so hard all night and i do think you ought to let me go to sleep now instead of scolding me  on the following morning the party was of course discussed in the tappitt family under various circumstances at the breakfasttable mrs rowan with her son and daughter were present and then a song of triumph was sung everything had gone off with honour and glory and the brewery had been immortalized for years to come mrs butler cornburys praises were spokenwith some little drawback of a sneer on them because she had made such a fuss with that girl rachel ray and then the girls had told of their partners and luke had declared it all to have been superb but when the rowans backs were turned and the tappitts were alone together others besides old tappitt himself had words to say in dispraise of luke mrs tappitt had been much inclined to make little of her husbands objections to the young man while she hoped that he might possibly become her soninlaw he might have been a thorn in the brewery among the vats but he would have been a flourishing young baytree in the outer world of baslehurst she had however no wish to encourage the growth of a thorn within her own premises in order that rachel ray or such as she might have the advantage of the baytree luke rowan had behaved very badly at her party not only had he failed to distinguish either of her own girls but he had as mrs tappitt said made himself so conspicuous with that foolish girl that all the world had been remarking it  mrs butler cornbury seemed to think it all right said cherry  mrs butler cornbury is not everybody said mrs tappitt i didnt think it right i can assure youand whats more your papa didnt think it right  and he was going on all the evening as though he were quite master in the house said augusta he was ordering the musicians to do this and that all the evening  hell find that hes not master your papa is going to speak to him this very day  whatabout rachel asked cherry in dismay  about things in general said mrs tappitt then mary rowan returned to the room and they all went back upon the glories of the ball i think it was nice said mrs tappitt simpering im sure there was no trouble sparednor yet expense she knew that she ought not to have uttered that last word and she would have refrained if it had been possible to herbut it was not possible the man who tells you how much his wine costs a dozen knows that he is wrong while the words are in his mouth but they are in his mouth and he cannot restrain them  mr tappitt was not about to lecture luke rowan as to his conduct in regard to rachel ray he found some difficulty in speaking to his wouldbe partner even on matters of business in a proper tone and with becoming authority as he was so much the senior and rowan so much the junior some such tone of superiority was as he thought indispensable but he had great difficulty in assuming it rowan had a way with him that was not exactly a way of submission and tappitt would certainly not have dared to encounter him on any such matter as his behaviour in a drawingroom when the time came he had not even the courage to allude to those champagne bottles and it may be as well explained that rowan paid the little bill at griggss without further reference to the matter but the question of the brewery management was a matter vital to tappitt there among the vats he had reigned supreme since bungall ceased to be king and for continual mastery there it was worth his while to make a fight that he was under difficulties even in that fight he had already begun to know he could not talk luke rowan down and make him go about his work in an orderly everyday businesslike fashion luke rowan would not be talked down nor would he be orderlynot according to mr tappitts orders no doubt mr tappitt under these circumstances could decline the partnership and this he was disposed to do but he had been consulting lawyers consulting papers and looking into old accounts and he had reason to fear that under bungalls will luke rowan would have the power of exacting from him much more than he was inclined to give  youd better take him into the concern the lawyer had said a young head is always useful  not when the young head wants to be master tappitt had answered if im to do that the whole thing will go to the dogs he did not exactly explain to the lawyer that rowan had carried his infatuation so far as to be desirous of brewing good beer but he did make it very clear that such a partner would in his eyes be anything but desirable  then upon my word i think youll have to give him the ten thousand pounds i dont even know but what the demand is moderate  this was very bad news to tappitt but suppose i havent got ten thousand pounds now it was very well known that the property and the business were worth money and the lawyer suggested that rowan might take steps to have the whole concern sold probably he might buy it himself and undertake to pay you so much a year suggested the lawyer but this view of the matter was not at all in accordance with mr tappitts ideas he had been brewer in baslehurst for nearly thirty years and still wished to remain so mrs tappitt had been of opinion that all difficulties might be overcome if only luke would fall in love with one of her girls mrs rowan had been invited to baslehurst specially with a view to some such arrangement but luke rowan as it seemed to them both now was an obstinate young man who in matters of beer as well as in matters of love would not be guided by those who best knew how to guide him mrs tappitt had watched him closely at the ball and had now given him up altogether he had danced only once with augusta and then had left her the moment the dance was over i should offer him a hundred and fifty pounds a year out of the concern and if he didnt like that let him lump it said mrs tappitt lump it said mr tappitt that means going to a london lawyer he felt the difficulties of his position as he prepared to speak his mind to young rowan on the morning after the party but on that occasion his strongest feeling was in favour of expelling the intruder any lot in life would be preferable to working in the brewery with such a partner as luke rowan  i suppose your heads hardly cool enough for business he said as luke came in and took a stool in his office tappitt was sitting in his customary chair with his arm resting on a large oldfashioned leathercovered table which was strewed with his papers and which had never been reduced to cleanliness or order within the memory of any one connected with the establishment he had turned his chair round from its accustomed place so as to face rowan who had perched himself on a stool which was commonly occupied by a boy whom tappitt employed in his own office  my head not cool said rowan its as cool as a cucumber i wasnt drinking last night  i thought you might be tired with the dancing then tappitts mind flew off to the champagne and he determined that the young man before him was too disagreeable to be endured  oh dear no those things never tire me i was across here with the men before eight this morning do you know im sure we could save a third of the fuel by altering the flues i never saw such contrivances they must have been put in by the coalmerchants for the sake of wasting coal  if you please we wont mind the flues at present  i only tell you its for your sake much more than my own if you wont believe me do you ask newman to look at them the first time you see him in baslehurst  i dont care a straw for newman  hes got the best concerns in devonshire and knows what hes about better than any man in these parts  i dare say but now if you please we wont mind him the concerns as i have managed them have done very well for me for the last thirty yearsvery well i may say also for your uncle who understood what he was doing im not very keen for so many changes they cost a great deal of money and as far as i can see dont often lead to much profit  if we dont go on with the world said rowan the world will leave us behind look at the new machinery theyre introducing everywhere people dont do it because they like to spend their money its competition and theres competition in beer as well as in other things  for a minute or two mr tappitt sat in silence collecting his thoughts and then he began his speech ill tell you what it is rowan i dont like these newfangled ways theyre very well for you i dare say you are young and perhaps you may see your way im old and i dont see mine among all these changes its clear to me that you and i could not go on together as partners in the same concern i should expect to have my own wayfirst because ive a deal of experience and next because my share in the concern would be so much the greatest  stop a moment mr tappitt im not quite sure that it would be much the greatest i dont want to say anything about that now only if i were to let your remark pass without notice it would seem that i had assented  ah very well i can only say that i hope youll find yourself mistaken ive been over thirty years in the concern and it would be odd if i with my large family were to find myself only equal to you who have never been in the business at all and aint even married yet  i dont see what being married has to do with it  dont you youll find thats the way we look at these things down in these parts youre not in london here mr rowan  certainly not but i suppose the laws are the same this is an affair of capital  capital said mr tappitt i dont know that youve brought in any capital  bungall did and im here as his representative but youd better let that pass by just at present if we can agree as to the management of the business you wont find me a hard man to deal with as to our relative shares hereupon tappitt scratched his head and tried to think but i dont see how we are to agree about the management he continued you wont be led by anybody  i dont know about that i certainly want to improve the concern  ah yes and so ruin it whereas ive been making money out of it these thirty years you and i wont do together thats the long of it and the short of it  it would be a putting of new wine into old bottles you think suggested rowan  im not saying anything about wine but i do think that i ought to know something about beer  and im to understand said rowan that you have definitively determined not to carry on the old concern in conjunction with me as your partner  yes i think i have  but it will be as well to be sure one cant allow ones self to depend upon thinking  well i am sure ive made up my mind ive no doubt youre a very clever young man but i am quite sure we should not do together and to tell you the truth rowan i dont think youll ever make your fortune by brewing  you think not  no never  im sorry for that  i dont know that you need be sorry youll have a nice income for a single man to begin the world with and theres other businesses besides brewingand a deal better  ah but ive made up my mind to be a brewer i like it theres opportunity for chemical experiments and room for philosophical inquiry which gives the trade a charm in my eyes i dare say it seems odd to you but i like being a brewer  tappitt only scratched his head and stared at him i do indeed continued rowan now a man cant do anything to improve his own trade as a lawyer a great deal will be done but ive made up my mind that all that must come from the outside all trades want improving but i like a trade in which i can do the improvements myselffrom the inside do you understand me mr tappitt mr tappitt did not understand himwas very far indeed from understanding him  with such ideas as those i dont think baslehurst is the ground for you said mr tappitt  the very ground said rowan thats just itits the very place i want brewing as i take it is at a lower ebb here than in any other part of englandthis at any rate was not complimentary to the brewer of thirty years standingthan in any other part of england the people swill themselves with the nasty juice of the apple because sound malt and hops have never been brought within their reach i think devonshire is the very county for a man who means to work hard and who wishes to do good and in all devonshire i dont think theres a more fitting town than baslehurst  mr tappitt was dumbfounded did this young man mean him to understand that it was his intention to open a rival establishment under his nose to set up with bungalls money another brewery in opposition to bungalls brewery could such ingratitude as that be in the mind of any one oh said tappitt i dont quite understand but i dont doubt but what you say is all very fine  i dont think that its fine at all mr tappitt but i believe that its true i represent mr bungalls interest here in baslehurst and i intend to carry on mr bungalls business in the town in which he established it  this is mr bungalls businessthis here where im sitting and it is in my hands  the use of these premises depends on you certainly  yes and the name of the firm and thethethe in point of fact this is the old establishment i never heard of such a thing in all my life  quite true it is the old establishment and if i should set up another brewery here as i think it probable i may i shall not make use of bungalls name in the first place it would hardly be fair and in the next place by all accounts he brewed such very bad beer that it would not be a credit to me if youll tell me what your plan is then ill tell you mine youll find that everything shall be aboveboard mr tappitt  my plan ive got no plan i mean to go on here as ive always done  but i suppose you intend to come to some arrangement with me my claims are these i will either come into this establishment on an equal footing with yourself as regards share and management or else i shall look to you to give me the sum of money to which my lawyers tell me i am entitled in fact you must either take me in or buy me out  i was thinking of a settled income  no it wouldnt suit me i have told you what are my intentions and to carry them out i must either have a concern of my own or a share in a concern a settled income would do me no good  two hundred ayear suggested tappitt  psha three per cent would give me three hundred  ten thousand pounds is out of the question you know  very well mr tappitt i cant say anything fairer than i have done it will suit my own views much the best to start alone but i do not wish to oppose you if i can help it start alone i certainly will if i cannot come in here on my own terms  after that there was nothing more said tappitt turned round pretending to read his letters and rowan descending from his seat walked out into the yard of the brewery his intention had been ever since he had looked around him in baslehurst to be master of that place or if not of that to be master of some other it would break my heart to be sending out such stuff as that all my life he said to himself as he watched the muddy stream run out of the shallow coolers he had resolved that he would brew good beer as to that ambition of putting down the consumption of cider i myself am inclined to think that the habits of the country would be too strong for him at the present moment he lighted a cigar and sauntered about the yard he had now for the first time spoken openly of his purpose to mr tappitt but having done so he resolved that there should be no more delay ill give him till saturday for an answer he said if he isnt ready with one by that time ill manage it through the lawyers after that he turned his mind to rachel ray and the events of the past evening he had told rachel that he would go out to braggs end if she did not come into town and he was quite resolved that he would do so he knew well that she would not come in understanding exactly those feelings of hers which would prevent it therefore his walk to braggs end on that afternoon was a settled thing with him they were to dine at the brewery at three and he would go almost immediately after dinner but what would he say to her when he got there and what would he say to her mother he had not even yet made up his mind that he would positively ask her on that day to be his wife and yet he felt that if he found her at home he would undoubtedly do so ill arrange it all said he as im walking over then he threw away the end of his cigar and wandered about for the next halfhour among the vats and tubs and furnaces  mr tappitt took himself into the house as soon as he found himself able to do so without being seen by young rowan he took himself into the house in order that he might consult with his wife as to this unexpected revelation that had been made to him or rather that he might have an opportunity of saying to some one all the hard things which were now crowding themselves upon his mind with reference to this outrageous young man had anything ever been known or heard or told equal in enormity to this wickedness he was to be called upon to find capital for the establishment of a rival in his own town or else he was to bind himself in a partnership with a youth who knew nothing of his business but was nevertheless resolved to constitute himself the chief manager of it he who had been so true to bungall in his young days was now to be sacrificed in his old age to bungalls audacious representative in the first glow of his anger he declared to his wife that he would pay no money and admit of no partnership if rowan did not choose to take his income as old mrs bungall had taken hers he might seek what redress the law would give him it was in vain that mrs tappitt suggested that they would all be ruined then we will be ruined said tappitt hot with indignation but all baslehurstall devonshire shall know why pernicious young man he could not explainhe could not even quite understand in what the atrocity of rowans proposed scheme consisted but he was possessed by a full conviction that it was atrocious he had admitted this man into his house he was even now entertaining as his guests the mans mother and sister he had allowed him to have the run of the brewery so that he had seen both the nakedness and the fat of the land and this was to be his reward if i were to tell it at the readingroom said tappitt he would never be able to show himself again in the high street  mrs tappitt who was anxious but not enraged did not see the matter quite in the same light but she was not able to oppose her husband in his indignation when she suggested that it might be well for them to raise money and pay off their enemys claim merely stipulating that a rival brewery should not be established in baslehurst he swore an oath that he would raise no money for such a purpose he would have no dealings with so foul a traitor except through his lawyer honyman but honyman thinks youd better settle with him pleaded mrs t then ill go to another lawyer said tappitt if honyman wont stand to me ill go to sharpit and longfite they wont give way as long as theres a leg to stand on for the time mrs tappitt let this pass she knew how useless it would be to tell her husband at the present moment that sharpit and longfite would be the only winners in such a contest as that of which he spoke at the present moment mr tappitt felt a pride in his anger and was almost happy in the fury of his wrath but mrs tappitt was very wretched if that nasty girl rachel ray had not come in the way all might have been well  he shant eat another meal in this house said tappitt i dont care he went on when his wife pleaded that luke rowan must be admitted to their table because of mrs rowan and mary you can say what you like to them theyre welcome to stay if they like it or welcome to go but he shant put his feet under my mahogany again on this point however he was brought to relent before the hour of dinner baslehurst his wife told him would be against him if he turned his guests away from his house hungry if a fight was necessary for them it would be everything to them that baslehurst should be with them in the fight it was therefore arranged that mrs tappitt should have a conversation with mrs rowan after dinner while the young people were out in the evening he shant sleep in this house tomorrow said tappitt riveting his assertion with very strong language and mrs tappitt understood that her communications were to be carried on upon that basis  at three oclock the tappitts and rowans all sat down to dinner mr tappitt ate his meal in absolute silence but the young people were full of the ball and the elder ladies were very gracious to each other at such entertainments paterfamilias is simply required to find the provender and to carve it if he does that satisfactorily silence on his part is not regarded as a great evil mrs tappitt knew that her husbands mood was not happy and martha may have remarked that all was not right with her father to the others i am inclined to think his ill humour was a matter of indifference     chapter xi  luke rowan takes his tea quite like a steady young man   it was the custom of the miss tappitts during these long midsummer days to start upon their evening walk at about seven oclock the hour for the family gathering round the teatable being fixed at six but in accordance with the same custom dinner at the brewery was usually eaten at one at this immediate time with which we are now dealing dinner had been postponed till three out of compliment to mrs rowan mrs tappitt considering three oclock more fashionable than one and consequently the afternoon habits of the family were disarranged halfpast seven it was thought would be a becoming hour for tea and therefore the young ladies were driven to go out at five oclock while the sun was still hot in the heavens  no said luke in answer to his sisters invitation i dont think i will mind walking today you are all going so early he was sitting at the moment after dinner with his glass of brewery port wine before him  the young ladies must be very unhappy that their hours cant be made to suit you said mrs tappitt and the tone of her voice was sarcastic and acid  i think we can do without him said cherry laughing  of course we can said augusta who was not laughing  but you might as well come all the same said mary  theres metal more attractive somewhere else said augusta  i cannot bear to see so much fuss made with the young men said mrs tappitt we never did it when i was young did we mrs rowan  i dont think theres much change said mrs rowan we used to be very glad to get the young men when we could and to do without them when we couldnt  and thats just the way with us said cherry  speak for yourself said augusta  during all this time mr tappitt spoke never a word he also sipped his glass of wine and as he sipped it he brooded over his wrath who were these rowans that they should have come about his house and premises and forced everything out of its proper shape and position the young man sat there as though he were lord of everythingso tappitt declared to himself and his own wife was snubbed in her own parlour as soon as she opened her mouth there was an uncomfortable atmosphere of discord in the room which gradually pervaded them all and made even the girls feel that things were going wrong  mrs tappitt rose from her chair and made a stiff bow across the table to her guest understanding that that was the proper way in which to effect a retreat into the drawingroom whereupon luke opened the door and the ladies went thank you sir said mrs tappitt very solemnly as she passed by him mrs rowan going first had given him a loving little nod of recognition and mary had pinched his arm martha uttered a word of thanks intended for conciliation augusta passed him in silence with her nose in the air and cherry as she went by turned upon him a look of dismay he returned cherrys look with a shake of his head and both of them understood that things were going wrong  i dont think ill take any more wine sir said rowan  do as you like said tappitt its there if you choose to take it  it seems to me mr tappitt that you want to quarrel with me said luke  you can form your own opinion about that im not bound to tell my mind to everybody  oh no certainly not but its very unpleasant going on in that way in the same house im thinking particularly of mrs tappitt and the girls  you neednt trouble yourself about them at all you may leave me to take care of them  luke had not sat down since the ladies left the room and now determined that he had better not do so i think ill say good afternoon said rowan  good day to you said tappitt with his face turned away and his eyes fixed upon one of the open windows  well mr tappitt if i have to say goodbye to you in that way in your own house of course it must be for the last time i have not meant to offend you and i dont think ive given you ground for offence  you dont dont you  certainly not if unfortunately there must be any disagreement between us about matters of business i dont see why that should be brought into private life  look here young man said tappitt turning upon him you lectured me in my countinghouse this morning and i dont intend that you shall lecture me here also im drinking my own wine in my own parlour and choose to drink it in peace and quietness  very well sir i will not disturb you much longer perhaps you will make my apologies to mrs tappitt and tell her how much obliged i am by her hospitality but that i will not trespass upon it any longer ill get a bed at the dragon and ill write a line to my mother or sister then luke left the room took his hat up from the hall and made his way out of the house  he had much to occupy his mind at the present moment he felt that he was being turned out of mr tappitts house but would not much have regarded that if no one was concerned in it but mr tappitt himself he had however been on very intimate terms with all the ladies of the family even for mrs tappitt he had felt a friendship and for the girlsespecially for cherryhe had learned to entertain an easy brotherly affection which had not weighed much with him as it grew but which it was not in his nature to throw off without annoyance he had acknowledged to himself as soon as he found himself among them that the tappitts did not possess in their ways and habits of life quite all that he should desire in his dearest and most intimate friends i do not know that he had thought much of this but he had felt it nevertheless he had determined that he would like them he intended to make his way in life as a tradesman and boldly resolved that he would not be above his trade his mother sometimes reminded him with perhaps not the truest pride that he was a gentleman in answer to this he had once or twice begged her to define the word and then there had been some slight very slight disagreement between them in the end the mother always gave way to the son as to whom she believed that the sun shone with more special brilliancy for him than for any other of gods creatures now as he left the brewery house he remembered how intimate he had been with them all but a few hours since arranging matters for their ball and giving orders about the place as though he had belonged to the family he had allowed himself to be at home with them and to be one of them he was by nature impulsive and had thus fallen instantly into the intimacy which had been permitted to him now he was turned out of the house and as he walked across the churchyard to bespeak a bed for himself at the inn and write the necessary note to his sister he was melancholy and almost unhappy he felt sure that he was right in his views regarding the business and could not accuse himself of any fault in his manner of making them known to mr tappitt but nevertheless he was ill at ease with himself in that he had given offence and with all these thoughts were mingled other thoughts as to rachel ray he did not in the least imagine that any of the anger felt towards him at the brewery had been caused by his open admiration of rachel it had never occurred to him that mrs tappitt had regarded him as a possible soninlaw or that having so regarded him she could hold him in displeasure because he had failed to fall into her views he had never regarded himself as being of value as a possible future husband or entertained the idea that he was a prize he had taken hold in good faith of the tappitt right hand which had been stretched out to him and was now grieved that that hand should be suddenly withdrawn  but as he was impulsive so also was he lighthearted and when he had chosen his bedroom and written the note to mary in which he desired her to pack up his belongings and send them to him he was almost at ease as regarded that matter old tappitt was as he said to himself an old ass and if he chose to make that brewery business a cause of quarrel no one could help it mary was bidden in the note to say very civil things to mrs tappitt but at the same time to speak out the truth boldly tell her said he that i am constrained to leave the house because mr tappitt and i cannot agree at the present moment about matters of business when this was done he looked at his watch and started off on his walk to braggs end  it has been said that rowan had not made up his mind to ask rachel to be his wifethat he had not made up his mind on this matter although he was going to braggs end in a mood which would very probably bring him to such a conclusion it will i fear be thought from this that he was light in purpose as well as light in heart but i am not sure that he was open to any special animadversion of that nature it is the way of men to carry on such affairs without any complete arrangement of their own plans or even wishes he knew that he admired rachel and liked her i doubt whether he had ever yet declared to himself that he loved her i doubt whether he had done so when he started on that walkthinking it probable however that he had persuaded himself of the fact before he reached the cottage door he had already as we know said words to rachel which he should not have said unless he intended to seek her as his wifehe had spoken words and done things of that nature being by no means perfect in all his ways but he had so spoken and so acted without premeditation and now was about to follow up those little words and little acts to their natural consequencealso without much premeditation  rachel had told her mother on her return from the ball that luke rowan had promised to call and had offered to take herself off from the cottage for the whole afternoon if her mother thought it wrong that she should see him mrs ray had never felt herself to be in greater difficulty  i dont know that you ought to run away from him said she and besides where are you to go to  rachel said at once that if her absence were desirable she would find whither to betake herself id stay upstairs in my bedroom for the matter of that mamma  hed be sure to know it said mrs rowan speaking of the young man as though he were much to be fearedas indeed he was much feared by her  if you dont think i ought to go perhaps it would be best that i should stay said rachel at last speaking in a very low tone but still with some firmness in her voice  im sure i dont know what im to say to him said mrs ray  that must depend upon what he says to you mamma said rachel  after that there was no further talk of running away but the morning did not pass with them lightly or pleasantly they made an effort to sit quietly at their work and to talk over the doings at mrs tappitts ball but this coming of the young man threw its shadow more or less over everything they could not talk or even look at each other as they would have talked and looked had no such advent been expected they dined at one as was their custom and after dinner i think it probable that each of them stood before her glass with more care than she would have done on ordinary days it was no ordinary day and mrs ray certainly put on a clean cap  will that collar do she said to rachel  oh yes mamma said rachel almost angrily she also had taken her little precautions but she could not endure to have such precautions acknowledged even by a word  the afternoon was very tedious i dont know why luke should have been expected exactly at three but mrs ray had i think made up her mind that he might be looked for at that time with the greatest certainty but at three he was sitting down to dinner and even at halfpast five had not as yet left his room at the dragon  i suppose that we cant have tea till hes been said mrs ray just at that hour that is if he does come at all  rachel felt that her mother was vexed because she suspected that mr rowan was not about to keep his word  dont let his coming make any difference mamma said rachel i will go and get tea  wait a few minutes longer my dear said mrs ray  it was all very well for rachel to beg that it might make no difference it did make a very great deal of difference  i think ill go over and see mrs sturt for a few minutes said rachel getting up  pray dont my dearpray dont i should never know what to say to him if he should come while you were away  so rachel again sat down  she had just for the second time declared her intention of getting tea having now resolved that no weakness on her mothers part should hinder her when mrs ray from her seat near the window saw the young man coming over the green he was walking very slowly swinging a big stick as he came and had taken himself altogether away from the road almost to the verge of mrs sturts farmyard there he is said mrs ray with a little start rachel who was struggling hard to retain her composure could not resist her impulse to jump up and look out upon the green from behind her mothers shoulder but she did this from some little distance inside the room so that no one might possibly see her from the green yes there he is certainly and having thus identified their visitor she immediately sat down again hes talking to farmer sturts ploughboy said mrs ray hes asking where we live said rachel hes never been here before  rowan having completed his conversation with the ploughboy which by the way seemed to mrs ray to have been longer than was necessary for its alleged purpose came boldly across the green and without pausing for a moment made his way through the cottage gate mrs ray caught her breath and could not keep herself quite steady in her chair rachel feeling that something must be done got up from her seat and went quickly out into the passage she knew that the front door was open and she was prepared to meet rowan in the hall  i told you i should call said he i hope youll let me come in  mamma will be very glad to see you she said then she brought him up and introduced him mrs ray rose from her chair and curtseyed muttering something as to its being a long way for him to walk out there to the cottage  i said i should come mrs ray if miss ray did not make her appearance at the brewery in the morning we had such a nice party and of course one wants to talk it over  i hope mrs tappitt is quite well after itand the girls said rachel  oh yes you know we kept it up two hours after you were gone i cant say mr tappitt is quite right this morning  is he ill asked mrs ray  well no not ill i think but i fancy that the party put him out a little middleaged gentlemen dont like to have all their things poked away anywhere ladies dont mind it i fancy  ladies know where to find them as it is they who do the poking away said rachel but im sorry about mr tappitt  im sorry too for hes a goodnatured sort of a man when hes not put out i say mrs ray what a very pretty place you have got here  we think so because were proud of our flowers  i do almost all the gardening myself said rachel  theres nothing i like so much as a garden only i never can remember the names of the flowers theyve got such grand names down here when i was a boy in warwickshire they used to have nothing but roses and sweetwilliams one could remember them  we havent got anything very grand here said rachel soon after that they were sauntering out among the little paths and rachel was picking flowers for him she felt no difficulty in doing it as her mother stood by her though she would not for worlds have given him even a rose if theyd been alone  i wonder whether mr rowan would come in and have some tea said mrs ray  oh wouldnt i said rowan if i were asked  rachel was highly delighted with her mother not so much on account of her courtesy to their guest as that she had shown herself equal to the occasion and had behaved in an unabashed manner as a mistress of a house should do mrs ray had been in such dread of the young mans coming that rachel had feared she would be speechless now the ice was broken and she would do very well the merit however did not belong to mrs ray but to rowan he had the gift of making himself at home with people and had done much towards winning the widows heart when after an interval of ten minutes they two followed rachel into the house rachel then had her hat on and was about to go over the green to the farmers house mamma ill just run over to mrs sturts for some cream said she  maynt i go with you said rowan  certainly not said rachel youd frighten mrs sturt out of all her composure and we should never get the cream then rachel went off and rowan was again left with her mother  he had seated himself at her request in an armchair and there for a minute or two he sat silent mrs ray was busy with the teathings but she suddenly felt that she was oppressed by the strangers presence while rachel had been there and even when they had been walking among the flowerbeds she had been quite comfortable but now the knowledge that he was there in the room with her as he sat silent in the chair was becoming alarming had she been right to ask him to stay for tea he looked and spoke like a sheep but then was it not known to all the world that wolves dressed themselves often in that guise so that they might carry out their wicked purposes had she not been imprudent and then there was the immediate trouble of his silence what was she to say to him to break it that trouble however was soon brought to an end by rowan himself mrs ray said he i think your daughter is the nicest girl i ever saw in my life  mrs ray instantly put down the teacaddy which she had in her hand and started with a slight gasp in her throat as though cold water had been thrown over her at the instant she said nothing what was she to say in answer to so violent a proposition  upon my word i do said luke who was too closely engaged with his own thoughts and his own feelings to pay much immediate attention to mrs ray it isnt only that shes goodlooking but theres somethingi dont know what it isbut shes just the sort of person i like i told her i should come today and i have come on purpose to say this to you i hope you wont be angry with me  pray sir dont say anything to her to turn her head  if i understand her mrs ray it wouldnt be very easy to turn her head but suppose she has turned mine  ah no young gentlemen like you are in no danger of that sort of thing but for a poor girl  i dont think you quite understand me mrs ray i didnt mean anything about danger my danger would be that she shouldnt care twopence for me and i dont suppose she ever will but what i want to know is whether you would object to my coming over here and seeing her i dont doubt but she might do much better  oh dear no said mrs ray  but i should like to have my chance  youve not said anything to her yet mr rowan  well no i cant say i have i meant to do so last night at the party but she wouldnt stay and hear me i dont think she cares very much about me but ill take my chance if youll let me  here she is said mrs ray then she again went to work with the teacaddy so that rachel might be led to believe that nothing special had occurred in her absence nevertheless had rowan been away every word would have been told to her  i hope you like clotted cream said rachel taking off her hat luke declared that it was the one thing in all the world that he liked best and that he had come into devonshire with the express object of feasting upon it all his life other devonshire dainties were not he said so much to his taste he had another object in life he intended to put down cider  i beg you wont do anything of the kind said mrs ray for i always drink it at dinner then rowan explained how that he was a brewer and that he looked upon it as his duty to put down so poor a beverage as cider the people of devonshire he averred knew nothing of beer and it was his ambition to teach them mrs ray grew eager in the defence of cider and then they again became comfortable and happy i never heard of such a thing in my life said mrs ray what are the farmers to do with all their apple trees it would be the ruin of the whole country  i dont suppose it can be done all at once said luke  not even by mr rowan said rachel  he sat there for an hour after their tea and mrs ray had in truth become fond of him when he spoke to rachel he did so with the utmost respect and he seemed to be much more intimate with the mother than with the daughter mrs rays mind was laden with the burden of what he had said in rachels absence and with the knowledge that she would have to discuss it when rowan was gone but she felt herself to be happy while he remained and had begun to hope that he would not go quite yet rachel also was perfectly happy she said very little but thought much of her different meetings with himof the arm in the clouds of the promise of his friendship of her first dance of the little fraud by which he had secured her company at supper and then of those words he had spoken when he detained her after supper in the hall she knew that she liked him well but had feared that such liking might not be encouraged but what could be nicer than thisto sit and listen to him in her mothers presence now she was not afraid of him now she feared no ones eyes now she was disturbed by no dread lest she might be sinning against rules of propriety there was no mrs tappitt by to rebuke her with an angry look  oh mr rowan im sure you need not go yet she said when he got up and sought his hat  mr rowan my dear has got other things to do besides talking to us  oh no he has not he cant go and brew after eight oclock  when my brewery is really going i mean to brew all night but just at present im the idlest man in baslehurst when i go away i shall sit upon cawston bridge and smoke for an hour till some of the briggses of the town come and drive me away but i wont trouble you any longer good night mrs ray  good night mr rowan  and i may come and see you again  mrs ray was silent im sure mamma will be very happy said rachel  i want to hear her say so herself said luke  poor woman she felt that she was driven into a position from which any safe escape was quite impossible she could not tell her guest that he would not be welcome she could not even pretend to speak to him with cold words after having chatted with him so pleasantly and with such cordial good humour and yet were she to tell him that he might come she would be granting him permission to appear there as rachels lover if rachel had been away she would have appealed to his mercy and have thrown herself in the spirit on her knees before him but she could not do this in rachels presence  i suppose business will prevent your coming so far out of town again very soon  it was a foolish subterfuge a vain silly attempt  oh dear no said he i always walk somewhere every day and you shall see me again before long then he turned to rachel shall you be at mr tappitts tomorrow  i dont quite know said rachel  i suppose i might as well tell you the truth and have done with it said luke laughing i hate secrets among friends the fact is mr tappitt has turned me out of his house  turned you out said mrs ray  oh mr rowan said rachel  thats the truth said rowan its about that horrid brewery he means to be honest and so do i but in such matters it is so hard to know what the right of each party really is i fear we shall have to go to law but theres a lady coming in so ill tell you the rest of it tomorrow i want you to know it all mrs ray and to understand it too  a lady said mrs ray looking out through the open window oh dear if here isnt dorothea  then rowan shook hands with them both pressing rachels very warmly close under her mothers eyes and as he went out of the house into the garden he passed mrs prime on the walk and took off his hat to her with great composure     chapter xii  rachel ray thinks she does like him   luke rowans appearance at mrs rays teatable as described in the last chapter took place on wednesday evening and it may be remembered that on the morning of that same day mrs prime had been closeted with mr prong in that gentlemans parlour she had promised to give mr prong an answer to his proposal on saturday and had consequently settled herself down steadily to think of all that was good and all that might be evil in such an arrangement as that suggested to her she wished much for legal advice but she made up her mind that that was beyond her reach was beyond her reach as a preliminary assistance she knew enough of the laws of her country to enable her to be sure that though she might accept the offer her own money could be so tied up on her behalf that her husband could not touch the principal of her wealth but she did not know whether things could be so settled that she might have in her own hands the spending of her income by three oclock on that day she thought that she would accept mr prong if she could be satisfied on that head her position as a clergymans wifea ministers wife she called itwould be unexceptionable the company of miss pucker was distasteful solitude was not charming to her and then could she not work harder as a married woman than in the position which she now held and also could she not so work with increased power and increased perseverance at three oclock she had almost made up her mind but still she was sadly in need of counsel and information then it occurred to her that her mother might have some knowledge in this matter in most respects her mother was not a woman of the world but it was just possible that in this difficulty her mother might assist her her mother might at any rate ask of others and there was no one else whom she could trust to seek such information for her and if she did this thing she must tell her mother it is true that she had quarrelled with them both at braggs end but there are affairs in life which will ride over family quarrels and trample them out unless they be deeper and of longer standing than that between mrs prime and mrs ray therefore it was that she appeared at the cottage at braggs end just as luke rowan was leaving it  she had entered upon the green with something of the olivebranch in her spirit and before she reached the gate had determined that as far as was within her power all unkindness should be buried on the present occasion but when she saw luke rowan coming out of her mothers door she was startled out of all her good feeling she had taught herself to look on rowan as the personification of mischief as the very mischief itself in regard to rachel she had lifted up her voice against him she had left her home and torn herself from her family because it was not compatible with the rigour of her principles that any one known to her should be known to him also but she had hardly left her mothers house when this most pernicious cause of war was admitted to all the freedom of family intercourse it almost seemed to her that her mother must be a hypocrite it was but the other day that mrs ray could not hear luke rowans name mentioned without wholesome horror but where was that wholesome horror now on monday mrs prime had left the cottage on tuesday rachel had gone to a ball expressly to meet the young man and on wednesday the young man was drinking tea at braggs end cottage mrs prime would have gone away without speaking a word to her mother or sister had such retreat been possible  stately and solemn was the recognition which she accorded to lukes salutation and then she walked on into the house  oh dorothea said her mother and there was a tone almost of shame in mrs rays voice  were so glad to see you dolly said rachel and in rachels voice there was no tone of shame it was all just as it should not be  i did not mean to disturb you mother while you were entertaining company  mrs ray said nothingnothing at the moment but rachel took upon herself to answer her sister you wouldnt have disturbed us at all even if you had come a little sooner but you are not too late for tea if youll have some  ive taken tea thank you two hours ago and she spoke as though there were much virtue in the distance of time at which she had eaten and drunk as compared with the existing rakish and dissipated appearance of her mothers teatable teathings about at eight oclock it was all of a piece together  we are very glad to see you at any rate said mrs ray i was afraid you would not have come out to us at all  perhaps it would have been better if i had not come  i dont see that said rachel i think its much better i hate quarrelling and i hope youre going to stay now you are here  no rachel im not going to stay mother it is impossible i should see that young man walking out of your house in that way without speaking of it although im well aware that my voice here goes for nothing now  that was mr luke rowan said mrs ray  i know very well who it was said mrs prime shaking her head rachel will remember that ive seen him before  and youll be likely to see him again if you stay here dolly said rachel this she said out of pure mischiefthat sort of mischief which her sisters rebuke was sure to engender  i dare say said mrs prime whenever he pleases no doubt but i shall not see him if you approve of it mother of course i can say nothing furthernothing further than this that i dont approve of such things  but what ails him that he shouldnt be a very good young man says mrs ray and if it was so that he was growing fond of rachel why shouldnt he and if rachel was to like him i dont see why she shouldnt like somebody some day as well as other girls mrs ray had been a little put beside herself or she would hardly have said so much in rachels presence she had forgotten probably that rachel had not as yet been made acquainted with the nature of rowans proposal  mamma dont talk in that way theres nothing of that kind said rachel  i dont believe there is said mrs prime  i say there is then said mrs ray and its very illnatured in you dorothea to speak and think in that way of your sister  oh very well i see that i had better go back to baslehurst at once  so it is very illnatured i cant bear to have these sort of quarrels but i must speak out for her i believe hes a very good young man with nothing bad about him at all and he is welcome to come here whenever he pleases and as for rachel i believe she knows how to mind herself as well as you did when you were her age only poor mr prime was come and gone at that time and as for his not intending he came out here just because he did intend and only to ask my permission i didnt at first tell him he might because rachel was over at the farm getting the cream and i thought she ought to be consulted first and if thats not straightforward and proper im sure i dont know what is and he having a business of his own too and able to maintain a wife tomorrow and if a young man isnt to be allowed to ask leave to see a young woman when he thinks he likes her i for one dont know how young people are to get married at all then mrs ray sat down put her apron up to her eyes and had a great cry  it was a most eloquent speech and i cannot say which of her daughters was the most surprised by it as to rachel it must be remembered that very much was communicated to her of which she had hitherto known nothing very much indeed we may say so much that it was of a nature to alter the whole tone and tenor of her life this young man of whom she had thought so much and of whom she had been so much in dreadfearing that her many thoughts of him were becoming dangerousthis young man who had interested her so warmly had come out to braggs end simply to get her mothers leave to pay his court to her and he had done this without saying a word to herself there was something in this infinitely sweeter to her than would have been any number of pretty speeches from himself she had hitherto been angry with him though liking him well she had been angry with though almost loving him she had not known why it was so but the cause had been thisthat he had seemed in their intercourse together to have been deficient in that respect which she had a right to claim but now all that sin was washed away by such a deed as this as the meaning of her mothers words sank into her heart and as she came to understand her mothers declaration that luke rowan should be welcome to the cottage as her lover her eyes became full of tears and the spirit of her animosity against her sister was quenched by the waters of her happiness  and mrs prime was almost equally surprised but was by no means equally delighted had the whole thing fallen out in a different way she would probably have looked on a marriage with luke rowan as good and salutary for her sister at any rate seeing that the world is as it is and that all men cannot be hardworking ministers of the gospel nor all women the wives of such or their assistants in godly ministrations she would not have taken upon herself to oppose such a marriage but as it was she had resolved that luke rowan was a black sheep that he was pitch not to be touched without defilement that he was in short a man to be regarded by religious people as anathemaa thing accursed and of that idea she was not able to divest herself suddenly why had the young man walked about under the churchyard elms at night why if he were not wicked and abandoned did he wear that jaunty lookthat look which was so worldly and moreover he went to balls and tempted others to do the like in a word he was a young man manifestly of that class which was esteemed by mrs prime more dangerous than roaring lions it was not possible that she should give up her opinion merely because this roaring lion had come out to her mother with a plausible story upon her at that moment fell the necessity of forming a judgment to which it would be necessary that she should hereafter abide she must either at once give in her adherence to the rowan alliance or else if she opposed it she must be prepared to cling to that opposition she was aware that some such decision was now required and paused for a moment before she declared herself but that moment only strengthened her verdict against rachels lover could any serious young man have taken off his hat with the flippancy which had marked that action on his part would not any serious young man properly intent on matrimonial prospects have been subdued at such a moment to a more solemn deportment mrs primes verdict was still against him and that verdict she proceeded to pronounce  oh very well then of course i shall interfere no further i shouldnt have thought that rachels seeing him twice in such a way as that toohiding under the churchyard trees  i wasnt hiding said rachel and youve no business to say so her tears however prevented her from fighting her own battle manfully or with her usual courage  it looked very much like it rachel at any rate i should have thought that mother would have wished you to have known a great deal more about any young man before she encouraged you to regard him in that way than you can possibly know of mr rowan  but how are they to know each other dorothea if they mustnt see one another said mrs ray  i have no doubt he knows how to dance very cleverly as rachel is being taught to live now that may perhaps be the chief thing necessary  this blow did reach poor mrs ray who a week or two since would certainly have agreed with her elder daughter in thinking that dancing was sinful into this difficulty however she had been brought by mr comforts advice but what else can she know of him continued mrs prime he is able to maintain a wife you sayand is that all that is necessary to consider in the choice of a husband or is that the chief thing oh mother you should think of your responsibility at such a time as this it may be very pleasant for rachel to have this young man as her lover very pleasant while it lasts but whatwhatwhat then mrs prime was so much oppressed by the black weight of her own thoughts that she was unable further to express them  i do think about it said mrs ray i think about it more than anything else  and have you concluded that in this way you can best secure rachels welfare oh mother  he always goes to church on sundays said rachel i dont know why you are to make him out so bad this she said with her eyes fixed upon her mother for it seemed to her that her mother was almost about to yield  a good deal might be said in excuse for mrs prime she was not only acting for the best in accordance with her own lights but the doctrine which she now preached was the doctrine which had been held by the inhabitants of the cottage at braggs end the fault if fault there was had been in the teaching under which had lived both mrs prime and her mother in their desire to live in accordance with that teaching they had agreed to regard all the outer world that is all the world except their world as wicked and dangerous they had never conceived that in forming this judgment they were deficient in charity nor indeed were they conscious that they had formed any such judgment in works of charity they had striven to be abundant but had taken simply the dorcas view of that virtue the younger and more energetic woman had become sour in her temper under the régime of this life while the elder and weaker had retained her own sweetness partly because of her weakness but who can say that either of them were other than good womengood according to such lights as had been lit for their guidance but now the younger was stanch to her old lessons while the elder was leaving them the elder was leaving them not by force of her own reason but under the necessity of coming in contact with the world which was brought upon her by the vitality and instincts of her younger child this difficulty she had sought to master once and for ever by a reference to her clergyman what had been the result of that reference the reader already knows  mother said mrs prime very solemnly is this young man such a one as you would have chosen for rachels husband six months ago  i never wished to choose any man for her husband said mrs ray i dont think you ought to talk to me in that way dorothea  i dont know in what other way to talk to you i cannot be indifferent on such a subject as this when you tell me and that before rachel herself that you have given this young man leave to come and see her whenever he pleases  i never said anything of the kind dorothea  did you not mother i am sure i understood you so  i said he had come to ask leave and that i should be glad to see him when he did come but i didnt say anything of having told him so i didnt tell him anything of the kind did i rachel but i know he will come and i dont see why he shouldnt and if he does i cant turn him out he took his tea here quite like a steady young man he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he always goes to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him and say that hes anything out of the way  i have not judged him mother  then rachel spoke out and we may say that it was needful that she should do so this offering of her heart had been discussed in her presence in a manner that had been very painful to her though the persons discussing it had been her own mother and her own sister but in truth she had been so much affected by what had been said there had been so much in it that was first joyful and then painful to her that she had not hitherto been able to repress her emotions so as to acquire the power of much speech but she had struggled and now so far succeeded as to be able to come to her mothers support  i dont know mamma why anybody should judge him yet and as to what he has said to me im sure no one has a right to judge him unkindly dolly has been very angry with me because she saw me speaking to him in the churchyard and has said that i washiding  i meant that he was hiding  neither of us were hiding and it was an unkind word not like a sister i have never had to hide from anybody and as forforfor liking mr rowan after such words as that i will not say anything about it to anybody except to mamma if he were to ask me to behis wife i dont know what answer i should makenot yet but i shall never listen to any one while mamma lives if she wishes me not then she turned to her mother and mrs ray who had before been driven to doubt by mrs primes words now again became strong in her resolution to cherish rachels lover  i dont believe shell ever do anything to make me think that i oughtnt to have trusted her said mrs ray embracing rachel and speaking with her own eyes full of tears  it now seemed to mrs prime that there was nothing left for her but to go in her eagerness about her sisters affairs she had for a while forgotten her own and now as she again remembered the cause that had brought her on the present occasion to braggs end she felt that she must return without accomplishing her object after having said so much in reprobation of her sisters loveaffair it was hardly possible that she should tell the tale of her own and yet her need was urgent she had pledged herself to give mr prong an answer on friday and she could hardly bring herself to accept that gentlemans offer without first communicating with her mother on the subject any such communication at the present moment was quite out of the question  perhaps it would be better that i should go and leave you she said if i can do no good i certainly dont want to do any harm i wish that rachel would have taken to what i think a better course of life  why what have i done said rachel turning round sharply  i mean about the dorcas meetings  i dont like the women therethats why i havent gone  i believe them to be good praiseworthy godly women but it is useless to talk about that now goodnight rachel and she gave her hand coldly to her sister goodnight mother i wish i could see you alone tomorrow  come here for your dinner said mrs ray  nobut if you would come to me in the morning i should take it kindly this mrs ray promised to do and then mrs prime walked back to baslehurst  rachel when her sister was gone felt that there was much to be said between her and her mother mrs ray herself was so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated if i may say so that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rachel during this visit of mrs primes or that anything had been said which made a further explanation necessary she had as it were authorized rachel to regard rowan as her lover and yet was not aware that she had done so but rachel had remembered every word she had resolved that she would permit herself to form no special intimacy with luke rowan without her mothers leave but she was also beginning to resolve that with her mothers leave such intimacy would be very pleasant of this she was quite sure within her own heartthat it should not be abandoned at her sisters instigation  mamma she said i did not know that he had spoken to you in that way  in what way rachel mrs rays voice was not quite pleasant now that mrs prime was gone she would have been glad to have had the dangerous subject abandoned for a while  that he had asked you to let him come here and that he had said that about me  he did thenwhile you were away at mrs sturts  and what answer did you give him  i didnt give him any answer you came back and im sure i was very glad that you did for i shouldnt have known what to say to him  but what was it that he did say mammathat is if you dont think it wrong to tell me  i hardly know but i dont suppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment  oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen  did he mamma and the girl clung closer to her mother as she heard the pleasant words  but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then he said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweetheart if i would let him  and what did you say mamma  i couldnt say anything because you came back  but you told dolly that you would be glad to see him whenever he might choose to come here  did i  yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he pleased and that you believed him to be a very good young man  and so i do why should he be anything else  i dont say that hes anything else but mamma  well my dear  what shall i say to him if he does ask me that question he has called me by my name two or three times and spoken to me as though he wanted me to like him if he does say anything to me like that what shall i answer  if you think you dont like him well enough you must tell him so of course  yes of course i must then rachel was silent for a minute or two she had not as yet received the full answer which she desired in such an alternative as that which her mother had suggested we may say that she would have known how to frame her answer to the young man without any advice from her mother but there was another alternative as to which she thought it well that she should have her mothers judgment and opinion but mamma i think i do like him said rachel burying her face  im sure i dont wonder at it said mrs ray for i like him very much he has a way with him so much nicer than most of the young men now and then hes very well off which after all must count for something a young woman should never fall in love with a man who cant earn his bread not if he was ever so religious or steady and hes very goodlooking too good looks are only skindeep i know and they wont bring much comfort when sorrow comes but i do own i love to look on a young fellow with a sonsy face and a quick lively step mr comfort seemed to think it would do very well if there was to be any such thing and if hes not able to tell im sure i dont know who ought to be and nothing could be fairer than his coming out here and telling me first theres so many of them are sly but there was nothing sly about that  in this way with many more rambling words with many kisses also and with some tears rachel ray received from her mother permission to regard luke rowan as her lover     chapter xiii  mr tappitt in his countinghouse   luke rowan when he left the cottage walked quickly back across the green towards baslehurst he had sauntered out slowly on his road from the brewery to braggs end being in doubt as to what he would do when he reached his destination but there was no longer room for doubt now he had said that to rachels mother which made any further doubt impossible and he was resolved that he would ask rachel to be his wife he had spoken to mrs ray of his intention in that respect as though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be rejected and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth but he was eager sanguine and selfconfident by nature and though he was by no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom any young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved he did not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with despair he walked quickly home along the dusty road picturing to himself a happy prosperous future in baslehurst with rachel as his wife and the tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income paid to old tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery that was his present solution of the brewery difficulty tappitt was growing old and it might be quite as well not only for himself but for the cause of humanity in devonshire that he should pass the remainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement from business affords he did not desire tappitt for a partner any more than tappitt desired him nevertheless he was determined to brew beer and was anxious to do so if possible on the spot where his greatuncle bungall had commenced operations in that line  it may be well to explain here that rowan was not without good standingground in his dispute with tappitt old bungalls will had somewhat confused matters as it is in the nature of wills to do but it had been bungalls desire that his full share in the brewery should go to his nephew after his widows death should he on dying leave a widow now it had happened that he had left a widow and that the widow had contrived to live longer than the nephew she had drawn an income of five hundred a year from the concern by agreement between her and her lawyer and tappitt and his lawyer and tappitt when the elder rowan bungalls nephew died had taught himself to believe that all the affairs of the brewery must now remain for ever in his own hands unless he himself might choose to make other provision he knew that some property in the concern would pass away from him when the old lady died but he had not acknowledged to himself that young rowan would inherit from his father all the rights which old rowan would have possessed had he lived lukes father had gone into other walks of life and had lived prosperously leaving behind him money for his widow and money also for his children and tappitt when he found that there was a young man with a claim to a partnership in his business had been not only much annoyed but surprised also he had been as we have seen persuaded to hold out the right hand of friendship and the left hand of the partnership to the young man he had thought that he might manage a young man from london who knew nothing of beer and his wife had thought that the young man might probably like to take a wife as well as an income out of the concern but as we have seen they had both been wrong in their hopes luke chose to manage the brewery instead of being managed and had foolishly fallen in love with rachel ray instead of taking augusta tappitt to himself as he should have done  there was much certainly of harshness and cruelty in that idea of an opposition brewery in baslehurst to be established in enmity to bungall and tappitt and to be so established with bungalls money and by bungalls heir but luke as he walked back to baslehurst thinking now of his beer and now of his love declared to himself that he wanted only his own let tappitt deal justly with him in that matter of the partnership and he would deal even generously with tappitt the concern gave an income of some fifteen hundred pounds out of which mrs bungall as taking no share of the responsibility or work had been allowed to have a third he was informed by his lawyer that he was entitled to claim onehalf of the whole concern if tappitt would give in his adhesion to that villa arrangement he should still have his thousand a year for life and mrs tappitt afterwards should have due provision and the girls should have all that could fairly be claimed for them or if the villa scheme could not be carried out quite at present he rowan would do two shares of the work and allow tappitt to take two shares of the pay but then in that case he must be allowed scope for his improvements good beer should be brewed for the people of baslehurst and the eyes of devonshire should be opened pondering over all this and resolving that he would speak out his mind openly to rachel on the morrow luke rowan reached his inn  theres a lady sir upstairs as wishes to speak to you said the waiter  a lady  quite elderly sir said the waiter intending to put an end to any excitement on rowans part  its the gentlemans own mother said the chambermaid in a tone of reproof and shes in number two sittingroom private so luke went to number two sittingroom private and there he found his mother waiting for him  this is very sad she said when their first greetings were over  about old tappitt yes it is but what could i do mother hes a stupid old man and pigheaded he would quarrel with me so that i was obliged to leave the house if you and mary like to come into lodgings while you stay here i can get rooms for you  but mrs rowan explained that she herself did not wish to come to any absolute or immediate rupture with mrs tappitt of course their visit would be shortened but mrs tappitt was disposed to be very civil as were the girls then mrs rowan suggested whether there might not be a reconciliation between luke and the brewery family  but mother i have not quarrelled with the family  it comes to the same thing luke does it not dont you think you could say something civil to mr tappitt so as toto bring him round again hes older than you are you know luke  rowan perceived at once that his mother was ranging herself on the tappitt side in the contest and was therefore ready to fight with so much the more vigour he was accustomed to yield to his mother in all little things mrs rowan being a woman who liked such yieldings but for some time past he had held his own against her in all greater matters now and again for an hour or so she would show that she was vexed but her admiration for him was so genuine and her love so strong that this vexation never endured and luke had been taught to think that his judgment was to be held supreme in all their joint concerns yes mother he is older than i am but i do not know that i can say anything particularly civil to himthat is more civil than what i have said the civility which he wants is the surrender of my rights i cant be so civil as that  no luke i should be the last to ask you to surrender any of your rights you must be sure of that butoh luke if what i hear is true i shall be so unhappy  and what have you heard mother  i am afraid all this is not about the brewery altogether  but it is about the brewery altogetherabout that and about nothing else to any smallest extent i dont at all know what you mean  luke is there no young lady in the case  young lady in what casein the case of my quarrel with old tappittwhether he and i have had a difference about a young lady  no luke you know i dont mean that  but what do you mean mother  im afraid that you know too well is there not a young lady whom youve met at mrs tappitts and whom youyou pretend to admire  and suppose there isfor the sake of the argumentwhat has that to do with my difference with mr tappitt as rowan asked this question some slight conception of the truth flashed across his mind some faint idea came home to him of the connecting link between his admiration for rachel ray and mr tappitts animosity  but is it so luke asked the anxious mother i care much more about that than i do about all the brewery put together nothing would make me so wretched as to see you make a marriage that was beneath you  i dont think i shall ever make you wretched in that way  and you tell me that there is nothing in this that i have heardnothing at all  no by heavensi tell you no such thing i do not know what you may have heard that you have heard falsehood and calumny i guess by your speaking of a marriage that would be beneath me but as you think it right to ask me i will not deceive you by any subterfuge it is my purpose to ask a girl here in baslehurst to be my wife  then you have not asked her yet  you are crossexamining me very closely mother if i have not asked her i am bound to do so not that any binding is necessaryfor without being bound i certainly should do so  and it is miss ray  yes it is miss ray  oh luke then indeed i shall be very wretched  why so mother have you heard anything against her  against her well i will not say that for i do not wish to say anything against any young woman but do you know who she is luke and who her mother is they are quite poor people  and is that against them  not against their moral character certainly but it is against them in considering the expediency of a connection with them you would hardly wish to marry out of your own station i am told that the mother lives in a little cottage quite in a humble sphere and that the sister  i intend to marry neither the mother nor the sister but rachel ray i do intend to marryif she will have me if i had been left to myself i should not have told you of this till i had found myself to be successful as you have asked me i have not liked to deceive you but mother do not speak against her if you can say nothing worse of her than that she is poor  you misunderstand me luke  i hope so i do not like to think that that objection should be made by you  of course it is an objection but it is not the one which i meant to make there may be many a young lady whom it would be quite fitting that you should wish to marry even though she had not got a shilling it would be much pleasanter of course that the lady should have something though i should never think of making any serious objection about that but what i should chiefly look to would be the young lady herself and her position in life  the young lady herself would certainly be the main thing said luke  thats what i saythe young lady herself and her position in life have you made any inquiries  yes i haveand am almost ashamed of myself for doing so  i have no doubt mrs ray is very respectable but the sort of people who are her friends are not your friends their most particular friends are the farmers family that lives near them  how was it then that mrs cornbury took her to the party  ah yes i can explain that and mrs tappitt has told me how sorry she is that people should have been deceived by what has occurred luke rowans brow grew black as mrs tappitts name was mentioned but he said nothing and his mother continued her speech her girls have been very kind to miss ray inviting her to walk with them and all that sort of thing because of her being so much alone without any companions of her own  oh that has been it has it i thought she had the farmers family out near where she lived  if you choose to listen to me luke i shall be obliged to you but if you take me up at every word in that way of course i must leave you then she paused but as luke said nothing she went on with her discourse it was in that way that she came to know the miss tappitts and then one of them the youngest i think asked her to come to the party it was very indiscreet but mrs tappitt did not like to go back from her daughters word and so the girl was allowed to come  and to make the blunder pass off easily mrs cornbury was induced to take her  mrs cornbury happened to be staying with her father in whose parish they had lived for many years and it certainly was very kind of her but it has been an unfortunate mistake altogether the poor girl has for a moment been lifted out of her proper sphere andas you must have seen yourselfhardly knew how to behave herself it made mrs tappitt very unhappy  this was more than luke rowan was able to bear his anger was not against his own mother but against the mistress of the brewery it was manifest that she had been maligning rachel and instigating his mother to take up the cudgels against her and he was vexed also that his mother had not perceived that rachel held or was entitled to hold among women a much higher position than could be fairly accorded to mrs tappitt i do not care one straw for mrs tappitts unhappiness he said and as to miss rays conduct at her house i do not think that there was anything in it that did not become her i do not know what you mean the least in the world and i think you would have no such idea yourself if mrs tappitt had not put it into your head  you should not speak in that way to your mother luke  i must speak strongly when i am defending my wifeas i hope she will be i never heard of anything in my life so little as this womans conduct it is mean paltry jealousy and nothing else you as my mother may think it better that i should not marry  but my dear i want you to marry  then i will do as you want or you may think that i should find some one with money or with grand friends or with a better connection it is natural that you should think like this but why should she want to belittle a young girl like rachel raya girl that her own daughters call their friend ill tell you why mother because rachel ray was admired and they were not  is there anybody in baslehurst that will say that she is your equal  i am not disposed to ask any one in baslehurst just at present and i would not advise any one in baslehurst to volunteer an opinion to me on the subject i intend that she shall be my equalmy equal in every respect if i can make her so i shall certainly ask her to be my wife and mother as my mind is positively made up on that pointas nothing on earth will alter mei hope you will teach yourself to think kindly of her i should be very unhappy if my house could not be your home when you may choose to make it so  but mrs rowan much as she was accustomed to yield to her son could not bring herself to yield in this matteror at least not to yield with grace she felt that the truth and wisdom all lay on her side in the argument though she knew that she had lacked words in which to carry it on she declared to herself that she was not at all inclined to despise anybody for living in a small cottage or for being poor she would have been delighted to be very civil to mrs ray herself and could have patronized rachel quite as kindly though perhaps not so graciously as mrs cornbury had done but it was a different thing when her son came to think of making this young woman his wife old mrs cornbury would have been very sorry to see either of her sons make such an alliance when anything so serious as marriage was to be considered it was only proper to remember that mrs ray lived in a cottage and that farmer sturt was her friend and neighbour but to all this prudence and wisdom luke would not listen at all and at last mrs rowan left him in dudgeon foolish and hasty as he was he could as she felt talk better than she could and therefore she retreated feeling that she had been worsted i have done my duty said she going away i have warned you of course you are your own master and can do as you please then she left him refusing his escort and in the last fading light of the long summer evening made her way back to the brewery  lukes first impulse was to start off instantly to the cottage and settle the matter out of hand but before he had taken up his hat for this purpose he remembered that he could not very well call at braggs end on such a mission at eleven oclock at night so he threw himself back on the hotel sofa and gave vent to his feelings against the tappitt family he would make them understand that they were not going to master him he had come down there disposed to do them all manner of kindnessto the extent even of greatly improving their fortunes by improving the brewing businessand they had taken upon themselves to treat him as though he were a dependent he did not tell himself that a plot had been made to catch him for one of the girls but he accused them of jealousy meanness selfishness and all those sins and abominations by which such a plot would be engendered when about an hour afterwards he took himself off to bed he was full of wrath and determined to display his wrath early on the morrow as he prayed for forgiveness on condition that he forgave others his conscience troubled him but he gulped it down and went on with his angry feelings till sleep came upon him  but in the morning some of this bitterness had worn away his last resolve overnight had been to go to the brewery before breakfast at which period of the day mr tappitt was always to be found for half an hour in his countinghouse and curtly tell the brewer that all further negotiations between them must be made by their respective lawyers but as he was dressing he reflected that mr tappitts position was certainly one of difficulty that amicable arrangements would still be best if amicable arrangements were possible and that something was due to the man who had for so many years been his uncles partner mr tappitt moreover was not responsible for any of those evil things which had been said about rachel by mrs tappitt therefore priding himself somewhat on his charity he entered mr tappitts office without the display of any anger on his face  the brewer was standing with his back to the empty fireplace with his hands behind the tails of his coat and his eyes fixed upon a letter which he had just read and which lay open upon his desk rowan advanced with his hand out and tappitt hesitating a little as he obeyed the summons put out his own and just touched that of his visitor then hastily he resumed his position with his arm behind his coattail  i have come down said rowan because i thought it might be well to have a little chat with you before breakfast  the letter which lay open on the desk was from rowans lawyer in london and contained that offer on rowans part of a thousand a year and retirement to which luke still looked as the most comfortable termination of all their difficulties luke had almost forgotten that he had ten days since absolutely instructed his lawyer to make the offer but there was the offer made and lying on tappitts table tappitt had been considering it for the last five minutes and every additional moment had added to the enmity which he felt against rowan rowan at twentyfive no doubt regarded tappitt who was nearer sixty than fifty as a very old man but men of fiftyfive do not like to be so regarded and are not anxious to be laid upon shelves by their juniors and moreover where was tappitt to find his security for the thousand a yearas he had not failed to remark to himself on his first glance over the lawyers letter buy him out indeed and lay him on one side he hated rowan with all his heartand his hatred was much more bitter in its nature than that which rowan was capable of feeling for him he remembered the champagne he remembered the young mans busy calling for things in his own house he remembered the sneers against the beer and the want of respect with which his experience in the craft had been treated buy him out no not as long as he had a fivepound note to spend or a leg to stand upon he was strong in his resolution now and capable of strength for mrs tappitt was also on his side mrs rowan had not quite kept her secret as to what had transpired at the inn and mrs tappitt was certain that rachel ray had succeeded when tappitt declared that morning that he would fight it out to the last mrs t applauded his courage  oh a little chat is it said tappitt about this letter that ive just got i suppose and he gave a contemptuous poke to the epistle with one of his hands  what letter asked rowan  come now young man dont let us have any humbug and trickery whatever we may do if theres anything i do hate its deceit  all rowans wrath returned upon him instantly redoubled and trebled in its energy what do you mean sir said he who is trying to deceive anybody how dare you speak to me in such language as that  now look here mr rowan this letter comes from your man in craven street as of course you know very well you have chosen to put our business in the hands of the lawyers and in the hands of the lawyers it shall remain i have been very wrong in attempting to have any dealings with you i should have known what sort of a man you were before i let you put your foot in the concern but i know enough of you now and if you please youll keep yourself on the other side of those gates for the future dye hear me unless you wish to be turned out by the men dont you put your feet inside the brewery premises any more and tappitts face as he uttered these words was a face very unpleasant to behold  luke was so astounded that he could not bethink himself at the moment of the most becoming words in which to answer his enemy his first idea had prompted him to repudiate all present knowledge of the lawyers letter seeing that the lawyers letter had been the ground of that charge against him of deceit but having been thus kicked outkicked out as far as words could kick him and threatened with personal violence should those words not be obeyed he found himself unable to go back to the lawyers letter i should like to see any one of your men dare to touch me said he  you shall see it very soon if you dont take yourself off said tappitt luckily the men were gone to breakfast and opportunity for violence was wanting  luke looked round and then remembered that he and tappitt were probably alone in the place mr tappitt said he youre a very foolish man  i dare say said tappitt very foolish not to give up my own bread and my wifes and childrens bread to an adventurer like you  i have endeavoured to treat you with kindness and also with honesty and because you differ from me as of course you have a right to do you think it best to insult me with all the billingsgate you can muster  if you dont go out of my countinghouse young man ill see if i cant put you out myself and tappitt in spite of his fiftyfive years absolutely put his hand down upon the poker  there is no personal encounter in which a young man is so sure to come by the worst as in that with a much older man this is so surely the case that it ought to be considered cowardly in an old man to attack a young one if an old man hit a young man over the head with a walkingstick what can the young man do except run away to avoid a second blow then the old man if he be a wicked old man as so many are tells all his friends that he has licked the young man tappitt would certainly have acted in this way if the weapon in his hand had been a stick instead of a poker but tappitt when he saw his own poker in his own hand was afraid of it if a woman attack a man with a knife the man will be held to have fought fairly though he shall have knocked her down in the encounter and so also with an old man if he take a poker instead of a stick the world will refuse to him the advantage of his gray hairs some such an idea as this came upon tappittby instinct and thus though he still held the poker he refrained his hand  the man must be mad this morning said rowan standing firmly before him with his two hands fixed upon his hips  am i to send for the police said tappitt  for a maddoctor i should think said rowan then tappitt turned round and rang a bell very violently but as the bell was intended to summon some brewery servant who was now away at his breakfast it produced no result  but i have no intention of staying here against your wish mr tappitt whether youre mad or only foolish this matter must of course be settled by the lawyers now and i shall not again come on to these premises unless i acquire a legal right to do so as the owner of them and then having so spoken luke rowan walked off  growling inwardly tappitt deposited the poker within the upright fender and thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets stood scowling at the door through which his enemy had gone he knew that he had been wrong he knew that he had been very foolish he was a man who had made his way upwards through the world with fair success and had walked his way not without prudence he had not been a man of violence or prone to an illicit use of pokers he had never been in difficulty for an assault and had on his conscience not even the blood of a bloody nose or the crime of a blackened eye he was hardworking and peaceable had been churchwarden three times and mayor of baslehurst once he was poorlaw guardian and waywarden and filled customarily the various offices of a steady good citizen what had he to do with pokers unless it were to extract heat from his coals he was ashamed of himself as he stood scowling at the door one fault he perhaps had and of that fault he had been ruthlessly told by lips that should have been sealed for ever on such a subject he brewed bad beer and by whom had this been thrown in his teeth by bungalls nephewby bungalls heirby him who claimed to stand in bungalls shoes within that establishment who had taught him to brew beerbad or good had it not been bungall and now because in his old age he would not change these things and ruin himself in a vain attempt to make some beverage that should look bright to the eye he was to be turned out of his place by this chip from the bungall block this stave out of one of bungalls vats ruat coelum fiat justitia he said as he walked forth to his own breakfast he spoke to himself in other language indeed though the romans sentiment was his own ill stand on my rights though i have to go into the poorhouse     chapter xiv  luke rowan pays a second visit to braggs end   early after breakfast on that morningthat morning on which tappitt had for a moment thought of braining luke rowan with the pokermrs ray started from the cottage on her mission into baslehurst she was going to see her daughter mrs prime at miss puckers lodgings and felt sure that the object of her visit was to be a further discourse on the danger of admitting that wolf rowan into the sheepfold at braggs end she would willingly have avoided the conference had she been able to do so knowing well that mrs prime would get the better of her in words when called upon to talk without having rachel at her back and indeed she was not happy in her mind it had been conceded at the cottage as an understood thing that rachel was to have this man as her lover but what if after all the man didnt mean to be a lover in the proper sense and what if so meaning he should still turn out to be a lover of a bad sorta worldly goodfornothing rakish lover i wonder says the wicked man in the play i wonder any man alive would ever rear a daughter mrs ray knew nothing of the play and had she done so she would not have repeated such a line but the hardness of the task which providence had allotted to her struck her very forcibly on this morning rachel was dearer to her than aught else in the world for rachels happiness she would have made any sacrifice in rachels presence and sweet smile and winning caresses was the chief delight of her existence nevertheless in these days the possession of rachel was hardly a blessing to her the responsibility was so great and worse than that as regarded her own comfort the doubts were so numerous and then they recurred over and over again as often as they were settled  im sure i dont know what she can have to say to me mrs ray as she spoke was tying on her bonnet and rachel was standing close to her with her light summer shawl  it will be the old story mamma im afraid my terrible iniquity and backslidings because i went to the ball and because i wont go to miss puckers shell want you to say that i shall go or else be sent to bed without my supper  thats nonsense rachel dorothea knows very well that i cant make you go mrs ray was wont to become mildly petulant when things went against her  but mamma you dont want me to go  i dont suppose its about miss pucker at all its about that other thing  you mean mr rowan  yes my dear im sure i dont know whats for the best when she gets me to herself she does say such terrible things to me that it quite puts me in a heat to have to go to her i dont think anybody ought to say those sort of things to me except a clergyman or a persons parents or a schoolmaster or masters and mistresses or such like rachel thought so toothought that at any rate a daughter should not so speak to such a mother as was her mother but on that subject she said nothing  and i dont like going to that miss puckers house continued mrs ray im sure i dont want her to come here i wouldnt go only i said that i would  i would go now if i were you mamma  of course i shall go havent i got myself ready  but i would not let her go on in that way  thats very easy said rachel but how am i to help it i cant tell her to hold her tongue and if i did she wouldnt if i am to go i might as well start i suppose theres cold lamb enough for dinner  plenty i should think  and if i find poultry cheap i can bring a chicken home in my basket cant i and so saying with her mind full of various cares mrs ray walked off to baslehurst  i wonder when hell come rachel as she said or thought these words stood at the open door of the cottage looking after her mother as she made her way across the green it was a delicious midsummer day warm with the heat of the morning sun but not yet oppressed with the full blaze of its noonday rays the air was alive with the notes of birds and the flowers were in their brightest beauty i wonder when hell come none of those doubts which so harassed her mother troubled her mind other doubts there were could it be possible that he would like her well enough to wish to make her his own could it be that any one so bright so prosperous in the world so clever so much above herself in all worldly advantages should come and seek her as his wifetake her from their little cottage and lowly ways of life when he had first said that he would come to braggs end she declared to herself that it would be well that he should see in how humble a way they lived he would not call her rachel after that she said to herself or if he did he should learn from her that she knew how to rebuke a man who dared to take advantage of the humility of her position he had come and he had not called her rachel he had come and taking advantage of her momentary absence had spoken of her behind her back as a lover speaks and had told his love honestly to her mother in rachels view of the matter no lover could have carried himself with better decorum or with a sweeter grace but because he had so done she would not hold him to be bound to her he had been carried away by his feelings too rapidly and had not as yet known how poor and lowly they were he should still have opened to him a clear path backwards then if the path backwards were not to his mind then in that case i am not sure that rachel ever declared to herself in plain terms what in such case would happen but she stood at the door as though she was minded to stand there till he should appear upon the green  i wonder when hell come she had watched her mothers figure disappear along the lane and had plucked a flower or two to pieces before she returned within the house he will not come till the evening she determinedtill the evening when his days work in the brewery would be over then she thought of the quarrel between him and tappitt and wondered what it might be she was quite sure that tappitt was wrong and thought of him at once as an obstinate foolish pigheaded old man yes he would come to her and she would take care to be provided in that article of cream which he pretended to love so well she would not have to run away again but how lucky on that previous evening had been that necessity seeing that it had given opportunity for that great display of a lovers excellence on rowans part having settled all this in her mind she went into the house and was beginning to think of her household work when she heard a mans steps in the passage she went at once out from the sittingroom and encountered luke rowan at the door  how dye do said he is mrs ray at home  mammano you must have met her on the road if youve come from baslehurst  but i could not meet her on the road because ive come across the fields  ohthat accounts for it  and shes away in baslehurst is she  shes gone in to see my sister mrs prime rachel still standing at the door of the sittingroom made no attempt of asking rowan into the parlour  and maynt i come in he said rachel was absolutely ignorant whether under such circumstances she ought to allow him to enter but there he was in the house and at any rate she could not turn him out  im afraid youll have to wait a long time if you wait for mamma she said slightly making way so that he obtained admittance was she not a hypocrite did she not know that mrs rays absence would be esteemed by him as a great gain and not a loss why did she thus falsely talk of his waiting a long time dogs fight with their teeth and horses with their heels swans with their wings and cats with their clawsso also do women use such weapons as nature has provided for them  i came specially to see you said he not but what i should be very glad to see your mother too if she comes back before i am gone but i dont suppose she will for you wont let me stay so long as that  well now you mention it i dont think i shall for i have got ever so many things to dothe dinner to get ready and the house to look after this she did by way of making him acquainted with her mode of lifeaccording to the plan which she had arranged for her own guidance  he had come into the room had put down his hat and had got himself up to the window so that his back was turned to her rachel he said turning round quickly and speaking almost suddenly now he had called her rachel again but she could find at the moment no better way of answering him than by the same plaintive objection which she had made before you shouldnt call me by my name in that way mr rowan you know you shouldnt  did your mother tell you what i said to her yesterday he asked  what you said yesterday  yes when you were away across the green  what you said to mamma  yes i know she told you i see it in your face and i am glad she did so may i not call you rachel now  as they were placed the table was still between them so that he was debarred from making any outward sign of his presence as a lover he could not take her hand and press it she stood perfectly silent looking down upon the table on which she leaned and gave no answer to his question may i not call you rachel now he said repeating the question  i hope it will be understood that rachel was quite a novice at this piece of work which she now had in hand it must be the case that very many girls are not novices a young lady who has rejected the first halfdozen suitors who have asked for her love must probably feel herself mistress of the occasion when she rejects the seventh and will not be quite astray when she accepts the eighth there are moreover young ladies who though they may have rejected and accepted none have had so wide an advantage in society as to be able when the moment comes to have their wits about them but rachel had known nothing of what is called society and had never before known either the trouble or the joy of being loved so when the question was pressed upon her she trembled and felt that her breath was failing her she had filled herself full of resolutions as to what she would do when this moment cameas to how she would behave and what words she would utter but all that was gone from her now she could only stand still and tremble of course he might call her rachelmight call her what he pleased to him with his wider experience that now became manifest enough  you must give me leave for more than that rachel if you would not send me away wretched you must let me call you my own then he moved round the table towards her and as he moved though she retreated from him she did not retreat with a step as rapid as his own racheland he put out his hand to heri want you to be my wife she allowed the tips of her fingers to turn themselves toward him as though unable altogether to refuse the greeting which he offered her but as she did so she turned away from him and bent down her head she had heard all she wanted to hear why did he not go away and leave her to think of it he had named to her the word so sacred between man and woman he had said that he sought her for his wife what need was there that he should stay longer  he got her hand in his and then passed his arm round her waist say love say rachelshall it be so nay but i will have an answer from you you shall look it to me if you will not speak it and he got his head round over her shoulder as though to look into her eyes  oh mr rowan pray dontpray dont pull me  but dearest say a word to me you must say some word can you learn to love me rachel  learn to love him the lesson had come to her very easily how was it possible she had once thought not to love him  say a word to me said rowan still struggling to look into her face one word and then i will let you go  what word  say to me dear luke i will be your wife  she remained for a moment quite passive in his hands trying to say it but the words would not come of course she would be his wife why need he trouble her further  nay but rachel you shall speak or i will stay with you here till your mother comes and she shall answer for you if you had disliked me i think you would have said so  i dont dislike you she whispered  and do you love me she slightly bowed her head and you will be my wife again she went through the same little piece of acting and i may call you rachel now in answer to this question she shook herself free from his slackened grasp and escaped away across the room  you cannot forbid me now come and sit down by me for of course i have got much to say to you come and sit down and indeed i will not trouble you again  then she went to him very slowly and sat with him leaving her hand in his listening to his words and feeling in her heart the full delight of having such a lover of the words that were then spoken but very few came from her lips he told her all his story of the brewery quarrel and was very eloquent and droll in describing tappitt as he brandished the poker  and was he going to hit you with it said rachel with all her eyes open  well he didnt hit me said luke but to look at him he seemed mad enough to do anything then he told her how at the present moment he was living at the inn and how it became necessary from this unfortunate quarrel that he should go at once to london but under no circumstances would i have gone said he pressing her hand very closely without an answer from you  but you ought not to think of anything like that when you are in such trouble  ought i not well but i do you see then he explained to her that part of his project consisted in his marrying her out of handat once he would go up to london for a week or two and then coming back be married in the course of the next month  oh mr rowan that would be impossible  you must not call me mr rowan or i shall call you miss ray  but indeed it would be impossible  why impossible  indeed it would you can ask mammaor rather you had better give over thinking of it i havent had time yet even to make up my mind what you are like  but you say that you love me  so i do but i suppose i ought not for im sure i dont know what you are like yet it seems to me that youre very fond of having your own way sirand so you ought she added but really you cant have your own way in that nobody ever heard of such a thing everybody would think we were mad  i shouldnt care one straw for that  ah but i shoulda great many straws  he sat there for two hours telling her of all things appertaining to himself he explained to her that irrespective of the brewery he had an income sufficient to support a wifethough not enough to make her a fine lady like mrs cornbury he said  if you can give me bread and cheese its as much as i have a right to expect said rachel  i have over four hundred a year said he and rachel hearing it thought that he could indeed support a wife why should a man with four hundred a year want to brew beer  but i have got nothing said rachel not a farthing  of course not said rowan it is my theory that unmarried girls never ought to have anything if they have they ought to be considered as provided for and then they shouldnt have husbands and i rather think it would be better if men didnt have anything either so that they might be forced to earn their bread only they would want capital  rachel listened to it all with the greatest content and most unalloyed happiness she did not quite understand him but she gathered from his words that her own poverty was not a reproach in his eyes and that he under no circumstances would have looked for a wife with a fortune her happiness was unalloyed at all she heard from him till at last he spoke of his mother  and does she dislike me asked rachel with dismay  it isnt that she dislikes you but shes staying with that mrs tappitt who is furious against me becausei suppose its because of this brewery row but indeed i cant understand it a week ago i was at home there now i darent show my nose in the house and have been turned out of the brewery this morning with a poker  i hope its nothing about me said rachel  how can it be about you  because i thought mrs tappitt looked at the ball as though but i suppose it didnt mean anything  it ought to be a matter of perfect indifference whether it meant anything or not  but how can it be so about your mother if this is ever to lead to anything  lead to anything what it will lead to is quite settled  you know what i mean but how could i become your wife if your mother did not wish it  look here rachel thats all very proper for a girl i dare say if your mother thought i was not fit to be your husband i wont say but what you ought to take her word in such a matter but it isnt so with a man it will make me very unhappy if my mother cannot be friends with my wife but no threats of hers to that effect would prevent me from marrying nor should they have any effect upon you im my own master and from the nature of things i must look out for myself  this was all very grand and masterful on rowans part and might in theory be true but there was that in it which made rachel uneasy and gave to her love its first shade of trouble she could not be quite happy as lukes promised bride if she knew that she would not be welcomed to that place by lukes mother and then what right had she to think it probable that lukes mother would give her such a welcome at that first meeting however she said but little herself on the subject she had pledged to him her troth and she would not attempt to go back from her pledge at the first appearance of a difficulty she would talk to her own mother and perhaps his mother might relent but throughout it all there ran a feeling of dismay at the idea of marrying a man whose mother would not willingly receive her as a daughter  but you must go said she at last indeed you must i have things to do if you have nothing  im the idlest man in the world at the present moment if you turn me out i can only go and sit at the inn  then you must go and sit at the inn if you stay any longer mamma wont have any dinner  if thats so of course ill go but i shall come back to tea  as rachel gave no positive refusal to this proposition rowan took his departure on the understanding that he might return  goodbye said he when i come this evening i shall expect you to walk with me  oh i dont know said she  yes you will and we will see the sun set again and you will not run from me this evening as though i were an ogre as he spoke he took her in his arms and held her and kissed her before she had time to escape from him youre mine altogether now said he and nothing can sever us god bless you rachel  goodbye luke and then they parted  she had told him to go alleging her household duties as her ground for dismissing him but when he was gone she did not at once betake herself to her work she sat on the seat which he had shared with her thinking of the thing which she had done she was now betrothed to this man as his wife the only man towards whom her fancy had ever turned with the slightest preference so far love for her had run very smoothly from her first meetings with him on those evenings in which she had hardly spoken to him his form had filled her eye and his words had filled her mind she had learned to love to see him before she understood what her heart was doing for her gradually but very quickly all her vacant thoughts had been given to him and he had become the hero of her life now almost before she had had time to question herself on the matter he was her affianced husband it had all been so quick and so very gracious that she seemed to tremble at her own good fortune there was that one little cloud in the skythat frown on his mothers brow but now in the first glow of her happiness she could not bring herself to believe that this cloud would bring a storm so she sat there dreaming of her happiness and longing for her mothers return that she might tell it allthat it might be talked of hour after hour and that lukes merits might receive their fitting mention her mother was not a woman who on such an occasion would stint the measure of her praise or refuse her child the happiness of her sympathy  but rachel knew that she must not let the whole morning pass by in idle dreams happy as those dreams were and closely as they were allied to her waking life after a while she jumped up with a start i declare there will be nothing done mamma will want her dinner though im ever so much going to be married  but she had not been long on foot or done much in preparation of the cold lamb which it was intended they should eat that day before she heard her mothers footsteps on the gravel path she ran out to the front door full of her own news though hardly knowing as yet in what words she would tell it but of her mothers news of any tidings which there might be to tell as to that interview which had just taken place in baslehurst rachel did not think much nothing that dorothea could say would now be of moment so at least rachel flattered herself and as for dorothea and all her growlings had they not chiefly ended in thisthat the young man did not intend to present himself as a husband but he had now done so in a manner which rachel felt to be so satisfactory that even dorotheas criticism must be disarmed so rachel as she met her mother thought only of the tale which she had to tell and nothing of that which she was to hear  but mrs ray was so full of her tale was so conscious of the fact that her tidings were entitled to the immediate and undivided attention of her daughter and from their first greeting on the gravel path was so ready with her words that rachel with all the story of her happiness was for a while obliterated  oh my dear said mrs ray i have such news for you  so have i mamma news for you said rachel putting out her hand to her mother  i never was so warm in my life do let me get in oh dear oh dear its no good looking in the basket for when i came away from dorothea i was too full of what i had just heard to think of buying anything  what have you heard mamma  im sure i hope shell be happy im sure i do but its a great venture a terribly great venture  what is it mamma and rachel though she could not yet think that her mothers budget could be equal in importance to her own felt that there was that which it was necessary that she should hear  your sister is going to be married to mr prong  dolly  yes my dear its a great venture but if any woman can live happy with such a man she can do so shes troubled about her moneythats all  marry mr prong i suppose she may if she likes oh dear i cant think i shall ever like him  i never spoke to him yet so perhaps i oughtnt to say but he doesnt look a nice man to my eyes but what are looks my dear theyre only skin deep we ought all of us to remember that always rachel theyre only skin deep and if as she says she only wants to work in the vineyard she wont mind his being so short i dare say hes honestat least im sure i hope he is  i should think hes honest at any rate or he wouldnt be what he is  theres some of them are so very fond of moneythat is if all that we hear is true perhaps he maynt care about it let us hope that he doesnt but if so hes a great exception however she means to have it tied up as close as possible and i think shes right where would she be if he was to go away some fine morning and leave her you see hes got nobody belonging to him i own i do like people who have got people belonging to them you feel sure in a sort of way that theyll go on living in their own houses  rachel immediately reflected that luke rowan had people belonging to himvery nice peopleand that everybody knew who he was and from whence he came  but she has quite made up her mind about it continued mrs ray and when i saw that i didnt say very much against it what was the use it isnt as though he wasnt quite respectable he is a clergyman you know my dear though he never was at any of the regular colleges and he might be a bishop just as much as if he had been so they tell me and i really dont think that she would ever have come back to the cottagenot unless you had promised to have been ruled by her in everything  i certainly shouldnt have done that and rachel as she made this assurance with some little obstinacy in her voice told herself that for the future she meant to be ruled by a very different person indeed  no i suppose not and im sure i shouldnt have asked you because i think it isnt the thing dragging people away out of their own parishes here and there to anybodys church and i told her that though i would of course go and hear mr prong now and then if she married him i wouldnt leave mr comfort not as a regular thing but she didnt seem to mind that now much as she used always to be saying about it  and when is it to be mamma  on friday that is tomorrow  tomorrow  that is shes to go and tell him tomorrow that she means to take himor hes to come to her at miss puckers lodgings its not to be wondered at when one sees miss pucker really and im not sure id not have done the same if id been living with her too only i dont think i ever should have begun i think its living with miss pucker has made her do it i do indeed my dear well now that i have told you i suppose i may as well go and get ready for dinner  ill come with you mamma the potatoes are strained and kitty can put the things on the table mammaand now they were on the stairsive got something to tell also  well leave mrs ray to eat her dinner and rachel to tell her story merely adding a word to say that the mother did not stint the measure of her praise or refuse her child the happiness of her sympathy that evening was probably the happiest of rachels existence although its full proportions of joy were marred by an unforeseen occurrence at four oclock a note came from rowan to his dearest rachel saying that he had been called away by telegraph to london about that horrid brewery business he would write from there but rachel was almost as happy without him talking about him as she would have been in his presence listening to him     chapter xv  maternal eloquence   on the friday morning there was a solemn conference at the brewery between mrs tappitt and mrs rowan mrs rowan found herself to be in some difficulty as to the line of action which she ought to take and the alliances which she ought to form she was passionately attached to her son and for mrs tappitt she had no strong liking but then she was very averse to this proposed marriage with rachel ray and was willing for a while to make a treaty with mrs tappitt offensive and defensive as against her own son if by doing so she could put a stop to so outrageous a proceeding on his part he had seen her before he started for london and had told her both the occurrences of the day he had described to her how tappitt had turned him out of the brewery poker in hand and how in consequence of tappitts pigheaded obstinacy it was now necessary that their joint affairs should be set right by the hand of the law he had then told her also that there was no longer any room for doubt or argument between them as regarding rachel he had gone out to braggs end that morning had made his offer and had been accepted his mother therefore would seeso he surmisedthat as any opposition on her part must now be futile she might as well take rachel to her heart at once he went so far as to propose to her that she should go over to rachel in his absenceit would be very gracious if you could do it tomorrow mother he saidand go through that little process of taking her future daughterinlaw to her heart but in answer to this mrs rowan said very little she said very little but she looked much my dear i cannot move so quick as you do i am older i am afraid however that you have been rash he said something as on such occasions young men do as to his privilege of choosing for himself as to his knowing what wife would suit him as to his contempt for money and as to the factthe undoubted fact as he declared itand in that declaration i am prepared to go handinhand with himthat rachel ray was a lady but he was clearheaded enough to perceive that his mother did not intend to agree with him when we are married she will come round he said to himself and then he took himself off by the night mail train to london  under these circumstances mrs rowan felt that her only chance of carrying on the battle would be by means of a treaty with mrs tappitt had the affair of the brewery stood alone mrs rowan would have ranged herself loyally on the side of her son she would have resented the uplifting of that poker and shown her resentment by an immediate withdrawal from the brewery she would have said a word or twoa stately word or twoas to the justice of her sons cause and have carried herself and her daughter off to the inn as things were now her visit to the brewery must no doubt be curtailed in its duration but in the mean time might not a blow be struck against that foolish matrimonial projectan opportune blow and by the aid of mrs tappitt therefore on that friday morning when mr prong was listening with enraptured ears to mrs primes acceptance of his suitunder certain pecuniary conditionsmrs rowan and mrs tappitt were sitting in conference at the brewery  they agreed together at that meeting that rachel ray was the head and front of the whole offence the source of all the evil done and to be done and the one great sinner in the matter it was clear to mrs rowan that rachel could have no just pretensions to look for such a lover or such a husband as her son and it was equally clear to mrs tappitt that she could have had no right to seek a lover or a husband out of the brewery if rachel ray had not been there all might have gone smoothly for both of them mrs tappitt did not perhaps argue very logically as to the brewery business or attempt to show either to herself or to her ally that luke rowan would have made himself an agreeable partner if he had kept himself free from all love vagaries but she was filled with an indefinite womans idea that the mischief which she felt had been done by rachel ray and that against rachel and rachels pretensions her hand should be turned  they resolved therefore that they would go out together and call at the cottage mrs tappitt knew from long neighbourhood of what stuff mrs ray was made a very good sort of woman she said to mrs rowan and not at all headstrong and perverse like her daughter if we find the young lady there we must ask her mamma to see us alone to this proposition mrs rowan assented not eagerly but with a slow measured dignified assent feeling that she was derogating somewhat from her own position in allowing herself to be led by such a one as mrs tappitt it was needful that on this occasion she should act with mrs tappitt and connect herself with the tappitt interests but all this she did with an air that distinctly claimed for herself a personal superiority if mrs tappitt did not perceive and understand this it was her fault and not mrs rowans  at two oclock they stepped into a fly at the brewery door and had themselves driven out to braggs end  mamma theres a carriage said rachel  it cant be coming here said mrs ray  but it is its the fly from the dragon i know it by the mans white hat and oh dear theres mrs rowan and mrs tappitt mamma i shall go away and rachel without another word escaped out into the garden she escaped utterly heedless of her mothers little weak prayer that she would remain she went away quickly so that not a skirt of her dress might be visible she felt instantly by instinct that these two women had come out there especially as her enemies as upsetters of her happiness as opponents of her one great hope in life and she knew that she could not fight her battle with them face to face she could not herself maintain her love stoutly and declare her intention of keeping her lover to his word and yet she did intend to maintain her love not doubting that he would be true to his word without any effort on her part her mother would make a very poor fightof that she was quite well aware it would have been well if her mother could have run away also but as that could not be her mother must be left to succumb and the fight must be carried on afterwards as best it might the two ladies remained at the cottage for about an hour and during that time rachel was sequestered in the garden hardening her heart against all enemies to her love if luke would only stand by her she would certainly stand by him  there was a good deal of ceremony between the three ladies when they first found themselves together in mrs rays parlour mrs rowan and mrs tappitt were large and stiff in their draperies and did not fit themselves easily in among mrs rays small belongings and they were stately in their demeanour conscious that they were visiting an inferior and conscious also that they were there on no friendly mission but the interview was commenced with a show of much civility mrs tappitt introduced mrs rowan in due form and mrs rowan made her little bow if with some selfasserting supremacy still with fitting courtesy mrs ray hoped that mrs tappitt and the young ladies were quite well and then there was a short silence very oppressive to mrs ray but refreshing rather than otherwise to mrs rowan it gave a proper business aspect to the visit and paved the way for serious words  miss rachel is out i suppose said mrs tappitt  yes she is out said mrs ray but shes about the place somewhere if you want to see her this she added in her weakness not knowing how she was to sustain the weight of such an interview alone  perhaps it is as well that she should be away just at present said mrs rowan firmly but mildly  quite as well said mrs tappitt as firmly but less mildly  because we wish to say a few words to you mrs ray said mrs rowan  that is what has brought us out so early said mrs tappitt it was only halfpast two now and company visiting was never done at baslehurst till after three we want to say a few words to you mrs ray about a very serious matter im sure you know how glad ive always been to see rachel with my girls and i had her at our party the other night you know it isnt likely therefore that i should be disposed to say anything unkind about her  at any rate not to me i hope said mrs ray  not to anybody indeed im not given to say unkind things about people no one in baslehurst would give me that character but the fact is mrs ray  perhaps mrs tappitt youll allow me said mrs rowan hes my son  oh yes certainlythat is if you wish it said mrs tappitt drawing herself up in her chair but i thought that perhaps as i knew miss ray so well  if you dont mind mrs tappitt and mrs rowan as she again took the words out of her friends mouth smiled upon her with a smile of great efficacy  oh dear certainly not said mrs tappitt acknowledging by her concession the superiority of mrs rowans nature  i believe you are aware mrs ray said mrs rowan that mr luke rowan is my son  yes im aware of that  and im afraid you must be aware also that there have been somesomesome talkings as it were between him and your daughter  oh yes the truth is maam that he has offered himself to my girl and that she has accepted him whether its for good or for bad the open truth is the best mrs tappitt  truth is truth said mrs tappitt and deception is not truth  i didnt think it had gone anything so far as that said mrs rowanwho at the moment perhaps forgot that deception is not truth and in saying that he has actually offered himself you may perhapswithout meaning it of coursebe attributing a more positive significance to his word than he has intended  god forbid said mrs ray very solemnly that would be a very sad thing for my poor girl but i think mrs rowan you had better ask him if he says he didnt intend it of course there will be an end of it as far as rachel is concerned  i cant ask him just at present said mrs rowan because he has gone up to london he went away yesterday afternoon and theres no saying when he may be in baslehurst again  if ever said mrs tappitt very solemnly perhaps he has not told you mrs ray that that partnership between him and mr t is all over  he did tell us that there had been words between him and mr tappitt  words indeed said mrs tappitt  and therefore it isnt so easy to ask him said mrs rowan ignoring mrs tappitt and the partnership but of course mrs ray our object in this matter must be the same we both wish to see our children happy and respectable mrs rowan as she said this put great emphasis on the last word  as to my girl ive no fear whatever but what shell be respectable said mrs ray with more heat than mrs tappitt had thought her to possess  no doubt no doubt but what im coming to is this mrs ray here has this boy of mine been behaving foolishly to your daughter as young men will do it may be that he has really said something to her of the kind you suppose  said something to her why maam he came out here and asked my permission to pay his addresses to her which i didnt answer because just at that moment rachel came in from farmer sturts opposite  farmer sturts said mrs tappitt to mrs rowan in an under voice and nodding her head whereupon mrs rowan nodded her head also one of the great accusations made against mrs ray had been that she lived on the farmer sturt level and not on the tappitt levelmuch less on the rowan level  yesfrom farmer sturts continued mrs ray not at all understanding this byplay so i didnt give him any answer at all  you wouldnt encourage him said mrs rowan  i dont know about that but at any rate he encouraged himself for he came again the next morning when i was in baslehurst  i hope miss rachel didnt know he was coming in your absence said mrs rowan  it would look so slywouldnt it said mrs tappitt  no she didnt and she isnt sly at all if she had known anything she would have told me i know what my girl is mrs rowan and i can depend on her mrs rays courage was up and she was inclined to fight bravely but she was sadly impeded by tears which she now found it impossible to control  im sure it isnt my wish to distress you said mrs rowan  it does distress me very much then for anybody to say that rachel is sly  i said i hoped she wasnt sly said mrs tappitt  i heard what you said continued mrs ray and i dont see why you should be speaking against rachel in that way the young man isnt your son  no said mrs tappitt indeed hes notnor yet he aint mr tappitts partner  nor wishes to be said mrs rowan with a toss of her head it was a thousand pities that mrs ray had not her wits enough about her to have fanned into a fire of battle the embers which glowed hot between her two enemies had she done so they might probably have been made to consume each otherto her great comfort nor wishes to be then mrs rowan paused a moment and mrs tappitt assumed a smile which was intended to indicate incredulity but mrs ray continued mrs rowan that is neither here nor there luke rowan is my son and i certainly have a right to speak such a marriage as this would be very imprudent on his part and very disagreeable to me from the way in which things have turned out its not likely that hell settle himself at baslehurst  the most unlikely thing in the world said mrs tappitt i dont suppose hell ever show himself in baslehurst again  as for showing himself mrs tappitt my son will never be ashamed of showing himself anywhere  but he wont have any call to come to baslehurst mrs rowan thats what i mean  if hes a gentleman of his word as i take him to be said mrs ray hell have a great call to show himself he never can have intended to come out here and speak to her in that way and ask her to marry him and then never to come back and see her any more i wouldnt believe it of him not though his own mother said it  i dont say anything said mrs rowan who felt that her position was one of some difficulty but we all do know that in affairs of that kind young men do allow themselves to go great lengths and the greater lengths they go mrs ray the more particular the young ladies ought to be  but whats a young lady to do hows she to know whether a young man is in earnest or whether hes only going lengths as you call it mrs rays eyes were still moist with tears and i grieve to say that though as far as immediate words are concerned she was fighting rachels battle not badly still the blows of the enemy were taking effect upon her she was beginning to wish that luke rowan had never been seen or his name heard at braggs end  i think its quite understood in the world said mrs rowan that a young lady is not to take a gentleman at his first word  oh quite said mrs tappitt  weve all of us daughters said mrs rowan  yes all of us said mrs tappitt thats what makes it so fitting that we should discuss this matter together in a friendly feeling  my son is a very good young mana very good young man indeed  but a little hasty perhaps said mrs tappitt  if youll allow me mrs tappitt  oh certainly mrs rowan  a very good young man indeed and i dont think it at all probable that in such a matter as this he will act in opposition to his mothers wishes he has his way to make in the world  which will never be in the brewery line said mrs tappitt  he has his way to make in the world continued mrs rowan with much severity and if he marries in four or five years time that will be quite as soon as he ought to think of doing im sure you will agree with me mrs ray that long engagements are very bad particularly for the lady  he wanted to be married next month said mrs ray  ah yes that shows that the whole thing couldnt come to much if there was an engagement at all it must be a very long one years must roll by from the artistic manner in which mrs rowan allowed her voice to dwell upon the words which signified duration of space any hope of a marriage between luke and rachel seemed to be put off at any rate to some future century years must roll by and we all know what that means the lady dies of a broken heart while the gentleman lives in a bachelors rooms and dines always at his club nobody can wish such a state of things as that mrs ray  i knew a girl who was engaged for seven years said mrs tappitt and she wore herself to a threadpaperso she did and then he married his housekeeper after all  id sooner see my girl make up her mind to be an old maid than let her have a long engagement said mrs rowan  and so would i my girls all three if anybody comes i say to them let your papa see them hell know whats the meaning of it it dont do for young girls to manage those things all themselves not but what i think my girls have almost as much wit about them as i have i wont mention any names but theres a young man about here as welltodo as any young man in the south hams but cherry wont as much as look at him mrs rowan again tossed her head she felt her misfortune in being burthened with such a colleague as mrs tappitt  what is it you want me to do mrs rowan asked mrs ray  i want you and your daughter who i am sure is a very nice young lady and goodlooking too  oh quite so said mrs tappitt  i want you both to understand that this little thing should be allowed to drop if my boy has done anything foolish im here to apologize for him he isnt the first that has been foolish and im afraid he wont be the last but it cant be believed mrs ray that marriages should be run up in this thoughtless sort of way in the first place the young people dont know anything of each other absolutely nothing at all and thenbut im sure i dont want to insist on any differences that there may be in their positions in life only you must be aware of this mrs ray that such a marriage as that would be very injurious to a young man like my son luke  my child wouldnt wish to injure anybody  and therefore of course she wont think any more about it all i want from you is that you should promise me that  if rachel will only just say that said mrs tappitt my daughters will be as happy to see her out walking with them as ever  rachel has had quite enough of such walking mrs tappitt quite enough  if harm has come of it it hasnt been the fault of my girls said mrs tappitt  then there was a pause among the three ladies and it appeared that mrs rowan was waiting for mrs rays answer but mrs ray did not know what answer she should make she was already disposed to regard the coming of luke rowan to baslehurst as a curse rather than a blessing she felt all but convinced that fate would be against her and hers in that matter she had ever been afraid of young men believing them to be dangerous bringers of trouble into families roaring lions sometimes and often wolves in sheeps clothing since she had first heard of luke rowan in connection with her daughter she had been trembling if she could have acted in accordance with her own feelings at this moment she would have begged that luke rowans name might never again be mentioned in her presence it would be better for them she thought to bear what had already come upon them than to run further risk but she could not give any answer to mrs rowan without consulting rachelshe could not at least give any such answer as that contemplated without doing so she had sanctioned rachels love and could not now undertake to oppose it rachel had probably been deceived and must bear her misfortune but as the question stood at present between her and her daughter she could not at once accede to mrs rowans views in the matter i will talk to rachel she said  give her my kindest respects said mrs rowan and pray make her understand that i wouldnt interfere if i didnt think it was for both their advantages goodbye mrs ray and mrs rowan got up  goodbye mrs ray said mrs tappitt putting out her hand give my love to rachel i hope that we shall be good friends yet for all that has come and gone  but mrs ray would not accept mrs tappitts hand nor would she vouchsafe any answer to mrs tappitts amenities goodbye maam she said to mrs rowan i suppose you mean to do the best you can by your own child  and by yours too said mrs rowan  if so i can only say that you must think very badly of your own son goodbye maam then mrs ray curtseyed them outnot without a certain amount of dignity although her eyes were red with tears and her whole body trembling with dismay  very little was said in the fly between the two ladies on their way back to the brewery nor did mrs rowan remain very long as a visitor at mrs tappitts house she had found herself compelled by circumstances to take a part inimical to mrs ray but she felt in her heart a much stronger animosity to mrs tappitt with mrs ray she could have been very friendly only for that disastrous love affair but with mrs tappitt she could not again put herself into pleasant relations i must point out how sadly unfortunate it was that mrs ray had not known how to fan that flame of anger to her own and her daughters advantage  well mamma said rachel returning to the room as soon as she heard the wheels of the fly in motion upon the road across the green she found her mother in tearshardly able to speak because of her sobs never mind it mamma of course i know the kind of things they have been saying it was what i expected never mind it  but my dear you will be brokenhearted  brokenhearted why  i know you will now that you have learned to love him youll never bear to lose him  and must i lose him  she says so she says that he doesnt mean it and that its all nonsense  i dont believe her nothing shall make me believe that mamma  she says it would be ruinous to all his prospects especially just now when he has quarrelled about this brewery  ruinous to him  his mother says so  i will never wish him to do anything that shall be ruinous to himself nevernot though i were brokenhearted as you call it  ah that is it rachel my darling i wish he had not come here  rachel went away across the room and looked out of the window upon the green there she stood in silence for a few minutes while her mother was wiping her eyes and suppressing her sobs tears also had run down rachels cheeks but they were silent tears few in number and very salt i cannot bring myself to wish that yet said she  but he has gone away and what can you do if he does not come again  do oh i can do nothing i could do nothing even though he were here in baslehurst every day of his life if i once thought that he didnt wish metobehis wife i should not want to do anything but mamma i cant believe it of him it was only yesterday that he was here  they say that young men dont care what they say in that way nowadays  i dont believe it of him mamma his manner is so steadfast and his voice sounds so true  but then she is so terribly against it  then again they were silent for a while after which rachel ended the conversation it is clear at any rate that you and i can do nothing mamma if she expects me to say that i will give him up she is mistaken give him up i couldnt give him up without being false to him i dont think ill ever be false to him if hes false to me thenthen i must bear it mamma dont say anything to dolly about this just at present in answer to which request mrs ray promised that she would not at present say anything to mrs prime about mrs rowans visit  the following day and the sunday were not passed in much happiness by the two ladies at braggs end tidings reached them that mrs rowan and her daughter were going to london on the monday but no letter came to them from luke by the monday morning mrs ray had quite made up her mind that luke rowan was lost to them for ever and rachel had already become worn with care during that saturday and sunday nothing was

daughter had left baslehurst and had followed luke up to london she came out and sat with her mother and sister for about an hour restraining herself with much discretion from the saying of disagreeable things about her sisters lover she had heard that the rowans had gone away and she had also heard that it was probable that they would be no more seen in baslehurst mr prong had given it as his opinion that luke would not trouble them again by his personal appearance among them under these circumstances mrs prime had thought that she might spare her sister nor had she said much about her own love affairs she had never mentioned mr prongs offer in rachels presence nor did she do so now as long as rachel remained in the room the conversation was very innocent and very uninteresting for a few minutes the two widows were alone together and then mrs prime gave her mother to understand that things were not yet quite arranged between herself and mr prong  you see mother said mrs prime as this money has been committed to my charge i do not think it can be right to let it go altogether out of my own hands  in answer to this mrs ray had uttered a word or two agreeing with her daughter she was afraid to say much against mr prongwas afraid indeed to express any very strong opinion about this proposed marriage but in her heart she would have been delighted to hear that the prong alliance was to be abandoned there was nothing in mr prong to recommend him to mrs ray  and is she going to marry him rachel asked as soon as her sister was gone  theres nothing settled as yet dorothea wants to keep her money in her own hands  i dont think that can be right if a woman is married the money should belong to the husband  i suppose thats what mr prong thinksat any rate theres nothing settled it seems to me that we know so little about him he might go away any day to australia you know  and did she say anything aboutmr rowan  not a word my dear  and that was all that was then said about luke even between rachel and her mother how could they speak about him mrs ray also believed that he would be no more seen in baslehurst and rachel was well aware that such was her mothers belief although it had never been expressed what could be said between them nowor ever afterwardsunless indeed rowan should take some steps to make it necessary that his doings should be discussed  the tuesday passed and the wednesday without any sign from the young man and during these two sad days nothing was said at the cottage on that wednesday his name was absolutely not mentioned between them although each of them was thinking of him throughout the day mrs ray had now become almost sure that he had obeyed his mothers behests and had resolved not to trouble himself about rachel any further and rachel herself had become frightened if not despondent could it be that all this should have passed over her and that it should mean nothingthat the man should have been standing there only three or four days since in that very room with his arm round her waist begging for her love and calling her his wifeand that all of it should have no meaning nothing amazed her so much as her mothers firm belief in such an ending to such an affair what must be her mothers thoughts about men and women in general if she could expect such conduct from luke rowanand yet not think of him as one whose falsehood was marvellous in its falseness  but on the thursday morning there came a letter from luke addressed to rachel on that morning mrs ray was up when the postman passed by the cottage and though rachel took the letter from the mans hand herself she did not open it till she had shown it to her mother  of course its from him said rachel  i suppose so said mrs ray taking the unopened letter in her hand and looking at it she spoke almost in a whisper as though there were something terrible in the coming of the letter  is it not odd said rachel but i never saw his handwriting before i shall know it now for ever and ever she also spoke in a whisper and still held the letter as though she dreaded to open it  well my dear said mrs ray  if you think you ought to read it first mamma you may  no rachel it is your letter i do not wish you to imagine that i distrust you  then rachel sat herself down and with extreme care opened the envelope the letter which she read to herself very slowly was as follows      my own dearest rachel     it seems so nice having to write to you though it would    be much nicer if i could see you and be sitting with you    at this moment at the churchyard stile that is the spot    in all baslehurst that i like the best i ought to have    written sooner i know and you will have been very angry    with me but i have had to go down into northamptonshire    to settle some affairs as to my fathers property so that    i have been almost living in railway carriages ever since    i saw you i am resolved about the brewery business more    firmly than ever and as it seems that t  mrs tappitt would occasionally so designate her lord and her doing so had been a joke between luke and rachel     will not come to reason without a lawsuit i must scrape    together all the capital i have or i shall be fifty years    old before i can begin he is a pigheaded old fool and    i shall be driven to ruin him and all his family i would    have doneand still would doanything for him in    kindness but if he drives me to go to law to get what    is as much my own as his share is his own i will build    another brewery just under his nose all this will require    money and therefore i have to run about and get my    affairs settled     but this is a nice loveletteris it not however you    must take me as i am just now i have beer in my very    soul the grand object of my ambition is to stand and    be fumigated by the smoke of my own vats it is a fat    prosperous moneymaking business and one in which there    is a clear line between right and wrong no man brews bad    beer without knowing itor sells short measure whether    the fatness and the honesty can go togetherthat is the    problem i want to solve     you see i write to you exactly as if you were a man    friend and not my own dear sweet girl but i am a very    bad hand at lovemaking i considered that that was all    done when you nodded your head over my arm in token that    you consented to be my wife it was a very little nod but    it binds you as fast as a score of oaths and now i think    i have a right to talk to you about all my affairs and    expect you at once to get up the price of malt and hops in    devonshire i told you you remember that you should be    my friend and now i mean to have my own way     you must tell me exactly what my mother has been doing and    saying at the cottage i cannot quite make it out from    what she says but i fear that she has been interfering    where she had no business and making a goose of herself    she has got an idea into her head that i ought to make a    good bargain in matrimony and sell myself at the highest    price going in the marketthat i ought to get money    or if not money family connexion im very fond of    moneyas is everybody only people are such liarsbut    then i like it to be my own and as to what people call    connexion i have no words to tell you how i despise it    if i know myself i should never have chosen a woman as my    companion for life who was not a lady but i have not the    remotest wish to become second cousin by marriage to a    baronets grandmother i have told my mother all this and    that you and i have settled the matter together but i see    that she trusts to something that she has said or done    herself to upset our settling of course what she has    said can have no effect on you she has a right to speak    to me but she has none to speak to younot as yet but    she is the best woman in the world and as soon as ever we    are married you will find that she will receive you with    open arms     you know i spoke of our being married in august i wish it    could have been so if we could have settled it when i was    at braggs end it might have been done i dont however    mean to scold you though it was your fault but as it is    it must now be put off till after christmas i wont name    a day yet for seeing you because i couldnt well go to    baslehurst without putting myself into tappitts way my    lawyer says i had better not go to baslehurst just at    present of course you will write to me constantlyto    my address here say twice a week at least and i shall    expect you to tell me everything that goes on give my    kind love to your mother     yours dearest rachel    most affectionately     luke rowan   the letter was not quite what rachel had expected but nevertheless she thought it very nice she had never received a loveletter before and probably had never read oneeven in print so that she was in possession of no strong preconceived notions as to the nature or requisite contents of such a document she was a little shocked when luke called his mother a gooseshe was a little startled when he said that people were liars having an idea that the word was one not to be lightly usedshe was amused by the allusion to the baronets grandmother feeling however that the manner and language of his letter was less pretty and loveladen than she had expectedand she was frightened when he so confidently called upon her to write to him twice a week but nevertheless the letter was a genial one joyous and upon the whole comforting she read it very slowly going back over much of it twice and thrice so that her mother became impatient before the perusal was finished  it seems to be very long said mrs ray  yes mamma it is long its nearly four sides  what can he have to say so much  theres a good deal of it is about his own private affairs  i suppose then i mustnt see it  oh yes mamma and rachel handed her the letter i shouldnt think of having a letter from him and not showing it to younot as things are now then mrs ray took the letter and spent quite as much time in reading it as rachel had done he writes as though he meant to have everything quite his own way said mrs ray  thats what he does mean i think he will do that always hes what people call imperious but that isnt bad in a man is it  mrs ray did not quite know whether it was bad in a man or no but she mistrusted the letter not construing it closely so as to discover what might really be its full meaning but perceiving that the young man took or intended to take very much into his own hands that he demanded that everything should be surrendered to his will and pleasure without any guarantee on his part that such surrendering should be properly acknowledged mrs ray was disposed to doubt people and things that were at a distance from her some check could be kept over a lover at baslehurst or if perchance the lover had removed himself only to exeter with which city mrs ray was personally acquainted she could have believed in his return he would not in that case have gone utterly beyond her ken but she could put no confidence in a lover up in london who could say that he might not marry some one else tomorrowthat he might not be promising to marry half a dozen it was with her the same sort of feeling which made her think it possible that mr prong might go to australia she would have liked as a lover for her daughter a young man fixed in businessif not at baslehurst then at totnes dartmouth or brixhamunder her own eye as it werea young man so fixed that all the world of south devonshire would know of all his doings such a young man when he asked a girl to marry him must mean what he said if he did not there would be no escape for him from the punishment of his neighbours eyes and tongues but a young man up in londona young man who had quarrelled with his natural friends in baslehursta young man who was confessedly masterful and impetuousa young man who called his own mother a goose and all the rest of the world liars in his first letter to his ladylovewas that a young man in whom mrs ray could place confidence as a lover for her pet lamb she read the letter very slowly and then as she gave it back to rachel she groaned  for nearly half an hour after that nothing was said in the cottage about the letter rachel had perceived that it had not been thought satisfactory by her mother but then she was inclined to believe that her mother would have regarded no letter as satisfactory until arguments had been used to prove to her that it was so this at any rate was clearmust be clear to mrs ray as it was clear to rachelthat luke had no intention of shirking the fulfilment of his engagement and after all was not that the one thing as to which it was essentially necessary that they should be confident had she not accepted luke telling him that she loved him and was it not acknowledged by all around her that such a marriage would be good for her the danger which they feared was the expectation of such a marriage without its accomplishment even the forebodings of mrs prime had shown that this was the evil to which they pointed under these circumstances what better could be wished for than a ready quick warm assurance on lukes part that he did intend all that he had said  with rachel now as with all girls under such circumstances the chief immediate consideration was as to the answer which should be given was she to write to him to write what she pleased and might she write at once she felt that she longed to have the pen in her hand and that yet when holding it she would have to think for hours before writing the first word mamma she said at last dont you think its a good letter  i dont know what to think my dear i doubt whether any letters of that sort are good for much  of what sort mamma  letters from men who call themselves lovers to young girls it would be safer i think that there shouldnt be anyvery much safer  but if he hadnt written we should have thought that he had forgotten all about us that would not have been good you said yourself that if he did not write soon there would be an end of everything  a hundred years ago there wasnt all this writing between young people and these things were managed better then than they are now as far as i can understand  people couldnt write so much then said rachel because there were no railways and no postage stamps i suppose i must answer it mamma to this proposition mrs ray made no immediate answer dont you think i ought to answer it mamma  you cant want to write at once  in the afternoon would do  in the afternoon why should you be in so much hurry rachel it took him four or five days to write to you  yes but he was down in northamptonshire on business besides he hadnt any letter from me to answer i shouldnt like him to think  to think what rachel  that i had forgotten him  psha  or that i didnt treat his letter with respect  he wont think that but i must turn it over in my mind and i believe i ought to ask somebody  not dolly said rachel eagerly  no not your sister i will not ask her but if you dont mind my dear ill take the young mans letter out to mr comfort and consult him i never felt myself so much in need of somebody to advise me mr comfort is an old man and you wont mind his seeing the letter  rachel did mind it very much but she had no means of saving herself from her fate she did not like the idea of having her loveletter submitted to the clergyman of the parish i do not know any young lady who would have liked it but bad as that was it was preferable to having the letter submitted to mrs prime and then she remembered that mr comfort had advised that she might go to the ball and that he was father to her friend mrs butler cornbury     chapter ii  electioneering   and now in these daysthe days immediately following the departure of luke rowan from baslehurstthe tappitt family were constrained to work very hard at the task of defaming the young man who had lately been living with them in their house they were constrained to do this by the necessities of their position and in doing so by no means showed themselves to be such monsters of iniquity as the readers of the story will feel themselves inclined to call them as for tappitt himself he certainly believed that rowan was so base a scoundrel that no evil words against him could be considered as malicious or even unnecessary is it not good to denounce a scoundrel and if the rascality of any rascal be specially directed against oneself and ones own wife and children is it not a duty to denounce that rascal so that his rascality may be known and thus made of no effect when tappitt declared in the readingroom at the dragon and afterwards in the little room inside the bar at the kings head and again to a circle of respectable farmers and tradesmen in the corn market that young rowan had come down to the brewery and made his way into the breweryhouse with a ready prepared plan for ruining himhim the head of the firmhe thought that he was telling the truth and again when he spoke with horror of rowans intention of setting up an opposition brewery his horror was conscientious he believed that it would be very wicked in a man to oppose the bungall establishment with money left by bungallthat it would be a wickedness than which no commercial rascality could be more iniquitous his very soul was struck with awe at the idea that anything was due in the matter to the consumer of beer never occurred to him and it may also be said in tappitts favour that his opinionas a general opinionwas backed by those around him his neighbours could not be made to hate rowan as he hated him they would not declare the young man to be the very mischief as he did but that idea of a rival brewery was distasteful to them all most of them knew that the beer was almost too bad to be swallowed but they thought that tappitt had a vested interest in the manufacture of bad beerthat as a manufacturer of bad beer he was a fairly honest and useful manand they looked upon any change as the work or rather the suggestion of a charlatan  this isnt staffordshire they said if you want beer like that you can buy it in bottles at griggs  hell soon find where hell be if he tries to undersell me said young griggs all the same i hope hell come back because he has left a little bill at our place  and then to other evil reports was added that special evil reportthat rowan had gone away without paying his debts i am inclined to think that mr tappitt can be almost justified in his evil thoughts and his evil words  i cannot make out quite so good a case for mrs tappitt and her two elder daughtersfor even martha martha the just shook her head in these days when rowans name was mentionedbut something may be said even for them it must not be supposed that mrs tappitts single grievance was her disappointment as regarded augusta had there been no augusta on whose behalf a hope had been possible the predilection of the young moneyed stranger for such a girl as rachel ray would have been a grievance to such a woman as mrs tappitt had she not been looking down on rachel ray and despising her for the last ten years had she not been wondering among her friends with charitable volubility as to what that poor woman at braggs end was to do with her daughter had she not been regretting that the young girl should be growing up so big and promising to look so coarse was it not natural that she should be miserable when she saw her taken in hand by mrs butler cornbury and made the heroine at her own party to the detriment of her own daughters by the fashionable lady in catching whom she had displayed so much unfortunate ingenuity under such circumstances how could she do other than hate luke rowanthan believe him to be the very mischiefthan prophesying all manner of bad things for racheland assist her husband tooth and nail in his animosity against the sinner  augusta was less strong in her feelings than her parents but of course she disliked the man who could admire rachel ray as regards martha her dislike to himor rather her judicial disapprovalwas founded on his social and commercial improprieties she understood that he had threatened her father about the businessand she had been scandalized in that matter of the champagne cherry was very brave and still stood up for him before her mother and sistersbut even cherry did not dare to say a word in his favour before her father mr tappitt had been driven to forget himself and to take a poker in his hand as a weapon of violence after that let no one speak a word on the offenders behalf in tappitts house and within tappitts hearing  in that affair of the champagne rowan was most bitterly injured he had ordered it if not at the request at least at the instigation of mrs tappittand he had paid for it when he left baslehurst he owed no shilling to any man in it and indeed he was a man by no means given to owing money to any one he was of a spirit masterful selfconfident and perhaps selfgloriousbut he was at the same time honest and independent that wine had been ordered in some unusual waynot at the regular counter and in the same way the bill for it had been paid griggs when he made his assertion in the barroom at the kings head had stated what he believed to be the truth the next morning he chanced to hear that the account had been settled but not at the moment duly marked off the books as far as griggs went that was the end of it he did not again say that rowan owed money to him but he never contradicted his former assertion and allowed the general report to go onthat report which had been founded on his own first statement thus before rowan had been a week out of the place it was believed all over the town that he had left unpaid bills behind him  i am told that young man is dreadfully in debt said mr prong to mrs prime at this time mr prong and mrs prime saw each other daily and were affectionate in their intercoursewith a serious solemn affection but affairs were by no means settled between them that affection was however strong enough to induce mr prong to take a decided part in opposing the rowan alliance they say he owes money all over the town  so miss pucker tells me said mrs prime  does your mother know it  mother never knows anything that other people know but he has gone now and i dont suppose we shall hear of him or see him again  he has not written to her dorothea  not that i know of  you should find out you should not leave them in this danger your mother is weak and you should give her the aid of your strength the girl is your sister and you should not leave her to grope in darkness you should remember dorothea that you have a duty in this matter  dorothea did not like being told of her duty in so pastoral a manner and resolved to be more than ever particular in the protection of her own pecuniary rights before she submitted herself to mr prongs marital authority once and for ever by miss pucker she was at any rate treated with great respect and was allowed perhaps some display of pastoral manner on her own part it began to be with her a matter of doubt whether she might not be of more use in that free vineyard which she was about to leave than in that vineyard with closed doors and a pastoral overseer which she was preparing herself to enter at any rate she would be careful about the money but in the mean time she did agree with mr prong that rowans proper character should be made known to her mother and with this view she went out to the cottage and whispered into mrs rays astonished ears the fact that luke was terribly in debt  you dont say so  but i do say so mother everybody in baslehurst is talking about it and they all say that he has treated mr tappitt shamefully has anything come from him since he went  then mrs ray told her elder daughter of the letter and told her also that she intended to consult mr comfort oh mr comfort said mrs prime signifying her opinion that her mother was going to a very poor counsellor and what sort of a letter was it said mrs prime with a not unnatural desire to see it  it was an honest letter enoughvery honest to my thinking and speaking as though everything between them was quite settled  thats nonsense mother  perhaps it may be nonsense dorothea but i am only telling you what the letter said he called his mother a goose that was the worst thing in it  you cannot expect that such a one as he should honour his parents  but his mother thinks him the finest young man in the world and i must say this for him that he has always spoken of her as though he loved her very dearly and i believe he has been a most excellent son he shouldnt have said gooseat any rate in a letternot to my way of thinking but perhaps they dont mind those things up in london  i never knew a young man so badly spoken of at a place hed left as he is in baslehurst i think it right to tell you but if you have made up your mind to ask mr comfort  yes i have made up my mind to ask mr comfort he has sent to say he will call the day after tomorrow then mrs prime went back home having seen neither the letter nor her sister  it may be remembered that an election was impending over the town of baslehurst the coming necessities of which had induced mrs butler cornbury to grace mrs tappitts ball it was now nearly the end of july and the election was to be made early in september both candidates were already in the field and the politicians of the neighbourhood already knew to a nicety how the affair would go mr hart the great clothier from houndsditch and regent streetmessrs hart and jacobs of from 110 to 136 houndsditch and about as many more numbers in regent streetwould come in at the top of the poll with 173 votes and butler cornbury whose forefathers had lived in the neighbourhood for the last four hundred years and been returned for various places in devonshire to dozens of parliaments would be left in the lurch with 171 votes a petition might probably unseat the jew clothier but then as was well known the cornbury estate could not bear the expenditure of the necessary five thousand pounds for the petition in addition to the twelve hundred which the election itself was computed to cost it was all known and thoroughly understood and men in baslehurst talked about the result as though the matter were past a doubt nevertheless there were those who were ready to bet on the cornbury side of the question  but though the thing was thus accurately settled and though its termination was foreseen by so many and with so perfect a certainty still the canvassing went on in fact there were votes that had not even yet been asked much less promisedand again much less purchased the hart people were striving to frighten the cornbury people out of the field by the fear of the probable expenditure and had it not been for the good courage of mrs butler cornbury would probably have succeeded in doing so the old squire was very fidgety about the money and the young squire declared himself unwilling to lean too heavily upon his father but the lady of the household declared her conviction that there was more smoke than fire and more threats of bribery than intention of bribing she would go on she declared and as her word passed for much at cornbury grange the battle was still to be fought  among the votes which certainly had not as yet been promised was that of mr tappitt mr hart in person had called upon him but had not been quite satisfied with his reception mr tappitt was a man who thought much of his local influence and local privileges and was by no means disposed to make a promise of his vote on easy terms at a moment when his vote was becoming of so much importance he was no doubt a liberal as was also mr hart but in small towns politics become split and a man is not always bound to vote for a liberal candidate because he is a liberal himself mr hart had been confident in his tone and had not sufficiently freed himself from all outer taint of his ancient race to please mr tappitts taste hes an impudent low jew he had said to his wife as for butler cornbury he gives himself airs and is too grand even to come and ask i dont think i shall vote at all his wife had reminded him how civil to them mrs cornbury had beenthis was before the morning of the pokerbut tappitt had only sneered and declared he was not going to send a man to parliament because his wife had come to a dance  but we who know tappitt best may declare now that his vote was to have been had by any one who would have joined him energetically in abuse of luke rowan his mind was full of his grievance his heart was laden with hatred of his enemy his very soul was heavy with that sorrow honyman whom he had not yet dared to desert had again recommended submission to him submission to one of the three terms proposed let him take the thousand a year and go out from the brewery that was honymans first advice if not that then let him admit his enemy to a full partnership if that were too distasteful to be possible then let him raise ten thousand pounds on a mortgage on the whole property and buy rowan out honyman thought that the money might be raised if tappitt were willing to throw into the lump the moderate savings of his past life but in answer to either proposal tappitt only raved had mr hart known all about this he might doubtless have secured tappitts vote  butler cornbury refused to call at the brewery the mans a liberal he said to his wife and whats the use besides hes just the man i cant stand weve always hated each other  whereupon mrs b cornbury determined to call on mrs tappitt and to see tappitt himself if it were possible she had heard something of the rowan troubles but not all she had heard too of rowans liking for rachel ray having also seen something of it as we know but unfortunately for her husbands parliamentary interests she had not learned that the two things were connected together and very unfortunately also for the same interests she had taken it into her head that rachel should be married to young rowan she had conceived a liking for rachel and being by nature busy fond of employment and apt at managing other peoples affairs she had put her finger on that match as one which she would task herself to further this i say was unfortunate as regards her husbands present views her work now in hand was to secure tappitts vote and to have carried her point in that quarter her surest method would have been to have entered the brewery openmouthed against luke rowan and rachel ray  but the conversation almost at once led to a word in praise of rachel and to following words in praise of luke martha only was in the room with her mother mrs cornbury did not at once begin about the vote but made as was natural certain complimentary speeches about the ball really she didnt remember when she had seen anything better done and the young ladies looked so nice she had indeed gone away early but she had done so by no means on her own account but because rachel ray had been tired then she said a nice goodnatured genial word or two about rachel ray and her performance on that occasion it seemed to me she added that a certain young gentleman was quite smitten  then mrs tappitts brow became black as thunder and mrs cornbury knew at once that she had trodden on unsafe groundon ground which she should specially have avoided  we are all aware mrs tappitt said that the certain young gentleman behaved very badlydisgracefully i may saybut it wasnt our fault mrs cornbury  upon my word mrs tappitt i didnt see anything amiss  im afraid everybody saw it indeed everybody has been talking of it ever since as regards him what he did then was only of a piece with his general conduct which it doesnt become me to name in the language which it deserves his behaviour to mr t has been shamefulquite shameful  i had heard something but i did not know there was anything like that im so sorry i mentioned his name  he has disagreed with papa about the brewery business said martha  its more than that martha as you know very well continued mrs tappitt still speaking in her great heat he has shown himself bad in every waygiving himself airs all over the town and then going away without paying his debts  i dont think we know that mamma  everybody says so your own father heard sam griggs say with his own ears that there was a shop bill left there of i dont know how long but thats nothing to us he came here under false pretences and now hes been turned out and we dont want to have any more to do with him but mrs cornbury i am sorry about that poor foolish girl  i didnt think her poor or foolish at all said mrs cornbury who had quite heart enough to forget the vote her husband wanted in her warmth for her young friend  i must say then i didi thought her very foolish and i didnt at all like the way she went on in my house and before my girls and as for him he doesnt think of her any more than he thinks of me in the first place hes engaged to another girl  we are not quite sure that hes engaged mamma said martha  i dont know what you call being sure my dear i cant say ive ever heard it sworn to on oath but his sister mary told your sister augusta that he was i think thats pretty good evidence but mrs cornbury hes one of those that will be engaged to twenty if he can find twenty foolish enough to listen to him and for her who never was at a dance before to go on with him like thati must say that i thought it disgraceful  well mrs tappitt said mrs cornbury speaking with much authority in her voice i can only say that i didnt see it she was under my charge and if it was as you say i must be very much to blamevery much indeed  im sure i didnt mean that said mrs tappitt frightened  i dont suppose you didbut i mean it as for the young gentleman i know very little about him he may be everything that is bad  youll find that he is mrs cornbury  but as to miss ray whom ive known all my life and whose mother my father has known for all her life i cannot allow anything of the kind to be said she was under my charge and when young ladies are under my charge i keep a close eye upon themfor their own comforts sake i know how to manage for them and i always look after them on the night of your party i saw nothing in miss rays conduct that was not nice ladylike and wellbehaved i must say so and if i hear a whisper to the contrary in any quarter you may be sure that i shall say so openmouthed how dyou do mr tappitt im so glad youve come in as i specially wanted to see you then she shook hands with mr tappitt who entered the room at the moment and the look and manner of her face was altered  mrs tappitt was cowed if her husband had not come in at that moment she might have said a word or two in her own defence being driven to do so by the absence of any other mode of retreating but as he came in so opportunely she allowed his coming to cover her defeat strong as was her feeling on the subject she did not dare to continue her attack upon rachel in opposition to the defiant bravery which came full upon her from mrs cornburys eyes the words had been bad but the determined fire of those eyes had been worse mrs tappitt was cowed and allowed rachels name to pass away without further remark  mrs cornbury saw it all at a glancesaw it all and understood it the vote was probably lost but it would certainly be lost if tappitt and his wife discussed the matter before he had pledged himself the vote would probably be lost even though tappitt should in his ignorance of what had just passed pledge himself to give it all that mrs cornbury perceived and knew that she could lose nothing by an immediate request  mr tappitt said she i have come canvassing the fact is this mr cornbury says you are a liberal and that therefore he has not the face to ask you i tell him that i think you would rather support a neighbour from the county even though there may be a shade of difference in politics between you than a stranger whose trade and religion cannot possibly recommend him and whose politics if you really knew them would probably be quite as much unlike your own as are my husbands  the little speech had been prepared beforehand but was brought out quite as naturally as though mrs cornbury had been accustomed to speak on her legs for a quarter of a century  mr tappitt grunted the attack came upon him so much by surprise that he knew not what else to do but to grunt if mr cornbury had come with the same speech in his mouth and could then have sided off into some general abuse of luke rowan the vote would have been won  im sure mrs tappitt will agree with me said mrs cornbury smiling very sweetly upon the foe she had so lately vanquished  women dont know anything about it said tappitt meaning to snub no one but his own wife and forgetting that mrs cornbury was a woman he blushed fiery red when the thought flashed upon him and wished that his own drawingroom floor would open and receive him nevertheless he was often afterwards heard to boast how he had put down the politician in petticoats when she came electioneering to the brewery  well that is severe said mrs cornbury laughing  oh t you shouldnt have said that before mrs cornbury  i only meant my own wife maam i didnt indeed  ill forgive your satire if youll give me your vote said mrs cornbury with her sweetest smile he owes it me now doesnt he mrs tappitt  welli really think he do mrs tappitt in her double troublein her own defeat and her shame on behalf of her husbands rudenesswas driven back out of all her latterday conventionalities into the thoughts and even into the language of old days she was becoming afraid of mrs cornbury and submissive as of old to the rank and station of cornbury grange in her terror she was becoming a little forgetful of niceties learned somewhat late in life i really think he do said mrs tappitt  tappitt grunted again  its a very serious thing he said  so it is said mrs cornbury interrupting him she knew that her chance was gone if the man were allowed to get himself mentally upon his legs it is very serious but the fact that you are still in doubt shows that you have been thinking of it we all know how good a churchman you are and that you would not willingly send a jew to parliament  i dont know said tappitt im not for persecuting even the jewsnot when they pay their way and push themselves honourably in commerce  oh yes commerce there is nobody who has shown himself more devoted to the commercial interests than mr cornbury we buy everything in baslehurst unfortunately our people wont drink beer because of the cider  tappitt doesnt think a bit about that mrs cornbury  im afraid i shall be called upon in honour to support my party said tappitt  exactly but which is your party isnt the protestant religion of your country your party these people are creeping down into all parts of the kingdom and where shall we be if leading men like you think more of shades of difference between liberal and conservative than of the fundamental truths of the church of england would you depute a jew to get up and speak your own opinions in your own vestryroom  that you wouldnt t said mrs tappitt who was rather carried away by mrs cornburys eloquence  not in a vestry because its joined on to a church said tappitt  or would you like a jew to be mayor in baslehursta jew in the chair where you yourself were sitting only three years ago  that wouldnt be seemly because our mayor is expected to attend in church on roundabout sunday roundabout sunday so called for certain local reasons which it would be long to explain followed immediately on the day of the mayors inauguration  would you like to have a jew partner in your own business  mrs butler cornbury should have said nothing to mr tappitt as to any partner in the brewery jew or christian  i dont want any partner and whats more i dont mean to have any  mrs cornbury is in favour of luke rowan she takes his side said mrs tappitt some portion of her courage returning to her as this opportunity opened upon her mr tappitt turned his head full round and looked upon mrs cornbury with an evil eye that lady knew that the vote was lost lost unless she would denounce the man whom rachel loved and she determined at once that she would not denounce him there are many things which such a woman will do to gain such an object she could smile when tappitt was offensive she could smile again when mrs tappitt talked like a kitchenmaid she could flatter them both and pretend to talk seriously with them about jews and her own church feelings she could have given up to them luke rowanif he had stood alone but she could not give up the girl she had chaperoned and upon whom during that chaperoning her goodwill and kindly feelings had fallen rachel had pleased her eye and gratified her sense of feminine nicety she felt that a word said against rowan would be a word said also against rachel and therefore throwing her husband over for the nonce she resolved to sacrifice the vote and stand up for her friend well yes i do said she meeting tappitts eye steadily she was not going to be looked out of countenance by mr tappitt  she thinks hell come back to marry that young woman at braggs end said mrs tappitt but i say that hell never dare to show his face in baslehurst again  that young woman is making a great fool of herself said tappitt if she trusts to a swindler like him  perhaps mrs tappitt said mrs cornbury we neednt mind discussing miss ray its not good to talk about a young lady in that way and im sure i never said that i thought she was engaged to mr rowan had i done so i should have been very wrong for i know nothing about it what little i saw of the gentleman i liked and as she used the word gentleman she looked tappitt full in the face and for miss ray ive a great regard for her and think very highly of her independently of her acknowledged beauty and pleasant ladylike manners shes a very charming girl about the vote mr tappitt at any rate youll think of it  but had he not been defied in his own house and as for her the mother of those three finely educated girls had not every word said in rachels favour been a dagger planted in her own maternal bosom whose courage would not have risen under such provocation  mrs cornbury had got up to go but the indignant injured tappitts resolved mutually though without concert that she should be answered  im an honest man mrs cornbury said the brewer and i like to speak out my mind openly mr hart is a liberal and i mean to support my party will you tell mr cornbury so with my compliments its all nonsense about jews not being in parliament its not the same as being mayors or churchwardens or anything like that i shall vote for mr hart and whats more we shall put him in  and mrs cornbury if you have so much regard for miss rachel youd better advise her to think no more of that young man hes no good hes not indeed if you ask youll find hes in debt everywhere  swindler said tappitt  i dont suppose it can be very bad with miss rachel yet for she only saw him about three timesthough she was so intimate with him at our party  mrs butler cornbury curtseyed and smiled and got herself out of the room mrs tappitt as soon as she remembered herself rang the bell and mr tappitt following her down to the hall door went through the pretence of putting her into her carriage  shes a nasty meddlesome woman said tappitt as soon as he got back to his wife  and how ever she can stand up and say all those things for that girl passes me said mrs tappitt holding up both her hands she was flighty herself when young she was no doubt and now i suppose she likes others to be the same if thats what she calls manners i shouldnt like her to take my girls about  and him a gentleman said tappitt if those are to be our gentlemen id sooner have all the jews out of jerusalem but theyll find out their gentleman theyll find him out hell rob that old mother of his before hes done you mark my words else comforting himself with this hope he took himself back to his countinghouse  mrs cornbury had smiled as she went and had carried herself through the whole interview without any sign of temper even when declaring that she intended to take rachels part openmouthed she had spoken in a halfdrolling way which had divested her words of any tone of offence but when she got into her carriage she was in truth very angry i dont believe a word of it she said to herself not a word of it that in which she professed to herself her own disbelief was the general assertion that rowan was a swindler supported by the particular assertion that he had left baslehurst over head and ears in debt i dont believe it and she resolved that it should be her business to find out whether the accusation were true or false she knew the ins and outs of baslehurst life and baslehurst doings with tolerable accuracy and was at any rate capable of unravelling such a mystery as that if the tappitts in their jealousy were striving to rob rachel ray of her husband by spreading false reports she would encourage rachel ray in her love by spreading the truthif as she believed the truth should speak in rowans favour she would have considerable pleasure in countermining mr and mrs tappitt  as to mr tappitts vote for the electionthat was gone     chapter iii  dr harford   the current of events forced upon rachel a delay of three or four days in answering her letter or rather forced upon her that delay in learning whether or no she might answer it and this was felt by her to be a grievous evil it had been arranged that she should not write until such writing should have received what might almost be called a parochial sanction and no idea of acting in opposition to that arrangement ever occurred to her but the more she thought of it the more she was vexed and the more she thought of it the more she learned to doubt whether or no her mother was placing her in safe tutelage during these few weeks a great change came upon the girls character when first mrs prime had brought home tidings that miss pucker had seen her walking and talking with the young man from the brewery angry as she had been with her sister and disgusted as she had been with miss pucker she had acknowledged to herself that such talking and walking were very dangerous if not very improper and she had half resolved that there should be no more of them and when mrs prime had seen her standing at the stile and had brought home that second report rachel knowing what had occurred at that stile had then felt sure that she was in danger at that time though she had thought much of luke rowan she had not thought of him as a man who could possibly be her husband she had thought of him as having no right to call her rachel because he could not possibly become so there had been great dangerthere had been conduct which she believed to be improper though she could not tell herself that she had been guilty in her outlook into the world nothing so beautiful had promised itself to her as having such a man to love her as luke rowan though her mother was not herself asceticliking tea and buttered toast dearly and liking also little soft laughter with her childshe had preached ascetisms till rachel had learned to think that the world was all either ascetic or reprobate the dorcas meetings had become distasteful to her because the women were vulgar but yet she had half believed herself to be wrong in avoiding the work and the vulgarity together idle she had never been since a needle had come easy to her hand and the economies of a household had been made intelligible to her she had earned her bread and assisted in works of charity she had read no love stories and been taught to expect no lover she was not prepared to denydid not deny even to herselfthat it was wrong that she should even like to talk to luke rowan  then came the ball or rather first came the little evening party which afterwards grew to be a ball she had been very desirous of going not for the sake of any pleasure that she promised herself not for the sake of such pleasure as girls do promise themselves at such gatherings but because her female pride told her that it was well for her to claim the right of meeting this young manwell for her to declare that nothing had passed between them which should make her afraid to meet him that some other hopes had crept in as the evening had come nigh at handhopes of which she had been made aware only by her efforts in repressing themmay not be denied she had been accused because of him and she would show that no such accusation had daunted her but would hewould he give occasion for further accusation she believed he would not nay she was sure at any rate she hoped he would not she told herself that such was her hope but had he not noticed her she would have been wretched  we know now in what manner he had noticed her and we know also whether she had been wretched she had certainly fled from him when she left the breweryhouse inducing mrs cornbury to bring her away she did so in order that she might escape from him but she ran from him as one runs from some great joy in order that the mind may revel over it in peace then little as she knew it her love had been given her heart was his she had placed him upon her pinnacle and was prepared to worship him she was ready to dress herself in his eyes to believe that to be good which he thought good and to repudiate that which he repudiated when she bowed her head over his breast a day or two afterwards she could have spoken to him with the full words of passionate love had not maiden fear repressed her  but she had not even bowed her head for him she had not acknowledged to herself that such love was possible to her till her mother had consented that her mothers consent had been wavering doubtful expressed without intention of such expressionso expressed that mrs ray hardly knew that she had expressed itwas not understood by rachel her mother had consented and that consent having been given rachel was not now disposed to allow of any steps backwards she seemed to have learned her rights or to have assumed that she had rights hitherto her obedience to her mother had been pure and simple although from the greater force of her character she had in many things been her mothers leader but now though she was ill inclined to rebel though in this matter of the letter she had obeyed she was beginning to feel that obedience might become a hardship she did not say to herself they have let me love him and now they must not put out their hands to hold back my love but the current of her feelings ran as though such unspoken words had passed across her mind she had her rights and though she did not presume that she could insist on them in opposition to her mother or her mothers advisers she knew that she would be wronged if those rights were withheld from her the chief of those rights was the possession of her lover if he was taken from her she would be as one imprisoned unjustlyas one robbed by those who should have been his friendsas one injured wounded stricken in the dark and treacherously mutilated by hands that should have protected him during these days she was silent and sat with that look upon her brow which her mother feared  i could not make mr comfort come any sooner rachel said mrs ray  no mamma  i can see how impatient you are  i dont know that im impatient im sure that i havent said anything  if you said anything i shouldnt mind it so much but i cant bear to see you with that unhappy look im sure i only wish to do whats best you cant think it right that you should be writing letters to a gentleman without being sure that it is proper  oh mamma dont talk about it  you dont like me to ask your sister and im sure its natural i should want to ask somebody hes nearly seventy years old and he has known you ever since you were born and then hes a clergyman and therefore hell be sure to know whats right not that i should have liked to have said a word about it to mr prong because theres a difference when they come from one doesnt know where  pray mamma dont i havent made any objection to mr comfort it isnt nice to be talked over in that way by anybody thats all  but what was i to do im sure i liked the young man very much i never knew a young man who took his tea so pleasant and as for his manners and his way of talking i had it in my heart to fall in love with him myself i had indeed as far as that goes hes just the young man that i could make a son of  dear mamma my own dearest mamma and rachel jumping up threw herself upon her mothers neck stop there you shant say another word  im sure i didnt mean to say anything unpleasant  no you did not and i wont be impatient  only i cant bear that look and you know what his mother saidand mrs tappitt not that i care about mrs tappitt only a persons mother is his mother and he shouldnt have called her a goose  it must be acknowledged that rachels position was not comfortable and it certainly would not have been improved had she known how many people in baslehurst were talking about her and rowan that rowan was gone everybody knew that he had made love to rachel everybody said that he never meant to come back any more most professed to believe tappitts tongue was loud in proclaiming his iniquities and her follies and injuries mrs tappitt whispered into the ears of all her female acquaintances  im sorry for her miss harford said mildly mrs tappitt was calling at the rectory and had made her way in mr tappitt was an upholder of the old rector and there was a fellowtownsmans friendship between them  oh yesvery sorry for her said mrs tappitt  very sorry indeed said augusta who was with her mother  she always seemed to me a pretty quiet wellbehaved girl said miss harford  still waters run deepest you know miss harford said mrs tappitt i should never have imagined it of hernever but she certainly met him halfway  but we all thought he was respectable you know said miss harford  miss harford was thoroughly goodnatured and though she had never gone halfway herself and had perhaps lost her chance from having been unable to go any part of the way she was not disposed to condemn a girl for having been willing to be admired by such a one as luke rowan  wellyes at first we did he had the name of money you know and that goes so far with some girls we were on our guardand she looked proudly round on augustatill we should hear what the young man really was he has thrown off his sheeps clothing now with a vengeance mr tappitt feels quite ashamed that he should have introduced him to any of the people here he does indeed  that may be her misfortune and not her fault said miss harford who in defending rachel was well enough inclined to give up luke indeed baslehurst was beginning to have a settled mind that luke was a wolf  oh quite so said mrs tappitt the poor girl has been very unfortunate no doubt  after that she took her leave of the rectory  on that evening mr comfort dined with dr harford as did also butler cornbury and his wife and one or two others the chances of the election formed of course the chief subject of conversation both in the drawingroom and at the dinnertable but in talking of the election they came to talk of mr tappitt and in talking of tappitt they came to talk of luke rowan  it has already been said that dr harford had been rector of baslehurst for many years at the period to which this story refers he had nearly completed half a century of work in that capacity and had certainly been neither an idle nor an inefficient clergyman but now in his old age he was discontented and disgusted by the changes which had come upon him and though some bodily strength for further service still remained to him he had no longer any aptitude for useful work a man cannot change as men change individual men are like the separate links of a rotatory chain the chain goes on with continuous easy motion as though every part of it were capable of adapting itself to a curve but not the less is each link as stiff and sturdy as any other piece of wrought iron dr harford had in his time been an active popular mana man possessing even some liberal tendencies in politics though a country rector of nearly half a centurys standing in his parish he had been more than a clergyman he had been a magistrate and a moving man in municipal affairs he had been a politician and though now for many years he had supported the conservative candidate he had been loudly in favour of the reform bill when baslehurst was a close borough in the possession of a great duke who held property hard by but liberal politics had gone on and had left dr harford high and dry on the standingground which he had chosen for himself in the early days of his manhood and then had come that pestilent act of the legislature under which his parish had been divided not that the act of parliament itself had been violently condemned by the doctor on its becoming law i doubt whether he had then thought much of it  but when men calling themselves commissioners came actually upon him and his and separated off from him a district of his own town taking it away altogether from his authority and giving it over to such inexperienced hands as chance might send thitherthen dr harford became a violent tory and my readers must not conceive that this was a question touching his pocket one might presume that his pocket would be in some degree benefited seeing that he was saved from the necessity of supplying the spiritual wants of a certain portion of his parish no shilling was taken from his own income which indeed was by no means excessive his whole parish gave him barely six hundred a year out of which he had kept always one and latterly two curates it was no question of money in any degree sooner than be invaded and mutilated he would have submitted to an order calling upon him to find a third curatecould any power have given such order his parish had been invaded and his clerical authority mutilated he was no longer totus teres atque rotundus the beauty of his life was over and the contentment of his mind was gone he knew that it was only left for him to die spending such days as remained to him in vague prophecies of evil against his devoted countrya country which had allowed its ancient parochial landmarks to be moved and its ecclesiastical fastnesses to be invaded  but perhaps hatred of mr prong was the strongest passion of dr harfords heart at the present moment he had ever hated the dissenting ministers by whom he was surrounded in devonshire dissent has waxed strong for many years and the pastors of the dissenting flocks have been thorns in the side of the church of england clergymen dr harford had undergone his full share of suffering from such thorns but they had caused him no more than a pleasant irritation in comparison with what he endured from the presence of mr prong in baslehurst he would sooner have entertained all the dissenting ministers of the south hams together than have put his legs under the same mahogany with mr prong mr prong was to him the evil thing anathema he believed all bad things of mr prong with an absolute faith but without any ground on which such faith should have been formed he thought that mr prong drank spirits that he robbed his parishionersdr harford would sooner have lost his tongue than have used such a word with reference to those who attended mr prongs chapelthat he had left a deserted wife on some parish that he was probably not in truth ordained there was nothing which dr harford could not believe of mr prong now all this was to say the least of it a pity for it disfigured the close of a useful and conscientious life  dr harford of course intended to vote for mr cornbury but he would not join loudly in condemnation of mr tappitt tappitt had stood stanchly by him in all parochial contests regarding the new district tappitt opposed the prong faction at all points tappitt as churchwarden had been submissive to the doctor church of england principles had always been held at the brewery and bungall had been ever in favour with dr harfords predecessor  he calls himself a liberal and always has done said the doctor you cant expect that he should desert his own party  but a jew said old mr comfort  well why not a jew said the doctor whereupon mr comfort and butler cornbury and dr harfords own curate young mr calclough and captain byng an old bachelor who lived in baslehurst all stared at him as dr harford had intended that they should upon my word said he i dont see the use for caring for that kind of thing any longer i dont indeed in the way we are going on now and for the sort of thing we do i dont see why jews shouldnt serve us as well in parliament as christians if i am to have my brains knocked out id sooner have it done by a declared enemy than by one who calls himself my friend  but our brains are not knocked out yet said butler cornbury  i dont know anything about yours but mine are  i dont think the worlds coming to an end yet said the captain  nor do i i said nothing about the world coming to an end but if you saw a part of your ship put under the command of a landlubber who didnt know one side of the vessel from the other youd think the world had better come to an end than be carried on in that way  its not the same thing you know said the captain you couldnt divide a ship  oh well youll see  i dont think any christian should vote for a jew said the curate a verdict has gone out against them and what is man that he should reverse it  are you quite sure that you are reversing it by putting them into parliament said dr harford may not that be a carrying on of the curse  theres consolation in that idea for butler if he loses his election said mr comfort  parliament isnt what it was said the doctor theres no doubt about that  and who is to blame said mr comfort who had never supported the reform bill as his neighbour had done  i say nothing about blame its natural that things should get worse as they grow older  dr harford thinks parliament is worn out said butler cornbury  and what if i do think so have not other things as great fallen and gone into decay did not the roman senate wear out as you call it and as for these jews of whom you are speaking what was the curse upon them but the wearing out of their grace and wisdom i am inclined to think that we are wearing out only i wish the garment could have lasted my time without showing so many thin places  now i believe just the contrary said the captain i dont think we have come to our full growth yet  could we lick the french as we did at trafalgar and waterloo said the doctor  the captain thought a while before he answered and then spoke with much solemnity yes said he i think we could and i hope the time will soon come when we may  we shant do it if we send jews to parliament said mr comfort  i must say i think tappitt wrong said young cornbury of course near as the thing is going im sorry to lose his vote but im not speaking because of that he has always pretended to hold on to the church party here and the church party has held on to him his beer is none of the best and i think hed have been wise to stick to his old friends  i dont see the argument about the beer said the doctor  he shouldnt provoke his neighbours to look at his faults  but the jews friends would find out that the beer is bad as well as yours  the truth is said cornbury that tappitt thinks he has a personal grievance against me hes as cross as a bear with a sore head at the present moment because this young fellow who was to have been his partner has turned against him theres some love affair and my wife has been there and made a mess of it its hard upon me for i dont know that i ever saw the young man in my life  i believe that fellow is a scamp said the doctor  i hope not said mr comfort thinking of rachel and her hopes  we all hope he isnt of course said the doctor but we cant prevent men being scamps by hoping there are other scamps in this town in whom if my hoping would do any good a very great change would be madeeverybody present knew that the doctor alluded especially to mr prong whose condition however if the doctors hopes could have been carried out would not have been enviablebut i fear this fellow rowan is a scamp and i think he has treated tappitt badly tappitt told me all about it only this morning  audi alteram partem said mr comfort  the scamps party you mean said the doctor i havent the means of doing that if in this world we suspend our judgment till weve heard all that can be said on both sides of every question we should never come to any judgment at all i hear that hes in debt i believe he behaved very badly to tappitt himself so that tappitt was forced to use personal violence to defend himself and he has certainly threatened to open a new brewery here now thats bad as coming from a young man related to the old firm  i think he should leave the brewery alone said mr comfort  of course he should said the doctor and i hear moreover that he is playing a wicked game with a girl in your parish  i dont know about a wicked game said the other it wont be a wicked game if he marries her  then rachels chances of matrimonial success were discussed with a degree of vigour which must have been felt by her to be highly complimentary had she been aware of it but i grieve to say that public opinion as expressed in dr harfords diningroom went against luke rowan mr tappitt was not a great man either as a citizen or as a brewer he was not one to whom baslehurst would even rejoice to raise a monument but such as he was he had been known for many years no one in that room loved or felt for him anything like real friendship but the old familiarity of the place was in his favour and his form was known of old upon the high street he was not a drunkard he lived becomingly with his wife he had paid his way and was a fellowtownsman what was it to dr harford or even to mr comfort that he brewed bad beer no man was compelled to drink it why should not a man employ himself openly and legitimately in the brewing of bad beer if the demand for bad beer were so great as to enable him to live by the occupation on the other hand luke rowan was personally known to none of them and they were jealous that a change should come among them with any view of teaching them a lesson or improving their condition they believed or thought they believed that mr tappitt had been illtreated in his countinghouse it was grievous to them that a man with a wife and three daughters should have been threatened by a young unmarried manby a man whose shoulders were laden with no family burden whether rowans propositions had been in truth good or evil just or unjust they had not inquired and would not probably have ascertained had they done so but they judged the man and condemned him mr comfort was brought round to condemn him as thoroughly as did dr harfordnot reflecting as he did so how fatal his condemnation might be to the happiness of poor rachel ray  the fact is butler said the doctor when mr comfort had left them and gone to the drawingroomthe fact is your wife has not played her cards at the brewery as well as she usually does play them she has been taking this young fellows part and after that i dont know how she was to expect that tappitt would stand by you  no general can succeed always said cornbury laughing  well some generals do but i must confess your wife is generally very successful come well go upstairs and dont you tell her that ive been finding fault shes as good as gold and i cant afford to quarrel with her but i think she has tripped here  when the old doctor and butler cornbury reached the drawingroom the names of rowan and tappitt had not been as yet banished from the conversation but to them had been added some others rachels name had been again mentioned as had also that of rachels sister  papa who do you think is going to be married said miss harford  not you my dear is it said the doctor  mr prong is going to be married to mrs prime said miss harford showing by the solemnity of her voice that she regarded the subject as one which should by its nature repress any further joke  nor was dr harford inclined to joke when he heard such tidings as these mr prong said he nonsense who told you  well it was baker told me mrs baker was the housekeeper at the baslehurst rectory and had been so for the last thirty years she learned it at drabbits in the high street where mrs prime had been living since she left her mothers cottage  if thats true comfort said the doctor i congratulate you on your parishioner  mrs prime is no parishioner of mine said the vicar of cawston if its true im very sorry for her mothervery sorry  i dont believe a word of it said mrs cornbury  poor wretched unfortunate woman said the doctor her little bit of money is all in her own hands is it not  i believe it is said mr comfort  ah yes i dare say its true said the vicar shes been running after him ever since hes been here i dont doubt its true poor creaturepoor creature poor thing and the doctor absolutely sighed as he thought of the misery in store for mr prongs future bride its an ill wind that blows nobody any good he said after a while hell go off no doubt when he has got the money in his hand and we shall be rid of him poor thingpoor thing  before the evening was over mrs cornbury and her father had again discussed the question of rachels possible engagement with luke rowan mr comfort had declared his conviction that it would be dangerous to encourage any such hopes whereas his daughter protested that she would not see rachel thrown over if she could help it dont condemn him yet papa she said  i dont condemn him at all my dear but i hardly think we shall see him back at baslehurst and he shouldnt have gone away without paying his debts patty     chapter iv  mr comfort calls at the cottage   mrs ray in her trouble occasioned by lukes letter had walked up to mr comforts house but had not found him at home therefore she had written to him in his own study a few very simple words telling the matter on which she wanted his advice almost any other woman would have half hidden her real meaning under a cloud of ambiguous words but with her there was no question of hiding anything from her clergyman rachel has had a letter from young mr rowan she said and i have begged her not to answer it till i have shown it to you so mr comfort sent word down to braggs end that he would call at the cottage and fixed an hour for his coming this task was to be accomplished by him on the morning after dr harfords dinner and he had thought much of the coming conference between himself and rachels mother while rowans character was being discussed at dr harfords house but on that occasion he had said nothing to any one not even to his daughter of the application which had been made to him by mrs ray at eleven oclock he presented himself at the cottage door and of course found mrs ray alone rachel had taken herself over to mrs sturt and greatly amazed that kindhearted person by her silence and confusion why my dear said mrs sturt you haint got a word today to throw at a dog rachel acknowledged that she had not and then mrs sturt allowed her to remain in her silence  oh mr comfort this is so good of you mrs ray began as soon as her friend was inside the parlour when i went up to the parsonage i didnt think of bringing you down here all the wayi didnt indeed mr comfort assured her that he thought nothing of the trouble declared that he owed her a visit and then asked after rachel  to tell you the truth then shes just stept across the green to mrs sturts so as to be out of the way its a trying time to her mr comfortvery and whatever way it goes shes a good girla very good girl  you neednt tell me that mrs ray  oh but i must theres her sister thinks shes encouraged this young man too freely but  bytheby mrs ray ive been told that mrs prime is engaged to be married herself  have you now  well yes i heard it in baslehurst yesterdayto mr prong  shes kept it so close mr comfort i didnt think anybody had heard it  it is true then  i cant say she has accepted him yet he has offered to hertheres no doubt about that mr comfortand she hasnt said him no  do let her look sharp after her money said mr comfort  well thats just it shes not a bit inclined to give it up to him i can tell you  i cant say mrs ray that the connexion is one that i like very much in any way theres no reason at all why your eldest daughter should not marry again but  what can i do mr comfort of course i know hes not just what he should bethat is for a clergyman when i knew he hadnt come from any of the colleges i never had any fancy for going to hear him myself but of course i should never have left your church mr comfortnot if anybody had come there and if i could have had my way with dorothy she would never have gone near himnever but what could i do mr comfort of course she can go where she likes  mr prime was a gentleman and a christian said the vicar  that he was mr comfort and a husband for a young woman to be proud of but he was soon taken away from hervery soon and she hasnt thought much of this world since  i dont know what shes thinking of now  it isnt of herself mr comfort not a bit dorothy is very stern but to give her her due its not herself shes thinking of  why does she want to marry him then  because hes lonely without some one to do for him  lonelyand he should be lonely for me mrs ray  and because she says she can work in the vineyard better as a clergymans wife  pshaw work in the vineyard indeed but its no business of mine and as you say i suppose you cant help it  indeed i cant shed never think of asking me  i hope shell look after her money thats all and whats all this about my friend rachel id a great deal sooner hear that she was going to be marriedif i knew that the man was worthy of her  then mrs ray put her hand into her pocket and taking out rowans letter gave it to the vicar to read as she did so she looked into his face with eyes full of the most intense anxiety she was herself greatly frightened by the magnitude of this marriage question she feared the enmity of mrs rowan and she doubted the firmness of luke she could not keep herself from reflecting that a young man from london was very dangerous that he might probably be a wolf that she could not be safe in trusting her one lamb into such custody but nevertheless she most earnestly hoped that mr comforts verdict might be in the young mans favour if he would only say that the young man was not a wolfif he would only take upon his own clerical shoulders the responsibility of trusting the young manmrs ray would become for the moment one of the happiest women in devonshire with what a beaming facewith what a true joywith what smiles through her tears would she then have welcomed rachel back from the farmhouse how she would have watched her as she came across the green beckoning to her eagerly and telling all her happy tale beforehand by the signs of her joy but there was to be no such happy tale as that told on this morning she watched the vicars face as he read the letter and soon perceived that the verdict was to be given against the writer of it i do not know that mrs ray was particularly quick at reading the countenances of men but in this instance she did read the countenance of mr comfort we all of us read more in the faces of those with whom we hold converse than we are aware of doing of the truth or want of truth in every word spoken to us we judge in great part by the face of the speaker by the face of every man and woman seen by us whether they speak or are silent we form a judgmentand in nine cases out of ten our judgment is true it is because our tenth judgmentthat judgment which has been wrongcomes back upon us always with the effects of its error that we teach ourselves to say that appearances cannot be trusted if we did not trust them we should be walking ever in doubt in darkness and in ignorance as mr comfort read the letter mrs ray knew that it would not be allowed to her to speak words of happiness to rachel on that day she knew that the young man was to be set down as dangerous but she was by no means aware that she was reading the vicars face with precise accuracy mr comfort had been slow in his perusal weighing the words of the letter and when he had finished it he slowly refolded the paper and put it back into its envelope he means what he says said he as he gave the letter back to mrs ray  yes i think he means what he says  but we cannot tell how long he may mean it nor can we tell as yet whether such a connection would be good for rachel even if he should remain stedfast in such meaning if you ask me mrs ray  i do ask you mr comfort  then i think we should all of us know more about him before we allow rachel to give him encouragementi do indeed  mrs ray could not quite repress in her heart a slight feeling of anger against the vicar she remembered the wordsso different not only in their meaning but in the tone in which they were spokenin which he had sanctioned rachels going to the ball young people get to think of each other he had then said speaking with goodhumoured cheery voice as though such thinking were worthy of all encouragement he had spoken then of marriage being the happiest condition for both men and women and had inquired as to rowans means every word that had then fallen from him had expressed his opinion that luke rowan was an eligible lover but now he was named as though he were undoubtedly a wolf why had not mr comfort said then at that former interview when no harm had as yet been done that it would be desirable to know more of the young man before any encouragement was given to him mrs ray felt that she was injured but nevertheless her trust in her counsellor was not on that account the less  i suppose it must be answered said mrs ray  oh yes of course it should be answered  and who should write it mr comfort  let rachel write it herself let her tell him that she is not prepared to correspond with him as yet any further that is you understand than the writing of that letter  and aboutaboutabout what he says as to loving her you know there has been a sort of promise between them mr comfort and no young man could have spoken more honestly than he did  and he meant honestly no doubt but you see mrs ray it is necessary to be so careful in these matters it is quite evident his mother doesnt wish this marriage  and he shouldnt have called her a goose should he  i dont think much about that  dont you now  it was all meant in goodhumour but she thinks it a bad marriage for him as regards money and money considerations always go so far you know and then hes away and youve got no hold upon him  thats quite true mr comfort  he has quarrelled with the people here and upon my word im inclined to think he has not behaved very well to mr tappitt  hasnt he now  im afraid not mrs ray they were talking about him last night in baslehurst and im afraid he has behaved badly at the brewery there were words between him and mr tappittvery serious words  yes i know that he told rachel as much as that i think he said he was going to law with mr tappitt  and if so the chances are that he may never be seen here again its ill coming to a place where one is quarrelling with people and as to the lawsuit it seems to me from what i hear that he would certainly lose it no doubt he has a considerable property in the brewery but he wants to be master of everything and that cant be reasonable you know and then mrs ray theres worse than that behind  worse than that said mrs ray in whose heart every gleam of comfort was quickly being extinguished by darkening shadows  they tell me that he has gone away without paying his debts if that is so it shows that his means cannot be very good then why had mr comfort taken upon himself expressly to say that they were good at that interview before mrs tappitts party that was the thought in the widows mind at the present moment mr comfort however went on with his caution and then when the happiness of such a girl as rachel is concerned it is impossible to be too careful where should we all be if we found that we had given her to a scamp  oh dear oh dear i dont think he can be a scamphe did take his tea so nicely  i dont say he isi dont judge him but then we should be careful why didnt he pay his debts before he went away a young man should always pay his debts  perhaps hes sent it down in a moneyorder said mrs ray they are so very convenientthat is if youve got the money  if he hasnt i hope he will for i can assure you i dont want to think badly of him maybe he will turn out all right and you may be sure of this mrs ray that if he is really attached to rachel he wont give her up because she doesnt throw herself into his arms at his first word theres nothing becomes a young woman like a little caution or makes a young man think more of her if rachel fancies that she likes him let her hold back a while and find out what sort of stuff hes made of if i were her i should just tell him that i thought it better to wait a little before i made any positive engagement  but mr comfort how is she to begin it you see he calls her dearest rachel  let her say dear mr rowan there cant be any harm in that  she mustnt call him luke i suppose  i think shed better not young men think so much of those things  and shes not to say yours affectionately at the end  shell understand all that when she comes to write the letter better than we can tell her give her my love and tell her from me im quite sure shes a dear good girl and that it must be a great comfort to you to know that you can trust her so thoroughly then having spoken these last words mr comfort took himself away  rachel sitting in the window of mrs sturts large front kitchen on the other side of the green could see mr comfort come forth from the cottage and get into his low fourwheeled carriage which with his boy in livery had been standing at the garden gate during the interview mrs sturt was away among the milkpans scalding cream or preparing butter and did not watch either rachel or the visitor at the cottage but she knew with tolerable accuracy what was going on and with all her heart wished that her young friend might have luck with her lover rachel waited for a minute or two till the little carriage was out of sight till the sound of the wheels could be no longer heard and then she prepared to move she slowly got herself up from her chair as though she were afraid to show herself upon the green and paused still a few moments longer before she left the kitchen  so thous off said mrs sturt coming in from the back regions of her territory with the sleeves of her gown tucked up enveloped in a large roundabout apron which covered almost all her dress mrs sturt would no more have thought of doing her work in the front kitchen than i should think of doing mine in the drawingroom so thous off home again my lass said mrs sturt  yes mrs sturt mr comfort has been with mammaabout business and as i didnt want to be in the way i just came over to you  thou art welcome as flowers in may morning or evening but thee knowest that girl as for mr comfortits cold comfort he is i always say its little i think of what clergymen says unless it be out of the pulpit or the like of that what does they know about lads and lasses  hes a very old friend of mammas  old friends is always best ill not deny that but look thee here my girl my mans an old friend too hes knowd thee since he lifted thee in his arms to pull the plums off that bough yonder and hes seen thee these ten years a deal oftener than mr comfort if they say anything wrong of thy joe there tell me and sturt ll find out whether it be true or no dont let ere a parson in devonshire rob thee of thy sweetheart its passing sweet when true hearts meet but it breaks the heart when true hearts part with the salutary advice contained in these ancient local lines mrs sturt put her arms round rachel and having kissed her bade her go  with slow step she made her way across the green hardly daring to look to the door of the cottage but there was no figure standing at the door and let her have looked with all her eyes there was nothing there to have told her anything she walked very slowly thinking as she went of mrs sturts wordsdont let ere a parson in devonshire rob thee of thy sweetheart was it not hard upon her that she should be subjected to the misery of such discussion seeing that she had given no hope either to her lover or to herself till she had received full warranty for doing so she would do what her mother should bid her let it be what it might but she would be wrongedshe felt that she would be wronged and injured grievously injured if her mother should now bid her think of rowan as one thinks of those that are gone  she entered the cottage slowly and turning into the parlour found her mother seated there on the old sofa opposite to the fireplace she was seated there in stiff composure waiting the work which she had to do it was no customary place of hers and she was a woman who in the ordinary occupations of her life never deserted her customary places she had an old easy chair near the fireplace and another smaller chair close to the window and in one of these she might always be found unless when on special occasions like the present some great thing had occurred to throw her out of the grooves of her life  well mamma said rachel coming in and standing before her mother mrs ray before she spoke looked up into her childs face and was afraid well mamma what has mr comfort said  was it not hard for mrs ray that at such a moment she should have had no sort of husband on whom to lean does the reader remember that in the opening words of this story mrs ray was described as a woman who specially needed some standingcorner some post some strong prop to bear her weightsome marital authority by which she might be guided such prop and such guiding she had never needed more sorely than she needed them now she looked up into rachels face before she spoke and was afraid he has been here my dear she said and has gone away  yes mamma i knew that said rachel i saw his phaeton drive off thats why i came over from mrs sturts  rachels voice was hard and there was no comfort in it it was so hard that mrs ray felt it to be unkind no doubt rachel suffered but did not she suffer also would not she have given blood from her breast like the maternal pelican to have secured from that clerical counsellor a verdict that might have been comforting to her child would she not have made any sacrifice of self for such a verdict even though the effecting of it must have been that she herself would have been left alone and deserted in the world why then should rachel be stern to her if misery was to fall on both of them it was not of her doing  i know you will think its my fault rachel but i cannot help it even though you should say so of course i was obliged to ask some one and who else was there that would be able to tell me so well as mr comfort you would not have liked it at all if i had gone to dorothea and as for mr prong  oh mamma mamma dont i havent said anything i havent complained of mr comfort what has he said now you forget that you have not told me  no my dear i dont forget i wish i could he says that mr rowan has behaved badly to mr tappitt and that he hasnt paid his debts and that the lawsuit will be sure to go against him and that he will never show his face in baslehurst again and he says too that it would be very wrong for you to correspond with himvery because a young girl like you must be so careful about such things and he says hell be much more likely to respect you if you dontdontdont just throw yourself into his arms like those were his very words and then he says that if he really cares for you hell be sure to come back again and so youre to answer the letter and you must call him dear mr rowan dont call him luke because young men think so much about those things and you are to tell him that there isnt to be any engagement or any letterwriting or anything of that sort at all but you can just say something friendlyabout hoping hes quite well or something of that kind and then when you come to the end you had better sign yourself yours truly it wont do to say anything about affection because one never knows how it may turn out andlet me see there was only one thing more mr comfort says that you are a good girl and that he is sure you have done nothing wrongnot even in a word or a thought and i say so too you are my own beautiful child and racheli do so wish i could make it all right between you  nobody can deny that mrs ray had given with very fair accuracy an epitome of mr comforts words but they did not leave upon rachels mind a very clear idea of what she was expected to do go away in debt she said who says so  mr comfort told me so just now but perhaps hell send the money in a moneyorder you know  i dont think he would go away in debt and why should the lawsuit go against him if hes got right on his side he does not wish to do any harm to mr tappitt  i dont know about that my dear but at any rate theyve quarrelled  but why shouldnt that be mr tappitts fault as much as his and as for not showing his face in baslehurst oh mamma dont you know him well enough to be sure that he will never be ashamed of showing his face anywhere he not show his face mamma i dont believe a word of it allnot a word  mr comfort said so he did indeed then mrs sturts words came back upon rachel dont let ere a parson in devonshire rob thee of thy sweetheart this lover of hers was her only possessionthe only thing of her own winning that she had ever valued he was her great triumph the rich upshot of her own prowessand now she felt that this parson was indeed robbing her had he been then present she would have risen up and spoken at him as she had never spoken before the spirit of rebellion against all the world was strong within heragainst all the world except that one weak woman who now sat before her on the sofa her eyes were full of anger and mrs ray saw that it was so but still she was minded to obey her mother  its no good talking said rachel but when they say that hes afraid to show himself in baslehurst i dont believe them does he look like a man afraid to show himself  looks are so deceitful rachel  and as for debtspeople if theyre called away by telegraph in a minute cant pay all that they owe there are plenty of people in baslehurst that owe a deal more than he does im sure and hes got his share in the brewery so that nobody need be afraid  mr comfort didnt say that you were to quarrel with him altogether  mr comfort whats mr comfort to me mamma this was said in such a tone that mrs ray absolutely started up from her seat  but rachel he is my oldest friend he was your fathers friend  why did he not say it before then whywhywhy mamma i cant throw him off now didnt i tell him thatthatthat i wouldlove him didnt you say that it might be soyou yourself how am i to show my face if i go back now mamma i do love him with all my heart and all my strength and nothing that anybody can say can make any difference if he owed ever so much money i should love him the same if he had killed mr tappitt it wouldnt make any difference  oh rachel  no more it would if mr tappitt began it first it wasnt his fault  but rachel my darlingwhat can we do if he has gone away we cannot make him come back again  but he wrote almost immediately  and you are going to answer itare you not  yesbut what sort of an answer mamma how can i expect that he will ever want to see me again when i have written to him in that way i wont say anything about hoping that hes very well if i may not tell him that hes my own own own luke and that i love him with all my heart ill bid him stay away and not trouble himself any further i wonder what hell think of me when i write in that way  if hes constanthearted hell wait a while and then hell come back again  why should he come back when ive treated him in that way what have i got to give him mamma you may write the letter yourself and put in it what you please  mr comfort said that you had better write it  mr comfort i dont know why im to do all that mr comfort tells me and then those other words of mrs sturts recurred to her its little i think of what a clergyman says unless it be out of a pulpit after that there was nothing further said for some minutes mrs ray still sat on the sofa and as she gazed upon the table which stood in the middle of the room she wiped her eyes with her handkerchief rachel was now seated in a chair with her back almost turned to her mother and was beating with her impatient fingers on the table she was very angryangry even with her mother and she was half brokenhearted truly believing that such a letter as that which she was desired to write would estrange her lover from her for ever so they sat and for a few minutes no word was spoken between them  rachel said mrs ray at last if wrong has been done is it not better that it should be undone  what wrong have i done said rachel jumping up  it is i that have done itnot you  no mamma you have done no wrong  i should have known more before i let him come here and encouraged you to think of him it has been my fault my dear will you not forgive me  mamma there has been no fault there is nothing to forgive  i have made you unhappy my child and then mrs ray burst out into open tears  no mamma i wont be unhappyor if i am i will bear it then she got up and threw her arms round her mothers neck and embraced her i will write the letter but i will not write it now you shall see it before it goes     chapter v  showing what rachel ray thought when she sat on the stile and how she wrote her letter afterwards   rachel as soon as she had made her mother the promise that she would write the letter left the parlour and went up to her own room she had many thoughts to adjust in her mind which could not be adjusted satisfactorily otherwise than in solitude and it was clearly necessary that they should be adjusted before she could write her letter it must be remembered not only that she had never before written a letter to a lover but that she had never before written a letter of importance to any one she had threatened at one moment that she would leave the writing of it to her mother but there came upon her a feeling of which she was hardly conscious that she herself might probably compose the letter in a strain of higher dignity than her mother would be likely to adopt that her lover would be gone from her for ever she felt almost assured but still it would be much to her that on going he should so leave her that his respect might remain though his love would be a thing of the past in her estimation he was a noble being to have been loved by whom even for a few days was more honour than she had ever hoped to win for a few days she had been allowed to think that her great fortune intended him to be her husband but fate had interposed and now she feared that all her joy was at an end but her joy should be so relinquished that she herself should not be disgraced in the giving of it up she sat there alone for an hour and was stronger when that hour was over than she had been when she left her mother her pride had supported her and had been sufficient for her support in that first hour of her sorrow it is ever so with us in our misery in the first flush of our wretchedness let the outward signs of our grief be what they may we promise to ourselves the support of some inner strength which shall suffice to us at any rate as against the eyes of the outer world but anon and that inner staff fails us our pride yields to our tears our dignity is crushed beneath the load with which we have burdened it and then with loud wailings we own ourselves to be the wretches which we are but now rachel was in the hour of her pride and as she came down from her room she resolved that her sorrow should be buried in her own bosom she had known what it was to lovehad known it perhaps for one whole weekand now that knowledge was never to avail her again among them all she had been robbed of her sweetheart she had been bidden to give her heart to this manher heart and hand and now when she had given all her heart she was bidden to refuse her hand she had not ventured to love till her love had been sanctioned it had been sanctioned and she had loved and now that sanction was withdrawn she knew that she was injureddeeply cruelly injured but she would bear it showing nothing and saying nothing with this resolve she came down from her room and began to employ herself on her household work  mrs ray watched her carefully and rachel knew that she was watched but she took no outward notice of it going on with her work and saying a soft gentle word now and again sometimes to her mother and sometimes to the little maiden who attended them will you come to dinner mamma she said with a smile taking her mother by the hand  i shouldnt mind if i never sat down to dinner again said mrs ray  oh mamma dont say that just when you are going to thank god for the good things he gives you  then mrs ray in a low voice as though rebuked said the grace and they sat down together to their meal  the afternoon went with them very slowly and almost in silence neither of them would now speak about luke rowan and to neither of them was it as yet possible to speak about aught else one word on the subject was said during those hours you wont have time for your letter after tea mrs ray said  i shall not write it till tomorrow rachel answered another day will do no harm now  at tea mrs ray asked her whether she did not think that a walk would do her good and offered to accompany her but rachel acceding to the proposition of the walk declared that she would go alone its very bad of me to say so isnt it when youre so good as to offer to go with me but mrs ray kissed her saying with many words that she was satisfied that it should be so you want to think of things i know said the mother rachel acknowledged by a slight motion of her head that she did want to think of things and soon after that she started  i believe ill call on dolly she said it would be bad to quarrel with her and perhaps now shell come back here to live with usonly i forgot about mr prong it was agreed however that she should call on her sister and ask her to dine at the cottage on the following day  she walked along the road straight into baslehurst and went at once to her sisters lodgings she had another place to visit before she returned home but it was a place for which a later hour in the evening would suit her better mrs prime was at home and rachel on being shown up into the sittingrooma room in which every piece of furniture had become known to her during those dorcas meetingsfound not only her sister sitting there but also miss pucker and mr prong rachel had not seen that gentleman since she had learned that he was to become her brotherinlaw and hardly knew in what way to greet him but it soon became apparent to her that no outward show of regard was expected from her at that moment  i think you know my sister mr prong said dorothea whereupon mr prong rose from his chair took rachels hand pressing it between his own and then sat down again rachel judging from his countenance thought that some cloud had passed also across the sunlight of his love she made her little speech giving her mothers love and adding her own assurance that she hoped her sister would come out and dine at the cottage  i really dont know said mrs prime such goings about do cut up ones time so much i shouldnt be here again till  of course youd stay for tea with us said rachel  and lose the whole afternoon said mrs prime  oh do said miss pucker you have been working so hard hasnt she now mr prong at this time of the year a sniff of fresh air among the flowers does do a body so much good and miss pucker looked and spoke as though she also would like the sniff of fresh air  im very well in health and am thankful for it i cant say that its needed in that way said mrs prime  but mamma will be so glad to see you said rachel  i think you ought to go dorothea said mr prong and even rachel could perceive that there was some slight touch of authority in his voice it was the slightest possible intonation of a command but nevertheless it struck rachels ears  mrs prime merely shook her head and sniffed it was not for a supply of air that she used her nostrils on this occasion but that she might indicate some grain of contempt for the authority which mr prong had attempted to exercise i think id rather not rachel thank younot to dinner that is perhaps ill walk out in the evening after tea when the work of the day is over if i come then perhaps my friend miss pucker may come with me  and if your esteemed mamma will allow me to pay my respects said mr prong i shall be most happy to accompany the ladies  it will be acknowledged that rachel had no alternative left to her she said that her mother would be happy to see mr prong and happy to see miss pucker also as to herself she made no such assertion being in her present mood too full of her own thoughts to care much for the ordinary courtesies of life  im very sorry you wont come to dinner dolly she said but she abstained from any word of asking the others to tea  if it had only been mr prong she said to her mother afterwards i should have asked him for i suppose hell have to come to the house sooner or later but i wouldnt tell that horrid squinting woman that you wanted to see her for im sure you dont  but we must give them some cake and a glass of sweet wine said mrs ray  she wont have to take her bonnet off for that as she would for tea and it isnt so much like making herself at home here i couldnt bear to have to ask her up to my room  on leaving the house in the high street which she did about eight oclock she took her way towards the churchyardnot passing down brewery lane by mr tappitts house but taking the main street which led from the high street to the church but at the corner just as she was about to leave the high street she was arrested by a voice that was familiar to her and turning round she saw mrs cornbury seated in a low carriage and driving a pair of ponies how are you rachel said mrs cornbury shaking hands with her friend for rachel had gone out into the street up to the side of the carriage when she found that mrs cornbury had stopped im going by the cottageto papas i see you are turning the other way but if youve not much delay ill stay for you and take you home  but rachel had before her that other visit to make and she was not minded either to omit it or postpone it i should like it so much said rachel only  ah well i see youve got other fish to fry but rachel look here dear and mrs cornbury almost whispered into her ear across the side of the pony carriage dont you believe quite all you hear ill find out the truth and you shall know goodbye  goodbye mrs cornbury said rachel pressing her friends hand as she parted from her this allusion to her lover had called a blush up over her whole face so that mrs cornbury well knew that she had been understood ill see to it she said driving away her ponies  see to it how could she see to it when that letter should have been written and rachel was well aware that another day must not pass without the writing of it  she went down across the churchyard leaving the path to the brewery on her left and that leading out under the elm trees to her right and went on straight to the stile at which she had stood with luke rowan watching the reflection of the setting sun among the clouds this was the spot which she had determined to visit and she had come hither hoping that she might again see some form in the heavens which might remind her of that which he had shown her the stile at any rate was the same and there were the trees beneath which they had stood there were the rich fields lying beneath her over which they two had gazed together at the fading lights of the evening there was no arm in the clouds now and the perverse sun was retiring to his rest without any of that royal pageantry and illumination with which the heavens are wont to deck themselves when their king goes to his couch but rachel though she had come thither to look for these things and had not found them hardly marked their absence her mind became so full of him and of his words that she required no outward signs to refresh her memory she thought so much of his look on that evening of the tones of his voice and of every motion of his body that she soon forgot to watch the clouds she sat herself down upon the stile with her face turned away from the fields telling herself that she would listen for the footsteps of strangers so that she might move away if any came near her but she soon forgot also to listen and sat there thinking of him alone the words that had been spoken between them on that occasion had been but triflingvery few and of small moment but now they seemed to her to have contained all her destiny it was there that love for him had first come upon herhad come over her with broad outspread wings like an angel but whether as an angel of darkness or of light her heart had then been unable to perceive how well she remembered it all how he had taken her by the hand claiming the right of doing so as an ordinary farewell greeting and how he had held her looking into her face till she had been forced to speak some word of rebuke to him i did not think you would behave like that she had said but yet at that very moment her heart was going from her the warm friendliness of his touch the firm clear brightness of his eye and the eager tone of his voice were even then subduing her coy unwillingness to part with her maiden love she had declared to herself then that she was angry with him but since that she had declared to herself that nothing could have been better finer sweeter than all that he had said and done on that evening it had been his right to hold her if he intended afterwards to claim her as his own i like you so very much he had said why should we not be friends she had gone away from him then fleeing along the path bewildered ignorant as to her own feelings conscious almost of a sin in having listened to him but still filled with a wondrous delight that any one so good so beautiful so powerful as he should have cared to ask for her friendship in such pressing words during all her walk home she had been full of fear and wonder and mysterious delight then had come the ball which in itself had hardly been so pleasant to her because the eyes of many had watched her there but she thought of the moment when he had first come to her in mrs tappitts drawingroom just as she was resolving that he did not intend to notice her further she thought of those repeated dances which had been so dear to her but which in their repetition had frightened her so grievously she thought of the supper during which he had insisted on sitting by her and of that meeting in the hall during which he had as it were forced her to remain and listen to himforced her to stay with him till in her agony of fear she had escaped away to her friend and begged that she might be taken home as she sat by mrs cornbury in the carriage and afterwards as she had thought of it all while lying in her bed she had declared to herself that he had been very wrongbut since that during those few days of her permitted love she had sworn to herself as often that he had been very right  and he had been right she said so to herself now again though the words which he had spoken and the things which he had done had brought upon her all this sorrow he had been right if he loved her it was only manly and proper in him to tell his love and for herselfseeing that she had loved had it not been proper and womanly in her to declare her love what had she done when at what point had she gone astray that she should be brought to such a pass as this at the beginning when he had held her hand on the spot where she was now sitting and again when he had kept her prisoner in mr tappitts hall she had been half conscious of some sin half ashamed of her own conduct but that undecided fear of sin and shame had been washed out and everything had been made white as snow as pure as running water as bright as sunlight by the permission to love this man which had been accorded to her what had she since done that she should be brought to such a pass as that in which she now found herself  as she thought of this she was bitter against all the world except himalmost bitter against her own mother she had said that she would obey in this matter of the letter and she knew well that she would in truth do as her mother bade her but sitting there on the churchyard stile she hatched within her mind plans of disobediencedreadful plans she would not submit to this usage she would go away from baslehurst without knowledge of any one and would seek him out in his london home it would be unmaidenlybut what cared she now for thatunless indeed he should care all her virgin modesty and young maiden fearswas it not for him that she would guard them for his delight and his pride and if she were to see him no more if she were to be forced to bid him go from her of what avail would it be now to her to cherish and maintain the unsullied brightness of her womans armour if he were lost to her everything was lost she would go to him and throwing herself at his feet would swear to him that life without his love was no longer possible for her if he would then take her as his wife she would strive to bless him with all that the tenderness of a wife could give if he should refuse herthen she would go away and die in such case what to her would be the judgment of any man or any woman what to her would be her sisters scorn and the malignant virtue of such as miss pucker and mr prong what the upturned hands and amazement of mr comfort it would have been they who had driven her to this  but how about her mother when she should have thus thrown herself overboard from the ship and cast herself away from the pilotage which had hitherto been the guide of her conduct whywhywhy had her mother deserted her in her need as she thought of her mother she knew that her plan of rebellion was nothing but whywhy had her mother deserted her  as for him and these new tidings which had come to the cottage respecting him she would have cared for them not a jot mrs cornbury had cautioned her not to believe all that she heard but she had already declinedhad altogether declined to believe any of it it was to her whether believed or disbelieved matter altogether irrelevant a wife does not cease to love her husband because he gets into trouble she does not turn against him because others have quarrelled with him she does not separate her lot from his because he is in debt those are the times when a wife a true wife sticks closest to her husband and strives the hardest to lighten the weight of his cares by the tenderness of her love and had she not been permitted to place herself in that position with regard to him when she had been permitted to love him in all her thoughts she recognized the right of her mother to have debarred her from the privilege of loving this man if such embargo had been placed on her before her love had been declared she had never even within her own bosom assumed to herself the right of such privilege without authority expressed but her very soul revolted against this withdrawal of the sanction that had been given to her the spirit within her rebelled though she knew that she would not carry on that rebellion by word or deed but she had been injuredinjured almost to death injured even to death itself as regarded all that life could give her worth her taking as she thought of this injury that fierce look of which i have spoken came across her brow she would obey her pastors and masters yes she would obey them but she could never again be soft and pliable within their hands obedience in this matter was a necessity to her in spite of that wild thought of throwing off her maiden bonds and allowing her female armour to be splashed and sullied in the gutter she knew that there was that which would hinder her from the execution of such scheme she was bound by her womans lot to maintain her womanly purity let her suffer as she might there was nothing for her but obedience she could not go forth as though she were a man and claim her right to stand or fall by her love she had been injured in being brought to such plight as this but she would bear her injury as best might be within her power  she was still thinking of all this and still sitting with her eyes turned towards the tower of the church when she was touched on the back by a light hand she turned round quickly startled by the touchfor she had heard no footstepand saw martha tappitt and cherry it was cherry who had come close upon her and it was cherrys voice that she first heard a penny for your thoughts said cherry  oh you have so startled me said rachel  then i suppose your thoughts were worth more than a penny perhaps you were thinking of an absent knight and then cherry began to singaway away away he loves and he rides away  poor rachel blushed and was unable to speak dont be so foolish said martha to her sister its ever so long since weve seen you rachel why dont you come and walk with us  yes indeedwhy dont you said cherry whose goodnature was quite as conspicuous as her bad taste she knew now that she had vexed rachel and was thoroughly sorry that she had done so if any other girl had quizzed her about her lover it would not have annoyed her and she had not understood at first that rachel ray might be different from herself i declare we have hardly seen you since the night of the party and we think it very illnatured in you not to come to us do come and walk tomorrow  oh thank younot tomorrow because my sister is coming out from baslehurst to spend the evening with us  wellon saturday then said cherry persistingly  but rachel would make no promise to walk with them on any day she felt that she must henceforth be divided from the tappitts had not he quarrelled with mr tappitt and could it be fitting that she should keep up any friendship with the family that was hostile to him she was also aware that mrs tappitt was among those who were desirous of robbing her of her lover mrs tappitt was her enemy as mr tappitt was his she asked herself no question as to that duty of forgiving them the injuries they had done her but she felt that she was divided from themfrom mr and mrs tappitt and also from the girls and moreover in her present strait she wanted no friend she could not talk to any friend about her lover and she could not bring herself even to think on any other subject  its late she said and i must go home as mamma will be expecting me  cherry had almost replied that she had not been in so great a hurry once before when she had stood in the churchyard with another companion but she thought of rachels reproachful face when her last little joke had been uttered and she refrained  shes over head and ears in love said cherry to her sister when rachel was gone  im afraid she has been very foolish said martha seriously  i dont see that she has been foolish at all hes a very nice fellow and as far as i can see hes just as fond of her as she is of him  but we know what that means with young men said martha who was sufficiently serious in her way of thinking to hold by that doctrine as to wolves in sheeps clothing in which mrs ray had been educated  but young men do marrysometimes said cherry  but not merely for the sake of a pretty face or a good figure i believe mamma is right in that and i dont think hell come back again  if he were my lover id have him back said cherry stoutlyand so they went away to the brewery  rachel on her way home determined that she would write her letter that night her mother was to read it when it was written that was understood to be the agreement between them but there would be no reason why she should not be alone when she wrote it she could word it very differently she thought if she sat alone over it in her own bedroom than she could do immediately under her mothers eye she could not pause and think and perhaps weep over it sitting at the parlour table with her mother in her armchair close by watching her it needed that she should write it with tears with many struggles with many baffled attempts to find the words that would be wantedwith her very hearts blood it must not be tender no she was prepared to omit all tenderness and it must probably be shortbut if so its very shortness would be another difficulty as she walked along she could not tell herself with what words she would write it but she thought that the words would perhaps come to her if she waited long enough for them in the solitude of her own chamber  she reached home by nine oclock and sat with her mother for an hour reading out loud some book on which they were then engaged  i think ill go to bed now mamma she said  you always want to go to bed so soon said mrs ray i think you are getting tired of reading out loud that will be very sad for me with my eyes  no im not mamma and ill go on again for half an hour if you please but i thought you liked going to bed at ten  the watch was consulted and as it was not quite ten rachel did go on for another halfhour and then she went up to her bedroom  she sat herself down at her open window and looked out for a while upon the heavens the summer moon was at its full so that the green before the cottage was as clear before her as in the day and she could see over into the gloom of mr sturts farmyard across it she had once watched rowan as he came over the turf towards the cottage swinging his stick in his hand and now she gazed on the spot where the baslehurst road came in as though she expected that his figure might again appear she looked and looked thinking of this till she would hardly have been surprised had that figure really come forth upon the road but no figure was to be seen and after awhile she withdrew from the window and sat herself down at the little table it was very late when she undressed herself and went to her bed and later still when her eyes red with many tears were closed in sleepbut the letter had been written and was ready for her mothers inspection this was the letter as it stood after many struggles in the writing of it      braggs end    thursday 186     my dear mr rowan     i am much obliged to you for having written the letter    which i received from you the other day and i should have    answered it sooner only mamma thought it best to see mr    comfort first as he is our clergyman here and to ask his    advice i hope you will not be annoyed because i showed    your letter to mamma but i could not receive any letter    from you without doing so and i may as well tell you that    she will read this before it goes     and now that i have begun i hardly know how to write what    i have to say mr comfort and mamma have determined that    there must be nothing fixed as an engagement between us    and that for the present at least i may not correspond    with you this will be my first and last letter as that    will be so of course i shall not expect you to write any    more and i know that you will be very angry but if you    understood all my feelings i think that perhaps you would    not be very very angry i know it is true that when you    asked me that question i nodded my head as you say in    your letter if i had sworn the twenty oaths of which you    speak they would not as you say have bound me tighter    but neither could bind me to anything against mammas    will i thought that you were very generous to come to me    as you didoh so generous i dont know why you should    have looked to such a one as me to be your wife but i    would have done my best to make you happy had i been able    to do as i suppose you then wished me but you well know    that a man is very different from a girl and of course i    must do as mamma wishes     they say that as the business here about the brewery is so    very unsettled they think it probable that you will not    have to come back to baslehurst any more and that as our    acquaintance has been so very short it is not reasonable    to suppose that you will care much about me after a little    while perhaps it is not reasonable and after this i    shall have no right to be angry with you if you forget me    i dont think you will quite forget me but i shall never    expect or even hope to see you again  twice in writing her letter rachel cut out this latter assertion but at last sobbing in despair she restored the words what right would she have to hope that he would come to her after she had taken upon herself to break that promise which had been conveyed to him when she bent her head over his arm     i shall not forget you and i will always be your friend    as you said i should be being friends is very different    to anything else and nobody can say that i may not do    that     i will always remember what you showed me in the clouds    and indeed i went there this very evening to see if i    could see another arm but there was nothing there and i    have taken that as an omen that you will not come back to    baslehurst  to me had been the words as she had first written them but there was tenderness in those words and she found it necessary to alter them     i will now say goodbye to you for i have told you all    that i have to tell mamma desires that i will remember    her to you kindly     may god bless you and protect you always     believe me to be    your sincere friend     rachel ray   in the morning she took down the letter in her hand and gave it to her mother mrs ray read it very slowly and demurred over it at sundry places she especially demurred at that word about the omen and even declared that it ought to be expunged but rachel was very stern and held her ground she had put into the letter she said all that she had been bidden to say such a word from herself to one who had been so dear to her must be allowed to her  the letter was not altered and was taken away by the postman that evening     chapter vi  mrs ray goes to exeter and meets a friend   six weeks passed over them at braggs end and nothing was heard of luke rowan rachels letter a copy of which was given in our last chapter was duly sent away by the postman but no answer to it came to braggs end it must however be acknowledged that it not only required no answer but that it even refused to be answered rachel had told her lover that he was not to correspond with her and that she certainly would not write to him again having so said she had no right to expect an answer and she protested over and over again that she did expect none but still she would watch as she thought unseen for the postmans coming and her heart would sink within her as the man would pass the gate without calling he has taken me at my word she said to herself very bitterly i deserve nothing else from him butbutbut in those days she was ever silent and stern she did all that her mother bade her but she did little or nothing from love there were no more banquets with clotted cream brought over from mrs sturts she would speak a word or two now and then to mrs sturt who understood the whole case perfectly but such words were spoken on chance occasions for rachel now never went over to the farm farmer sturts assistance had been offered to her but what could the farmer do for her in such trouble as hers  during the whole of these six weeks she did her household duties but gradually she became slower in them and still more slow and her mother knew that her disappointment was becoming the source of permanent misery rachel never said that she was ill nor indeed of any special malady did she show signs but gradually she became thin and wan her cheeks assumed a haggard look and that aspect of the brow which her mother feared had become habitual to her mrs ray observed her closely in all that she did she knew well of those watchings for the postman she was always thinking of her child and after a while longing that luke rowan might come back to them with a heart almost as sore with longing as was that of rachel herself but what could she do she could not bring him back in all that she had donein giving her sanction to this lover and again in withdrawing it she had been guided by the advice of her clergyman should she go again to him and beg him to restore that young man to them ah no great as was her trust in her clergyman she knew that even he could not do that for her  during all these weeks hardly a word was spoken openly between the mother and daughter about the matter that chiefly occupied the thoughts of them both luke rowans name was hardly mentioned between them once or twice some allusion was made to the subject of the brewery for it was becoming generally known that the lawyers were already at work on behalf of rowans claim but even on such occasions as these mrs ray found that her speech was stopped by the expression of rachels eyes and by those two lines which on such occasions would mark her forehead in those days mrs ray became afraid of her younger daughteralmost more so than she had ever been afraid of the elder one rachel indeed never spoke as mrs prime would sometimes speak no word of scolding ever passed her mouth and in all that she did she was gentle and observant but there was ever on her countenance that look of reproach which by degrees was becoming almost unendurable and then her words during the day were so few she was so anxious to sit alone in her own room she would still read to her mother for some hours in the evening but this reading was to her so manifestly a task difficult and distasteful  it may be remembered that mrs prime with her lover mr prong and her friend miss pucker had promised to call at braggs end on the evening after rachels walk into baslehurst they did come as they had promised about half an hour after rachels letter to luke had been carried away by the postman they had come and had remained at braggs end for an hour eating cake and drinking currant wine but not having on the whole what our american friends call a good time of it that visit had been terrible to mrs ray rachel had sat there cold hard and speechless not only had she not asked miss pucker to take off her bonnet but she had absolutely declined to speak to that lady it was wonderful to her mother that she should thus in so short a time have become wilful masterful and resolved in following out her own purposes not one word on that occasion did she speak to miss pucker and mrs prime observing this had grown black and still blacker till the horror of the visit had become terrible to mrs ray miss pucker had grinned and smiled and striven gallantly poor woman to make the best of it she had declared how glad she had been to see miss rachel on the previous evening and how well miss rachel had looked and had expressed quite voluminous hopes that miss rachel would come to their dorcas meetings but to all this rachel answered not a syllable now and then she addressed a word or two to her sister now and then she spoke to her mother when mr prong specially turned himself to her asking her some question she would answer him with one or two monosyllables always calling him sir but to miss pucker she never once opened her mouth mrs prime became very angryvery black and very angry and the time of the visit was a terrible time to mrs ray  but this visit is to be noticed in our story chiefly on account of a few words which mr prong found an opportunity of saying to mrs ray respecting his proposed marriage mrs ray knew that there were difficulties about the money and was disposed to believe and perhaps to hope that the match would be broken off but on this occasion mr prong was very marked in his way of speaking to mrs ray as though everything were settled mrs ray was thoroughly convinced by this that it was so and her former beliefs and possible hopes were all dispersed but then mrs ray was easily convinced by any assertion in thus speaking to his future motherinlaw he had contrived to turn his back round upon the other three ladies so as to throw them together for the time and thus make their position the more painful it must be acknowledged that rachel was capable of something great after her determined resistance to miss puckers blandishments under such circumstances as these  mrs ray mr prong had saidand as he spoke his voice was soft with mingled love and sanctityi cannot let this moment pass without expressing one word of what i feel at the prospect of connecting myself with your amiable family  im sure im much obliged mrs ray had answered  of course i am aware that dorothea has mentioned the matter to you  oh yes she has mentioned it certainly  and therefore i should be remiss both as regards duty and manners if i did not take this opportunity of assuring you how much gratification i feel in becoming thus bound up in family affection with you and miss rachel family ties are sweet bonds of sanctified love and as i have none of my ownnearer that is than geelong the colony of victoria where my mother and brother and sisters have located themselvesi shall feel the more pleasure in taking you and miss rachel to my heart  this was complimentary to mrs ray but with her peculiar feelings as to the expediency of people having their own belongings she almost thought that it would have been better for all parties if mr prong had gone to geelong with the rest of the prong family this opinion however she did not express as to taking mr prong to her heart she felt some doubts of her own capacity for such a performance it would be natural for her to love a soninlaw she had loved mr prime very dearly and trusted him thoroughly she would have been prepared to love luke rowan had fate been propitious in that quarter but she could not feel secure as to loving mr prong such love moreover should come naturally of its own growth and not be demanded categorically as a right it certainly was a pity that mr prong had not made himself happy with that happiness for which he sighed in the bosom of his family at geelong im sure youre very kind mrs ray had said  and when we are thus united in the bonds of this world continued mr prong i do hope that other bonds more holy in their nature even than those of family more needful even than them may join us together dorothea has for some months past been a constant attendant at my church  oh i couldnt leave mr comfort indeed i couldnt said mrs ray in alarm i couldnt go away from my own parish church was it ever so  no no not altogether perhaps i am not sure that it would be desirable but will it not be sweet mrs ray when we are bound together as one family to pour forth our prayers in holy communion together  i think so much of my own parish church mr prong mrs ray replied after that mr prong did not on that occasion press the matter further and soon turned round his chair so as to relieve the three ladies behind him  i think we had better be going mr prong said mrs prime rising from her seat with a display of anger in the very motion of her limbs goodevening mother goodevening to you rachel im afraid our visit has put you out had i guessed as much we would not have come  you know dolly that i am always glad to see youonly you come to us so seldom said rachel then with a very cold bow to miss pucker with a very warm pressure of the hand from mr prong and with a sisterly embrace for dorothea that was not cordial as it should have been she bade them goodbye it was felt by all of them that the visit had been a failureit was felt so at least by all the ray family mr prong had achieved a certain object in discussing his marriage as a thing settled and as regarded miss pucker she also had achieved a certain object in eating cake and drinking wine in mrs rays parlour  for some weeks after that but little had been seen of mrs prime at the cottage and nothing had been said of her matrimonial prospects rachel did not once go to her sisters lodgings and on the few occasions of their meeting asked no questions as to mr prong indeed as the days and weeks went on her heart became too heavy to admit of her asking any questions about the love affairs of others she still went about her work as i have before said she was not illnot ill so as to demand the care due to an invalid but she moved about the house slowly as though her limbs were too heavy for her she spoke little unless when her mother addressed her she would sit for hours on the sofa doing nothing reading nothing and looking at nothing but still at the postmans morning hours she would keep her eye upon the road over which he came and that dull look of despair would come across her face when he passed on without calling at the cottage  but on a certain morning towards the end of the six weeks the postman did callas indeed he had called on other days though bringing with him no letter from luke rowan neither now on this occasion did he bring a letter from luke rowan the letter was addressed to mrs ray and as rachel well knew from the handwriting it was from the gentleman who managed her mothers little money mattersthe gentleman who had succeeded to the business left by mr ray when he died so rachel took the letter up to her mother and left it saying that it was from mr goodall  mrs rays small income arose partly from certain cottages in baslehurst which had been let in lump to a baslehurst tradesman and partly from shares in a gas company at exeter now the gas company at exeter was the better investment of the two and was considered to be subject to less uncertainty than the cottages the lease under which the cottages had been let was out and mrs ray had been advised to sell the property building ground near the town was rising in value and she had been advised by mr goodall to part with her little estate both mrs ray and rachel were aware that this business to them very important was imminent and now had come a letter from mr goodall saying that mrs ray must go to exeter to conclude the sale we should only bungle matters mr goodall had said if i were to send the deeds down to you and as it is absolutely necessary that you should understand all about it i think you had better come up on tuesday you can get back to baslehurst easily on the same day  my dear said mrs ray coming into the parlour i must go to exeter  today mamma  no not today but on tuesday mr goodall says i must understand all about the sale it is a dreadful trouble  but dreadful as the trouble was it seemed that mrs ray was not made unhappy by the prospect of the little expedition she fussed and fretted as ladies do on such occasions butas is also common with ladiesthe excitement of the journey was upon the whole a gratification to her she asked rachel to accompany her and at first pressed her to do so strongly but such work at the present moment was not in accord with rachels mood and at last she escaped from it under the plea of expense  i think it would be foolish mamma she said now that dolly has gone you will be run very close and when mr goodall first spoke of selling the cottages he said that perhaps you might be without anything from them for a quarter  but he has sold them now my dear and there will be the money at once  i dont see why you should throw away ten and sixpence mamma said rachel  and as she spoke in that resolved and masterful tone her mother of course gave up the point so when the tuesday morning came she went with her mother only as far as the station  dont mind meeting me because i cant be sure about the train said mrs ray but i shall be back tonight certainly  and ill wait tea for you said rachel then when her mother was gone she walked back to the cottage by herself  she walked back at once but took a most devious course she was determined to avoid the length of the high street and she was determined also to avoid brewery lane but she was equally determined to pass through the churchyard so she walked down from the railway station to the hamlet at the bottom of the hill below the church and from thence went up by the fieldpath to the stile in order to accomplish this she went fully two miles out of her way and now the sun over her head was very hot but what was the distance or the heat of the sun to her when her object was to stand for a few moments in that place her visit however to the spot which was so constantly in her thoughts did her no good why had she been so injured why had this sacrifice of herself been demanded from her as she sat for a moment on the stile this was the matter that filled her breast she had been exalted to the heavens when she first heard her mother speak of mr rowan as an acceptable suitor she had been filled with joy as though paradise had been opened to her when she found herself to be the promised bride of luke rowan then had come her lovers letter and the clergymans counsel and her own reply and after that the gates of her paradise had been closed against her i wonder whether its the same thing to him she said to herself but i suppose not i dont think it can be the same thing or he would come wouldnt i go to him if i were free as he is she barely rested in the churchyard and then walked on between the elms at a quick pace with a heart soresore almost to breaking she would never have been brought to this condition had not her mother told her that she might love him thence came her vexation of spirit there was the cruelty all the world knew that this man had been her loverall her world knew it cherry tappitt had sung her little witless song about it mrs tappitt had called at the cottage about it mr comfort had given his advice about it mrs cornbury had whispered to her about it out of her pony carriage mrs sturt had counselled her about it mr prong had thought it very wrong on her part to love the man mr sturt had thought it very right and had offered his assistance all this would have been as nothing had her lover remained to her cherry might have sung till her little throat was tired and mr prong might have expressed his awe with outspread hands and have looked as though he expected the skies to fall had her paradise not been closed to her all this talking would have been a thing of course but such talkingsuch widespread knowledge of her condition with the gates of her paradise closed against her was very hard to bear and who had closed the gates her own hands had done it he her lover had not deserted her he had done for her all that truth and earnestness demanded and perhaps as much as love required men were not so soft as girls she argued within her own breast let a man be ever so true it could not be expected that he should stand by his love after he had been treated with such cold indifference as had been shown in her letter she would have stood by her love let his letter have been as cold as it might but then she was a woman and her love once encouraged had become a necessity to her a man she said to herself would be more proud but less stanch of course she would hear no more from him of course the gates of her paradise were shut such were her thoughts as she walked home and such the thoughts over which she sat brooding alone throughout the entire day  at halfpast seven in the evening mrs ray came back home wearily trudging across the green she was very weary for she had now walked above two miles from the station she had also been on her feet half the day and which was probably worse than all the rest had she known it she had travelled nearly eighty miles by railway she was very tired and would under ordinary circumstances have been disposed to reckon up her grievances in the evening quite as accurately as rachel had reckoned hers in the morning but something had occurred in exeter the recollection of which still overcame the sense of weariness which mrs ray feltovercame it or rather overtopped it so that when rachel came out to her at the cottage door she did not speak at once of her own weariness but looked lovingly into her daughters facelovingly and anxiously and said some little word intended to denote affection  you must be very tired said rachel who with many selfreproaches and much communing within her own bosom had for the time vanquished her own hard humour  yes i am tired my dear very i thought the train never would have got to the baslehurst station it stopped at all the little stations and really i think i could have walked as fast a dozen years had not as yet gone by since the velocity of these trains had been so terrible to mrs ray that she had hardly dared to get into one of them  and whom have you seen said rachel  seen said mrs ray who told you that i had seen anybody  i suppose you saw mr goodall  oh yes i saw him of course i saw him and the cottages are all sold we shall have seven pounds ten a year more than before im sure it will be a very great comfort seven pounds ten will buy so many things  but ten pounds would buy more  of course it would my dear and i told mr goodall i wished he could make it ten as it would make it sound so much more regular like but he said he couldnt do it because the gas has gone up so much he could have done it if i had sixty pounds but of course i hadnt  but mamma whom did you see except mr goodall i know you saw somebody and you must tell me  thats nonsense rachel you cant know that i saw anybody it may however be well to explain at once the cause of mrs rays hesitation and that this may be done in the proper course we will go back to her journey to exeter all the incidents of her day may be told very shortly but there was one incident in her day which filled her with so much anxiety and almost dismay that it must be narrated  on arriving at exeter she got into an omnibus which would have taken her direct to mr goodalls office in the close but she was minded to call at a shop in the high street and had herself put down at the corner of one of those passages which lead from the high street to the close she got down from the step of the vehicle very carefully as is the wont with middleaged ladies from the country and turned round to walk directly into the shop but before her on the pavement she saw luke rowan he was standing close to her so that it was impossible that they should have pretended to miss seeing each other even had they been so minded any such pretence would have been impossible to mrs ray and would have been altogether contrary to luke rowans nature he had been coming out of the shop and had been arrested at once by mrs rays figure as he saw it emerging from the door of the omnibus  how dyou do said he coming forward with outstretched hand and speaking as though there was nothing between him and mrs ray which required any peculiar word or tone  oh mr rowan is this you said she dear dear im sure i didnt expect to see you in exeter  i dare say not mrs ray and i didnt expect to see you but the odd thing is ive come here about the same business as you though i didnt know anything about it till yesterday  what business mr rowan  ive bought your cottages in baslehurst  no  but i have and ive paid for them too and youre going this very minute to mr goodall to sign the deed of sale isnt that true so you see i know all about it  well that is strange isnt it now  the fact is i must have a bit of land at baslehurst for building tappitt will go on fighting and as i dont mean to be beaten ill have a place of my own there  and youll pull down the cottages  if i dont pull him down first so as to get the old brewery i was obliged to buy your bit of ground now as i might not have been able to get any just when i wanted it youve sold it a deal too cheap you tell mr goodall i say so  but he says im to gain something by selling it  does he if it is so im very glad of it i only came down from london yesterday to finish this piece of business and im going back today  during all this time not a word had been said about rachel he had not even asked after her in the ordinary way in which men ask after their ordinary acquaintance he had not looked as though he were in the least embarrassed in speaking to rachels mother and now it seemed as though he were going away as though all had been said between them that he cared to say mrs ray at the first moment had dreaded any special word but now as he was about to leave her she felt disappointed that no special word had been spoken but he was not as yet gone  i literally havent a minute to spare he said offering her his hand for a second time for ive two or three people to see before i get to the train  goodbye said mrs ray  goodbye mrs ray i dont think ive been very well treated among you i dont indeed but i wont say any more about that at present is she quite well  pretty well thank you said she all of a tremble  i wont send her any message as things are at present no message would be of any service goodbye and so saying he went from her  mrs ray at that moment had no time for making up her mind as to what she would do or say in consequence of this meetingor whether she would do or say anything she looked forward to all the leisure time of her journey home for thinking of that so she finished her shopping and hurried on to mr goodalls office without resolving whether or no she would tell rachel of the encounter at mr goodalls she remained some little time dining at that gentlemans house as well as signing the deed and asking questions about the gas company he had grateful recollections of kindnesses received from mr ray and always exercised his hospitality on those rare occasions which brought mrs ray up to exeter as they sat at table he asked questions about the young purchaser of the property which somewhat perplexed mrs ray yes she said she did know him she had just met him in the street and heard his news young rowan she told her friend had been at the cottage more than once but no mention had been made of his desire to buy these cottages was he well spoken of in baslehurst wellshe was so little in baslehurst that she hardly knew she had heard that he had quarrelled with mr tappitt and she believed that many people had said that he was wrong in his quarrel she knew nothing of his property but certainly had heard somebody say that he had gone away without paying his debts it may easily be conceived how miserable and ineffective she would be under this crossexamination although it was made by mr goodall without any allusion to rachel  at any rate we have got our money said mr goodall and i suppose thats all we care about but i should say hes rather a harumscarum sort of fellow why he should leave his debts behind him i cant understand as he seems to have plenty of money  all this made mrs rays task the more difficult during the last two or three weeks she had been wishing that she had not gone to mr comfortwishing that she had allowed rachel to answer rowans letter in any terms of warmest love that she might have chosenwishing in fact that she had permitted the engagement to go on but now she began again to think that she had been right if this man were in truth a harumscarum fellow was it not well that rachel should be quit of himeven with any amount of present sorrow thinking of this on her way back to baslehurst she again made up her mind that rowan was a wolf but she had not made up her mind as to what she would or what she would not tell rachel about the meeting even when she reached her own door i will send her no message he had said as things are at present no message would be of service what had he meant by this what purpose on his part did these words indicate these questions mrs ray had asked herself but had failed to answer them  but no resolution on mrs rays part to keep the meeting secret would have been of avail even had she made such resolution the fact would have fallen from her as easily as water falls from a sieve rachel would have extracted from her the information had she been ever so determined not to impart it as things had turned out she had at once given rachel to understand that she had met some one in exeter whom she had not expected to meet  but mamma whom did you see except mr goodall rachel asked i know you saw somebody and you must tell me  thats nonsense rachel you cant know that i saw anybody  after that there was a pause for some moments and then rachel persisted in her inquiry but mamma i do know that you met somebodythen there was another pausemamma was it mr rowan  mrs ray stood convicted at once had she not spoken a word the form of her countenance when the question was asked would have answered it with sufficient clearness but she did speak a word well yes it was mr rowan he had come down to exeter on business  and what did he say mamma  he didnt say anythingat least nothing particular it is he that has bought the cottages and he had come down from london about that he told me that he wanted some ground near baslehurst because he couldnt get the brewery  and what else did he say mamma  i tell you that he said nothing else  he didntdidnt mention me then  mrs ray had been looking away from rachel during this conversationhad been purposely looking away from her but now there was a tone of agony in her childs voice which forced her to glance round ah me she beheld so piteous an expression of woe in rachels face that her whole heart was melted within her and she began to wish instantly that they might have rowan back again with all his faults  tell me the truth mamma i may as well know it  well my dear he didnt mention your name but he did say a word about you  what word mamma  he said he would send no message because it would be no good  he said that did he  yes he said that and so i suppose he meant it would be no good sending anything till he came himself  no mamma he didnt mean quite that i understand what he meant as it is to be so he was quite right no message could be of any use it has been my own doing and i have no right to blame him mamma if you dont mind i think ill go to bed  my dear youre wrong im sure youre wrong he didnt mean that  didnt he mamma and as she spoke a sad weary wobegone smile came over her facea smile so sad and piteous that it went to her mothers heart more keenly than would have done any sound of sorrow any sobs or wail of grief but i think he did mean that mamma its no good doubting or fearing any longer its all over now  and it has been my fault  no dearest it has not been your fault nor do i think that it has been mine i think wed better not talk of faults ah deari do wish he had never come here  perhaps it may be all well yet rachel  perhaps it mayin another world it will never be well again for me in this goodnight mamma you must never think that i am angry with you  then she went up stairs leaving mrs ray alone with her sorrow     chapter vii  domestic politics at the brewery   in the mean time things were not going on very pleasantly at the brewery and mr tappitt was making himself unpleasant in the bosom of his family a lawsuit will sometimes make a man extremely pleasant company to his wife and children even a losing lawsuit will sometimes do so if he be well backed up in his pugnacity by his lawyer and if the matter of the battle be one in which he can take a delight to fight ah a man will say though i spend a thousand pounds over it ill stick to him like a burr he shant shake me off and at such times he is almost sure to be in a good humour and in a generous mood then let his wife ask him for money for a dinnerparty and his daughters for new dresses he has taught himself for the moment to disregard money and to think that he can sow fivepound notes broadcast without any inward pangs but such was by no means the case with mr tappitt his lawyer honyman was not backing him up and as cool reflection came upon him he was afraid of trusting his interests to those other men sharpit and longfite and mrs tappitt when cool reflection came on her had begun to dread the ruin which it seemed possible that terrible young man might inflict upon them she had learned already though mrs ray had not how false had been that report which had declared luke rowan to be frivolous idle and in debt to her it was very manifest that honyman was afraid of the young man and honyman though he might not be as keen as some others was at any rate honest honyman also thought that if the brewery were given up to rowan that thousand a year which had been promised would be paid regularly and to this solution of the difficulty mrs tappitt was gradually bending herself to submit as the best which an untoward fate offered to them honyman himself had declared to her that mr tappitt if he were well advised would admit rowan in as a partner on equal terms as regarded power and ultimate possession but with that lions share of the immediate concern for himself which rowan offered but this she knew that tappitt would not endure and she knew also that if he were brought to endure it for a while it would ultimately lead to terrible sorrows they would be knocking each other about with the pokers mr honyman she had said and where would the custom be when that got into the newspapers if i were mr tappitt i would just let him have his own way honyman had replied that shows that you dont know tappitt had been mrs tappitts rejoinder nothe thousand a year and dignified retirement in a villa had recommended itself to mrs tappitts mind she would use all her influence to attain that positionif only she could bring herself to feel assured that the thousand a year would be forthcoming  as to tappitt himself he was by no means so anxious to prolong the battle as he had been at the time of rowans departure his courage for fighting was not maintained by good backing had honyman clapped him on the shoulder and bade him put ready money in his purse telling him that all would come out right eventually and that rowan would be crushed he would have gone about baslehurst boasting loudly and would have been happy then mrs t and the girls would have had a merry time of it and the tappitts would have come out of the contest with four or five hundred a year for life instead of the thousand now offered to them and nobody would have blamed anybody for such a result but honyman had not spirit for such backing in his dull slow droning way he had shaken his head and said that things were looking badly then tappitt had cursed and had sworn and had half resolved to go to sharpit and longfite sharpit and longfite would have clapped him on the back readily enough and have bade him put plenty of money in his purse but we may suppose that fate did not intend the ruin of tappitt seeing that she did not make him mad enough to seek the counsels of sharpit and longfite fate only made him very cross and unpleasant in the bosom of his family looking out himself for some mode of escape from this terrible enemy that had come upon him he preferred the raising of the sum of money which would be necessary to buy off rowan altogether rowan had demanded ten thousand pounds but tappitt still thought that seven or at any rate eight thousand would do it  i dont think hell take less than ten said honyman because his share is really worth as much as that  this was very provoking and who can wonder that tappitt was not pleasant company in his own house  on the day after mrs rays visit to exeter tappitt as was now his almost daily practice made his way into mr honymans little back room and sat there with his hat on discussing his affairs  i find that mr rowan has bought those cottages of the widow rays said honyman  nonsense shouted tappitt as though such a purchase on rowans part was a new injury done to himself  oh but he has said honyman theres not a doubt in life about it if he does mean to build a new brewery it wouldnt be a bad place you see its out of the thoroughfare of the town and yet as one may say within a stones throw of the high street  i will not repeat mr tappitts exclamation as he listened to these suggestions of his lawyer but it was of a nature to show that he had not heard the news with indifference  you see hes such a fellow that you dont know where to have him continued honyman its not only that he dont mind ruining you but he dont mind ruining himself either  i dont believe hes got anything to lose  ah thats where youre wrong he has paid ready money for this bit of land to begin with or goodall would never have let him have it goodall knows what hes about as well as any man  and do you mean to tell me that hes going to put up buildings there at once and tappitts face as he asked the question would have softened the heart of any ordinary lawyer but honyman was one whom nothing could harden and nothing soften  i dont know what hes going to put up mr tappitt and i dont know when but i know this well enough that when a man buys little bits of property about a place it shows that he means to do something there  if he had twenty thousand pounds hed lose it all  thats very likely but the question is how would you fare in the mean time if he hadnt this claim upon you of course youd let him build what he liked and only laugh at him then mr tappitt uttered another exclamation and pulling his hat tighter on to his head walked out of the lawyers office and returned to the brewery  they dined at three oclock at the brewery and during dinner on this day the father of the family made himself very disagreeable he scolded the maidservant till the poor girl didnt know the spoons from the forks he abused the cooks performances till that valuable old retainer declared that if master got so rampageous he might suit hisself the sooner the better she didnt care how soon shed cooked victuals for his betters and would again he snarled at his daughters till they perked up their faces and came silently to a mutual agreement that they would not condescend to notice him further while he held on in his present mood and he replied to his wifes questionsquestions intended to be soothing and kindly conjugalin such a tone that she determined to have it out with him before she allowed him to go to bed she knew her duty she said to herself and she could stand a good deal but there were some things she couldnt stand and some things that werent her duty after dinner tappitt took himself out at once to his office in the brewery and then for the first time saw the baslehurst gazette and totnes chronicle for that week the baslehurst gazette and totnes chronicle was an enterprising weekly newspaper which had been originally intended to convey on sunday mornings to the inhabitants of south devonshire the news of the past week and the paper still bore the dates of successive sundays but it had gradually pushed itself out into the light of its own world before its own date gaining first a night and then a day till now at the period of which i am speaking it was published on the friday morning  you ought just to look at this a burly old foreman had said handing him the paper in question with his broad thumb placed upon a certain column this foreman had known bungall and though he respected tappitt he did not fear him you should just look at this of course it dont amount to nothing but its as well to see what folks say and he handed the paper to his master almost making a hole in it by screwing his thumb on to the spot he wished to indicate  tappitt read the article and his spirit was very bitter within him it was a criticism on his own beer written in no friendly tone there is no reason said the article why baslehurst should be flooded with a liquor which no christian ought to be asked to drink baslehurst is as capable of judging good beer from bad as any town in the british empire let mr tappitt look to it or some young rival will spring up beneath his feet and seize from his brow the hopleaf wreath which bungall won and wore this attack was the more cruel because the paper had originally been established by bungalls money and had in old days been altogether devoted to the bungall interest that this paper should turn against him was very hard but what else had he a right to expect it was known that he had promised his vote to the jew candidate and the paper in question supported the cornbury interest a man that lives in a glass house should throw no stones the brewer who brews bad beer should vote for nobody  but tappitt would not regard this attack upon him in its proper political light every evil at present falling upon him was supposed to come from his present enemy its that dirty underhand blackguard he said to the foreman  i dont think so mr tappitt said the foreman i dont think so indeed  but i tell you it is said tappitt and i dont care what you think  just as you please mr tappitt said the foreman who thereupon retired from the office leaving his master to meditate over the newspaper in solitude  it was a very bitter time for the poor brewer he was one of those men whose spirit is not wanting to them while the noise and tumult of contest are around them but who cannot hold on by their own convictions in the quiet hours he could storm and talk loud and insist on his own way while men stood around him listening and perhaps admiring but he was cowed when left by himself to think of things which seemed to be adverse what could he do if those around him who had known him all his life as those newspaper people had known himwhat could he do if they turned against him and talked of bad beer as rowan had talked he was not man enough to stand up and face this new enemy unless he were backed by his old friends honyman had told him that he would be beaten how would it fare with him and his family if he were beaten as he sat in his little office with his hat low down over his eyes balancing himself on the hind legs of his chair he abused honyman roundly had honyman been possessed of wit of skill of professional crafthad he been the master of any invention all might have been well but the attorney was a fool an ass a coward might it not be that he was a knave but luckily for honyman and luckily also for mr tappitt himself this abuse did not pass beyond the precincts of tappitts own breast we all know how delightful is the privilege of abusing our nearest friends after this fashion but we generally satisfy ourselves with that limited audience to which mr tappitt addressed himself on the present occasion  in the mean time mrs tappitt was sitting upstairs in the brewery drawingroom with her daughters and she also was not happy in her mind she had been snubbed and almost browbeaten at dinner time and she also had had a little conversation in private with mr honyman she had been snubbed and if she did not look well about her she was going to be ruined you mustnt let him go on with this lawsuit mr honyman had said hell certainly get the worst of it if he does and then hell have to pay double she disliked rowan quite as keenly as did her husband but she was fully alive to the folly of spiting rowan by doing an injury to her own face she would speak to tappitt that night very seriously and in the mean time she turned the rowan controversy over in her own mind endeavouring to look at it from all sides it had never been her custom to make critical remarks on their fathers conduct to any of the girls except martha but on the present great occasion she waived that rule and discussed the family affairs in full female family conclave i dont know whats come over your papa she began by saying he seems quite beside himself today  i think he is troubled about mr rowan and this lawsuit said the sagacious martha  nasty man i wish hed never come near the place said augusta  i dont know that hes very nasty either said cherry we all liked him when he was staying here  but to be so false to papa said augusta i call it swindling downright swindling  one should know and understand all about it before one speaks in that way said martha i dare say it is very vexatious to papa but after all perhaps mr rowan may have some right on his side  i dont know about right said mrs tappitt i dont think he can have any right to come and set himself up here in opposition as one may say to the very ghost of his own uncle i agree with augusta and think it is a very dirty thing to do  quite shameful said augusta indignantly  but if he has got the law on his side continued mrs tappitt its no good your papa trying to go against that where should we be if we were to lose everything and be told to pay more money than your papa has got it wouldnt be very pleasant to be turned out of the house  i dont think hed ever do it said cherry  i declare cherry i think you are in love with the man said augusta  if i aint i know who was said cherry  as for love said mrs tappitt we all know who is in love with himnasty little sly minx in the whole matter nothing makes me so angry as to think that she should have come here to our dance  that was cherrys doing said augusta this remark cherry noticed only by a grimace addressed specially to her sister a battle in rachels favour under present circumstances would have been so losing an affair that cherry had not pluck enough to adventure it on her friends behalf  but the question iswhat are we to do about the lawsuit said mrs tappitt it is easy to see from your papas manner that he is very much harassed he wont admit him as a partnerthats certain  oh dear i should hope not said augusta  thats all very well said martha but if the young man can prove his right he must have it mamma do you know what mr honyman says about it  yes my dear i do mrs tappitts manner became very solemn and the girls listened with all their ears yes my dear i do mr honyman thinks your father should give way  and take him in as a partner said augusta papa has got that spirit that he couldnt do it  it doesnt follow that your papa should take mr rowan in as a partner because he gives up the lawsuit he might pay him the money that he asks  but has he got it demanded martha  besides its such a deal isnt it said augusta  or continued mrs tappitt your papa might accept his offer by retiring with a very handsome income for us all your papa has been in business for a great many years working like a galleyslave nobody knows how he has toiled and moiled except me it isnt any joke being a brewerand having it all on himself as he has had and if young rowan ever begins it i wish him joy of it  but would he pay the income martha asked  mr honyman says that he would and if he did not there would be the property to fall back upon  and where should we live said cherry  that cant be settled quite yet it must be somewhere near so that your papa might keep an eye on the concern and know that it was going all right perhaps torquay would be the best place  torquay would be delicious said cherry  and would that man come and live at the brewery said augusta  of course he would if he pleased said martha  and bring rachel ray with him as his wife said cherry  hell never do that said mrs tappitt with energy  never never said augustawith more energy  in this way the large and influential feminine majority of the family at the brewery was brought round to look at one of the propositions made by rowan without disfavour it was not that that young mans sins had been in any degree forgiven but that they all perceived with female prudence that it would be injudicious to ruin themselves because they hated him and then to what lady living in a dingy brick house close adjoining to the smoke and smells of beerbrewing would not the idea of a marine villa at torquay be delicious none of the family not even mrs tappitt herself had ever known what annual profit had accrued to mr t as the reward of his lifes work but they had been required to live in a modest homely wayas though that annual profit had not been great under the altered circumstances as now proposed they would all know that papa had a thousand a year to spendand what might not be done at torquay with a thousand a year before mr tappitt came home for the eveningwhich he did not do on that day till past ten having been detained by business in the bar of the dragon innthey had all resolved that the combined ease and dignity of a thousand a year should be accepted  mr tappitt was still perturbed in spirit when he took himself to the marital chamber what had been the nature of the business which had detained him at the bar of the dragon he did not condescend to say but it seemed to have been of a nature not well adapted to smooth his temper mrs tappitt perhaps guessed what that business had been but if so she said nothing of the subject in direct words one little remark she did make which may perhaps have had allusion to that business  bah she exclaimed as mr tappitt came near her if you must smoke at all i wish to goodness youd smoke good tobacco  so i do said tappitt turning round at her sharply its best mixed birdseye as if you could know the difference indeed  so i do t i know the difference very well its all poison to meabsolute poisonas youre very well aware but that filthy strong stuff that youve taken to lately is enough to kill anybody  i havent taken to any filthy strong stuff said tappitt  this was the beginning of that evenings conversation i am inclined to think that mrs tappitt had made her calculations and had concluded that she could put forth her coming observations more efficaciously by having her husband in bad humour than she could if she succeeded in coaxing him into a good humour i think that she made the above remarks not solely because the fumes of tobacco were distasteful to her but because the possession of a grievance might give her an opportunity of commencing the forthcoming debate with some better amount of justified indignation on her own side it was not often that she begrudged tappitt his pipe or made illnatured remarks about his gin and water  t she said when tappitt had torn off his coat in some anger at the allusion to filthy strong stufft what do you mean to do about this lawsuit  i dont mean to do anything  thats nonsense t you must do something you know what does mr honyman say  honyman is a fool  nonsense t hes not a fool or if he is why have you let him manage your affairs so long but i dont believe hes a fool at all i believe he knows what hes talking about quite as well as some others who pretend to be so clever as to your going to sharpit and longfite its quite out of the question  whos talking of going to them  you did talk of it  no i didnt you heard me mention their names but i never said that i should go to them at all i almost wish i had  now t dont talk in that way or youll really put me beside myself  i dont want to talk of it at all i only want to go to bed  but we must talk of it t its all very well for you to say you dont want to talk of things but what is to become of me and my girls if everything goes astray at the brewery you cant expect me to sit by quiet and see you ruined  who talks about my being ruined  well i believe all baslehurst pretty well is talking about it if a man will go on with a lawsuit when his own lawyer says he oughtnt what else can come to him but ruin  you dont know anything about it i wish youd hold your tongue and let me go to bed  i do know something about it mr tappitt and i wont hold my tongue its all very well for you to bid me hold my tongue but am i to sit by and see you ruined and the girls left without a bit to eat or a thing to wear goodness knows ive never thought much about myself nobody will ever say that of me but it has come to this t that something must be settled about rowans claim if he hasnt got justice hes got law on his side and he seems to be one of those who dont care much as long as hes got that if you ask me t  but i didnt ask you said tappitt  tappitt never actually succumbed in these matrimonial encounters and would always maintain courage for a sharp word even to the last  no i know you didntand more shame to you not to consult the wife of your bosom and the mother of your children when such an affair as this has to be settled but if you think im going to hold my tongue youre mistaken i know very well how things are going you must either let this young man come in as a partner  ill be   tappitt would not have disgraced himself by such an exclamation in his wifes bedroom as he then used if his business in the bar of the dragon had been legitimate  very well sir i say nothing about the coarseness of your language on the present occasion though i might say a great deal if i pleased but if you dont choose to have him for a partnerwhy then you must do something else  of course i must  exactlyand therefore the only thing is for you to take the offer of a thousand a year that he has made now t dont begin cursing and swearing again because you know that cant do any good honyman says that hell pay the incomeand if he dontif he gets into arrear with it then you can come down upon him and turn him out think how youd like that youve only just to keep a little ready money by you so that youll have something for six months or so if he should get into arrear  and im to give up everything myself  no t you would not give up anything quite the other way you would have every comfort round you that any man can possibly want you cant go on at it always toiling and moiling as youre doing now its quite dreadful for a man never to have a moment to himself at your time of life and of course it must tell on any constitution if its kept up too long youre not the man you were t and of course you couldnt expect it  oh bother  thats all very well but its my duty to see these things and to think of them and to speak of them too where should i be and the girls if you was hurried into your grave by working too hard mrs tappitts voice as this terrible suggestion fell from her was almost poetic through the depth of its solemnity do you think i dont know what it is that takes you to the dragon so late at night  i dont go to the dragon late at night  im not finding fault t and you neednt answer me so sharp its only natural you should want something to sustain you after such slavery as you have to go through im not unreasonable i know very well what a man is and what it is he can do and what he cant it would be all very well your going on if you had a partner you could trust  nothing on earth shall induce me to carry on with that fellow  and therefore you ought to take him at his word and retire it would be the gentlemanlike thing to do of course youd have the power of going over and seeing that things was straight and if we was living comfortable at some genteel place such as torquay or the like of course you wouldnt want to be going out to dragons every evening then i shouldnt wonder if in two or three years you didnt find yourself as strong as ever again  tappitt beneath the clothes insisted that he was strong and made some virile remark in answer to that further allusion to the dragon he by no means gave way to his wife or uttered any word of assent but the ladys scheme had been made known to him the ice had been broken and mrs tappitt when she put out the candle felt that she had done a good evenings work     chapter viii  mrs rays penitence   another fortnight went by and still nothing further was heard at braggs end from luke rowan much was heard of him in baslehurst it was soon known by everybody that he had bought the cottages and there was a widelyspread and wellcredited rumour that he was going to commence the necessary buildings for a new brewhouse at once nor were these tidings received by baslehurst with all that horrorwith that loud clamour of indignationwhich tappitt conceived to be due to them baslehurst i should say as a whole received the tidings with applause why should not bungalls nephew carry on a brewery of his own especially why should he not if he were resolved to brew good beer very censorious remarks about the tappitt beer were to be heard in all barrooms and were reechoed with vehemence in the kitchens of the baslehurst aristocracy  it aint beer said dr harfords cook who had come from the midland counties and knew what good beer was its a nasty muddle of stuff not fit for any christian who has to earn her victuals over a kitchen fire  it came to pass speedily that luke rowan was expected to build a new brewery and that the event of the first brick was looked for with anxious expectation and that false report which had spread itself through baslehurst respecting him and his debts had taken itself off it had been banished by a contrary report and there now existed in baslehurst a very general belief that rowan was a man of meansof very considerable meansa man of substantial capital whom to have settled in the town would be very beneficial to the community that false statement as to the bill at griggs had been sifted and the truth made knownand somewhat to the disgrace of the tappitt faction the only article supplied by griggs to rowans order had been the champagne consumed at tappitts supper and for this rowan had paid ready money within a week of the transaction it was mrs cornbury who discovered all this and who employed means for making the truth known in baslehurst this truth also became known at last to mrs raybut of what avail was it then she had desired her daughter to treat the young man as a wolf and as a wolf he had been hounded off from her little sheepcot she heard now that he was expected back at baslehurstthat he was a wealthy man that he was thought well of in the town that he was going to do great things with what better possible husband could any young woman have been blessed and yet she had turned him away from her cottage as though he had been a wolf  it was from mrs sturt that mrs ray first learned the truth mr sturt was a tenant on the cornbury estate and mrs sturt was of course well known to mrs cornbury that lady when she had sifted to the bottom the story of griggs bill and had assured herself that rowan was by no means minded to surrender his interest in baslehurst determined that the truth should be made known to mrs ray but she was not willing to call on mrs ray herself nor did she wish to present herself before rachel at the cottage unless she could bring with her some more substantial comfort than could be afforded by simple evidence as to rowans good character she therefore took herself to mrs sturt and discussed the matter with her  i suppose she does care about him said mrs cornbury sitting in mrs sturts little parlour that opened out upon the kitchen garden mrs sturt was also seated leaning on the corner of the table with the sleeves of her gown tucked up ready for work when the squires lady should be gone but very willing to postpone her work as long as the squires lady would stay and gossip with her  oh that she do mrs butlerin her heart of hearts if i know anything of true love she do love that young man  and he did offer to her there can be no doubt about that i suppose  not a doubt on earth mrs butler she never told me so outrightnor yet didnt her motherbut if he didnt ill give my head for a cream cheese laws love you mrs butler i know whats what well enough i know when a girls wild and flighty and thinks of things as she oughtntand i know when shes proper behaved and gives a young man encouragement only when it becomes her  of course you do mrs sturt  it isnt for me mrs butler to say anything against your papa nobody can have more respect for their clergyman than sturt has and i and before it was all settled like sturt never had a word with mr comfort about tithes but mrs butler i think your papa was wrong here as far as i can learn it was he that told mrs ray that this young man wasnt all that he should be  papa meant it for the best there were strange things said about him you know  i never believes one word of what i hears and never will people are such liars beant they mrs butler and i didnt believe a word again him hes as fine a young man as youd wish to see in a hundred years and of course that goes a long way with a young woman well mrs butler ill tell mrs ray what you say but im afeard its too late im afeard it is hes of a stubborn sort i think hes one of them that says if you will not when you may when you will you shall have nay  mrs cornbury still entertained hope that the stubbornness of the stubborn man might be overcome but as to that she said nothing to mrs sturt  mrs sturt with what friendly tact she possessed made her communication to mrs ray but it may be doubted whether more harm than good was not thus done and he didnt owe a shilling then asked mrs ray  not a shilling said mrs sturt  and he is going to come back to baslehurst about this brewery business  theres not a doubt in life about that answered mrs sturt if these tidings could have come in time they would have been very salutary but what was mrs ray to do with them now she felt that she could not honestly withhold them from rachel and yet she knew not how to tell them without adding to rachels misery it was very improbable that rachel should hear anything about rowan from other lips than her own it was clear that mrs sturt did not intend to speak to her and also clear that mrs sturt expected that mrs ray would do so  rachels demeanour at this time was cause of great sorrow to mrs ray she never smiled she sought no amusement she read no books she spoke but little and when she did speak her words were hard and cold and confined almost entirely to household affairs her mother knew that she was not ill because she ate and drank and worked even dorothea must have been satisfied with the amount of needlework which she produced in these days but though not ill she was thin and pale and unlike herself but perhaps of all the signs which her mother watched so carefully the signs which tormented her most were those everpresent lines on her daughters foreheadlines which mrs ray had now learned to read correctly and which indicated some settled inward purpose and an inward resolve that that purpose should become the subject of no outward discussion rachel had formerly been everything to her motherher friend her minister her guide her great comfortthe subject on which could be lavished all the soft tenderness of her nature the loving object to whom could be addressed all the little innocent petulances of her life but now mrs ray did not dare to be either tender with rachel or petulant she hardly dared to speak to her on subjects that were not indifferent on this matter of luke rowan she did not dare to speak to her rachel never upbraided her with wordshad never spoken one word of reproach but every moment of their passing life was an unspoken reproach so severe and heavy that the poor mother hardly knew how to bear the burden of her fault  as mrs ray became more afraid of her younger daughter she became less afraid of the elder this was occasioned partly no doubt by the absence of mrs prime from the cottage when there she only came as a visitor and no visitor to a house can hold such dominion there as may be held by a domestic tyrant present at all meals and claiming an ascendancy in all conversations but it arose in part also from the overwhelming solicitude which filled mrs rays heart from morning to night as she watched poor rachel in her misery her bowels yearned towards her child and she longed to give her relief with an excessive longing had the man been a very wolf indeedsuch were her feelings at presenti think that she would have welcomed him to the cottage in ordering his repulse she had done a deed of which she had by no means anticipated the consequences and now she repented in the sackcloth and ashes of a sorrowstricken spirit ah me what could she do to relieve that oppressed one so thoroughly did this desire override all others in her breast that she would snub mrs prime without dreading or even thinking of the consequences her only hopes and her only fears at the present moment had reference to rachel had rachel proposed to her that they should both start off to london and there search for luke rowan i doubt whether she would have had the heart to decline the journey  in these days mrs prime came to the cottage regularly twice a weekon wednesdays and saturdays on wednesday she came after tea and on saturday she drank tea with her mother on these occasions much was of course said as to the prospect of her marriage with mr prong nothing was as yet settled and rachel had concluded in her own mind that there would be no such wedding as to mrs rays opinion she of course thought there would be a wedding or that there would not in accordance with the last words spoken by mrs prime to herself on the occasion of that special conversation  shell never give up her money rachel had said and hell never marry her unless she does  mrs prime at this period acknowledged to her mother that she was not happy  i want said she to do whats right but its not always easy to find out what is right  thats very true said mrs ray thinking that there were difficulties in the affairs of other people quite as embarrassing as those of which mrs prime complained  he says continued the younger widow that he wants nothing for himself but that it is not fitting that a married woman should have a separate income  i think hes right there said mrs ray  i quite believe what he says about himself said mrs prime it is not that he wants my money for the moneys sake but that he chooses to dictate to me how i shall use it  so he ought if hes to be your husband said mrs ray  these conversations usually took place in rachels absence when mrs prime came rachel would remain long enough to say a word to her and on the saturdays would pour out the tea for her and would hand to her the bread and butter with the courtesy due to a visitor but after that she would take herself to her own bedroom and only come down when mrs prime had prepared herself for going at last on one of these evenings there came a proposition from mrs prime that she should return to the cottage and live again with her mother and sister she had not said that she had absolutely rejected mr prong but she spoke of her return as though it had become expedient because the cause of her going away had been removed very little had been said between her and her mother about rachels love affair nor was mrs prime inclined to say much about it now but so much as that she did say no doubt its all over now about that young man and therefore if you like it i dont see why i shouldnt come back  i dont at all know about its being all over said mrs ray in a hurried quick tone and as she spoke she blushed with emotion  but i suppose it is mother from all that i can hear he isnt thinking of her and i dont suppose he ever did much  i dont know what hes thinking about dorothea and i aint sure that theres any good talking about it besides if youre going to have mr prong at last  if i did mother it neednt prevent my coming here for a month or two first it wouldnt be quite yet certainlyif at all and i thought that perhaps if i am going to settle myself in that way youd be glad that we should be altogether again for a little while  so i should dorotheaof course i have never wanted to be divided from my children your going away was your own doing not mine im sure it made me so wretched i didnt know what to do at the time only other things have come since that have pretty nearly put all that out of my mind  but you cant think i was wrong to go when i felt it to be right  i dont know how that may be said mrs ray if you thought it right to go i suppose you were right to go but perhaps you shouldnt have had such thoughts  well mother we wont go back to that  no we wont if you please  this at any rate is certain that rachel in departing from our usual ways of life has brought great unhappiness upon herself im afraid she is thinking of this young man now more than she ought to do  of course she is thinking of him why should she not think of him  why mother surely it cannot be good that any girl should think of a man who thinks nothing of her  then mrs ray spoke outas perhaps she had never spoken before  what right have you to say that he thinks nothing of her who can tell he did think of heras honestly as any man ever thought of the woman he wished to mate with he came to her fairly and asked her to be his wife what can any man do more by a girl than that and she didnt say a word to him to encourage him till those she had a right to look to had encouraged him too so she didnt and i dont believe any woman ever had a child that behaved better or truer or more maidenly than she has done and i was a fool and worse than a fool when i allowed any one to have an evil thought of her for a moment  do you mean me mother  i dont mean anybody except myself so i dont mrs ray as she spoke was weeping bitterly and rubbing the tears from her red eyes with her apron ive behaved like a fool to herworse than a fooland ive broken her heart not think of him hows a girl not to think of a man day and night when she loves him better than herself think of him shell think of him till shes in her grave shell think of him till shes past all other thinking i hate such cruelty and i hate myself for having been cruel i shall never forgive myself the longest day i have to live  you only did your duty mother  no i didnt do my duty at all it cant be a mothers duty to break her childs heart and to be set against her by what anybody else can say she was ever and always the best child that ever lived and she came away from him and strove to banish him from her thoughts and wouldnt own to herself that she cared for him the least in the world till hed come here and spoken out straight like a man as he is i tell you what dorothea id go to london on my knees to him if i could bring him back to her i would and if he comes here i will go to him  oh mother  i know he loves her hes not one of your inconstant ones that take up with a girl for a week or so and then forgets her but she has offended him and hes stubborn she has offended him at my bidding and its my doingand id humble myself in the dust to bring him back to herso i would never tell me of her not thinking of him i tell you dorothea shell think of him always not because she has loved him but because she has been brought to confess her love  mrs ray was so strong in her mingled passion and grief that mrs prime made no attempt to rebuke her the daughter was indeed quelled by her mothers vehemence and felt that for the present the subject of rachels love and rachels lover was not a fitting one for the exercise of her own talents as a preacher the tragedy had progressed beyond the reach of her preaching mrs ray protested that rachel had been right throughout and that she herself had been wrong only when she had opposed rachels wishes such a view of the matter was altogether at variance with that entertained by mrs prime who was still of opinion that young people shouldnt be allowed to please themselves and who feared the approach of any lover who came with lute in hand and with light soft loving worldly words men and women according to her theory were right to marry and have children but she thought that such marriages should be contracted not only in a solemn spirit but with a certain dinginess of solemnity with a painstaking absence of mirth that would divest love of its worldly alloy rachel had gone about her business in a different spirit and it may almost be said that mrs prime rejoiced that she had failed she did not believe in broken hearts she did believe in the efficacy of chastisement and she thought that on the whole the present state of affairs would be beneficial to her sister had she been possessed of sufficient power she would now on this occasion have preached her sermon again as she had preached it before but her mothers passion had overcome her and she was unable to express her convictions  i hope that she will be better soon she said  i hope she will said mrs ray  at this moment rachel came down from her own room and joined them in the parlour she came in with that same look of sad composure on her face as though she were determined to speak nothing of her thoughts to any one and sat herself down near to her sister in doing so however she caught a glimpse of her mothers face and saw that she had been cryingsaw indeed that she was still crying at that moment  mamma she said what is the matterhas anything happened  no dear nothingnothing has happened  but you would not cry for nothing what is it dolly  we have been talking said dorothea things in this world are not so pleasant in themselves that they can always be spoken of without tearseither outward tears or inward people are too apt to think that there is no true significance in their words when they say that this world is a vale of tears  all the same i dont like to see mamma crying like that  dont mind it rachel said mrs ray if you will not regard me i shall be better soon  i was saying that i thought i would come back to the cottage said mrs prime that is if mother likes it  but that did not make mamma cry  there were other things arose out of my saying so then rachel asked no further questions but sat silent waiting till her sister should go  of course we shall be very glad to have you back again if it suits you to come said mrs ray i dont think it at all nice that a family should be dividedthat is as long as they are the same family having received so much encouragement with reference to her proposed return mrs prime took her departure and walked back to baslehurst  for some minutes after they had been so left neither mrs ray nor rachel spoke the mother sat rocking herself in her chair and the daughter remained motionless in the seat which she had taken when she first came into the room their faces were not turned to each other but rachel was so placed that she could watch her mother without being observed every now and again mrs ray would put her hand up to her eyes to squeeze away the tears and a low gurgling sound would come from her as though she were striving without success to repress her sobs she had thought that she would speak to rachel when mrs prime was gonethat she would confess her error in having sent rowan away and implore her child to pardon her and to love her once again it was not however that she doubted rachels lovethat she feared that rachel was casting her out from her heart or that she was learning to hate her she knew well enough that her child still loved her it was thisthat her life had become barren to her cold and altogether tasteless without those thousand little signs of everpresent affection to which she had been accustomed if it was to be always thus between them what would the world be to her for the remainder of her days she could have borne to part with rachel had rachel married as in parting with her she would have looked forward to some future return of her girls caresses and in such case she would at least have felt that her loss had come from no cessation of the sweet loving nature of their mutual connexion she would have wept as she gave rachel over to a husband but her tears would have been sweet as well as bitter but there was nothing of sweetness in her tears as she shed them nownothing of satisfaction in her sorrow if she could get rachel to talk with her freely on the matter if she could find an opportunity for confessing herself to have been wrong might it not be that the soft caresses would be restored to hercaresses that would be soft though moistened with salt tears but she feared to speak to her child she knew that rachels face was still hard and stern and that her voice was not the voice of other days she knew that her daughter brooded over the injury that had been done to herthough she knew also that no accusation was made even in the girls own bosom against herself she thoroughly understood the state of rachels mind but she was unable to find the words that might serve to soften it  i suppose we may as well go to bed she said at last giving the matter up at any rate for that evening  mamma why were you crying when i came into the room said rachel  was i crying my dear  you are crying still mamma is it i that make you unhappy  mrs ray was anxious to declare that the reverse of that was truethat it was she who had made the other unhappy but even now she could not find the words in which to say this no she said it isnt you it isnt anybody i believe its true what mr comfort has told us so often when hes preaching its all vanity and vexation there isnt anything to make anybody happy i suppose i cry because im foolisher than other people i dont know that anybody is happy im sure dorothea is not and im sure you aint  i dont want you to be unhappy about me mamma  of course you dont i know that but how can i help it when i see how things have gone i tried to do for the best and i have broken my childs heart mrs ray intended to say but she failed altogether before she got as far as that and bursting out into a flood of tears hid her face in her apron  rachel still kept her seat and her face was still hard and unmoved her mother did not see it she did not dare to look upon it but she knew that it was so she knew her daughter would have been with her close to her embracing her throwing her arms round her had that face relented but rachel still kept her chair and mrs ray sobbed aloud  i wish i could be a comfort to you mamma rachel said after another pause but i do not know how i suppose in time we shall get over this and things will be as they used to be  theyll never be to me as they used to be before he came to baslehurst said mrs ray through her tears  at any rate that is not his fault said rachel almost angrily whoever may have done wrong no one has a right to say that he has done wrong  im sure i never said so it is i that have done wrong exclaimed mrs ray i know it all now and i wish id never asked anybody but just my own heart i didnt mean to say anything against him and i dont think it im sure i liked him as i never liked any young man the first time of seeing him that night he came out here to tea and i know that what they said against him was all false so i do  what was all false mamma  about his going away in debt and being a neerdowell and about his going away from baslehurst and not coming back any more everybody has a good word for him now  have they mamma said rachel and mrs ray learned in a moment from the tone of her daughters voice that a change had come over her feeling she asked her little question with something of the softness of her old manner with something of the longing loving wishfulness which used to make so many of her questions sweet to her mothers ears have they mamma  yes they have and i believe it was those wicked people at the brewery who spread the reports about him as for owing anybody money i believe hes got plenty of course he has or how could he have bought our cottages and paid for them all in a minute and i believe hell come back and live at baslehurst so i do only  only what mamma  if hes not to come back to you id rather that he never showed his face here again  he wont come to me mamma had he meant it he would have sent me a message  perhaps he meant that he wouldnt send the message till he came himself said mrs ray  but she made the suggestion in a voice so full of conscious doubt that rachel knew that she did not believe in it herself  i dont think he means that mamma if he did why should he keep me in doubt he is very true and very honest but i think he is very hard when i wrote to him in that way after accepting the love he had offered me he was angered and felt that i was false to him he is very honest but i think he must be very hard  i cant think that if he loved you he would be so hard as that  men are different from women i suppose i feel about him that whatever he might do i should forgive it but then i feel also that he would never do anything for me to forgive  ill never forgive him never if he doesnt come back again  dont say that mamma youve no right even to be angry with him because it was we who told him that there was to be no engagementafter i had promised him  i didnt think hed take you up so at the first word said mrs rayand then there was again silence for a few minutes  mamma said rachel  well rachel  mrs ray was still rocking her chair and had hardly yet repressed that faint gurgling sound of halfcontrolled sobs  i am so glad to hear you say that yourespect him and dont believe of him what people have said  i dont believe a word bad of him except that he oughtnt to take huff in that way at one word that a girl says to him he ought to have known that you couldnt write just what letter you liked as he could  we wont say anything more about that but as long as you dont think him bad  i dont think him bad i dont think him bad at all i think him very good id give all i have in the world to bring him back again so i would  dear mamma  and now rachel moved away from her chair and came up to her mother  and i know its been all my fault oh my child i am so unhappy i dont get half an hours sleep at night thinking of what i have donei that would have given the very blood out of my veins to make you happy  no mamma it wasnt you  yes it was id no business going away to other people after i had told him he might come here you who had always been so good too  you mustnt say again that you wish he hadnt come here  oh but i do wish it because then he would have been nothing to you i do wish he hadnt ever come but now id do anything to bring him back again i believe ill go to him and tell him that it was my doing  no mamma you wont do that  why should i not i dont care what people say isnt your happiness everything to me  but i shouldnt take him if he came in that way what beg him to come and have compassion on me as if i couldnt live without him no mother that wouldnt do i do love him i do love him i sometimes think i cannot live without his love i sometimes feel as though stories about broken hearts might be true but i wouldnt have him in that way how could he love me afterwards when i was his wife but mamma well be friends againshall we not ive been so unhappy that you should have thought ill of him  that night the mother and daughter shared the same bed together and mrs ray was able to sleep she would not confess to herself that her sorrow had been lightened because nothing had been said or done to lessen that of her daughter but on the morrow rachel came and hovered round her again and the bitterness of mrs rays grief was removed     chapter ix  the election at baslehurst   towards the end of september the day of the election arrived and with it arrived luke rowan at baslehurst the vacancy had been occasioned by the acceptance of the then sitting member of that situation under the crown which is called the stewardship of the manor of helpholme in other words an old gentleman who had done his lifes work retired and made room for some one more young and active the old member had kept his seat till the end of the session just leaving time for the moving for a new writ and now the election was about to be held almost at the earliest day possible it had been thought that a little reflection would induce the baslehurst people to reject the smiles of the jew tailor from london and therefore as little time for reflection was given to them as possible the wealth the liberal politics the generosity and the successes of mr hart were dinned into their ears by a succession of speeches and by an overpowering flight of enormous posters and then the jewish hero the tailor himself came among them and astonished their minds by the ease and volubility of his speeches he did not pronounce his words with any of those soft slushy judaic utterances by which they had been taught to believe he would disgrace himself his nose was not hookey with any especial hook nor was it thicker at the bridge than was becoming he was a dapper little man with bright eyes quick motion ready tongue and a very new hat it seemed that he knew well how to canvass he had a smile and a good word for allenemies as well as friends the task of abusing the cornbury party he left to his committee and backers he spent a great deal of moneythrowing it away in every direction in which he could do so without laying himself open to the watchful suspicion of the other side he ate and drank like a christian and only laughed aloud when some true defender of the protestant faith attempted to scare him away out of the streets by carrying a gammon of bacon up on high perhaps his strength as a popular candidate was best shown by his drinking a pint of tappitts beer in the little parlour behind the bar at the dragon  he beats me there said butler cornbury when he heard of that feat  but the action was a wise one the question as to tappitts brewery and tappitts beer was running high at baslehurst and in no stronger way could mr hart have bound to him the tappitt faction than by swallowing in public that pint of beer let me have a small glass of brandy at once said mr hart to his servant having retired to his room immediately after the performance of the feat his constitution was good and i may as well at once declare that before half an hour had passed over his head he was again himself and at his work  the question of tappitts beer and tappitts brewery was running high in baslehurst and had gotten itself involved in the mouths of the people of baslehurst not only with the loves and sorrows of poor rachel ray but with the affairs of this election we know how tappitt had been driven to declare himself a stanch supporter of the jew he had become very stanchstanch beyond the promising of his own votestanch even to a final sitting on the jews committee and an active canvasser on the jews behalf his wife whose passions were less strong than his own and her prudence greater had remonstrated with him on the matter you can vote against cornbury if you please she had said but do it quietly keep your toe in your pump and say nothing just as we stand at present about the business of rowans it would almost be better that you shouldnt vote at all but tappitt was an angry man at this moment uncontrollable by the laws of prudence and he went into these election matters heart and soul to his wifes great grief butler cornbury or mrs butler cornburyit was all the same to him whichhad openly taken up rowans part in the brewery controversy a rumour had reached tappitt that the inmates of cornbury grange had loudly expressed a desire for good beer under such circumstances it was not possible for him not to rush to the fight he did rush into the thick of it and boasted among his friends that the jew was safe i think he was rightright at any rate as regarded his own peace of mind nothing gives a man such spirit for a fight as the act of fighting during these election days he was almost regardless of rowan he was to second the nomination of the jew and so keen was he as to the speech that he would make and as to the success of what he was doing against mr cornbury that he was able to talk down his wife and browbeat honyman in his own office honyman was about to vote for butler cornbury was employed in the cornbury interest and knew well on which side his bread was buttered sharpit and longfite were local attorneys for the jew and in this way tappitt was thrown into close intercourse with that eminent firm of course we wouldnt interfere said sharpit confidently to the brewer we never do interfere with the clients of another firm we never did such a thing yet and dont mean to begin we find people drop into us quick enough without that but in a friendly way mr tappitt let me caution you not to let your fine business be injured by that young sharper  mr tappitt found this to be very kindand very sensible too he gave no authority to sharpit on that occasion to act for him but he thought of it resolving that he would set his shoulders firmly to that wheel as soon as he had carried through this business of the election  but even in the matter of the election everything did not go well with tappitt he had appertaining to his establishment a certain foreman of the name of worts a heavy respectable useful man educated on the establishment by bungall and bequeathed by bungall to tappitta man by no means ambitious of good beer but very ambitious of profits to the firm a servant indeed almost invaluable in such a business but tappitt had ever found him deficient in thisthat he had a certain objectionable pride in having been bungalls servant and that as such he thought himself absolved from the necessity of subserviency to his latter master once a day indeed he did touch his cap but when that was done he seemed to fancy that he was almost equal to mr tappitt upon the premises he never shook in his shoes if tappitt were angry nor affected to hasten his steps if tappitt were in a hurry nor would he even laugh at tappitts jokes ifas was too usualsuch jokes were not mirthmoving in their intrinsic nature clearly he was not at all points a good servant and tappitt in some hours of his prosperity had ventured to think that the brewery could go on without him now since the day in which rowans treachery had first loomed upon tappitt he had felt much inclined to fraternize on easier terms with his foreman worts when he touched his cap had been received with a smile and his advice had been asked in a flattering tonenot demanded as belonging to the establishment by right then tappitt began to talk of rowan to his man and to speak evil things of him as was natural expecting a reciprocity of malignity from worts but worts on such occasions had been ominously silent hm i beant so zure o that worts had once said thus differing from his master on some fundamental point of tappitt strategy as opposed to rowan strategy aint you said tappitt showing his teeth youd better go now and look after those men at the carts worts had looked after the men at the carts but he had done so with an idea in his head that perhaps he would not long look after tappitts men or tappitts carts he had not himself been ambitious of good beer but the idea had almost startled him into acquiescence by its brilliancy  now worts had a vote in the borough and it came to tappitts ears that his servant intended to give that vote to mr cornbury worts said he a day or two before the election of course you intend to vote for mr hart  worts touched his cap for it was the commencement of the day  i dont jest know said he i was thinking of woting for the young squoire ive knowd him ever since he was born and i aint never knowd the jew gentlemannever at all  look here worts if you intend to remain in this establishment i shall expect you to support the liberal interest as i support it myself the liberal interest has always been supported in baslehurst by bungall and tappitt ever since bungall and tappitt have existed  the old maister he wouldnt a woted for ere a jew in christendomnot agin the squoire the old maister was allays for the protestant religion  very well worts there cant be two ways of thinking here thats all especially not at such a time as this when theres more reason than ever why those connected with the brewery should all stand shoulder to shoulder youve had your bread out of this establishment worts for a great many years  and ive arned it hardno man cant say otherwise the sweat o my body belongs to the brewery but i didnt ever sell em my woteand i dont mean saying which words with an emphasis that was by no means servile worts went out from the presence of his master  that mans turning against me said tappitt to his wife at breakfast time in almost mute despair  what worts said mrs tappitt  yesthe ungrateful hound hes been about the place almost ever since he could speak for more than forty years hes had two pound a week for the last ten yearsand now hes turning against me  is he going over to rowan  i dont know where the d hes going hes going to vote for butler cornbury and thats enough for me  oh t i wouldnt mind that especially not just now only think what a help hell be to that man  i tell you he shall walk out of the brewery the week after this if he votes for cornbury there isnt room for two opinions here and i wont have it  for a moment or two mrs tappitt sat mute almost in despair then she took courage and spoke out  t said she it wont do  what wont do  all this wont do we shall be ruined and left without a home i dont mind myself i never did but think of the girls what would they do if we was turned out of this  whos to turn you out  i know i see it i am beginning to understand t that man would not go against you and the brewery if he didnt know which way the wind is blowing worts is wide awakequite wide he always was t you must take the offer rowan has made of a regular income and live retired if you dont do iti shall and mrs tappitt as she spoke the audacious words rose up from her chair and stood with her arms leaning upon the table  what said tappitt sitting aghast with his mouth open  yes t if you dont think of your family i must what im saying mr honyman has said before and indeed all baslehurst is saying the same thing theres an offer made to you that will put your family on a footing quite genteelno gentlefolks in the county more so and you too that are getting past your work  i aint getting past my work  i shouldnt say so t if it werent for your own goodand if im not to know about that who is its all very well going about electioneering and indeed its just what gentlefolks is fit for when theyre past their regular work and im sure i shant begrudge it so long as it dont cost anything but thats not work you know t  aint i in the brewery every day for seven or eight hours and often more  yes t you are and whats like to come of it if you go on so what would be my feelings if i saw you brought into the house struck down with apoplepsy and paralepsy because i let you go on in that way when you wasnt fit no t i know my duty and i mean to do it you know dr haustus said only last month that you were that bilious  pshaw bilious its enough to make any man bilious  or any dog he would have added had he thought of it thereupon tappitt rushed away from his wife back into his little office and from that soon made his way to the jews committeeroom at the dragon at which he was detained till nearly eleven oclock at night  its a kind of work in which one has to do as much after dinner as before he said to his wife when he got back  for the matter of that said she i think the afterdinner work is the chief part of it  on the day of the election luke rowan was to be seen standing in the high street talking to butler cornbury the candidate rowan was not an elector for the cottages had not been in his possession long enough to admit of his obtaining from them a qualification to vote but he was a declared friend of the cornbury party mrs butler cornbury had sent a message to him saying that she hoped to see him soon after the election should be over on the following day or on the next and butler cornbury himself had come to him in the town though absent from baslehurst rowan had managed to declare his opinions before that time and was suspected by many to have written those articles in the baslehurst gazette which advocated the right of any constituency to send a jew to parliament if it pleased but which proved at the same time that any constituency must be wrong to send any jew to parliament and that the constituency of baslehurst would in the present instance be specially wrong to send mr hart to parliament we have always advocated said one of these articles the right of absolute freedom of choice for every borough and every county in the land but we trust that the day is far distant in which the electors of england shall cease to look to their nearest neighbours as their best representatives there wasnt much in the argument but it suited the occasion and added strength to rowans own cause in the borough all the stanch protestants began to feel a want of good beer questions very illnatured as toward tappitt were asked in the newspapers who owns the spotted dog at busbyporcorum and who compels the landlord to buy his liquor at tappitts brewery there were scores of questions of the same nature all of which tappitt attributed wrongly to luke rowan luke had written that article about freedom of election but he had not condescended to notice the beer at the spotted dog  and there was another quarrel taking place in baslehurst on the score of that election between persons with whom we are connected in this story mr prong had a vote in the borough and was disposed to make use of it and mrs prime regarding her own position as mr prongs affianced bride considered herself at liberty to question mr prong as to the use which he proposed to make of that vote to mrs prime it appeared that anything done in any direction for the benefit of a jew was a sin not to be forgiven to mr prong it seemed to be as great a sin not to do anything in his power for the hindrance and vexation of those with whom dr harford and mr comfort were connected by ties of friendship mrs prime who of the two was the more logical would not disjoin her personal and her scriptural hatreds she also hated dr harford but she hated the jews more she was not disposed to support a jew in baslehurst because mr comfort in his doctrines had fallen away from the purity of his early promise her idea was that a just man and a good christian could not vote for either of the baslehurst candidates under the present unhappy local circumstancesbut that under no circumstances should a christian vote for a jew all this she said in a voice not so soft as should be the voice of woman to her betrothed  dorothea said mr prong very solemnlythey were sitting at the time in his own little front parlour as to the due arrangement of the furniture in which mrs prime had already ventured to make some slight alterations which had not been received favourably by mr prongdorothea in this matter you must allow me to be the best judge voting for members of parliament is a thing which ladies naturally are not called upon to understand  ladies can understand as well as gentlemen said mrs prime that a curse has gone out from the lord against that people and gentlemen have no more right than ladies to go against the will of the lord  it was in vain that mr prong endeavoured to explain to her that the curse attached to the people as a nation and did not necessarily follow units of that people who had adopted other nationalities  let the units become christians before they go into parliament said mrs prime  i wish they would said mr prong i heartily wish they would and mr hart if he be returned shall have my prayers  but this did not at all suffice for mrs prime who perhaps in the matter of argument had the best of it she told her betrothed to his face that he was going to commit a great sin and that he was tempted to this sin by grievous worldly passions when so informed mr prong closed his eyes crossed his hands meekly on his breast and shook his head  not from thee dorothea said he not from thee should this have come  who is to speak out to you if i am not said she  but mr prong sat in silence and with closed eyes again shook his head  perhaps we had better part said mrs prime after an interval of five minutes perhaps it will be better for both of us  mr prong however still shook his head in silence and it was difficult for a lady in mrs primes position to read accurately the meaning of such shakings under such circumstances but mrs prime was a woman sufficiently versed in the worlds business to be able to resolve that she would have an answer to her question when she required an answer  mr prong she said i remarked just now that perhaps we had better part  i heard the words said mr prongi heard the cruel words but even then he did not open his eyes or remove his hands from his breast i heard the words and i heard those other words still more cruel you had better leave me now that i may humble myself in prayer  thats all very well mr prong and im sure i hope you will but situated as we are of course i should choose to have an answer it seems to me that you dislike that kind of interference which i regard as a wifes best privilege and sweetest duty if this be so it will be better for us to partas friends of course  you have accused me of a great sin he said of a great sinof a great sin  and so in my mind it would be  judge not lest ye be judged dorothea remember that  that doesnt mean mr prong that we are not to have our opinions and that we are not to warn those that are near us when we see them walking in the wrong path i might as well say the same to you when you  no dorothea it is my bounden duty it is my work it is that to which i am appointed as a minister if you cannot see the difference i have much mistaken your characterhave much mistaken your character  do you mean to say that nobody but a clergyman is to know whats right and whats wrong that must be nonsense mr prong im sorry to say anything to grieve you mr prong was now shaking his head again with his eyes most pertinaciously closedbut there are some things which really one cant bear  but he only shook his head his inward feelings were too many for him so that he could not at the present moment bring himself to give a reply to the momentous proposition which his betrothed had made him nor indeed had he at this moment fixed his mind as to the step which duty and wisdom combined would call upon him to take in this matter the temper of the lady was not certainly all that he had desired as an admiring member of his flock she had taken all his ghostly counsels as infallible but now it seemed to him as though most of his words and many of his thoughts and actions were made subject by her to a bitter criticism but in this matter he was inclined to rely much upon his own strength should he marry the lady as he was still minded to do for many reasons he would be to her a loving careful husband but he would also be her lord and masteras was intended when marriage was made a holy ordinance in this respect he did not doubt himself or his own powers hard words he could bear and as he thought after a time control so thinking he was not disposed to allow the lady to recede from her troth to him simply because in her anger she expressed a wish to do so therefore he had wisely been silent and had shaken his head in reproach but unfortunately the terms of their compact had not been finally settled with reference to another heading mrs prime had promised to be his wife but she had burdened her promise with certain pecuniary conditions which were distasteful to himwhich were much opposed to that absolute headship and perfect mastery which as he thought should belong to the husband as husband his views on this subject were very strong and he was by no means inclined to abate one jot of his demand better remain single in his work than accept the name of husband without its privileges but he had hoped that by mingled firmness and gentle words he might bring his dorothea round to a more womanly way of thinking he had flattered himself that there was a power of eloquence in him which would have prevailed over her once or twice he thought that he was on the brink of success he knew well that there were many points in his favour a woman who has spoken of herself and been spoken of as being on the point of marriage does not like to recede and his dorothea though not specially womanly among women was still a woman moreover he had the law on his sidethe old law as coming from the scriptures he could say that such a pecuniary arrangement as that proposed by his dorothea was sinful he had said soas he had then thought not without effect but now she retaliated upon him with accusation of another sin it was manifestly in her power to break away from him on that money detail it seemed now to be her wish to break away from him but she preferred doing so on that other matter he began to fear that he must lose his wife seeing that he was resolved never to yield on the money question but he did not choose to be entrapped into an instant resignation of his engagement by dorotheas indignation on a point of abstruse scripturopolitical morality his dorothea had assumed her indignation as a cloak for her pecuniary obstinacy it might be that he must yield but he would not surrender thus at the sound of a false summons so he closed his eyes very pertinaciously and shook his head  i think upon the whole said she again that we had better make up our minds to part then she stood up feeling that she should thus employ a greater power in forcing an answer from him he must have seen her motion through some cranny of his pertinaciously closed eyes for he noticed it by rising from his own chair with both his hands firmly fixed upon the table but still he did not open his eyesunless it might be to the extent of that small cranny  goodbye mr prong said she  then he altered the form of his hands and taking them from the table he dashed them together before his face god bless you dorothea said he god bless you god bless you and he put out his hands as though blessing her in his darkness she perceiving the inutility of endeavouring to shake hands with a man who wouldnt open his eyes moved away from her chair towards the door purposely raising a sound of motion with her dress so that he might know that she was going in that i think she took an unnecessary precaution for the cranny at the corner of his eye was still at his disposal  goodbye mr prong she said again as she opened the door for herself  god bless you dorothea said he may god bless you  then without assistance at the front door she made her way out into the street and as she stepped along the pavement she formed a resolvewhich no eloquence from mr prong could ever overcomethat she would remain a widow for the rest of her days  at twelve oclock on the morning of the election mr hart was declared by his own committee to be nine ahead and was admitted to be six ahead by mr cornburys committee but the cornbury folk asserted confidently that in this they saw certain signs of success their supporters were not men who could be whipped up to the poll early in the day whereas harts voters were all more or less under control and had been driven up hurriedly to the hustings so as to make this early show of numbers mr hart was about everywhere speaking and so was butler cornbury but in the matter of oratory i am bound to acknowledge that the jew had by much the mastery over the christian there are a class of menor rather more than a class a section of mankindto whom a power of easy expression by means of spoken words comes naturally english country gentlemen highly educated as they are undaunted as they usually are selfconfident as they in truth are at the bottom are clearly not in this section perhaps they are further removed from it considering the advantages they have for such speaking than any other class of men in englandor i might almost say elsewhere the fact for it is a fact that some of the greatest orators whom the world has known have been found in this class does not in any degree affect the truth of my proposition the best grapes in the world are perhaps grown in england though england is not a land of grapes and for the same reason the value of the thing depends upon its rarity and its value instigates the efforts for excellence the power of vocal expression which seems naturally to belong to an american is to an ordinary englishman very marvellous but in america the talking man is but little esteemed very wonderful power of deliverythat of mr soandso says the englishman speaking of an american  guess we dont think much of that kind of thing here says the yankee theres a deal too much of that coin in circulation  english country gentlemen are not to be classed among that section of mankind which speaks easily in public but jews i think may be so classed the men who speak thus easily and with natural fluency are also they who learn languages easily they are men who observe rather than think who remember rather than create who may not have great mental powers but are ever ready with what they have whose best word is at their command at a moment and is then serviceable though perhaps incapable of more enduring service  at any rate as regarded oratory in baslehurst the dark little man with the bright new hat from london was very much stronger than his opponentso much stronger that poor butler cornbury began to sicken of elections and to wish himself comfortably at home at cornbury grange he knew that he was talking himself down while the israelitish clothier was talking himself up it dont matter honyman said to him comfortably its only done for the show of the thing and to fill up the day if gladstone were here he wouldnt talk a vote out of them one way or the othernor yet the devil himself this consoled butler cornbury but nevertheless he longed that the day might be over  and tappitt spoke too more than onceas did also luke rowan in spite of various noisy interruptions in which he was told that he was not an elector and in spite also of an early greeting with a dead cat tappitt in advocating the claims of mr hart to be returned to parliament as member for baslehurst was clever enough to introduce the subject of his own wrongs and so important had this brewery question become that he was listened to with every sign of interest when he told the people for how many years bungall and tappitt had brewed beer for them there in baslehurst doubtless he was met by sundry interruptions from the rowanites  what sort of tipple has it been t was demanded by one voice  do you call that beer said a second  where do you buy your hops asked a third  but he went on manfully and was buoyed up by a strong belief that he was fighting his own battle with success  nor was rowan slow to answer him he was proud to say that he was bungalls heir and as such he intended to continue bungalls business whether he could improve the quality of the old tap he didnt know but he would try people had said a few weeks ago that he had been hounded out of baslehurst and did not mean to come back again here he was he had bought property in baslehurst he meant to live in baslehurst he pledged himself to brew beer in baslehurst he already regarded himself as belonging to baslehurst and being a bachelor he hoped that he might live to marry a wife out of baslehurst this last assurance was received with unqualified applause from both factions and went far in obtaining for rowan that local popularity which was needful to him certainly the rowan contest added much to the popular interest of that election  at the close of the poll on that evening it was declared by the mayor that mr butler cornbury had been elected to serve the borough in parliament by a majority of one vote     chapter x  the baslehurst gazette   by one vote old mr cornbury when he heard of it gasped with dismay and in secret regretted that his son had not been beaten what seat could be gained by one vote and not be contested especially when the beaten candidate was a jew clothier rolling in money and what sums would not a petition and scrutiny cost butler cornbury himself was dismayed and could hardly participate in the exultation of his more enthusiastic wife mr hart of course declared that he would petition and that he was as sure of the seat as though he already occupied it but as it was known that every possible electioneering device had been put in practice on his behalf during the last two hours of the poll the world at large in baslehurst believed that young cornburys position was secure tappitt and some few others were of a different opinion at the present moment tappitt could not endure to acknowledge to himself that he had been beaten nothing but the prestige and inward support of immediate success could support him in that contest so much more important to himself in which he was now about to be engaged that matter of the petition however can hardly be brought into the present story the political world will understand that it would be carried on with great vigour  the news of the election of butler cornbury reached the cottage at braggs end by the voice of mr sturt on the same evening and mrs ray in her quiet way expressed much joy that mr comforts soninlaw should have been successful and that baslehurst should not have disgraced itself by any connexion with a jew to her it had appeared monstrous that such a one should have been even permitted to show himself in the town as a candidate for its representation to such she would have denied all civil rights and almost all social rights for a true spirit of persecution one should always go to a woman and the milder the sweeter the more loving the more womanly the woman the stronger will be that spirit within her strong love for the thing loved necessitates strong hatred for the thing hated and thence comes the spirit of persecution they in england who are now keenest against the jews who would again take from them rights that they have lately won are certainly those who think most of the faith of a christian the most deadly enemies of the roman catholics are they who love best their religion as protestants when we look to individuals we always find it so though it hardly suits us to admit as much when we discuss these subjects broadly to mrs ray it was wonderful that a jew should have been entertained in baslehurst as a future member for the borough and that he should have been admitted to speak aloud within a few yards of the church tower  on the day but one after the election mrs sturt brought over to the cottage an extra sheet of the baslehurst gazette which had been published out of its course and which was devoted to the circumstances of the election i am not sure that mrs sturt would have regarded this somewhat dull report of the election speeches as having any peculiar interest for mrs ray and her daughter had it not been for one special passage luke rowans speech about baslehurst was given at length and in it was contained that public promise as to his matrimonial intentions mrs sturt came into the cottage parlour with the paper doubled into four and with her finger on a particular spot to her it had seemed that rowans promise must have been intended for rachel and it seemed also that nothing could be more manly straightforward or gallant than that assurance it suited her idea of chivalry but she was not quite sure that rachel would enjoy the publicity of the declaration and therefore she was prepared to point the passage out more particularly to mrs ray ive brought ee the account of it all said she still holding the paper in her hand the gudemanhes done with t paper and youll keep it for good and all one young man that we know of has made t finest speech of em all to my mind luik at that mrs ray then with a knowing wink at the mother and a poke at the special words with her finger she left the sheet in mrs rays hand and went her way  mrs ray who had not quite understood the pantomime and whose eye had not caught the words relating to marriage saw however that the column indicated contained the report of a speech made by luke rowan and she began it at the beginning and read it throughout luke had identified himself with the paper and therefore received from it almost more than justice his words were given at very full length and for some ten minutes she was reading before she came to the words which mrs sturt had hoped would be so delightful  what is it mamma rachel asked  a speech my dear made at the election  and who made it mamma  mrs ray hesitated for a moment before she answered thereby letting rachel know full well who made the speech before the word was spoken but at last she did speak the wordmr rowan my dear  oh said rachel she longed to get hold of the newspaper but she would utter no word expressive of such longing since that evening on which she had been bidden to look at the clouds she had regarded luke as a special hero cleverer than other men around her as a man born to achieve things and make himself known it was not astonishing to her that a speech of his should be reported at length in the newspaper he was a man certain to rise to make speeches and to be reported so she thought of him and so thinking had almost wished that it were not so could she expect that such a one would stoop to her or that if he did so that she could be fit for him he had now perceived that himself and therefore had taken her at her word and had left her had he been more like other men around hermore homely less prone to rise with less about him of fire and genius she might have won him and kept him the prize would not have been so precious but still she thought it might have been sufficient for her heart a young man who could find printers and publishers to report his words in that way on the first moment of his coming among them would he turn aside from his path to look after her would he not bring with him some grand lady down from london as his wife  dear me said mrs ray quite startled oh dear what do you think he says  what does he say mamma  well i dont know perhaps he maynt mean it i dont think i ought to have spoken of it  if its in the newspaper i suppose i should have heard of it unless you sent it back without letting me see it  she said we were to keep it and its because of that im sure she was always the most goodnatured woman in the world i dont know what we should have done if we hadnt found such a neighbour as mrs sturt  but what is it mamma that you are speaking of in the newspapers  mr rowan saysoh dear i wish id let you come to it yourself how very odd that he should get up and say that kind of thing in public before all the people he saysbut any way i know he means it because hes so honest and after all if he means it it doesnt much matter where he says it handsome is that handsome does there my dear i dont know how to tell it you so you had better read it yourself  rachel with eager hands took the paper and began the speech as her mother had done and read it through she read it through till she came to those words and then she put the paper down beside her i understand what you mean mamma and what mrs sturt meant but mr rowan did not mean that  what did he mean my dear  he meant them to understand that he intended to become a man of baslehurst like one of themselves  but then why did he talk about finding a wife there  he wouldnt have said that mamma if he had meant anything particular if anything of that sort had been at all in his mind it would have kept him from saying what he did say  but didnt he mean that he intended to marry a baslehurst lady  he meant it in that sort of way in which men do mean such things it was his way to make them think well of him but dont let us talk any more about it mamma it isnt nice  well im sure i cant understand it said mrs ray but she became silent on the subject and the reading of the newspaper was passed over to rachel  this had not been completed when a step was heard on the gravel walk outside and mrs ray jumping up declared it to be the step of her eldest daughter it was so and mrs prime was very soon in the room it was at this time about four oclock in the afternoon and therefore as the hour for tea at the cottage was halfpast five it was naturally understood that mrs prime had come there to join them at their evening meal after their first greeting she had seated herself on the sofa and there was that in her manner which showed both to her mother and sister that she was somewhat confusedthat she had something to say as to which there was some hesitation do take off your bonnet dorothea said her mother  will you come upstairs dolly said her sister and put your hair straight after your walk  but dolly did not care whether her hair was straight or tossed as the irish girls say when the smoothness of their locks has been disarranged she took off her bonnet however and laid it on the sofa beside her mother she said ive got something particular that i want to say to you  i hope its not anything serious the matter said mrs ray  well mother it is serious things are serious mostly i thinkor should be  shall i go into the garden while you are speaking to mamma said rachel  no rachel not on my account what ive got to say should be said to you as well as to mother its all over between me and mr prong  no said mrs ray  i thought it would be said rachel  and why did you think so said mrs prime turning round upon her sister almost angrily  i felt that he wouldnt suit you dolly thats why i thought so if its all over now i suppose theres no harm in saying that i didnt like him well enough to hope hed be my brotherinlaw  but that couldnt make you think it however its all over between us we agreed that it should be so this morning and i thought it right to come out and let you know at once  im glad youve told us said mrs ray  was there any quarrel asked rachel  no rachel there was no quarrel not what you call a quarrel i suppose we found there were subjects of disagreement between usmatters on which we had adverse opinions and therefore it was better that we should part  it was about the money perhaps said mrs ray  well yes it was in part about the money had i known then as much as i do now about the law in such matters i should have told mr prong from the first that it could not be he is a good man and i hope i have not disturbed his happiness  i used to be afraid that he would disturb yours said rachel and therefore i cannot pretend to regret it  thats not charitable rachel but if you please we wont say anything more about it its over and that is enough and now mother i want to know if you will object to my returning here and living at the cottage again  mrs ray could not bethink herself at the moment what answer she might best make and therefore for some moments she made none for herself she would have been delighted that her eldest daughter should return to the cottage under no circumstances could she refuse her own child a home under her own roof but at the present moment she could not forget the circumstances under which mrs prime had gone and it militated sorely against mrs rays sense of justice that the return should be made to depend on other circumstances mrs prime had gone away in loud disapproval of rachels conduct and now she proposed to return on this breaking up of her own matrimonial arrangements as though she had left the cottage because of her proposed marriage mrs prime should be welcomed back but her return should be accompanied by a withdrawal of her accusation against rachel mrs ray did not know how to put her demand into words but her mind was clear on the subject  well mother said mrs prime is there any objection  no my dear no objection at all of course not i shall be delighted to have you back and so im sure will rachel but  but what is it about money  oh dear no nothing about money at all if you do come backand im sure i hope you will and indeed it seems quite unnatural that you should be staying in baslehurst while we are living here but i think you ought to say my dear that rachel behaved just as she ought to behave in all that matter aboutabout mr rowan you know  dont mind me mamma said rachelwho could however have smothered her mother with kisses on hearing these words  but i think we all ought to understand each other rachel you and your sister cant go on comfortably together if theres to be more black looks about that  i dont know that there have been any black looks said mrs prime looking very black as she spoke  at any rate we should understand each other continued mrs ray with admirable courage ive thought a great deal about it since youve been away indeed i havent thought about much else and i dont think i shall ever forgive myself for having let a hard word be said to rachel about it  oh mamma dontdont said rachel but those meditated embraces were continued in her imagination  i dont want to say any hard words said mrs prime  no im sure you dontonly they were saidwerent they now didnt we blame her about being out there in the churchyard that evening  mamma exclaimed rachel  well my dear i wont say any moreonly this your sister went away because she thought you werent good enough for her to live with and if she comes back againwhich im sure i hope she willi think she ought to say that shes been mistaken  mrs prime looked very black and no word fell from her she sat there silent and gloomy while mrs ray looked at the fireplace lost in wonder at her own effort whether she would have given way or not had she and mrs prime been alone i cannot say that mrs prime would have uttered no outspoken recantation i feel sure it was rachel at last who settled the matter  if dolly comes back to live here mamma said she i shall take that as an acknowledgment on her part that she thinks i am good enough to live with  well my dear said mrs ray perhaps thatll do only there should be an understanding you know  mrs prime at the moment said nothing but when next she spoke her words showed her intention of having her things brought back to the cottage on the next day i think it must be felt that rachel had won the victory she felt it so herself and was conscious that no further attempt would be made to carry her off to dorcas meetings against her own will     chapter xi  cornbury grange   luke rowan had been told that mrs butler cornbury wished to see him when the election should be over and on the evening of the election the victorious candidate before he returned home asked luke to come to the grange on the following monday and stay till the next wednesday now it must be understood that rowan during this period of the election had become in a public way very intimate with cornbury they were both young men the new member of parliament not being over thirty and for the time they were together employed on the same matter luke rowan was one with whom such a man as mr cornbury could not zealously cooperate without reaching a considerable extent of personal intimacy he was pleasantmannered free in speech with a bold eye assuming though not asserting his equality with the best of those with whom he might be brought in contact had cornbury chosen to consider himself by reason of his social station too high for rowans fellowship he might of course have avoided him but he could not have put himself into close contact with the man without submitting himself to that temporary equality which rowan assumed and to that temporary familiarity which sprung from it butler cornbury had thought little about it he had found rowan to be a pleasant associate and an able assistant and had fallen into that mode of fellowship which the other mans ways and words had made natural to him when his wife begged him to ask rowan up to the grange he had been startled for a moment but had at once assented  well said he hes an uncommon pleasant fellow i dont see why he shouldnt come  ive a particular reason said mrs butler  all right said the husband do you explain it to my father and so the invitation had been given  but rowan was a man more thoughtful than cornbury and was specially thoughtful as to his own position he was a radical at heart if ever there was a radical but in saying this i must beg my reader to understand that a radical is not necessarily a revolutionist or even a republican he does not by reason of his social or political radicalism desire the ruin of thrones the degradation of nobles the spoliation of the rich or even the downfall of the bench of bishops many a young man is frightened away from the just conclusions of his mind and the strong convictions of his heart by dread of being classed with those who are jealous of the favoured ones of fortune a radical may be as ready as any aristocrat to support the crown with his blood and the church with his faith it is in this that he is a radical that he desires expects works for and believes in the gradual progress of the people no doctrine of equality is his liberty he must have and such position high or low for himself and others as each mans individual merits will achieve for him the doctrine of outward equality he eschews as a barrier to all ambition and to all improvement the idea is as mean as the thing is impracticable but withinis it in his soul or in his heartwithin his breast there is a manhood that will own no inferiority to the manhood of another he retires to a corner that an earl with his suite may pass proudly through the doorway and he grudges the earl nothing of his pride it is the earls right but he also has his right and neither queen nor earl nor people shall invade it that is the creed of a radical  rowan as i have said was a man thoughtful as to his own position he had understood well the nature of the league between himself and butler cornbury it was his intention to become a brewer in baslehurst and a brewer in baslehurst would by no means be as the mighty brewers of great name who marry lords daughters and give their daughters in marriage to mighty lords he would simply be a tradesman in the town it might well be that he should not find the society of the tappitts and the griggses much to his taste but such as it was he would make the best of it at any rate he would make no attempt to force his way into other society if others came to him let that be their look out now when cornbury asked him thus to come to cornbury grange as though they two were men living in the same class of lifeas though they were men who might be bound together socially in their homes as well as politically on the hustings the red colour came to his face and he hesitated for a moment in his answer  you are very kind said he  oh you must come said cornbury my wife particularly desires it  she is very kind said he but if you ask all your supporters over to the grange youll get rather a mixed lot  i suppose i should but i dont mean to do that i shall be very glad however to see youvery glad  and i shall be very happy to come said rowan having again hesitated as he gave his answer  i wish i hadnt promised that id go there he said to himself afterwards this was on the sunday after evening churchan hour or more after the people had all gone home and he was sitting on that stile looking to the west and thinking as he looked of that sunset which he and another had seen as they stood there together he did wish that he had not undertaken to go to mr cornburys house what to him would be the society of such people as he should find thereto him who had laid out for himself a career that would necessarily place his life among other associates ill send and excuse myself he said ill be called away to exeter i have things to do there i shall only get into a mess by knowing people who will drop me when this ferment of the election is over and yet the idea of an intimacy at such a house as cornbury grangewith such people as mrs butler cornbury was very sweet to him only this that if he associated with them or such as them it must be on equal terms he could acknowledge them to be people apart from him as ice creams and sponge cakes are things apart from the shillingless schoolboy but as the schoolboy if brought within the range of cakes and creams must devour them with unchecked relish as though his pocket were lined with coin so must he rowan carry himself with these curled darlings of society if he found himself placed among them he liked cakes and creams but had made up his mind that other viands were as wholesome and more comfortably within his reach was it worth his while to go to this banquet which would unsettle his taste and at which perhaps if he sat there at his ease he might not be wholly welcome all his thoughts were not noble he had declared to himself that a certain thing could not be his except at a cost which he would not pay and yet he hankered for that thing he had declared to himself that no social position in which he might ever find himself should make a change in him on his inner self or on his outward manner and now he feared to go among these people lest he should find himself an inferior among superiors it was not all noble but there was beneath it a basis of nobility i will go he said at last fearing that if he did not there would have been some grain of cowardice in the motives of his action if they dont like me its their fault for asking me  of course as he sat there he was thinking of rachel of course he had thought of rachel daily almost hourly since he had been with her at the cottage when she had bent her head over his shoulder and submitted to have his arm round her waist but his thoughts of her were not as hers of him nor is it often that a mans love is like a womansrestless fearful uncomfortable sleepless timid and allpervading not the less may it be passionate constant and faithful he had been angered by rachels letter to himgreatly angered of a truth when mrs ray met him in exeter he had no message to send back to cawston he had done his part and had been rejectedhad been rejected too clearly because on the summing up of his merits and demerits at the cottage his demerits had been found to be the heavier he did not suspect that the calculation had been made by rachel herself and therefore he had never said to himself that all should be over between them he had never determined that there should be a quarrel between them but he was angered and he would stand aloof from her he would stand aloof from her and would no longer acknowledge that he was in any way bound by the words he had spoken all such bonds she had broken nevertheless i think he loved her with a surer love after receiving that letter than he had ever felt before  he had been here at this spot every evening since his return to baslehurst and here had thought much of his future life and something too of the days that were past looking to the left he could see the trees that stood in front of the old brewery hiding the building from his eyes that was the house in which old bungall had lived and there tappitt had lived for the last twenty years i suppose said he speaking to himself it will be my destiny to live there too with the vats and beer barrels under my nose but what farmer ever throve who disliked the muck of his own farmyard then he had thought of tappitt and of the coming battle and had laughed as he remembered the scene with the poker at that moment his eye caught the bright colours of womens bonnets coming into the field beneath him and he knew that the tappitt girls were returning home from their walk he had retired quickly round the chancel of the church and had watched thinking that rachel would be with them but rachel of course was not there he said to himself that they had thrown her off and said also that the time should come when they should be glad to win from her a kind word and an encouraging smile his love for rachel was as true and more strong than ever but it was of that nature that he was able to tell himself that it had for the present moment been set aside by her act and that it became him to leave it for a while in abeyance  what on earth shall i do with myself all tuesday he said again as he walked away from the churchyard on the sunday evening i dont know what these people do with themselves when theres no hunting and shooting it seems unnatural to me that a man shouldnt have his bread to earnor a woman either in some form after that he went back to his inn  on the monday he went out to cornbury grange late in the afternoon butler cornbury drove into baslehurst with a pair of horses and took him back in his phaeton  give my fellow your portmanteau thats all right you never were at the grange were you its the prettiest five miles of a drive in devonshire but the walk along the river is the prettiest walk in englandwhich is saying a great deal more  i know the walk well said rowan though i never was inside the park  it isnt much of a park indeed there isnt a semblance of a park about it grange is just the name for it as its an upperclass sort of homestead for a gentleman farmer weve lived there since long before adam but weve never made much of a house of it  thats just the sort of place that i should like to have myself  if you had it you wouldnt be content youd want to pull down the house and build a bigger one its what i shall do some day i suppose but if i do it will never be so pretty again i suppose that fellow will petition wont he  i should say he wouldthough he wont get anything by it  he knows his purse is longer than ours and hell think to frighten usand by george he will frighten us too my father is not a rich man by any means  you should stand to your guns now  i mean to do so if i can my wifes father is made of money  what mr comfort  yes hes been blessed with the most surprising number of unmarried uncles and aunts that ever a man had hes rather fond of me and likes the idea of my being in parliament i think i shall hint to him that he must pay for the idea here we are will you come and take a turn round the place before dinner  rowan was then taken into the house and introduced to the old squire who received him with the stiff urbanity of former days  you are welcome to the grange mr rowan youll find us very quiet here which is more i believe than can have been said of baslehurst these last two or three days my daughterinlaw is somewhere with the children shell be here before dinner butler has that tailor fellow gone back to london yet  butler told his father that the tailor had at least gone away from baslehurst and then the two younger men went out and walked about the grounds till dinner time  it was mrs butler cornbury who gave soul and spirit to daily life at cornbury grangewho found the salt with which the bread was quickened and the wine with which the heart was made glad marvellous is the power which can be exercised almost unconsciously over a company or an individual or even upon a crowd by one person gifted with good temper good digestion good intellects and good looks a woman so endowed charms not only by the exercise of her own gifts but she endows those who are near her with a sudden conviction that it is they whose temper health talents and appearance is doing so much for society mrs butler cornbury was such a woman as this the grange was a popular house the old squire was not found to be very dull the young squire was thought to be rather clever the air of the house was lively and bracing men and women did not find the days there to be over long and mrs butler cornbury did it all  rowan did not see her till he met her in the drawingroom just before dinner when he found that two or three other ladies were also staying there she came up to him when he entered the room and greeted him as though he were an old friend all conversation at that moment of course had reference to the election thanks were given and congratulations received and when old mr cornbury shook his head his daughterinlaw assured him that there would be nothing to fear  i dont know what you call nothing to fear my dear i call two thousand pounds a great deal to fear  i shouldnt wonder if we dont hear another word about him said she  the old man uttered a long sigh it seems to me said he that no gentleman ought to stand for a seat in parliament since these people have been allowed to come up purity of election indeed it makes me sick come along my dear then he gave his arm to one of the young ladies and toddled into the diningroom  mrs butler cornbury said nothing special to luke rowan on that evening but she made the hours very pleasant to him all those halfmorbid ideas as to social difference between himself and his hosts family soon vanished the house was very comfortable the girls were very pretty mrs cornbury was very kind and everything went very well on the following morning it was nearly ten when they sat down to breakfast and half the morning before lunch had passed away in idle chat before the party bethought itself of what it should do for the day at last it was agreed that they would all stroll out through the woods up to a special reach of the river which there ran through a ravine of rock called cornbury cleeves many in those parts declared that cornbury cleeves was the prettiest spot in england i am not prepared to bear my testimony to the truth of that very wide assertion i can only say that i know no prettier spot the river here was rapid and sparkling not rapid because driven into small compass for its breadth was greater and more regular in its passage through the cleeves than it was either above or below but rapid from the declivity of its course on one side the rocks came sheer down to the water but on the other there was a strip of meadow or rather a grassy amphitheatre for the wall of rocks at the back of it was semicircular so as to enclose the field on every side there might be four or five acres of green meadow here but the whole was so interspersed with old stunted oak trees and thorns standing alone that the space looked larger than it was the rocks on each side were covered here and there with the richest foliage and the spot might be taken to be a valley from which as from that of rasselas there was no escape down close upon the margin of the water a bathinghouse had been built from which a plunge could be taken into six or seven feet of the coolest darkest cleanest water that a bather could desire in his heart  i suppose you never were here before said mrs cornbury to rowan  indeed i have said he i always think it such a grand thing that you landed magnates cant keep all your delights to yourself i dare say ive been here oftener than you have during the last three months  thats very likely seeing that its my first visit this summer  and ive been here a dozen times i suppose youll think im a villanous trespasser when i tell you that ive bathed in that very house more than once  then youve done more than i ever did and yet we had it made thinking it would do for ladies but the water looks so black  ah i like that as long as its a clear black  i like bathing where i can see the bright stones like jewels at the bottom you can never do that in fresh water its only in some nook of the sea where there is no sand when the wind outside has died away and when the tide is quiet and at its full then one can drop gently in and almost fancy that one belongs to the sea as the mermaids do i wonder how the idea of mermaids first came  some one saw a crowd of young women bathing  but then how came they to have lookingglasses and fishes tails  the fishes tails were taken as granted because they were in the sea and the lookingglasses because they were women said rowan  and the one with as much reason as the other bytheby mr rowan talking of women and fishes tails and lookingglasses and all other feminine attractions when did you see miss ray last  rowan paused before he answered her and looking round perceived that he had strayed with mrs cornbury to the furthest end of the meadow away from their companions it immediately came across his mind that this was the matter on which mrs cornbury wished to speak to him and by some combative process he almost resolved that he would not be spoken to on that matter  when did i see miss ray said he repeating her question two or three days after mrs tappitts party i have not seen her since that  and why dont you go and see her said mrs cornbury  now this was asked him in a tone which made it necessary that he should either answer her question or tell her simply that he would not answer it the questioners manner was so firm so eager so incisive that the question could not be turned away  i am not sure that i am prepared to tell you said he  ah but i want you to be prepared said she or rather perhaps to tell the truth i want to drive you to an answer without preparation is it not true that you made her an offer and that she accepted it  rowan thought a moment and then he answered her it is true  i should not have asked the question if i had not positively known that such was the case i have never spoken a word to her about it and yet i knew it her mother told my father  well  and as that is so why do you not go and see her i am sure you are not one of those who would play such a trick as that upon such a girl with the mere purpose of amusing yourself  upon no girl would i do so mrs cornbury  i feel sure of it therefore why do you not go to her they walked along together for a few minutes under the rocks in silence and then mrs cornbury again repeated her question why do you not go to her  mrs cornbury he said you must not be angry with me if i say that that is a matter which at the present moment i am not willing to discuss  nor must you be angry with me if as rachels friend i say something further about it as you do not wish to answer me i will ask no other question but at any rate you will be willing to listen to me rachel has never spoken to me on this subjectnot a word but i know from others who see her daily that she is very unhappy  i am grieved that it should be so  yes i knew you would be grieved but how could it be otherwise a girl you know mr rowan has not other things to occupy her mind as a man has i think of rachel ray that she would have been as happy there at braggs end as the day is long if no offer of love had come in her way she was not a girl whose head had been filled with romance and who looked for such things but for that very reason is she less able to bear the loss of it when the offer has come in her way i think perhaps you hardly know the depth of her character and the strength of her love  i think i know that she is constant  then why do you try her so hardly  mrs cornbury had promised that she would ask no more questions but the asking of questions was her easiest mode of saying that which she had to say and rowan though he had declared that he would answer no question could hardly avoid the necessity of doing so  it may be that the trial is the other way  i knowi understand they made her write a letter to you it was my fathers doing i will tell you the whole truth it was my fathers doing and therefore it is that i think myself bound to speak to you her mother came to him for advice and he had heard evil things spoken of you in baslehurst you will see that i am very frank with you and i will take some credit to myself too i believed such tidings to be altogether false and i made inquiry which proved that i was right but my father had given the advice which he thought best i do not know what rachel wrote to you but a girls letter under such circumstances can hardly do more than express the will of those who guide her it was sad enough for her to be forced to write such a letter but it will be sadder still if you cannot be brought to forgive it  then she paused standing under the gray rock and looking up eagerly into his face but he made her no answer nor gave her any sign his heart was very tender at that moment towards rachel but there was that in him of the stubbornness of manhood which would not let him make any sign of his tenderness  i will not press you to say anything mr rowan she continued and i am much obliged to you for having listened to me ive known rachel ray for many years and that must be my excuse  no excuse is wanting he said if i do not say anything it is not because i am offended there are things on which a man should not allow himself to speak without considering them  oh certainly come shall we go back to them at the bathinghouse theyll think weve lost ourselves  thus mrs cornbury said the words which she had desired to speak on rachel rays behalf  when they reached the grange there were still two hours left before the time of dressing for dinner should come and during these hours luke returned by himself to the cleeves he escaped from his host and retraced his steps and on reaching the river sat himself down on the margin and looked into the cool dark running water had he been severe to rachel he would answer no such question when asked by mrs cornbury but he was very desirous of answering it to himself the women at the cottage had doubted himmrs ray and her daughter with perhaps that other daughter of whom he had only heard and he had resolved that they should see him no more and hear of him no more till there should be no further room for doubt then he would show himself again at the cottage and again ask rachel to be his wife there was some manliness in this but there was also a hardness in his pride which deserved the rebuke which mrs cornburys words had conveyed to him he had been severe to rachel lying there with his full length stretched upon the grass he acknowledged to himself that he had thought more of his own feelings than of hers while mrs cornbury had been speaking he could not bring himself to feel that this was the case but now in his solitude he did acknowledge it what amount of sin had she committed against him that she should be so punished by him who loved her he took out her letter from his pocket and found that her words were loving though she had not been allowed to put into them that eager pressing speaking love which he had desired  spoken ill of me have they said he to himself as he got up to walk back to the grange well that was natural too what an ass a man is to care for such things as that  on that evening and the next morning the cornburys were very gracious to him and then he returned to baslehurst on the whole well pleased with his visit     chapter xii  in which the question of the brewery is settled   during the day or two immediately subsequent to the election mr tappitt found himself to be rather downhearted the excitement of the contest was over he was no longer buoyed up by the consoling and almost triumphant assurances of success for himself against his enemy rowan which had been administered to him by those with whom he had been acting on behalf of mr hart he was alone and thoughtful in his countinghouse or else subjected to the pressure of his wifes arguments in his private dwelling he had never yet been won over to say that he would agree to any proposition but he knew that he must now form some decision rowan would not even wait till the lawsuit should be decided by legal means if mr tappitt would not consent to one of the three propositions made to him rowan would at once commence the building of his new brewery he is that sort of man said honyman that if he puts a brick down nothing in the world will prevent him from going on  of course it wont said mrs tappitt oh dear oh dear t if you go on in this way we shall all be ruined and then people will say that it was my fault and that i ought to have had you inquired into about your senses  tappitt gnashed his teeth and rushed out of the diningroom back into his brewery among all those who were around him there was not one to befriend him even worts had turned against him and had received notice to go with a stern satisfaction which tappitt had perfectly understood  tappitt was in this frame of mind and was seated on his office stool with his hat over his eyes when he was informed by one of the boys about the place that a deputation from the town had come to wait upon himso he pulled off his hat and begged that the deputation might be shown into the countinghouse the deputation consisted of three tradesmen who were desirous of convening a meeting with the view of discussing the petition against mr cornburys return to parliament and they begged that mr tappitt would take the chair the meeting was to be held at the dragon and it was proposed that after the meeting there should be a little dinner mr tappitt would perhaps consent to take the chair at the dinner also mr tappitt did consent to both propositions and when the deputation withdrew he felt himself to be himself once more his courage had returned to him and he would at once rebuke his wife for the impropriety of the words she had addressed to him he would rebuke his wife and would then proceed to meet mr sharpit the attorney at the dragon and to take the chair at the meeting it could not be that a young adventurer such as rowan could put down an oldestablished firm such as his own or banish from the scene of his labours a man of such standing in the town as himself it was all the fault of honymanof honyman who never was firm on any matter when the meeting should be over he would say a word or two to sharpit and see if he could not put the matter into better training  with a heavy tread a tread that was intended to mark his determination he ascended to the drawingroom and from thence to the bedroom above in which mrs tappitt was then seated she understood the meaning of the footfall and knew well that it indicated a purpose of marital authority a woman must have much less of natural wit than had fallen to mrs tappitts share who has not learned from the experience of thirty years the meaning of such marital signs and sounds so she sat herself firmly in her seat caught hold of the petticoat which she was mending with a stout grasp and prepared herself for the battle margaret said he when he had carefully closed the door behind him i have come up to say that i do not intend to dine at home today  oh indeed said she at the dragon i suppose then  yes at the dragon ive been asked to take the chair at a popular meeting which is to be held with reference to the late election  take the chair  yes my dear take the chair at the meeting and at the dinner  now t dont you make a fool of yourself  no i wont but margaret i must tell you once for all that that is not the way in which i like you to speak to me why you should have so much less confidence in my judgment than other people in baslehurst i cannot conceive but  now t look here as for your taking the chair as you call it of course you can do it if you like it  of course i can and i do like it and i mean to do it but it isnt only about that ive come to speak to you you said something to me today before honyman that was very improper  what i say always is improper i know  i dont suppose you could have intended to insinuate that you thought that i was a lunatic  i didnt say so  you said something like it  no i didnt t  yes you did margaret  if youll allow me for a moment t ill tell you what i did say and if you wish it ill say it again  no id rather not hear it said again  but t i dont choose to be misunderstood nor yet misrepresented  i havent misrepresented you  but i say you have misrepresented me if i aint allowed to speak a word of course it isnt any use for me to open my mouth i hope i know what my duty is and i hope ive done itboth by you t and by the children i know im bound to submit and i hope i have submitted very hard it has been sometimes when ive seen things going as they have gone but ive remembered my duty as a wife and ive held my tongue when any other woman in england would have spoken out but there are some things which a woman cant stand and shouldnt and if im to see my girls ruined and left without a roof over their heads or a bit to eat or a thing to wear it shant be for want of a word from me  didnt they always have plenty to eat  but where is it to come from if youre going to rush openmouthed into the lions jaws in this way ive done my duty by you t and no man nor yet no woman can say anything to the contrary and if it was myself only id see myself on the brink of starvation before id say a word but i cant see those poor girls brought to beggary without telling you what everybody in baslehurst is talking about and i cant see you t behaving in such a way and sit by and hold my tongue  behave in what way havent i worked like a horse do you mean to tell me that i am to give up my business and my position and everything i have in the world and go away because a young scoundrel comes to baslehurst and tells me that he wants to have my brewery i tell you what margaret if you think im that sort of man you dont know me yet  i dont know about knowing you t  no you dont know me  if you come to that i know very well that i have been deceived i didnt want to speak of it but now i must i have been made to believe for these last twenty years that the brewery was all your own whereas it now turns out that youve only got a share in it and for aught i can see by no means the best share why wasnt i told all that before  woman shouted mr tappitt  yes woman indeed i suppose i am a woman and therefore im to have no voice in anything will you answer me one question if you please are you going to that man sharpit  yes i am  then mr tappitt i shall consult my brothers mrs tappitts brothers were grocers in plymouth men whom mr tappitt had never loved they maynt hold their heads quite as high as you door rather as you used to do when people thought that the establishment was all your own but such as it is nobody can turn them out of their shop in the marketplace if you are going to sharpit i shall consult them  you may consult the devil if you like it  oh oh very well mr tappitt its clear enough that youre not yourself any longer and that somebody must take up your affairs and manage them for you if youll follow my advice youll stay at home this evening and take a dose of physic and see dr haustus quietly in the morning  i shall do nothing of the kind  very well of course i cant make you as yet youre your own master if you choose to go to this silly meeting and then to drink gin and water and to smoke bad tobacco till all hours at the dragon and you in the dangerous state you are at present i cant help it i dont suppose that anything i could do now that is quite immediately would enable me to put you under fitting restraint  put me where then mr tappitt looked at his wife with a look that was intended to annihilate her for the time beingseeing that no words that he could speak had any such effectand he hurried out of the room without staying to wash his hands or brush his hair before he went off to preside at the meeting  mrs tappitt remained where she was for about half an hour and then descended among her daughters  isnt papa going to dine at home said augusta  no my dear your papa is going to dine with some friends of mr harts the candidate who was beaten  and has he settled anything about the brewery cherry asked  no not as yet your papa is very much troubled about it and i fear he is not very well i suppose he must go to this electioneering dinner when gentlemen take up that sort of thing they must go on with it and as they wish your father to preside over the petition i suppose he he cant very well help himself  is papa going to preside over the petition asked augusta  yes my dear  i hope it wont cost him anything said martha people say that those petitions do cost a great deal of money  its a very anxious time for me girls of course you must all of you see that im sure when we had our party i didnt think things were going to be as anxious as this or i wouldnt have had a penny spent in such a way as that if your papa could bring himself to give up the brewery everything would be well  i do so wish he would said cherry and let us all go and live at torquay i do so hate this nasty dirty old place  i shall never live in a house i like so well said martha  the house is well enough my dears and so is the brewery but it cant be expected that your father should go on working for ever as he does at present its too much for his strengtha great deal too much i can see it though i dont suppose any one else can no one knows only me what your father has gone through in that brewery  but why doesnt he take mr rowans offer said cherry  everybody seems to say now that rowan is ever so rich said augusta  i suppose papa doesnt like the feeling of being turned out said martha  he wouldnt be turned out my dear not the least in the world said mrs tappitt i dont choose to interfere much myself because perhaps i dont understand it but certainly i should like your papa to retire i have told him so but gentlemen sometimes dont like to be told of things  mrs tappitt could be very severe to her husband could say to him terrible words if her spirit were put up as she herself was wont to say but she understood that it did not become her to speak ill of their father before her girls nor would she willingly have been heard by the servants to scold their master and though she said terrible things she said them with a conviction that they would not have any terrible effect tappitt would only take them for what they were worth and would measure them by the standard which his old experience had taught him to adopt when a man has been long consuming red pepper it takes much red pepper to stimulate his palate had mrs tappitt merely advised her husband in proper conjugal phraseology to relinquish his trade and to retire to torquay her advice she knew would have had no weight she was eager on the subject feeling convinced that this plan of retirement was for the good of the family generally and therefore she had advocated it with energy there may be those who think that a wife goes too far in threatening a husband with a commission of lunacy and frightening him with a prospect of various fatal diseases but the dose must be adapted to the constitution and the palate that is accustomed to large quantities of red pepper must have quantities larger than usual whenever some special culinary effect is to be achieved on the present occasion mrs tappitt went on talking to the girls of their father in language that was quite eulogistic no threat against the absent brewer passed her mouthor theirs but they all understood each other and were agreed that everything was to be done to induce papa to accept mr rowans offer  then said cherry hell marry rachel ray and shell be mistress of the brewery house  never said mrs tappitt very solemnly never hell never be such a fool as that  never said augusta never  in the mean time the meeting went on at the dragon i cant say that mr tappitt was on this occasion called upon to preside over the petition he was simply invited to take the chair at a meeting of a dozen men at baslehurst who were brought together by mr sharpit in order that they might be induced by him to recommend mr hart to employ him mr sharpit in getting up the petition in question and in order that there might be some sufficient temptation to these twelve men to gather themselves together the dinner at the dragon was added to the meeting mr tappitt took the chair in the big uncarpeted fusty room upstairs in which masonic meetings were held once a month and in which the farmers of the neighbourhood dined once a week on market days he took the chair and some seven or eight of his townsmen clustered round him the others had sent word that they would manage to come in time for the dinner mr sharpit before he put the brewer in his place of authority prompted him as to what he was to do and in the course of a quarter of an hour two resolutions already prepared by mr sharpit had been passed unanimously mr hart was to be told by the assembled people of baslehurst that he would certainly be seated by a scrutiny and he was to be advised to commence his proceedings at once these resolutions were duly committed to paper by one of mr sharpits clerks and mr tappitt before he sat down to dinner signed a letter to mr hart on behalf of the electors of baslehurst when the work of the meeting was completed it still wanted half an hour to dinner during which the nine electors of baslehurst sauntered about the yard of the inn looked into the stables talked to the landlady at the bar indulged themselves with gin and bitters and found the time very heavy on their hands they were nine decentlooking middleaged men dressed in black not of the newest in swallowtailed coats and black trousers with chimneypot hats and red faces and as they pottered about the premises of the dragon they seemed to be very little at their ease  whats up jim said one of the postboys to the ostler  sharpits got em all here to get some more money out of that ere jew gentthats about the ticket said the ostler  hes a clever un said the postboy  at last the dinner was ready and the total number of the party having now completed itself the liberal electors of baslehurst prepared to enjoy themselves no bargain had been made on the subject but it was understood by them all that they would not be asked to pay for their dinner sharpit would see to that he would probably know how to put it into his little bill and if he failed in that the risk was his own  but while the body of the liberal electors was peeping into the stables and drinking gin and bitters mr sharpit and mr tappitt were engaged in a private conference  if you come to me said sharpit of course i must take it up the etiquette of the profession dont allow me to decline  but why should you wish to decline said tappitt not altogether pleased by mr sharpits manner  oh by no means no its just the sort of work i likenot much to be made by it but theres injury to be redressed and justice to be done only you see poor honyman hasnt got much of a practice left to him and i dont want to take his bread out of his mouth  but im not to be ruined because of that  as i said before if you bring the business to me i must take it up i cant help myself if i would and if i do take it up ill see you through it everybody who knows me knows that of me  i suppose i shall find you at home about ten tomorrow  yes ill be in my office at tenonly you should think it well over you know mr tappitt ive nothing to say against mr honymannot a word youll remember that if you please if there should be anything about it afterwards ah youre wanted for the chair mr tappitt ill come and sit alongside of you if youll allow me  the dinner itself was decidedly bad and the company undoubtedly dull i am inclined to think that every individual there would have dined more comfortably at home a horrid mess concocted of old gravy catsup and bad wine was distributed under the name of soup then there came upon the table half a huge hakethe very worst fish that swims a fish with which devonshire is peculiarly invested some hard dark brown mysterious balls were handed round which on being opened with a knife were found to contain sausagemeat very greasy and by no means cooked through even the dura ilia of the liberal electors of baslehurst declined to make acquaintance with these dainties after that came the dinner consisting of a piece of roast beef very raw and a leg of parboiled mutton absolutely blue in its state of rawness when the gory mess was seen which displayed itself on the first incision made into these lumps of meat the vicepresident and one or two of his friends spoke out aloud that hard and greasy sausagemeat might have been all right for anything they knew to the contrary and the soup they had swallowed without complaint but they did know what should be the state of a joint of meat when brought to the table and therefore they spoke out in their anger tappitt himself said nothing that was intended to be carried beyond the waiter seeing that beer from his own brewery was consumed in the tap of the dragon but the vicepresident was a hardware dealer with whom the dragon had but small connection of trade and he sent terrible messages down to the landlady threatening her with the blue boar the mitre and even with that nasty little pothouse the chequers what is it they expects for their threeandsixpence said the landlady in her wrath for it must be understood that sharpit knew well that he was dealing with one who understood the value of money and that he did not feel quite sure of passing the dinner in mr harts bill then came a pie with crust an inch thick which nobody could eat and a cabinet pudding so called full of lumps of suet i venture to assert that each liberal elector there would have got a better dinner at home and would have been served with greater comfort but a public dinner at an inn is the recognized relaxation of a middleclass englishman in the provinces did he not attend such banquets his neighbours would conceive him to be constrained by domestic tyranny others go to them and therefore he goes also he is bored frightfully by every speech to which he listens he is driven to the lowest depths of dismay by every speech which he is called upon to make he is thoroughly disgusted when he is called on to make no speech he has no point of sympathy with the neighbours between whom he sits the wine is bad the hot water is brought to him cold his seat is hard and crowded no attempt is made at the pleasures of conversation he is continually called upon to stand up that he may pretend to drink a toast in honour of some person or institution for which he cares nothing for the hero of the evening as to whom he is probably indifferent for the church which perhaps he never enters the army which he regards as a hotbed of aristocratic insolence or for the queen whom he reveres and loves by reason of his nature as an englishman but against whose fulsome praises as repeated to him ad nauseam in the chairmans speech his very soul unconsciously revolts it is all a bore trouble ennui nastiness and discomfort but yet he goes again and againbecause it is the relaxation natural to an englishman the frenchman who sits for three hours tilted on the hind legs of a little chair with his back against the windowsill of the café with first a cup of coffee before him and then a glass of sugar and water is perhaps as much to be pitied as regards his immediate misery but the liquids which he imbibes are not so injurious to him  mr tappitt with the eleven other liberal electors of baslehurst went through the ceremony of their dinner in the usual way they drank the health of the queen and of the volunteers of the county because there was present a podgy little grocer who had enrolled himself in the corps and who was thus enabled to make a speech and then they drank the health of mr hart whose ultimate return for the borough they pledged themselves to effect having done so much for business and having thus brought to a conclusion the political work of the evening they adjourned their meeting to a cosy little parlour near the bar and then they began to be happy some few of the number including the angry vicepresident who sold hardware took themselves home to their wives mrs tongs keeps him sharp enough by the ears said sharpit winking to tappitt come along old fellow and well get a drop of something really hot tappitt winked back again and shook his head with an affected laugh but as he did so he thought of mrs t at home and the terrible words she had spoken to himand at the same moment an idea came across him that mr sharpit was a very dangerous companion  about half a dozen entered the cosy little parlour and there they remained for a couple of hours while sitting in that cosy little parlour they really did enjoy themselves about nine oclock they had a bit of the raw beef broiled and in that guise it was pleasant enough and the water was hot and the tobacco was grateful and the stiffness of the evening was gone the men chatted together and made no more speeches and they talked of matters which bore a true interest to them sharpit explained to them how each man might be assisted in his own business if this rich london tailor could be brought in for the borough and by degrees they came round to the affairs of the brewery and tappitt as the brandy warmed him spoke loudly against rowan  by george said the podgy grocer if anybody would offer me a thousand a year to give up id take it hopping  then i wouldnt said tappitt and whats more i wont but brewing aint like other businessestheres more in it than in most others  of course there is said sharpit it isnt like any common trade  thats true too said the podgy grocer  a man usually receives some compensation for having gone through the penance of the chairmans duties for the remainder of the evening he is entitled to the flattery of his companions and generally receives it till they become tipsy and insubordinate tappitt had not the character of an intemperate man but on this occasion he did exceed the bounds of a becoming moderation the room was hot and the tobacco smoke was thick the wine had been bad and the brandy was strong sharpit too urged him to new mixtures and stronger denunciations against rowan till at last at eleven oclock when he took himself to the brewery he was not in a condition proper for the father of such daughters or for the husband of such a wife  shall i see him home said the podgy grocer to mr sharpit  tappitt with the suspicious quickness of a drunken man turned sharply upon the podgy and abashed grocer and abused him for his insolence he then made his way out of the innyard and along the high street and down brewery lane to his own door knowing the way as well as though he had been sober and passing over it as quickly nor did he fall or even stumble though now and again he reeled slightly and as he went the idea came strongly upon him that sharpit was a dangerous man and that perhaps at this very moment he tappitt was standing on the brink of a precipice then he remembered that his wife would surely be watching for him and as he made his first attempt to insert the latchkey into the door his heart became forgetful of the brandy and sank low within his breast  how affairs went between him and mrs tappitt on that night i will not attempt to describe that she used her power with generosity i do not doubt that she used it with discretion i am quite convinced on the following morning at ten oclock tappitt was still in bed but a note had been written by mrs t to messrs sharpit and longfite saying that the projected visit had under altered circumstances become unnecessary that tappitts head was racked with pain and his stomach disturbed with sickness there can be no doubt and as little that mrs t used the consequent weakness of her husband for purposes of feminine dominion but this she did with discretion and even with kindness only a word or two was said as to the state in which he had returned homea word or two with the simple object of putting that dominion on a firm basis after that mrs tappitt took his condition as an established fact administered to him the comforts of her medicinechest and teapot excused his illness to the girls as having been produced by the fish and never left his bedside till she had achieved her purpose if ever a man got tipsy to his own advantage mr tappitt did so on that occasion and if ever a man in that condition was treated with forbearing kindness by his wife mr tappitt was so treated then  dont disturb yourself t she said theres nothing wants doing in the brewery and if it did what would it signify in comparison with your health the brewery wont be much to you now thank goodness and im sure youve had enough of it thirty years of such work as that would make any man sick and weak im sure i dont wonder at your being illnot the least the wonder is that youve ever stood up against it so long as you have if youll take my advice youll just turn round and try to sleep for an hour or so  tappitt took her advice at any rate so far that he turned round and closed his eyes up to this time he had not given way about the brewery he had uttered no word of assent but he was gradually becoming aware that he would have to yield before he would be allowed to put on his clothes and now in the base and weak condition of his head and stomach yielding did not seem to him to be so very bad a thing after all the brewery was troublesome the fight was harassing rowan was young and strong and mr sharpit was very dangerous rowan too had risen in his estimation as in that of others and he could not longer argue even to himself that the stipulated income would not be paid he did not sleep but got into that halfdrowsy state in which men think of their existing affairs but without any power of active thought he knew that he ought to be in his countinghouse and at work he half feared that the world was falling away from him because he was not there he was ashamed of himself and sometimes almost entertained a thought of rising up and shaking off his lethargy but his stomach was bad and he could not bring himself to move his head was tormented and his pillow was soft and therefore there he lay he wondered what was the time of day but did not think of looking at his watch which was under his head he heard his wifes steps about the room as she shaded some window from his eyes or crept to the door to give some household order to one of her girls outside but he did not speak to her nor she to him she did not speak to him as long as he lay there motionless and when he moved with a small low groan she merely offered him some beef tea  it was nearly six oclock and the hour of dinner at the brewery was long passed when mrs tappitt sat herself down by the bedside determined to reap the fruit of her victory he had just raised himself in his bed and announced his intention of getting updeclaring as he did so that he would never again eat any of that accursed fish the moment of his renovation had come upon him and mrs tappitt perceived that if he escaped from her now there might even yet be more trouble  it wasnt only the fish t she said with somewhat of sternness in her eye  i hardly drank anything said tappitt  of course i wasnt there to see what you took said she but you were very bad when you came home last nightvery bad indeed you couldnt have got in at the door only for me  thats nonsense  but it is quite true its a mercy t that neither of the girls saw you only think but therell be nothing more of that kind im sure when we are out of this horrid place and it wouldnt have happened now only for all this trouble  to this tappitt made no answer but he grunted and again said that he thought he would get up  of course its settled now t that were to leave this place  i dont know that at all  then t you ought to know it come now just look at the common sense of the thing if we dont give up the brewery what are we to do there isnt a decent respectable person in the town in favour of our staying here only that rascal sharpit you desired me this morning to write and tell him youd have nothing more to do with him and so i did tappitt had not seen his wifes letter to the lawyerhad not asked to see it and now became aware that his only possible supporter might probably have been driven away from him sharpit too though dangerous as an enemy was ten times more dangerous as a friend  of course youll take that young mans offer shall i sit down and write a line to honyman and tell him to come in the morning  tappitt groaned again and again said that he would get up but mrs t would not let him out of bed till he had assented to her proposition that honyman should be again invited to the brewery he knew well that the battle was gone from himhad in truth known it through all those halfcomatose hours of his bedridden day but a man or a nation when yielding must still resist even in yielding tappitt fumed and fussed under the clothes protesting that his sending for honyman would be useless but the letter was written in his name and sent with his knowledge and it was perfectly understood that that invitation to honyman signified an unconditional surrender on the part of mr tappitt one word mrs t said as she allowed her husband to escape from his prison amidst the blankets one word by which to mark that the thing was done and one word only i suppose we neednt leave the house for about a month or sobecause it would be inconvenient about the furniture  whos to turn you out if you stay for six months said tappitt  the thing was marked enough then and mrs tappitt retired in muffled triumphretired when she had made all things easy for the simplest ceremony of dressing  just sponge your face my dear she said and put on your dressinggown and come down for half an hour or so  im all right now said tappitt  oh quite sobut i wouldnt go to the trouble of much dressing then she left him descended the stairs and entered the parlour among her daughters when there she could not abstain from one blast of the trumpet of triumph well girls she said its all settled and we shall be in torquay now before the winter  no said augusta  thatll be a great change said martha  in torquay before the winter said cherry oh mamma how clever you have been  and now your papa is coming down and you should thank him for what hes doing for you its all for your sake that hes doing it  mr tappitt crept into the room and when he had taken his seat in his accustomed armchair the girls went up to him and kissed him then they thanked him for his proposed kindness in taking them out of the brewery  oh papa it is so jolly said cherry  mr tappitt did not say much in answer to thisbut luckily there was no necessity that he should say anything it was an occasion on which silence was understood as giving a perfect consent     chapter xiii  what took place at braggs end farm   when mrs tappitt had settled within her own mind that the brewery should be abandoned to rowan she was by no means therefore ready to assent that rachel ray should become the mistress of the brewery house never she had exclaimed when cherry had suggested such a result never and augusta had echoed the protestation never never i will not say that she would have allowed her husband to remain in his business in order that she might thus exclude rachel from such promotion but she could not bring herself to believe that luke rowan would be so fatuous so ignorant of his own interests so deluded as to marry that girl from braggs end it is thus that the mrs tappitts of the world regard other womens daughters when they have undergone any disappointment as to their own she had no reason for wishing well to rowan and would not have cared if he had taken to his bosom a harpy in marriage but she could not endure to hear of the success of the girl whose attractions had foiled her own little plan i dont believe that the man can ever be such a fool as that she said again to augusta when on the evening of the day following tappitts abdication a rumour reached the brewery that luke rowan had been seen walking out upon the cawston road  mr honyman in accordance with his instructions called at the brewery on that morning and was received by mr tappitt with a sullen and almost savage submission mrs t had endeavoured to catch him first but in that she had failed she did however manage to see the attorney as he came out from her husband  its all settled said honyman and ill see rowan myself before half an hour is over  im sure its a great blessing mr honyman said the ladynot on that occasion assuming any of the glory to herself  it was the only thing for him said mr honymanthat is if he didnt like to take the young man in as acting partner  that wouldnt have done at all said mrs t and then the lawyer went his way  in the mean time tappitt sat sullen and wretched in the countinghouse such moments occur in the lives of most of usmoments in which the real work of life is brought to an endand they cannot but be sad it is very well to talk of ease and dignity but ease of spirit comes from action only and the worlds dignity is given to those who do the worlds work let no man put his neck from out of the collar till in truth he can no longer draw the weight attached to it tappitt had now got rid of his collar and he sat very wretched in his brewery countinghouse  be i to go sir  tappitt in his meditation was interrupted by these words spoken not in a rough voice and looking up he saw worts standing in the countinghouse before him worts had voted for butler cornbury whereas had he voted for mr hart mr hart would have been returned and upon that worts as a rebellious subject had received notice to quit the premises now his time was out and he came to ask whether he was to leave the scene of his forty years of work but what would be the use of sending worts away even if the wish to punish his contumacy still remained in another week worts would be brought back again in triumph and would tread those brewery floors with the step almost of a master while he tappitt could tread them only as a stranger if he were allowed to tread them at all  you can stay if you like said tappitt hardly looking up at the man  i know you be a going mr tappitt said the man and i hear you be a going very handsome like gentlefolk such as yeu neednt go on working allays like uz if so be yeu be a going mr tappitt i hope yeu and mell part friendly weve been together a sight o yearstoo great a sight for uz to part unfriendly  mr tappitt admitted the argument shook hands with the man and then of course took him into his immediate confidence with more warmth than he would have done had there been no quarrel between them and i think he found some comfort in this he walked about the premises with worts telling him much that was true and some few things that were not strictly accurate for instance he said that he had made up his mind to leave the place whereas that action of decisive resolution which we call making up our minds had perhaps been done by mrs tappitt rather than by him but worts took all these assertions with an air of absolute belief which comforted the brewer worts was very wise in his discretion on that day and threw much oil on the troubled waters so that tappitt when he left him bade god bless him and expressed a hope that the old place might still thrive for his sake  and for yourn too master said worts for yeull allays have the best egg still the young master hell only be a working for yeu  there was comfort in this thought and tappitt when he went into his dinner was able to carry himself like a man  the tidings which had reached mrs tappitt as to rowan having been seen on that evening walking on the cawston road with his face towards braggs end were true on that morning mr honyman had come to him and his career in life was at once settled for him  mr tappitt is quite in time mr honyman he had said but he would not have been in time this day week unless he had consented to pay for what work had been already done for i had determined to begin at once  the truth is mr rowan you step into an uncommon good thing but mr tappitt is tired of the work and glad to give it up  thus the matter was arranged between them and before nightfall everybody in baslehurst knew that tappitt and rowan had come to terms and that tappitt was to retire upon a pension there was some little discrepancy as to the amount of tappitts annuity the liberal faction asserting that he was to receive two thousand a year and those of the other side cutting him down to two hundred  on the evening of that dayin the cool of the eveningluke rowan sauntered down the high street of baslehurst and crossed over cawston bridge on the bridge he was all alone and he stood there for a moment or two leaning upon the parapet looking down upon the little stream beneath the arch during the day many things had occupied him and he had hardly as yet made up his mind definitely as to what he would do and what he would say during the hours of the evening from the moment in which honyman had announced to him tappitts intended resignation he became aware that he certainly should go out to braggs end before that day was over it had been with him a settled thing a thing settled almost without thought ever since the receipt of rachels letter that he would take this walk to braggs end when he should have put his affairs at baslehurst on some stable footing but that he would not take that walk before he had so done  they say rachel had written in her letter they say that as the business here about the brewery is so very unsettled they think it probable that you will not have to come back to baslehurst any more  in that had been the offence they had doubted his stability and beyond that had almost doubted his honesty he would punish them by taking them at their word till both should be put beyond all question he knew well that the punishment would fall on rachel whereas none of the sin would have been rachels sin but he would not allow himself to be deterred by that consideration  it is her letter he said to himself and in that way will i answer her when i do go there again they will all understand me better  it had been too a matter of pride to him that mr comfort and mrs butler cornbury should thus be made to understand him he would say nothing of himself and his own purposes to any of them he would speak neither of his own means nor his own stedfastness but he would prove to them that he was stedfast and that he had boasted of nothing which he did not possess when mrs butler cornbury had spoken to him down by the cleeves asking him of his purpose and struggling to do a kind thing by rachel he had resolved at once that he would tell her nothing she should find him out he liked her for loving rachel but neither to her nor even to rachel herself would he say more till he could show them that the business about the brewery was no longer unsettled  but up to this momentthis moment in which he was standing on the bridge he had not determined what he would say to rachel or to rachels mother he had never relaxed in his purpose of making rachel his wife since his first visit to the cottage he was one who having a fixed resolve feels certain of their ultimate success in achieving it he was now going to braggs end to claim that which he regarded as his own but he had not as yet told himself in what terms he would put forward his claim so he stood upon the bridge thinking  he stood upon the bridge thinking but his thoughts would only go backwards and would do nothing for him as to his future conduct he remembered his first walk with her and the churchyard elms with the setting sun and the hot dances in mrs tappitts house and he remembered them without much of the triumph of a successful lover it had been very sweet but very easy in so saying to himself he by no means threw blame upon rachel things were easy he thought and it was almost a pity that they should be so as for rachel nothing could have been more honest or more to his taste than her mode of learning to love him a girl who while intending to accept him could yet have feigned indifference would have disgusted him at once nevertheless he could not but wish that there had been some castles for him to storm in his career tappitt had made but poor pretence of fighting before he surrendered and as to rachel it had not been in rachels nature to make any pretence he passed from the bridge at last without determining what he would say when he reached the cottage but he did not pass on till he had been seen by the scrutinizing eyes of miss pucker  if there aint young rowan going out to braggs end again she said to herself comforting herself i fear or striving to comfort herself with an inward assertion that he was not going there for any good striving to comfort herself but not effectually for though the assertion was made by herself to herself yet it was not believed though she declared with wellpronounced mental words that luke rowan was going on that path for no good purpose she felt a wretched conviction at her hearts core that rachel ray would be made to triumph over her and her early suspicions by a happy marriage nevertheless she carried the tidings up into baslehurst and as she repeated it to the grocers daughters and the bakers wife she shook her head with as much apparent satisfaction as though she really believed that rachel oscillated between a ruined name and a broken heart  he walked on very slowly towards braggs end as though he almost dreaded the interview swinging his stick as was his custom and keeping his feet on the grassy edges of the road till he came to the turn which brought him on to the green when on the green he did not take the highway but skirted along under farmer sturts hedge so that he had to pass by the entrance of the farmyard before he crossed over to the cottage here just inside her own gate he encountered mrs sturt standing alone she had been intent on the cares of her poultryyard till she had espied luke rowan but then she had forgotten chickens and ducks and all and had given herself up to thoughts of rachels happiness in having her lover back again  its he as sure as eggs she had said to herself when she first saw him how mortal slow he do walk to be sure if he was coming as joe to me id soon shake him into quicker steps than them  oh mrs sturt said he i hope youre quite well and he stopped short at her gate  pretty bobbish thankee mr rowan and hows yourself are you going over to the cottage this evening  whos at home there mrs sturt  well theyre all at home mrs ray and rachel and mrs prime i doubt whether you know the eldest daughter mr rowan  luke did not know mrs prime and by no means wished to spend any of the hours of the present evening in making her acquaintance  is mrs prime there he asked  deed she is mr rowan shes come back these last two days  thereupon rowan paused for a moment having carefully placed himself inside the gateposts of the farmyard so that he might not be seen by the inmates of the cottage if haply he had hitherto escaped their eyes  mrs sturt said he i wonder whether youd do me a great favour  that depends said mrs sturt if its to do any good to any of them over there i will  if i wanted to do harm to any of them i shouldnt come to you  well i should hope not is she and you going to be one mr rowan thats about the whole of it  it shant be my fault if were not said rowan  thats spoken honest said the lady and now ill do anything in my power to bring you together if youll just go into my little parlour ill bring her to you in five seconds i will indeed mr rowan you wont mind going through the kitchen for once will you  luke did not mind going through the kitchen and immediately found himself shut up in mrs sturts back parlour looking out among the mingled roses and cabbages  mrs sturt walked quickly across the road to the cottage door and went at once to the open window of the sittingroom mrs ray was there with a book in her handa serious book the perusal of which i fear was in some degree due to the presence of her elder daughter and mrs prime was there with another book evidently very serious and rachel was there too seated on the sofa deeply buried in the manipulation of a dress belonging to her mother mrs sturt was sure at once that they had not seen luke rowan as he passed inside the farmyard gate and that they did not suspect that he was near them  oh mrs sturt is that you said the widow looking up youll just come in for a minute wont you and mrs ray showed by a suppressed yawn that her attention had not been deeply fixed by that serious book rachel looked up and bade the visitor welcome with a little nod but it was not a cheery nod as it would have been in old days before her sorrow had come upon her  ill have the cherries back in her cheeks before the evenings over said mrs sturt to herself as she looked at the palefaced girl mrs prime also made some little salutation to their neighbour but she did so with the very smallest expenditure of thoughts or moments mrs sturt was all very well but mrs prime had greater work on hand than gossiping with mrs sturt  ill not just come in thankee mrs ray but if it aint troubling you i want to speak a word to you outside and a word to rachel too if she dont mind coming  a word to me said rachel getting up and putting down her dress her thoughts nowadays were always fixed on the same subject and it seemed that any special word to her must have reference to that mrs ray also got up leaving her mark in her book mrs prime went on reading harder than ever there was to be some conference of importance from which she could not but feel herself to be excluded in a very special way something wicked was surely to be proposed or she would have been allowed to hear it she said nothing but her head was almost shaken by the vehemence with which she read the book in her lap  mrs sturt retired beyond the precincts of the widows front garden before she said a word rachel had followed her first through the gate and mrs ray came after with her apron turned over her head what is it mrs sturt said rachel have you heard anything  heard anything well im always a hearing of something do you slip across the green while i speak just one word to your mother and rachel wait for me at the gate mrs ray hes in my little parlour  who not luke rowan  but he is though that very young man hes come over to make it up with her hes told me so with his own mouth you may be as sure of it asasas anything you leave em to me mrs ray i wouldnt bring them together if it wasnt for good its my belief our pet would a died if he hadnt come back to herit is then and mrs sturt put her apron up to her eyes  rachel having paused for a moment as she looked first at her mother and then at mrs sturt had done as she was bidden and had walked quickly across the green mrs ray when she heard her neighbours tidings stood fixed by dismay and dread mingled with joy she had longed for his coming back but now that he was there close upon them intending to do all that she had wished him to do she was half afraid of him after all was he not a young man and might he not even yet be a wolf she was horrorstricken at the idea of sending rachel over to see a lover and looked back at the cottage window towards mrs prime as though to see whether she was being watched in her iniquity oh mrs sturt she said why didnt you give us time to think about it  give you time how could i give you time and he here on the spot theres been too much time to my thinking when young folk are agreeable and the old folk are agreeable too there cant be too little time come along over and well talk of it in the kitchen while they talks in the parlour hed a been in there among you all only for mrs prime she is so dour like for a young man to have to say anything before her of the likes of that thats why i took him into our place  they overtook rachel at the house door and they all went through together into the great kitchen oh rachel said mrs ray oh dear  what is it mamma said rachel then looking into her mothers face she guessed the truth mamma she said hes here mr rowan is here and she took hold of her mothers arm as though to support herself  and thats just the truth said mrs sturt triumphantly hes through there in the little parlour and you must just go to him my dear and hear what hes got to say to you  oh mamma said rachel  i suppose you must do what she tells you said mrs ray  of course she must said mrs sturt  mamma you must go to him said rachel  that wont do at all said mrs sturt  and why has he come here said rachel  ah i wonder why said mrs sturt i wonder why any young man should come on such an errand but it wont do to leave him there standing in my parlour by himself so do you come along with me  so saying mrs sturt took rachel by the arm to lead her away mrs ray in this great emergency was perfectly helpless she could simply look at her daughter with imploring loving eyes and stand quivering in doubt against the dresser mrs sturt had very decided views on the matter she had put luke rowan into the parlour with a promise that she would bring rachel to him there and she was not going to break her word through any mock delicacy the two young people liked one another and they should have this opportunity of saying so in each others hearing so she took rachel by the arm and opening the door of the parlour led her into the room mr rowan she said when you and miss rachel have had your say out youll find me and her mamma in the kitchen then she closed the door and left them alone  rachel when first summoned out of the cottage had felt at once that mrs sturts visit must have reference to luke rowan indeed everything with her in her present moods had some reference to himsome reference though it might be ever so remote but now before she had time to form a thought she was told that he was there in the same house with her and that she was taken to him in order that she might hear his words and speak her own it was very sudden and for the space of a few moments she would have fled away from mrs sturts kitchen had such flight been possible since rowan had gone from her there had been times in which she would have fled to him in which she would have journeyed alone any distance so that she might tell him of her love and ask whether she had got any right to hope for his but all that seemed to be changed though her mother was there with her and her friend she feared that this seeking of her lover was hardly maidenly should he not have come to herevery foot of the way to her feet and there have spoken if he had aught to say before she had been called on to make any sign would he like her for thus going to him but then she had no chance of escape she found herself in mrs sturts kitchen under her mothers sanction before she had been able to form any purpose and then an idea did come to her even at that moment that poor luke would have had a hard task of it in her sisters presence when she was first told that he was there in the farmhouse parlour her courage left her and she dreaded the encounter but she was able to collect her thoughts as she passed out of the kitchen and across the passage and when she followed mrs sturt into the room she had again acquired the power to carry herself as a woman having a soul of her own  rachel rowan said stepping up to her and tendering his hand to her i have come to answer your letter in person  i knew she said when i wrote it that my letter did not deserve any answer i did not expect an answer  but am i wrong now to bring you one in person i have thought so much of seeing you again will you not say a word of welcome to me  i am glad to see you mr rowan  mr rowan nay if it is to be mr rowan i may as well go back to baslehurst it has come to that that it must be luke now or there must be no naming of names between us you chided me once when i called you rachel  you called me so once sir when i should have chided you and did not i remember it well you were very wrong and i was very foolish  but i may call you rachel now then when she did not answer him at the moment he asked the question again in that imperious way which was common with him may i not call you now as i please if it be not so my coming here is useless come rachel say one word to me boldly do you love me well enough to be my wife  she was standing at the open window looking away from him while he remained at a little distance from her as though he would not come close to her till he had exacted from her some positive assurance of her love as a penance for the fault committed by her letter he certainly was not a soft lover nor by any means inclined to abate his own privileges he paused a moment as though he thought that his last question must elicit a plain reply but no reply to it came she still looked away from him through the window as though resolved that she would not speak till his mood should have become more tender  you said something in your letter he continued about my affairs here in baslehurst being unsettled i would not show myself here again till that matter was arranged  it was not i she said turning sharply round upon him it was not i who thought that  it was in your letter rachel  do you know so little of a girl like me as to suppose that what was written there came from me myself did i not tell you that i said what i was told to say did i not explain to you that mamma had gone to mr comfort did you not know that all that had come from him  i only know that i read it in your letter to methe only letter you had ever written to me  you are unfair to me mr rowan you know that you are unfair  call me luke he said call me by my own name  luke she said you are unfair to me  then by heavens it shall be for the last time may things in this world and the next go well with me as i am fair to you for the future so saying he came up close to her and took her at once in his arms  luke luke dont you frighten me indeed you do  you shall give me a fair open kiss honestly before i leave youin truth you shall if you love me and wish to be my wife and intend me to understand that you and i are now pledged to each other beyond the power of any person to separate us by his advice or any mother by her fears give me a bold honest kiss and i will understand that it means all that  still she hesitated for a moment turning her face away from him while he held her by the waist she hesitated while she was weighing the meaning of his words and taking them home to herself as her own then she turned her neck towards him still holding back her head till her face was immediately under his own and after another moments pause she gave him her pledge as he had asked it mrs sturts words had come true and the cherries had returned to her cheek  my own rachel and now tell me one thing are you happy  so happy  my own one  but lukei have been wretchedso wretched i thought you would never come back to me  and did that make you wretched  ahdid it what do you think yourself when i wrote that letter to you i knew i had no right to expect that you would think of me again  but how could i help thinking of you when i loved you  and then when mamma saw you in exeter and you sent me no word of message  i was determined to send none till this business was finished  ah that was cruel but you did not understand i suppose no man can understand i couldnt have believed it myself tilltill after you had gone away it seemed as though all the sun had deserted us and that everything was cold and dark  they stood at the open window looking out upon the roses and cabbages till the patience of mrs sturt and of mrs ray was exhausted what they said beyond so much of their words as i have repeated need not be told but when a low halfabashed knock at the door interrupted them luke thought that they had hardly been there long enough to settle the preliminaries of the affair which had brought him to braggs end  may we come in said mrs sturt very timidly  oh mamma mamma said rachel and she hid her face upon her mothers shoulder     chapter xiv  mrs prime reads her recantation   above an hour had passed after the interruption mentioned at the end of the last chapter before mrs ray and rachel crossed back from the farmhouse to the cottage and when they went they went alone during that hour they had been sitting in mrs sturts parlour and when at last they got up to go they did not press luke rowan to go with them mrs prime was at the cottage and it was necessary that everything should be explained to her before she was asked to give her hand to her future brotherinlaw the farmer had come in and had joked his joke and mrs sturt had clacked over them as though they were a brood of chickens of her own hatching and mrs ray had smiled and cried and sobbed and laughed till she had become almost hysterical then she had jumped up from her seat saying oh dear what will dorothea think has become of us after that rachel insisted upon going and the mother and daughter returned across the green leaving luke at the farmhouse ready to take his departure as soon as mrs ray and rachel should have safely reached their home  i knew thee was minded stedfast to take her said mrs sturt when it came out upon the newspaper how thou hadst told them all in baslehurst that thou wouldst wed none but a baslehurst lass  in answer to this luke protested that he had not thought of rachel when he was making that speech and tried to explain that all that was soft sawder as he called it for the election but the words were too apposite to the event and the sentiment too much in accordance with mrs sturts chivalric views to allow of her admitting the truth of any such assurance as this  i know she said i know and when i read them words in the newspaper i said to the gudeman there we shall have bridecake from the cottage now before christmas  for the matter of that so you shall said luke shaking hands with her as he went or the fault will not be mine  rachel as she followed her mother out from the farmyard gate had not a word to say could it have been possible she would have wished to remain silent for the remainder of the evening and for the night so that she might have time to think of this thing which she had done and to enjoy the full measure of her happiness hitherto she had hardly had any joy in her love the cup had been hardly given to her to drink before it had been again snatched away and since then she had been left to think that the draught for which she longed would never again be offered to her lips the whole affair had now been managed so suddenly and the action had been so quick that she had hardly found a moment for thought could it be that things were so fixed that there was no room for further disappointment she had been scalded so cruelly that she still feared the hot water her heart was sore with the old hurt as the head that has ached will be still sore when the actual malady has passed away she longed for hours of absolute quiet in which she might make herself sure that her malady had also passed away and that the soreness which remained came only from the memory of former pain but there was no such perfect rest within her reach as yet  will you tell her or shall i said mrs ray pausing for a moment at the cottage gate  you had better tell her mamma  i suppose she wont set herself against it will she  i hope not mamma i shall think her very illnatured if she does but it cant make any real difference now you know  no it cant make any difference only it will be so uncomfortable  then with halffrightened muffled steps they entered their own house and joined mrs prime in the sittingroom  mrs prime was still reading the serious book but i am bound to say that her mind had not been wholly intent upon it during the long absence of her mother and sister she had struggled for a time to ignore the slight fact that her companions were away gossiping with the neighbouring farmers wife she had made a hard fight with her book pinning her eyes down upon the page over and over again as though in pinning down her eyes she could pin down her mind also but by degrees the delay became so long that she was tantalized into surmises as to the subject of their conversation if it were not wicked why should not she have been allowed to share it she did not imagine it to be wicked according to the worlds ordinary wickednessbut she feared that it was wicked according to that tone of morals to which she was desirous of tying her mother down as a bond slave they were away talking about love and pleasure and those heartthrobbings in which her sister had so unfortunately been allowed to indulge she felt all but sure that some tidings of luke rowan had been brought in mrs sturts budget of news and she had never been able to think well of luke rowan since the evening on which she had seen him standing with rachel in the churchyard she knew nothing against him but she had then made up her mind that he was pernicious and she could not bring herself to own that she had been wrong in that opinion she had been loud and defiant in her denunciation when she had first suspected rachel of having a lover since that she had undergone some troubles of her own by which the tone of her remonstrances had been necessarily moderated but even now she could not forgive her sister such a lover as luke rowan she would have been quite willing to see her sister married but the lover should have been dingy blackcoated lugubrious having about him some true essence of the tears of the valley of tribulation alas her sisters taste was quite of another kind  im afraid you will have been thinking that we were never coming back again said mrs ray as she entered the room  no mother i didnt think that but i thought you were staying late with mrs sturt  so we wereand really i didnt think we had been so long but dorothea there was some one else over there besides mrs sturt and he kept us  he what he said mrs prime she had not even suspected that the lover had been over there in person  mr rowan my dear he has been at the farm  what the young man that was dismissed from mr tappitts  it was ill said of hervery ill said and so she was herself aware as soon as the words were out of her mouth but she could not help it she had taken a side against luke rowan and could not restrain herself from illnatured words rachel was still standing in the middle of the room when she heard her lover thus described but she would not condescend to plead in answer to such a charge the colour came to her cheeks and she threw up her head with a gesture of angry pride but at the moment she said nothing mrs ray spoke  it seems to me dorothea she said that you are mistaken there i think he has dismissed mr tappitt  i dont know much about it said mrs prime i only know that theyve quarrelled  but it would be well that you should learn because im sure you will be glad to think as well of your brotherinlaw as possible  do you mean that he is engaged to marry rachel  yes dorothea i think we may say that it is all settled nowmaynt we rachel and a very excellent young man he isand as for being well off a great deal better than what a child of mine could have expected and a fine comely fellow he is as a womans eye would wish to rest on  beauty is but skin deep said mrs prime with no little indignation in her tone that a thing so vile as personal comeliness should have been mentioned by her mother on such an occasion  when he came out here and drank tea with us that evening continued mrs ray i took a liking to him most unaccountable unless it was that i had a foreshadowing that he was going to be so near and dear to me  mother there can have been nothing of the kind you should not say such things the lord in his providence allows us no foreshadowing of that kind  at any rate i liked him very much didnt i rachelfrom the first moment i set eyes on him only i dont think hell ever do away with cider in devonshire because of the apple trees but if people are to drink beer it stands to reason that good beer will be better than bad  all this time rachel had not spoken a word nor had her sister uttered anything expressive of congratulation or good wishes now as mrs ray ceased there came a silence in the room and it was incumbent on the elder sister to break it  if this matter is settled rachel  it is settledi think said rachel  if it is settled i hope that it may be for your lasting happiness and eternal welfare  i hope it will said rachel  marriage is a most important step  thats quite true my dear said mrs ray  a most important step and one that requires the most exact circumspectionespecially on the part of the young woman i hope you may have known mr rowan long enough to justify your confidence in him  it was still the voice of a raven mrs prime as she spoke thus knew that she was croaking and would have divested herself of her croak and spoken joyously had such mode of speech been possible to her but it was not possible though she would permit no such foreshadowings as those at which her mother had hinted she had committed herself to forebodings against this young man to such extent that she could not wheel her thoughts round and suddenly think well of him she could not do so as yet but she would make the struggle  god bless you rachel she said when they parted for the night you have my best wishes for your happiness i hope you do not doubt my love because i think more of your welfare in another world than in this then she kissed her sister and they parted for the night  rachel now shared her mothers room and from her mother when they were alone together she received abundance of that sympathy for which her heart was craving  you mustnt mind dorothea the widow said  no mamma i do not  i mean that you mustnt mind her seeming to be so hard she means well through it all and is as affectionate as any other woman  why did she say that he had been dismissed when she knew that it wasnt true  ah my dear cant you understand when she first heard of mr rowan  call him luke mamma  when she first heard of him she was taught to believe that he was giddy and that he didnt mean anything  why should she think evil of people who taught her  miss pucker and mr prong and that set  yes and they are the people who talk most of christian charity  but my dear they dont mean to be uncharitable they try to do good if dorothea really thought that this young man was a dangerous acquaintance what could she do but say so and you cant expect her to turn round all in a minute think how she has been troubled herself about this affair of mr prongs  but thats no reason she should say that luke is dangerous dangerous what makes me so angry is that she should think everybody is a fool except herself why should anybody be more dangerous to me than to anybody else  well my dear i think that perhaps she is not so wrong there of course everything is all right with you now and im sure im the happiest woman in the world to feel that it is so i dont know how to be thankful enough when i think how things have turned outbut when i first heard of him i thought he was dangerous too  but you dont think he is dangerous now mamma  no my dear of course i dont and i never did after he drank tea here that night only mr comfort told me it wouldnt be safe not to see how things went a little before youyou understand dearest  yes i understand i aint a bit obliged to mr comfort though i mean to forgive him because of mrs cornbury she has behaved best through it allnext to you mamma  i am afraid it was late before mrs ray went to sleep that night and i almost doubt whether rachel slept at all it seemed to her that in the present condition of her life sleep could hardly be necessary during the last month past she had envied those who slept while she was kept awake by her sorrow she had often struggled to sleep as she sat in her chair so that she might escape for a few moments from the torture of her waking thoughts but why need she sleep now that every thought was a new pleasure there was no moment that she had ever passed with him that had not to be recalled there was no word of his that had not to be reweighed she remembered or fancied that she remembered her idea of the man when her eye first fell upon his outside form she would have sworn that her first glance of him had conveyed to her far more than had ever come to her from many a days casual looking at any other man she could almost believe that he had been specially made and destined for her behoof she blushed even while lying in bed as she remembered how the gait of the man and the tone of his voice had taken possession of her eyes and ears from the first day on which she had met him when she had gone to mrs tappitts party so consciously alive to the fact that he was to be there she had told herself that she was sure she thought no more of him than of any other man that she might meet but she now declared to herself that she had been a weak fool in thus attempting to deceive herself that she had loved him from the firstor at any rate from that evening when he had told her of the beauty of the clouds and that from that day to the present hour there had been no other chance of happiness to her but that chance which had now been so wondrously decided in her favour when she came down to breakfast on the next morning she was very quietso quiet that her sister almost thought she was frightened at her future prospects but i think that there was no such fear she was so happy that she could afford to be tranquil in her happiness  on that day rowan came out to the cottage in the evening and was formally introduced to mrs prime mrs ray i fear did not find the little teaparty so agreeable on that evening as she had done on the previous occasion mrs prime did make some effort at conversation she did endeavour to receive the young man as her future brotherinlaw she was gracious to him with such graciousness as she possessedbut the duration of their meal was terribly long and even mrs ray herself felt relieved when the two lovers went forth together for their evening walk i think there must have been some triumph in rachels heart as she tied on her hat before she started i think she must have remembered the evening on which her sister had been so urgent with her to go to the dorcas meetingwhen she had so obstinately refused that invitation and had instead gone out to meet the tappitt girls and had met with them the young man of whom her sister had before been speaking with so much horror now he was there on purpose to take her with him and she went forth with him leaning lovingly on his arm while yet close under her sisters eyes i think there must have been a gleam of triumph in her face as she put her hand with such confidence well round her lovers arm  girls do triumph in their loversin their acknowledged and permitted lovers as young men triumph in their loves which are not acknowledged or perhaps permitted a mans triumph is for the most part over when he is once allowed to take his place at the family table as a right next to his betrothed he begins to feel himself to be a sacrificial victimdone up very prettily with blue and white ribbons round his horns but still an ox prepared for sacrifice but the girl feels herself to be exalted for those few weeks as a conqueror and to be carried along in an ovation of which that bucolic victim tied round with blue ribbons on to his horns is the chief grace and ornament in this mood no doubt both rachel and luke rowan went forth leaving the two widows together in the cottage  it is pretty to see her so happy isnt it now said mrs ray  the question for the moment made mrs prime uncomfortable and almost wretched but it gave her the opportunity which in her heart she desired of recanting her error in regard to luke rowans character she wished to give in her adhesion to the marriageto be known to have acknowledged its fitness so that she could with some true word of sisterly love wish her sister well in rachels presence she could not have first made this recantation though rachel spoke no triumph there was a triumph in her eye which prevented almost the possibility of such yielding on the part of dorothea but when the thing should have been once done when she should once have owned that rachel was not wrong then gradually she could bring herself round to the utterance of some kindly expression  pretty she said yes it is pretty i do not know that anybody ever doubted its prettiness  and isnt it nice too dear girl it does make me so happy to see her lighthearted again she has had a sad time of it dorothea since we made her write that letter to him a very sad time of it  people here mother do mostly have what you call a sad time of it are we not taught that it is better for us that it should be so have not you and i mother had a sad time of it it would be all sad enough if this were to be the end of it  yes just so of course we know that but it cant be wrong that she should be happy now when things are so bright all around her you wouldnt have thought it better for her or for him either that they should be kept apart seeing that they really love each other  no i dont say that if they love one another of course it is right that they should marry i only wish we had known him longer  i am not sure that these things always go much better because young people have known each other all their lives it seems to be certain that he is an industrious steady young man everybody seems to speak well of him now  well mother i have nothing to say against himnot a word and if it will give rachel any pleasurethough i dont suppose it will the least in the world but if it would she may know that i think she has done wisely to accept him  indeed it will the greatest pleasure  and i hope they will be happy together for very many years i love rachel dearly though i fear she does not think so and anything i have said i have said in love not in anger  im sure of that dorothea  now that she is to be settled in life as a married woman of course she must not look for counsel either to you or to me she must obey him and i hope that god may give him grace to direct her steps aright  amen said mrs ray solemnly it was thus that mrs prime read her recantation which was repeated on that evening to rachel with some little softening touches you wont be living together in the same house after a bit said mrs ray thinking with some sadness that those little evening festivities of buttered toast and thick cream were over for her nowbut i do hope you will be friends  of course we will mamma she has only to put out her hand the least little bit in the world and i will go the rest of the way as for her living i dont know what will be best about that because luke says that of course youll come and live with us  it was two or three days after this that rachel saw the tappitt girls for the first time since the fact of her engagement had become known it was in the evening and she had been again walking with luke when she met them but at that moment she was alone augusta would have turned boldly away though they had all come closely together before either had been aware of the presence of the other but to this both martha and cherry objected  we have heard of your engagement said martha and we congratulate you you have heard of course that we are going to move to torquay and we hope that you will be comfortable at the brewery  yes said augusta the place isnt what it used to be and so we think it best to go mamma has already looked at a villa near torquay which will suit us delightfully  then they passed on but cherry remained behind to say another word i am so happy said cherry that you and he have hit it off hes a charming fellow and i always said he was to fall in love with you after the ball of course there wasnt a doubt about it mind you send us cake dear and byandby well come and see you at the old place and be better friends than ever we were     chapter xv  conclusion   early in november mr tappitt officially announced his intention of abdicating and the necessary forms and deeds and parchment obligations were drawn out signed and sealed for the giving up of the brewery to luke rowan mr honymans clerk revelled in thinlycovered folio sheets to the great comfort and profit of his master while mr sharpit went about baslehurst declaring that tappitt was an egregious ass and hinting that rowan was little better than a clever swindler what he said however had but little effect on baslehurst it had become generally understood that rowan would spend money in the town employing labour and struggling to go ahead and baslehurst knew that such a man was desirable as a citizen the parchments were prepared and the signatures were written with the necessary amount of witnessing and tappitt and rowan once more met each other on friendly terms tappitt had endeavoured to avoid this pleading both to honyman and to his wife that his personal dislike to the young man was as great as ever but they had not permitted him thus to indulge his wrath mr honyman pointed out to mrs tappitt that such illhumour might be very detrimental to their future interests and tappitt had been made to give way we may as well declare at once that the days of tappitts domestic dominion were over as is generally the case with a man who retires from work and allows himself to be placed as a piece of venerable furniture in the chimney corner hitherto he and he only had known what funds could be made available out of the brewery for household purposes and mrs tappitt had been subject at every turn of her life to provoking intimations of reduced profits but now there was the clear thousand a year and she could demand her rights in accordance with that sum tappitt too could never again stray away from home with mysterious hints that matters connected with malt and hops must be discussed at places in which beer was consumed he had no longer left to him any excuse for deviating from the regular course of his life even by a hairs breadth and before two years were over he had learned to regard it almost as a favour to be allowed to take a walk with one of his own girls no man should abdicateunless indeed he does so for his souls advantage as to happiness in this life it is hardly compatible with that diminished respect which ever attends the relinquishing of labour otium cum dignitate is a dream there is no such position at any rate for the man who has once worked he may have the ease or he may have the dignity but he can hardly combine the two this truth the unfortunate tappitt learned before he had been three months settled in the torquay villa  he was called upon to meet rowan on friendly terms and he obeyed the friendship was not very cordial but such as it was it served its purpose the meeting took place in the diningroom of the brewery and mrs tappitt was present on the occasion the lady received her visitor with some little affectation of grandeur while t standing with his hands in his pockets on his own rug looked like a whipped hound the right hand he was soon forced to bring forth as rowan demanded it that he might shake it  i am very glad that this affair has been settled between us amicably said luke while he still held the hand of the abdicating brewer  yes well i suppose its for the best said tappitt bringing out his words uncomfortably and with hesitation take care and mind what youre about or i suppose i shall have to come back again  therell be no fear of that i think said rowan  i hope not said mrs tappitt with a tone that showed that she was much better able to master the occasion than her husband i hope not but this is a great undertaking for so young a man and i trust you feel your responsibility it would be disagreeable to us of course to have to return to the brewery after having settled ourselves pleasantly at torquay but we shall have to do so if things go wrong with you  dont be frightened mrs tappitt you shall never have to come back here  i hope not but it is always well to be on ones guard i am sure you must be aware that mr tappitt has behaved to you very generously and if you have the high principle for which we are willing to give you credit and which you ought to possess for the management of such an undertaking as the brewery you will be careful that me and my daughters shant be put to inconvenience by any delay in paying up the income regularly  dont be afraid about that mrs tappitt  into the bank on quarter day if you please mr rowan short accounts make long friends and as mr t wont want to be troubled with letters and suchlike you can send me a line to montpellier villa torquay just to say that its done  oh ill see to that said tappitt  my dear as mr rowan is so young for the business therell be nothing like getting him to write a letter himself saying that the money is paid itll keep him up to the mark like and im sure i shant mind the trouble  dont you be alarmed about the money mrs tappitt said rowan laughing and in order that you may know how the old shop is going on ill always send you at christmas sixteen gallons of the best stuff were brewing  that will be a very proper little attention mr rowan and we shall be happy to drink success to the establishment heres some cake and wine on the table and perhaps youll do us the favour to take a glassso as to bury any past unkindness t my love will you pour out the wine  it was twelve oclock in the day and the port wine which had been standing for the last week in its decanter was sipped by luke rowan without any great relish but it also served its purposeand the burial service over past unkindness was performed with as much heartiness as the nature of the entertainment admitted it was not as yet full four months since rowan had filled rachels glass with champagne in that same room then he had made himself quite at home in the house as a member of mr tappitts family but now he was going to be at home there as master of the establishment as he put down the glass he could not help looking round the room and suggesting to himself the changes he would make as seen at present the parlour of the brewery was certainly a dull room it was very long since the wainscoting had been painted longer since the curtains or carpets had been renewed it was dark and dingy but then so were the tappitts themselves before rachel should be brought there he would make the place as bright as herself  they said to him no word about his marriage as for tappitt he said few words about anything and mrs tappitt with all her wish to be gracious could not bring herself to mention rachel ray even between her and her daughters there was no longer any utterance of rachels name she had once declared to augusta with irrepressible energy that the man was a greater fool than she had ever believed possible but after that it had been felt that the calamity would be best endured in silence  when that interview in the diningroom was over rowan saw no more of mrs tappitt business made it needful that he should be daily about the brewery and there occasionally he met the poor departing man wandering among the vats and empty casks like a brewers ghost there was no word spoken between them as to business the accounts the keys and implements were all handed over through worts and rowan found himself in possession of the whole establishment with no more trouble than would have been necessary in settling himself in a new lodging  that promise which he had half made of sending bridecake to mrs sturt before christmas was not kept but it was broken only by a little they were married early in january in december mrs rowan came back to baslehurst and became the guest of her son who was then keeping a bachelors house at the brewery this ladys first visit to the cottage after her return was an affair of great moment to rachel everything now had gone well with her except that question of her motherinlaw her lover had come back to her a better lover than ever her mother petted her to her hearts content speaking of luke as though she had never suspected him of lupine propensities mr comfort talked to her of her coming marriage as though she had acted with great sagacity through the whole affair addressing her in a tone indicating much respect and differing greatly from that in which he had been wont to catechise her when she was nothing more than mrs rays girl at braggs end and even dolly had sent in her adhesion with more or less cordiality but still she had feared mrs rowans enmity and when luke told her that his mother was coming to baslehurst for the christmasso that she might also be present at the marriagerachel felt that there was still a cloud in her heavens i know your mother wont like me she said to luke she made up her mind not to like me when she was here before luke assured her that she did not understand his mothers characterasserting that his mother would certainly like any woman that he might choose for his wife as soon as she should have been made to understand that his choice was irrevocable but rachel remembered too well the report as to that former visit to the cottage which mrs rowan had made together with mrs tappitt and when she heard that lukes mother was again in the parlour she went down from her bedroom with hesitating step and an uneasy heart mrs rowan was seated in the room with her mother and sister when she entered it and therefore the first words of the interview had been already spoken to mrs ray the prospect of the visit had not been pleasant for she also remembered how grand and distant the lady had been when she came to the cottage on that former occasion but rachel observed as she entered the room that her mothers face did not wear that look of dismay which was usual to her when she was in any presence that was disagreeable to her  my dear child said mrs rowan rising from her seat and opening her arms for an embrace rachel underwent the embrace and kissed the lady by whom she found herself to be thus enveloped she kissed mrs rowan but she could not for the life of her think of any word to speak which would be fitting for the occasion  my own dear child said mrs rowan again for you know that you are to be my child now as well as your own mammas  it is very kind of you to say so said mrs ray  very kind indeed said mrs prime and im sure that you will find rachel dutiful as a daughter rachel herself did not feel disposed to give any positive assurance on that point she intended to be dutiful to her husband and was inclined to think that obedience in that direction was quite enough for a married woman  now that luke is going to settle himself for life continued mrs rowan it is so very desirable that he should be married at once dont you think so mrs ray  indeed yes mrs rowan i always like to hear of young men getting married that is when theyve got anything to live upon it makes them less harumscarum like  i dont think luke was ever what you call harumscarum said mrs rowan  mother didnt mean to say he was said mrs prime but marriage certainly does steady a young man and generally makes him much more constant at divine service  my luke always did go to church very regularly said mrs rowan  i like to see young men in church said mrs ray as for the girls they go as a matter of course but young men are allowed so much of their own way when a man is a father of a family it becomes very different hereupon rachel blushed and then was kissed again by lukes mother and was made the subject of certain very interesting prophecies which embarrassed her considerably and which need not be repeated here after that interview she was never again afraid of her motherinlaw  youll love mamma when you know her said mary rowan to rachel a day or two afterwards strangers and acquaintances generally think that she is a very tremendous personage but she always does what she is asked by those who belong to herand as for luke shes almost a slave to him i wont say that rachel resolved that mrs rowan should be a slave to her also but she did resolve that she would not be a slave to mrs rowan she intended henceforward to serve one person and one person only  mrs butler cornbury also called at the cottage and her visit was very delightful to rachelnot the less so perhaps because mrs prime was away at a dorcas meeting had she been at the cottage all those pleasant allusions to the transactions at the ball would hardly have been made dont tell me said mrs cornbury do you think i couldnt see how it was going to be with half an eye i told walter that very night that he was a goose to suppose that you would go down to supper with him  but mrs cornbury i really intended it only they had another dance and i was obliged to stand up with mr rowan because i was engaged to him  i dont doubt you were engaged to him my dear  only for that dance i mean  only for that dance of course but now you are engaged to him for something else and i tell you that i knew it was going to be so  all this was very pretty and very pleasant and when mrs cornbury as she went away made a special request that she might be invited to the wedding rachel was supremely happy  mamma she said i do love that woman i hardly know why but i do love her so much  it was always the same with patty comfort said mrs ray she had a way of making people fond of her they say that she can do just what she likes with the old gentleman at the grange  it may be well that i should declare here that there was no scrutiny as to the return of butler cornbury to parliamentto the great satisfaction both of old mr cornbury and of old mr comfort they had been brought to promise that the needful funds for supporting the scrutiny should be forthcoming but the promise had been made with heavy hearts and the tidings of mr harts quiescence had been received very gratefully both at cornbury and at cawston  luke and rachel were married on new years day at cawston church and afterwards made a short marriage trip to penzance and the lands end it was cold weather for pleasuretravelling but snow and winds and rain affect young married people less i think than they do other folk rachel when she returned could not bear to be told that it had been cold there was no winter she said at penzanceand so she continued to say ever afterwards  mrs ray would not consent to abandon the cottage at braggs end she still remained its occupier in conjunction with mrs prime but she passed more than half her time at the brewery mrs prime is still mrs prime and will i think remain so although mr prong is occasionally seen to call at the cottage  it is i think now universally admitted by all devonshire and cornwall that luke rowan has succeeded in brewing good beer with what results to himself i am not prepared to say i do not however think it probable that he will succeed in his professed object of shutting up the apple orchards of the county
