phillips sampson  co in the clerks office of the district court of massachusetts    contents  georgie  the little landing  georgies money  two good friends  a lecture on playthings  the young drivers  the story of shallow selfish and wise    georgie     the little landing   a short distance from where rollo lives there is a small but very pleasant house just under the hill where you go down to the stone bridge leading over the brook there is a noble large apple tree on one side of the house which bears a beautiful sweet and mellow kind of apple called golden pippins a great many other trees and flowers are around the house and in the little garden on the side of it towards the brook there is a small white gate that leads to the house from the road and there is a pleasant path leading right out from the front door through the garden down to the water this is the house that georgie lives in  one evening just before sunset rollo was coming along over the stone bridge towards home he stopped a moment to look over the railing down into the water presently he heard a very sweettoned voice calling out to him  rollo  rollo looked along in the direction in which the sound came it was from the bank of the stream a little way from the road at the place where the path from georgies house came down to the water the brook was broad and the water pretty smooth and still here and it was a place where rollo had often been to sail boats with georgie there was a little smooth sandy place on the shore at the foot of the path and they used to call it georgies landing and there was a seat close by under the bushes  rollo thought it was georgies voice that called him and in a minute he saw him sitting on his little seat with his crutches by his side georgie was a sick boy he could not walk but had to sit almost all day at home in a large easy chair which his father had bought for him in the winter his chair was established in a particular corner by the side of the fire and he had a little case of shelves and drawers painted green by the side of him in these shelves and drawers he had his books and playthingshis pen and inkhis paintbox brushes and pencilshis knife and a little sawand a great many things which he used to make for his amusement then in the summer his chair and his shelves and drawers were moved to the end window which looked out upon the garden and brook sometimes when he was better than usual he could move about a little upon crutches and at such times when it was pleasant he used to go out into the garden and down through it to his landing at the brook  georgie had been sick a great many years and when rollo and jonas first knew him he used to be very sad and unhappy it was because the poor little fellow had nothing to do his father had to work pretty hard to get food and clothing for his family he loved little georgie very much but he could not buy him many things sometimes people who visited him used to give him playthings and they would amuse him a little while but he soon grew tired of them and had them put away it is very hard for any body to be happy who has not any thing to do  it was jonas that taught georgie what to do he lent him his knife and brought him some smooth soft pine wood and taught him to make windmills and little boxes georgie liked this very much and used to sit by his window in the summer mornings and make playthings hours at a time after he had made several things jonas told the boys that lived about there that they had better buy them of him when they had a few cents to spend for toys and they did in fact they liked the little windmills and wagons and small framed houses that georgie made better than sugarplums and candy besides they liked to go and see georgie for whenever they went to buy any thing of him he looked so contented and happy sitting in his easy chair with his small and slender feet drawn up under him and his work on the table by his side  then he was a very beautiful boy too his face was delicate and pale but there was such a kind and gentle expression in his mild blue eye and so much sweetness in the tone of his voice that they loved very much to go and see him in fact all the boys were very fond of georgie     georgies money   georgie at length earned in this way quite a little sum of money it was nearly all in cents but then there was one fourpence which a lady gave him for a fourwheeled wagon that he made he kept this money in a corner of his drawer and at last there was quite a handful of it  one summer evening when georgies father came home from his work he hung up his hat and came and sat down in georgies corner by the side of his little boy georgie looked up to him with a smile  well father said he are you tired tonight  you are the one to be tired georgie said he sitting here alone all day  hold up your hand father said georgie reaching out his own at the same time which was shut up and appeared to have something in it  why what have you got for me said his father  hold fast all i give you replied he and he dropped the money all into his fathers hand and shut up his fathers fingers over it  what is all this said his father  it is my money said he for you it is most all cents but then there is one fourpence  i am sure i am much obliged to you georgie for this  o no said georgie its only a little of what you have to spend for me  georgies father took the money and put it in his pocket and the next day he went to jonas and told him about it and asked jonas to spend it in buying such things as he thought would be useful to georgie either playthings or tools or materials to work with  jonas said he should be very glad to do it for he thought he could buy him some things that would help him very much in his work jonas carried the money into the city the next time he went and bought him a small hone to sharpen his knife a finetoothed saw and a bottle of black varnish with a little brush to put it on with he brought these things home and gave them to georgies father and he carried them into the house and put them in a drawer  that evening when georgie was at supper his father slyly put the things that jonas had bought on his table so that when he went back after supper he found them there he was very much surprised and pleased he examined them all very particularly and was especially glad to have the black varnish for now he could varnish his work and make it look much more handsome the little boxes that he made after this of a bright black outside and lined neatly with paper within were thought by the boys to be elegant  he could now earn money faster and as his father insisted on having all his earnings expended for articles for georgies own use and jonas used to help him about expending it he got at last quite a variety of implements and articles he had some wire and a little pair of pliers for bending it in all shapes and a hammer and little nails he had also a paintbox and brushes and paper of various colors for lining boxes and making portfolios and pocketbooks and he had varnishes red green blue and black all these he kept in his drawers and shelves and made a great many ingenious things with them  so georgie was a great friend of both rollo and jonas and they often used to come and see him and play with him and that was the reason that rollo knew his voice so well when he called to him from the landing when rollo was standing on the bridge as described in the beginning of this story     two good friends   rollo ran along to the end of the bridge clambered down to the waters edge went along the shore among the trees and shrubbery until he came to the seat where georgie was sitting georgie asked him to sit down and stay with him but rollo said he must go directly home and so georgie took his crutches and they began to walk slowly together up the garden walk  where have you been rollo said georgie  i have been to see my cousin james to ask him to go to the city with us tomorrow  are you going to the city  yes uncle george gave james and i a half a dollar apiece the other day and mother is going to carry us into the city tomorrow to buy something with it  is jonas going with you  yes said rollo he is going to drive we are going in our carryall  i wish you would take some money for me then and get jonas to buy me something with it  well i will said rollo what shall he buy for you  o he may buy any thing he chooses  yes but if you do not tell him what to buy he may buy something you have got already  o jonas knows every thing i have got as well as i do  just then they came up near the house and georgie asked rollo to look up at the golden pippin tree and see how full it was  that is my branch said he  he pointed to a large branch which came out on one side and which hung down loaded with fruit it would have broken down perhaps if there had not been a crotched pole put under it to prop it up  but all the apples on your branch are not golden pippins said rollo there are some on it that are red what beautiful red apples  yes said georgie father grafted that for me to make it bear rosyboys i call the red ones my rosyboys  grafted said rollo how did he graft it  o said georgie i do not know exactly he cut off a little branch from a rosyboy tree and stuck it on somehow and it grew and bears rosyboys still  rollo thought this was very curious georgie told him he would give him an apple and that he might have his choicea pippin or a rosyboy  rollo hesitated and looked at them first at one and then at another but he could not decide the rosyboys had the brightest and most beautiful color but then the pippins looked so rich and mellow that he could not choose very easily and so georgie laughed and told him he would settle the difficulty by giving him one of each  so come here said he rollo and let me lean on you while i knock them down  so rollo came and stood near him while georgie leaned on him and with his crutch gave a gentle tap to one of each of his kinds of apples and they fell down upon the soft grass safe and sound  illustration  they then went into the house and georgie gave rollo his money wrapped up in a small piece of paper and then rollo bidding him good by went out of the little white gate and walked along home  the next morning soon after breakfast jonas drove the carryall up to the front door and rollo and his mother walked out to it rollos mother took the back seat and rollo and jonas sat in front and they drove along  they called at the house where james lived and found him waiting for them on the front steps with his half dollar in his hand  he ran into the house to tell his mother that the carryall had come and to bid her good morning and then he came out to the gate  james said rollo you may sit on the front seat with jonas if you want to  james said he should like to very much and so rollo stepped over behind and sat with his mother this was kind and polite for boys all like the front seat when they are riding and rollo therefore did right to offer it to his cousin     a lecture on playthings   after a short time they came to a smooth and pleasant road with trees and farmhouses on each side and as the horse was trotting along quietly rollo asked his mother if she could not tell them a story  i cannot tell you a story very well this morning but i can give you a lecture on playthings if you wish  very well mother we should like that said the boys  they did not know very well what a lecture was but they thought that any thing which their mother would propose would be interesting  do you know what a lecture is said she  not exactly said rollo  why i should explain to you about playthingsthe various kinds their use the way to keep them and to derive the most pleasure from them c giving you this information will not be as interesting to you as to hear a story but it will be more useful if you attend carefully and endeavor to remember what i say  the boys thought they should like the lecture and promised to attend rollo said he would remember it all and so his mother began  the value of a plaything does not consist in itself but in the pleasure it awakens in your mind do you understand that  not very well said rollo  if you should give a round stick to a baby on the floor and let him strike the floor with it he would be pleased you would see by his looks that it gave him great pleasure now where would this pleasure bein the stick or in the floor or in the baby  why in the baby said rollo laughing  yes and would it be in his body or in his mind  in his face said james  in his eyes said rollo  you would see the signs of it in his face and in his eyes but the feeling of pleasure would be in his mind now i suppose you understand what i said that the value of the plaything consists in the pleasure it can awaken in the mind  yes mother said rollo  there is your jumping man said she is that a good plaything  yes said rollo my kicker but i dont care much about it i dont know where it is now  what was it said james i never saw it  it was a pasteboard man said his mother and there was a string behind fixed so that by pulling it you could make his arms and legs fly about  yes said rollo i called him my kicker  you liked it very much when you first had it  yes said rollo but i dont think it is very pretty now  that shows what i said was true when you first had it it was new and the sight of it gave you pleasure but the pleasure consisted in the novelty and drollery of it and after a little while when you became familiar with it it ceased to give you pleasure and then you did not value it i found it the other day lying on the ground in the yard and took it up and put it away carefully in a drawer  but if the value is all gone what good does it do to save it said rollo  the value to you is gone because you have become familiar with it and so it has lost its power to awaken feelings of pleasure in you but it has still power to give pleasure to other children who have not seen it and i kept it for them  i should like to see it very much said james i never saw such a one  i will show it to you some time now this is one kind of playthingthose which please by their novelty only it is not generally best to buy such playthings for you very soon get familiar with them and then they cease to give you pleasure and are almost worthless  only we ought to keep them if we have them to show to other boys said rollo  yes said his mother you ought never to throw them away or leave them on the floor or on the ground  o the little fool said rollo suddenly  his mother and james looked up wondering what rollo meant he was looking out at the side of the carryall at something about the wheel  what is it said his mother  why here is a large fly trying to light on the wheel and every time his legs touch it it knocks them away see see  yes but you must not attend to him now you must listen to my lecture you promised to give your attention to me  so james and rollo turned away from the window and began to listen again  i have told you now said she of one kind of playthingsthose that give pleasure from their novelty only there is another kindthose that give you pleasure by their usesuch as a doll for example  how mother is a doll of any use  yes in one sense that is the girl who has it uses it continually perhaps she admired the looks of it the first day it was given to her but then after that she can use it in so many ways that it continues to afford her pleasure for a long time she can dress and undress it put it to bed make it sit up for company and do a great many other things with it when she gets tired of playing with it one day she puts it away and the next day she thinks of something new to do with it which she never thought of before now which should you think the pleasure you should obtain from a ball would arise from its novelty or its use  its use said the boys  yes said the mother the first sight of a ball would not give you any very special pleasure its value would consist in the pleasure you would take in playing with it  now it is generally best to buy such playthings as you can use a great many times and in a great many ways such as a top a ball a knife a wheelbarrow but things that please you only by their novelty will soon lose all their power to give you pleasure and be good for nothing to you such for instance as jumping men and witches and funny little images children are very often deceived in buying their playthings for those things which please by their novelty only usually please them very much for a few minutes while they are in the shop and see them for the first time while those things which would last a long time do not give them much pleasure at first  there is another kind of playthings i want to tell you about a little and then my lecture will be done i mean playthings which give you pleasure but give other persons pain a drum and a whistle for example are disagreeable to other persons and children therefore ought not to choose them unless they have a place to go to to play with them which will be out of hearing i have known boys to buy masks to frighten other children with and bows and arrows which sometimes are the means of putting out childrens eyes so you must consider when you are choosing playthings first whether the pleasure they will give you will be from the novelty or the use and secondly whether in giving you pleasure they will give any other persons pain  this is the end of the lecture now you may rest a little and look about and then i will tell you a short story     the young drivers   they came about this time to the foot of a long hill and jonas said he believed that he would get out and walk up and he said james might drive the horse so he put the reins into jamess hands and jumped out rollo climbed over the seat and sat by his side presently james saw a large stone in the road and he asked rollo to see how well he could drive round it for as the horse was going he would have carried one wheel directly over it so he pulled one of the reins and turned the horse away but he contrived to turn him out just far enough to make the other wheel go over the stone rollo laughed and asked him to let him try the next time and james gave him the reins but there was no other stone till they got up to the top of the hill  then james said that rollo might ride on the front seat now and when jonas got in he climbed back to the back seat and took his place by the side of rollos mother  come mother then said rollo we are rested enough now please to begin the story  very well if you are all ready  so she began as follows     the story of shallow selfish and wise        once there were three boys going into town to buy some playthings      their names were shallow selfish and wise each had half a      dollar shallow carried his in his hand tossing it up in the air      and catching it as he went along selfish kept teasing his mother      to give him some more money half a dollar he said was not      enough wise walked along quietly with his cash safe in his      pocket       presently shallow missed catching his half dollar andchinkit      went on the sidewalk and it rolled along down into a crack under      a building then he began to cry selfish stood by holding his own      money tight in his hands and said he did not pity shallow at all      it was good enough for him he had no business to be tossing it up      wise came up and tried to get the money out with a stick but he      could not he told shallow not to cry said he was sorry he had      lost his money and that he would give him half of his as soon as      they could get it changed at the shop       so they walked along to the toyshop       their mother said that each one might choose his own plaything so      they began to look around on the counter and shelves       after a while shallow began to laugh very loud and heartily at      something he found it was an image of a grinning monkey it looked      very droll indeed shallow asked wise to come and see wise laughed      at it too but said he should not want to buy it as he thought he      should soon get tired of laughing at any thing if it was ever so      droll       shallow was sure that he should never get tired of laughing at so      very droll a thing as the grinning monkey and he decided to buy      it if wise would give him half of his money and so wise did       selfish found a rattle a large noisy rattle and went to      springing it until they were all tired of hearing the noise       i think i shall buy this said he i can make believe that there      is a fire and can run about springing my rattle and crying      fire fire or i can play that a thief is breaking into a store      and can rattle my rattle at him and call out stop thief       but that will disturb all the people in the house said wise       what care i for that said selfish       selfish found that the price of his rattle was not so much as the      half dollar so he laid out the rest of it in cake and sat down on      a box and began to eat it       wise passed by all the images and gaudy toys only good to look at      a few times and chose a soft ball and finding that that did not      take all of his half of the money he purchased a little morocco      box with an inkstand some wafers and one or two short pens in      it shallow told him that was not a plaything it was only fit for      a school and as to his ball he did not think much of that       wise said he thought they could all play with the ball a great many      times and he thought too that he should like his little inkstand      rainy days and winter evenings       so the boys walked along home shallow stopped every moment to      laugh at his monkey and selfish to spring his rattle and they      looked with contempt on wises ball which he carried quietly in      one hand and his box done up in brown paper in the other       when they got home shallow ran in to show his monkey the people      smiled a little but did not take much notice of it and in fact      it did not look half so funny even to himself as it did in the      shop in a short time it did not make him laugh at all and then      he was vexed and angry with it he said he meant to go and throw      the ugly old baboon away he was tired of seeing that same old grin      on his face all the time so he went and threw it over the wall       selfish ate his cake up on his way home he would not give his      brothers any for he said they had had their money as well as he      when he got home he went about the house up and down through      parlor and chamber kitchen and shed springing his rattle and      calling out stop thief stop thief or fire fire every body      got tired and asked him to be still but he did not mind until      at last his father took his rattle away from him and put it up on      a high shelf       then selfish and shallow went out and found wise playing      beautifully with his ball in the yard and he invited them to play      with him they would toss it up against the wall and learn to      catch it when it came down and then they made some batsticks and      knocked it back and forth to one another about the yard the more      they played with the ball the more they liked it and as wise was      always very careful not to play near any holes and to put it away      safe when he had done with it he kept it a long time and gave      them pleasure a great many times all summer long       and then his inkstand box was a great treasure he would get it out      in the long winter evenings and lend selfish and shallow each      one of his pens and they would all sit at the table and make      pictures and write little letters and seal them with small bits      of the wafers in fact wise kept his inkstand box safe till he      grew up to be a man       that is the end of the story     the toyshop   i wish i could get an inkstand box said rollo when the story was finished  i think he was very foolish to throw away his grinning monkey said james i wish i could see a grinning monkey  they continued talking about this story some time and at length they drew nigh to the city they drove to a stable where jonas had the horse put up and then they all walked on in search of a toyshop  they passed along through one or two streets walking very slowly so that the boys might look at the pictures and curious things in the shop windows at length they came to a toyshop and all went in  they saw at once a great number and variety of playthings exhibited to view all around the floor were arranged horses on wheels little carts wagons and baskets the counter had a great variety of images and figuresbirds that would peep and dogs that would bark and drummers that would drumall by just turning a little handle then the shelves and the window were filled with all sorts of boxes and whips and puzzles and teasets and dolls dressed and not dressed there were bows and arrows and darts and jumping ropes and glass dogs and little rockinghorses and a thousand other things  when the boys first came in there was a little girl standing by the counter with a small slate in her hand she looked like a poor girl though she was neat and tidy in her dress she was talking with the shopman about the slate  dont you think said she you could let me have it for ten cents  no said he i could not afford it for less than fifteen it cost me more than ten  the little girl laid the slate down and looked disappointed and sad rollos mother came up to her took up the slate and said  i should think you had better give him fifteen cents it is a very good slate it is worth as much as that certainly  yes madam so i tell her said the shopman  but i have not got but ten cents said the little girl  have not you said rollos mother she stood still thinking a moment and then she asked the little girl what her name was  she said it was maria  she asked her what she wanted the slate for and maria said it was to do sums on at school she wanted to study arithmetic and could not do so without a slate  jonas then came forward and said that he should like to give her five cents of georgies money and that with the ten she had would be enough he said that georgie had given him authority to do what he thought best with his money and he knew if georgie was here he would wish to help the little girl  rollo and james were both sorry they had not thought of it themselves and as soon as jonas mentioned it they wanted to give some of their money to the girl but jonas said he knew that georgie would prefer to do it at last however it was agreed that rollo and james should furnish one cent each and georgie the rest this was all agreed upon after a low conversation by themselves in a corner of the store and then jonas came forward and told the shopman that they were going to pay the additional five cents and that he might let the girl have the slate so jonas paid the money and it was agreed that rollo and james should pay him back their share when they got their money changed the boys were very much pleased to see the little girl go away so happy with her slate in her hand it was neatly done up in paper with two pencils which the shopman gave her done up inside  after maria was gone the boys looked around the shop but could not find any thing which exactly pleased them or at least they could not find any thing which pleased them so much more than any thing else that they could decide in favor of it so they concluded to walk along and look at another shop  they succeeded at last in finding some playthings that they liked and jonas bought a variety of useful things for georgie on their way home the carryall stopped at the house where lucy lived and rollos mother left him and james there to show lucy their playthings  one of the things they bought was a little boat with two sails and they went down behind the house to sail it the other playthings and books they carried down too and had a fine time playing with them with lucy and another little girl who was visiting her that afternoon
