                           chapter i                  there are heroisms all round us  mr hungerton her father really was the most tactless person upon eartha fluffy feathery untidy cockatoo of a man perfectly goodnatured but absolutely centered upon his own silly self  if anything could have driven me from gladys it would have been the thought of such a fatherinlaw  i am convinced that he really believed in his heart that i came round to the chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism a subject upon which he was by way of being an authority  for an hour or more that evening i listened to his monotonous chirrup about bad money driving out good the token value of silver the depreciation of the rupee and the true standards of exchange  suppose he cried with feeble violence that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously and immediate payment insisted uponwhat under our present conditions would happen then  i gave the selfevident answer that i should be a ruined man upon which he jumped from his chair reproved me for my habitual levity which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence and bounced off out of the room to dress for a masonic meeting  at last i was alone with gladys and the moment of fate had come  all that evening i had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind  she sat with that proud delicate profile of hers outlined against the red curtain  how beautiful she was  and yet how aloof  we had been friends quite good friends but never could i get beyond the same comradeship which i might have established with one of my fellowreporters upon the gazetteperfectly frank perfectly kindly and perfectly unsexual  my instincts are all against a woman being too frank and at her ease with me  it is no compliment to a man  where the real sex feeling begins timidity and distrust are its companions heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand  the bent head the averted eye the faltering voice the wincing figurethese and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply are the true signals of passion  even in my short life i had learned as much as thator had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct  gladys was full of every womanly quality  some judged her to be cold and hard but such a thought was treason  that delicately bronzed skin almost oriental in its coloring that raven hair the large liquid eyes the full but exquisite lipsall the stigmata of passion were there  but i was sadly conscious that up to now i had never found the secret of drawing it forth  however come what might i should have done with suspense and bring matters to a head tonight  she could but refuse me and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother  so far my thoughts had carried me and i was about to break the long and uneasy silence when two critical dark eyes looked round at me and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof  i have a presentiment that you are going to propose ned  i do wish you wouldnt for things are so much nicer as they are  i drew my chair a little nearer  now how did you know that i was going to propose i asked in genuine wonder  dont women always know  do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares  butoh ned our friendship has been so good and so pleasant  what a pity to spoil it  dont you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked  i dont know gladys  you see i can talk face to face withwith the stationmaster  i cant imagine how that official came into the matter but in he trotted and set us both laughing  that does not satisfy me in the least  i want my arms round you and your head on my breast andoh gladys i want  she had sprung from her chair as she saw signs that i proposed to demonstrate some of my wants  youve spoiled everything ned she said  its all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in  it is such a pity  why cant you control yourself  i didnt invent it i pleaded  its nature  its love  well perhaps if both love it may be different  i have never felt it  but you mustyou with your beauty with your soul  oh gladys you were made for love  you must love  one must wait till it comes  but why cant you love me gladys  is it my appearance or what  she did unbend a little  she put forward a handsuch a gracious stooping attitude it wasand she pressed back my head  then she looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile  no it isnt that she said at last  youre not a conceited boy by nature and so i can safely tell you it is not that  its deeper  my character  she nodded severely  what can i do to mend it  do sit down and talk it over  no really i wont if youll only sit down  she looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my mind than her wholehearted confidence  how primitive and bestial it looks when you put it down in black and whiteand perhaps after all it is only a feeling peculiar to myself  anyhow she sat down  now tell me whats amiss with me  im in love with somebody else said she  it was my turn to jump out of my chair  its nobody in particular she explained laughing at the expression of my face only an ideal  ive never met the kind of man i mean  tell me about him  what does he look like  oh he might look very much like you  how dear of you to say that  well what is it that he does that i dont do  just say the wordteetotal vegetarian aeronaut theosophist superman  ill have a try at it gladys if you will only give me an idea what would please you  she laughed at the elasticity of my character  well in the first place i dont think my ideal would speak like that said she  he would be a harder sterner man not so ready to adapt himself to a silly girls whim  but above all he must be a man who could do who could act who could look death in the face and have no fear of him a man of great deeds and strange experiences  it is never a man that i should love but always the glories he had won for they would be reflected upon me  think of richard burton  when i read his wifes life of him i could so understand her love  and lady stanley  did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband these are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul and yet be the greater not the less on account of her love honored by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds  she looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that i nearly brought down the whole level of the interview  i gripped myself hard and went on with the argument  we cant all be stanleys and burtons said i besides we dont get the chanceat least i never had the chance  if i did i should try to take it  but chances are all around you  it is the mark of the kind of man i mean that he makes his own chances  you cant hold him back  ive never met him and yet i seem to know him so well  there are heroisms all round us waiting to be done  its for men to do them and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men  look at that young frenchman who went up last week in a balloon  it was blowing a gale of wind but because he was announced to go he insisted on starting  the wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twentyfour hours and he fell in the middle of russia  that was the kind of man i mean  think of the woman he loved and how other women must have envied her  thats what i should like to beenvied for my man  id have done it to please you  but you shouldnt do it merely to please me  you should do it because you cant help yourself because its natural to you because the man in you is crying out for heroic expression  now when you described the wigan coal explosion last month could you not have gone down and helped those people in spite of the chokedamp  i did  you never said so  there was nothing worth bucking about  i didnt know  she looked at me with rather more interest  that was brave of you  i had to  if you want to write good copy you must be where the things are  what a prosaic motive  it seems to take all the romance out of it but still whatever your motive i am glad that you went down that mine  she gave me her hand but with such sweetness and dignity that i could only stoop and kiss it  i dare say i am merely a foolish woman with a young girls fancies  and yet it is so real with me so entirely part of my very self that i cannot help acting upon it  if i marry i do want to marry a famous man  why should you not i cried  it is women like you who brace men up give me a chance and see if i will take it  besides as you say men ought to make their own chances and not wait until they are given look at clivejust a clerk and he conquered india  by george  ill do something in the world yet  she laughed at my sudden irish effervescence  why not she said you have everything a man could haveyouth health strength education energy  i was sorry you spoke  and now i am gladso gladif it wakens these thoughts in you  and if i do  her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips  not another word sir  you should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago only i hadnt the heart to remind you  some day perhaps when you have won your place in the world we shall talk it over again  and so it was that i found myself that foggy november evening pursuing the camberwell tram with my heart glowing within me and with the eager determination that not another day should elapse before i should find some deed which was worthy of my lady  but whowho in all this wide world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was to take or the strange steps by which i was led to the doing of it  and after all this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative and yet there would have been no narrative without it for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him that he breaks away as i did from the life he knows and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards  behold me then at the office of the daily gazette on the staff of which i was a most insignificant unit with the settled determination that very night if possible to find the quest which should be worthy of my gladys  was it hardness was it selfishness that she should ask me to risk my life for her own glorification  such thoughts may come to middle age but never to ardent threeandtwenty in the fever of his first love                                 chapter ii              try your luck with professor challenger  i always liked mcardle the crabbed old roundbacked redheaded news editor and i rather hoped that he liked me  of course beaumont was the real boss but he lived in the rarefied atmosphere of some olympian height from which he could distinguish nothing smaller than an international crisis or a split in the cabinet  sometimes we saw him passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum with his eyes staring vaguely and his mind hovering over the balkans or the persian gulf  he was above and beyond us  but mcardle was his first lieutenant and it was he that we knew  the old man nodded as i entered the room and he pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead  well mr malone from all i hear you seem to be doing very well said he in his kindly scotch accent  i thanked him  the colliery explosion was excellent  so was the southwark fire  you have the true descreeptive touch  what did you want to see me about  to ask a favor  he looked alarmed and his eyes shunned mine tut tut  what is it  do you think sir that you could possibly send me on some mission for the paper  i would do my best to put it through and get you some good copy  what sort of meesion had you in your mind mr malone  well sir anything that had adventure and danger in it  i really would do my very best  the more difficult it was the better it would suit me  you seem very anxious to lose your life  to justify my life sir  dear me mr malone this is veryvery exalted  im afraid the day for this sort of thing is rather past  the expense of the special meesion business hardly justifies the result and of course in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order  the big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in and theres no room for romance anywhere  wait a bit though he added with a sudden smile upon his face  talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea  what about exposing a frauda modern munchausenand making him rideeculous  you could show him up as the liar that he is  eh man it would be fine  how does it appeal to you  anythinganywherei care nothing  mcardle was plunged in thought for some minutes  i wonder whether you could get on friendlyor at least on talking terms with the fellow he said at last  you seem to have a sort of genius for establishing relations with peopleseempathy i suppose or animal magnetism or youthful vitality or something  i am conscious of it myself  you are very good sir  so why should you not try your luck with professor challenger of enmore park  i dare say i looked a little startled  challenger i cried  professor challenger the famous zoologist wasnt he the man who broke the skull of blundell of the telegraph  the news editor smiled grimly  do you mind  didnt you say it was adventures you were after  it is all in the way of business sir i answered  exactly  i dont suppose he can always be so violent as that  im thinking that blundell got him at the wrong moment maybe or in the wrong fashion  you may have better luck or more tact in handling him theres something in your line there i am sure and the gazette should work it  i really know nothing about him said i  i only remember his name in connection with the policecourt proceedings for striking blundell  i have a few notes for your guidance mr malone  ive had my eye on the professor for some little time  he took a paper from a drawer here is a summary of his record  i give it you briefly  challenger george edward  born largs n b 1863  educ largs academy edinburgh university  british museum assistant 1892 assistantkeeper of comparative anthropology department 1893 resigned after acrimonious correspondence same year  winner of crayston medal for

weissmannism which caused heated discussion at the zoological congress of vienna  recreations walking alpine climbing  address enmore park kensington w  there take it with you  ive nothing more for you tonight  i pocketed the slip of paper  one moment sir i said as i realized that it was a pink bald head and not a red face which was fronting me  i am not very clear yet why i am to interview this gentleman  what has he done  the face flashed back again  went to south america on a solitary expedeetion two years ago  came back last year  had undoubtedly been to south america but refused to say exactly where  began to tell his adventures in a vague way but somebody started to pick holes and he just shut up like an oyster something wonderful happenedor the mans a champion liar which is the more probable supposeetion  had some damaged photographs said to be fakes  got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions and heaves reporters down the stairs  in my opinion hes just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science  thats your man mr malone  now off you run and see what you can make of him  youre big enough to look after yourself  anyway you are all safe employers liability act you know  a grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval fringed with gingery fluff the interview was at an end  i walked across to the savage club but instead of turning into it i leaned upon the railings of adelphi terrace and gazed thoughtfully for a long time at the brown oily river  i can always think most sanely and clearly in the open air  i took out the list of professor challengers exploits and i read it over under the electric lamp then i had what i can only regard as an inspiration  as a pressman i felt sure from what i had been told that i could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous professor  but these recriminations twice mentioned in his skeleton biography could only mean that he was a fanatic in science  was there not an exposed margin there upon which he might be accessible  i would try  i entered the club  it was just after eleven and the big room was fairly full though the rush had not yet set in  i noticed a tall thin angular man seated in an armchair by the fire  he turned as i drew my chair up to him  it was the man of all others whom i should have chosentarp henry of the staff of nature a thin dry leathery creature who was full to those who knew him of kindly humanity  i plunged instantly into my subject  what do you know of professor challenger  challenger he gathered his brows in scientific disapproval challenger was the man who came with some cockandbull story from south america  what story  oh it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered i believe he has retracted since  anyhow he has suppressed it all he gave an interview to reuters and there was such a howl that he saw it wouldnt do  it was a discreditable business  there were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously but he soon choked them off  how  well by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior  there was poor old wadley of the zoological institute  wadley sent a message the president of the zoological institute presents his compliments to professor challenger and would take it as a personal favor if he would do them the honor to come to their next meeting  the answer was unprintable  you dont say  well a bowdlerized version of it would run  professor challenger presents his compliments to the president of the zoological institute and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil  good lord  yes i expect thats what old wadley said  i remember his wail at the meeting which began  in fifty years experience of scientific intercourse  it quite broke the old man up  anything more about challenger  well im a bacteriologist you know  i live in a ninehundreddiameter microscope  i can hardly claim to take serious notice of anything that i can see with my naked eye  im a frontiersman from the extreme edge of the knowable and i feel quite out of place when i leave my study and come into touch with all you great rough hulking creatures  im too detached to talk scandal and yet at scientific conversaziones i have heard something of challenger for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore  hes as clever as they make ema fullcharged battery of force and vitality but a quarrelsome illconditioned faddist and unscrupulous at that  he had gone the length of faking some photographs over the south american business  you say he is a faddist  what is his particular fad  he has a thousand but the latest is something about weissmann and evolution  he had a fearful row about it in vienna i believe  cant you tell me the point  not at the moment but a translation of the proceedings exists  we have it filed at the office  would you care to come  its just what i want  i have to interview the fellow and i need some lead up to him  its really awfully good of you to give me a lift  ill go with you now if it is not too late   half an hour later i was seated in the newspaper office with a huge tome in front of me which had been opened at the article weissmann versus darwin with the sub heading spirited protest at vienna lively proceedings  my scientific education having been somewhat neglected i was unable to follow the whole argument but it was evident that the english professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion and had thoroughly annoyed his continental colleagues  protests uproar and general appeal to the chairman were three of the first brackets which caught my eye  most of the matter might have been written in chinese for any definite meaning that it conveyed to my brain  i wish you could translate it into english for me i said pathetically to my helpmate  well it is a translation  then id better try my luck with the original  it is certainly rather deep for a layman  if i could only get a single good meaty sentence which seemed to convey some sort of definite human idea it would serve my turn  ah yes this one will do  i seem in a vague way almost to understand it ill copy it out  this shall be my link with the terrible professor  nothing else i can do  well yes i propose to write to him  if i could frame the letter here and use your address it would give atmosphere  well have the fellow round here making a row and breaking the furniture  no no youll see the letternothing contentious i assure you  well thats my chair and desk  youll find paper there  id like to censor it before it goes  it took some doing but i flatter myself that it wasnt such a bad job when it was finished  i read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist with some pride in my handiwork   dear professor challenger it said as a humble student of nature i have always taken the most profound interest in your speculations as to the differences between darwin and weissmann  i have recently had occasion to refresh my memory by rereading   you infernal liar murmured tarp henry   by rereading your masterly address at vienna  that lucid and admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter  there is one sentence in it howevernamely  i protest strongly against the insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly through the series of generations have you no desire in view of later research to modify this statement  do you not think that it is overaccentuated  with your permission i would ask the favor of an interview as i feel strongly upon the subject and have certain suggestions which i could only elaborate in a personal conversation with your consent i trust to have the honor of calling at eleven oclock the day after tomorrow wednesday morning  i remain sir with assurances of profound respect yours very truly  edward d malone   hows that i asked triumphantly  well if your conscience can stand it  it has never failed me yet  but what do you mean to do  to get there  once i am in his room i may see some opening  i may even go the length of open confession  if he is a sportsman he will be tickled  tickled indeed  hes much more likely to do the tickling  chain mail or an american football suitthats what youll want  well goodbye  ill have the answer for you here on wednesday morningif he ever deigns to answer you  he is a violent dangerous cantankerous character hated by everyone who comes across him and the butt of the students so far as they dare take a liberty with him  perhaps it would be best for you if you never heard from the fellow at all                                chapter iii                he is a perfectly impossible person  my friends fear or hope was not destined to be realized  when i called on wednesday there was a letter with the west kensington postmark upon it and my name scrawled across the envelope in a handwriting which looked like a barbedwire railing  the contents were as follows                                 enmore park w  siri have duly received your note in which you claim to endorse my views although i am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else  you have ventured to use the word speculation with regard to my statement upon the subject of darwinism and i would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree  the context convinces me however that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice so i am content to pass the matter by  you quote an isolated sentence from my lecture and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it  i should have thought that only a subhuman intelligence could have failed to grasp the point but if it really needs amplification i shall consent to see you at the hour named though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me  as to your suggestion that i may modify my opinion i would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views  you will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man austin when you call as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves journalists                            yours faithfully                             george edward challenger   this was the letter that i read aloud to tarp henry who had come down early to hear the result of my venture  his only remark was theres some new stuff cuticura or something which is better than arnica some people have such extraordinary notions of humor  it was nearly halfpast ten before i had received my message but a taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment  it was an imposing porticoed house at which we stopped and the heavilycurtained windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this formidable professor  the door was opened by an odd swarthy driedup person of uncertain age with a dark pilot jacket and brown leather gaiters  i found afterwards that he was the chauffeur who filled the gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers  he looked me up and down with a searching light blue eye  expected he asked  an appointment  got your letter  i produced the envelope  right  he seemed to be a person of few words  following him down the passage i was suddenly interrupted by a small woman who stepped out from what proved to be the diningroom door  she was a bright vivacious darkeyed lady more french than english in her type  one moment she said  you can wait austin  step in here sir may i ask if you have met my husband before  no madam i have not had the honor  then i apologize to you in advance  i must tell you that he is a perfectly impossible personabsolutely impossible  if you are forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances  it is most considerate of you madam  get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent  dont wait to argue with him  several people have been injured through doing that  afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and all of us  i suppose it wasnt about south america you wanted to see him  i could not lie to a lady  dear me  that is his most dangerous subject  you wont believe a word he saysim sure i dont wonder  but dont tell him so for it makes him very violent  pretend to believe him and you may get through all right  remember he believes it himself  of that you may be assured  a more honest man never lived  dont wait any longer or he may suspect  if you find him dangerousreally dangerousring the bell and hold him off until i come  even at his worst i can usually control him  with these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn austin who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our short interview and i was conducted to the end of the passage  there was a tap at a door a bulls bellow from within and i was face to face with the professor  he sat in a rotating chair behind a broad table which was covered with books maps and diagrams  as i entered his seat spun round to face me  his appearance made me gasp  i was prepared for something strange but not for so overpowering a personality as this  it was his size which took ones breath awayhis size and his imposing presence his head was enormous the largest i have ever seen upon a human being i am sure that his tophat had i ever ventured to don it would have slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders  he had the face and beard which i associate with an assyrian bull the former florid the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue spadeshaped and rippling down over his chest  the hair was peculiar plastered down in front in a long curving wisp over his massive forehead  the eyes were bluegray under great black tufts very clear very critical and very masterful  a huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair  this and a bellowing roaring rumbling voice made up my first impression of the notorious professor challenger  well said he with a most insolent stare  what now  i must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview  you were good enough to give me an appointment sir said i humbly producing his envelope  he took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him  oh you are the young person who cannot understand plain english are you  my general conclusions you are good enough to approve as i understand  entirely sirentirely  i was very emphatic  dear me  that strengthens my position very much does it not  your age and appearance make your support doubly valuable  well at least you are better than that herd of swine in vienna whose gregarious grunt is however not more offensive than the isolated effort of the british hog  he glared at me as the present representative of the beast  they seem to have behaved abominably said i  i assure you that i can fight my own battles and that i have no possible need of your sympathy  put me alone sir and with my back to the wall  g e c is happiest then  well sir let us do what we can to curtail this visit which can hardly be agreeable to you and is inexpressibly irksome to me  you had as i have been led to believe some comments to make upon the proposition which i advanced in my thesis  there was a brutal directness about his methods which made evasion difficult  i must still make play and wait for a better opening  it had seemed simple enough at a distance  oh my irish wits could they not help me now when i needed help so sorely  he transfixed me with two sharp steely eyes  come come he rumbled  i am of course a mere student said i with a fatuous smile hardly more i might say than an earnest inquirer  at the same time it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon weissmann in this matter  has not the general evidence since that date tended towell to strengthen his position  what evidence  he spoke with a menacing calm  well of course i am aware that there is not any what you might call definite evidence  i alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and the general scientific point of view if i might so express it  he leaned forward with great earnestness  i suppose you are aware said he checking off points upon his fingers that the cranial index is a constant factor  naturally said i  and that telegony is still sub judice  undoubtedly  and that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg  why surely i cried and gloried in my own audacity  but what does that prove he asked in a gentle persuasive voice  ah what indeed i murmured  what does it prove  shall i tell you he cooed  pray do  it proves he roared with a sudden blast of fury that you are the damnedest imposter in londona vile crawling journalist who has no more science than he has decency in his composition  he had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes  even at that moment of tension i found time for amazement at the discovery that he was quite a short man his head not higher than my shouldera stunted hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth breadth and brain  gibberish he cried leaning forward with his fingers on the table and his face projecting  thats what i have been talking to you sirscientific gibberish  did you think you could match cunning with meyou with your walnut of a brain  you think you are omnipotent you infernal scribblers dont you  that your praise can make a man and your blame can break him  we must all bow to you and try to get a favorable word must we  this man shall have a leg up and this man shall have a dressing down  creeping vermin i know you  youve got out of your station  time was when your ears were clipped  youve lost your sense of proportion  swollen gasbags  ill keep you in your proper place  yes sir you havent got over g e c  theres one man who is still your master  he warned you off but if you will come by the lord you do it at your own risk  forfeit my good mr malone i claim forfeit  you have played a rather dangerous game and it strikes me that you have lost it  look here sir said i backing to the door and opening it you can be as abusive as you like  but there is a limit  you shall not assault me  shall i not  he was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way but he stopped now and put his big hands into the sidepockets of a rather boyish short jacket which he wore  i have thrown several of you out of the house  you will be the fourth or fifth  three pound fifteen eachthat is how it averaged  expensive but very necessary now sir why should you not follow your brethren  i rather think you must  he resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance pointing his toes as he walked like a dancing master  i could have bolted for the hall door but it would have been too ignominious  besides a little glow of righteous anger was springing up within me  i had been hopelessly in the wrong before but this mans menaces were putting me in the right  ill trouble you to keep your hands off sir  ill not stand it  dear me  his black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a sneer  you wont stand it eh  dont be such a fool professor i cried  what can you hope for im fifteen stone as hard as nails and play center threequarter every saturday for the london irish  im not the man  it was at that moment that he rushed me  it was lucky that i had opened the door or we should have gone through it  we did a catharinewheel together down the passage  somehow we gathered up a chair upon our way and bounded on with it towards the street  my mouth was full of  his beard our arms were locked our bodies intertwined and that infernal chair radiated its legs all round us the watchful austin had thrown open the hall door  we went with a back somersault down the front steps  i have seen the two macs attempt something of the kind at the halls but it appears to take some practise to do it without hurting oneself  the chair went to matchwood at the bottom and we rolled apart into the gutter  he sprang to his feet waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic  had enough he panted  you infernal bully i cried as i gathered myself together  then and there we should have tried the thing out for he was effervescing with fight but fortunately i was rescued from an odious situation  a policeman was beside us his notebook in his hand  whats all this  you ought to be ashamed said the policeman  it was the most rational remark which i had heard in enmore park  well he insisted turning to me what is it then  this man attacked me said i  did you attack him asked the policeman  the professor breathed hard and said nothing  its not the first time either said the policeman severely shaking his head  you were in trouble last month for the same thing youve blackened this young mans eye  do you give him in charge sir  i relented  no said i i do not  whats that said the policeman  i was to blame myself  i intruded upon him  he gave me fair warning  the policeman snapped up his notebook  dont let us have any more such goingson said he  now then move on there move on  this to a butchers boy a maid and one or two loafers who had collected  he clumped heavily down the street driving this little flock before him  the professor looked at me and there was something humorous at the back of his eyes  come in said he  ive not done with you yet  the speech had a sinister sound but i followed him none the less into the house  the manservant austin like a wooden image closed the door behind us                                 chapter iv           its just the very biggest thing in the world  hardly was it shut when mrs challenger darted out from the diningroom  the small woman was in a furious temper  she barred her husbands way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog  it was evident that she had seen my exit but had not observed my return  you brute george she screamed  youve hurt that nice young man  he jerked backwards with his thumb  here he is safe and sound behind me  she was confused but not unduly so  i am so sorry i didnt see you  i assure you madam that it is all right  he has marked your poor face  oh george what a brute you are nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other  everyone hating and making fun of you  youve finished my patience  this ends it  dirty linen he rumbled  its not a secret she cried  do you suppose that the whole streetthe whole of london for that matter  get away austin we dont want you here  do you suppose they dont all talk about you where is your dignity  you a man who should have been regius professor at a great university with a thousand students all revering you  where is your dignity george  how about yours my dear  you try me too much  a ruffiana common brawling ruffianthats what you have become  be good jessie  a roaring raging bully  thats done it  stool of penance said he  to my amazement he stooped picked her up and placed her sitting upon a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall  it was at least seven feet high and so thin that she could hardly balance upon it  a more absurd object than she presented cocked up there with her face convulsed with anger her feet dangling and her body rigid for fear of an upset i could not imagine  let me down she wailed  say please  you brute george  let me down this instant  come into the study mr malone  really sir said i looking at the lady  heres mr malone pleading for you jessie  say please and down you come  oh you brute  please please  he took her down as if she had been a canary  you must behave yourself dear  mr malone is a pressman  he will have it all in his rag tomorrow and sell an extra dozen among our neighbors  strange story of high lifeyou felt fairly high on that pedestal did you not  then a subtitle glimpse of a singular menage  hes a foul feeder is mr malone a carrion eater like all of his kindporcus ex grege diabolia swine from the devils herd thats it malonewhat  you are really intolerable said i hotly  he bellowed with laughter  we shall have a coalition presently he boomed looking from his wife to me and puffing out his enormous chest  then suddenly altering his tone excuse this frivolous family badinage mr malone  i called you back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little domestic pleasantries  run away little woman and dont fret  he placed a huge hand upon each of her shoulders  all that you say is perfectly true  i should be a better man if i did what you advise but i shouldnt be quite george edward challenger  there are plenty of better men my dear but only one g e c  so make the best of him he suddenly gave her a resounding kiss which embarrassed me even more than his violence had done  now mr malone he continued with a great accession of dignity this way if you please  we reentered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes before  the professor closed the door carefully behind us motioned me into an armchair and pushed a cigarbox under my nose  real san juan colorado he said  excitable people like you are the better for narcotics  heavens dont bite it  cutand cut with reverence  now lean back and listen attentively to whatever i may care to say to you  if any remark should occur to you you can reserve it for some more opportune time  first of all as to your return to my house after your most justifiable expulsionhe protruded his beard and stared at me as one who challenges and invites contradictionafter as i say your wellmerited expulsion  the reason lay in your answer to that most officious policeman in which i seemed to discern some glimmering of good feeling upon your partmore at any rate than i am accustomed to associate with your profession  in admitting that the fault of the incident lay with you you gave some evidence of a certain mental detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice the subspecies of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has always been below my mental horizon  your words brought you suddenly above it  you swam up into my serious notice  for this reason i asked you to return with me as i was minded to make your further acquaintance  you will kindly deposit your ash in the small japanese tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow  all this he boomed forth like a professor addressing his class  he had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bullfrog his head laid back and his eyes halfcovered by supercilious lids  now he suddenly turned himself sideways and all i could see of him was tangled hair with a red protruding ear  he was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk  he faced me presently with what looked like a very tattered sketchbook in his hand  i am going to talk to you about south america said he  no comments if you please  first of all i wish you to understand that nothing i tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my express permission  that permission will in all human probability never be given  is that clear  it is very hard said i surely a judicious account  he replaced the notebook upon the table  that ends it said he  i wish you a very good morning  no no i cried  i submit to any conditions  so far as i can see i have no choice  none in the world said he  well then i promise  word of honor  word of honor  he looked at me with doubt in his insolent eyes  after all what do i know about your honor said he  upon my word sir i cried angrily you take very great liberties i have never been so insulted in my life  he seemed more interested than annoyed at my outbreak  roundheaded he muttered  brachycephalic grayeyed blackhaired with suggestion of the negroid  celtic i presume  i am an irishman sir  irish irish  yes sir  that of course explains it  let me see you have given me your promise that my confidence will be respected  that confidence i may say will be far from complete  but i am prepared to give you a few indications which will be of interest  in the first place you are probably aware that two years ago i made a journey to south americaone which will be classical in the scientific history of the world  the object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of wallace and of bates which could only be done by observing their reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves noted them  if my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry  you are awareor probably in this halfeducated age you are not awarethat the country round some parts of the amazon is still only partially explored and that a great number of tributaries some of them entirely uncharted run into the main river  it was my business to visit this littleknown backcountry and to examine its fauna which furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and monumental work upon zoology which will be my lifes justification  i was returning my work accomplished when i had occasion to spend a night at a small indian village at a point where a certain tributarythe name and position of which i withholdopens into the main river  the natives were cucama indians an amiable but degraded race with mental powers hardly superior to the average londoner  i had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river and had impressed them considerably with my personality so that i was not surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return  i gathered from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services and i followed the chief to one of his huts  when i entered i found that the sufferer to whose aid i had been summoned had that instant expired  he was to my surprise no indian but a white man indeed i may say a very white man for he was flaxenhaired and had some characteristics of an albino  he was clad in rags was very emaciated and bore every trace of prolonged hardship  so far as i could understand the account of the natives he was a complete stranger to them and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in the last stage of exhaustion  the mans knapsack lay beside the couch and i examined the contents his name was written upon a tab within itmaple white lake avenue detroit michigan  it is a name to which i am prepared always to lift my hat  it is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned  from the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had been an artist and poet in search of effects  there were scraps of verse  i do not profess to be a judge of such things but they appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit  there were also some rather commonplace pictures of river scenery a paintbox a box of colored chalks some brushes that curved bone which lies upon my inkstand a volume of baxters moths and butterflies a cheap revolver and a few cartridges  of personal equipment he either had none or he had lost it in his journey  such were the total effects of this strange american bohemian  i was turning away from him when i observed that something projected from the front of his ragged jacket  it was this sketchbook which was as dilapidated then as you see it now  indeed i can assure you that a first folio of shakespeare could not be treated with greater reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession  i hand it to you now and i ask you to take it page by page and to examine the contents  he helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical pair of eyes taking note of the effect which this document would produce  i had opened the volume with some expectation of a revelation though of what nature i could not imagine  the first page was disappointing however as it contained nothing but the picture of a very fat man in a peajacket with the legend jimmy colver on the mailboat written beneath it  there followed several pages which were filled with small sketches of indians and their ways  then came a picture of a cheerful and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat sitting opposite a very thin european and the inscription  lunch with fra cristofero at rosario  studies of women and babies accounted for several more pages and then there was an unbroken series of animal drawings with such explanations as manatee upon sandbank turtles and their eggs black ajouti under a miriti palmthe matter disclosing some sort of piglike animal and finally came a double page of studies of longsnouted and very unpleasant saurians  i could make nothing of it and said so to the professor  surely these are only crocodiles  alligators  alligators  there is hardly such a thing as a true crocodile in south america  the distinction between them  i meant that i could see nothing unusualnothing to justify what you have said  he smiled serenely  try the next page said he  i was still unable to sympathize  it was a fullpage sketch of a landscape roughly tinted in colorthe kind of painting which an openair artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort there was a palegreen foreground of feathery vegetation which sloped upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color and curiously ribbed like some basaltic formations which i have seen  they extended in an unbroken wall right across the background  at one point was an isolated pyramidal rock crowned by a great tree which appeared to be separated by a cleft from the main crag  behind it all a blue tropical sky  a thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of the ruddy cliff  well he asked  it is no doubt a curious formation said i but i am not geologist enough to say that it is wonderful  wonderful he repeated  it is unique  it is incredible  no one on earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility  now the next  i turned it over and gave an exclamation of surprise  there was a fullpage picture of the most extraordinary creature that i had ever seen  it was the wild dream of an opium smoker a vision of delirium the head was like that of a fowl the body that of a bloated lizard the trailing tail was furnished with upwardturned spikes and the curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe which looked like a dozen cocks wattles placed behind each other  in front of this creature was an absurd mannikin or dwarf in human form who stood staring at it  well what do you think of that cried the professor rubbing his hands with an air of triumph  it is monstrousgrotesque  but what made him draw such an animal  trade gin i should think  oh thats the best explanation you can give is it  well sir what is yours  the obvious one that the creature exists  that is actually sketched from the life  i should have laughed only that i had a vision of our doing another catharinewheel down the passage  no doubt said i no doubt as one humors an imbecile  i confess however i added that this tiny human figure puzzles me  if it were an indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in america but it appears to be a european in a sunhat  the professor snorted like an angry buffalo  you really touch the limit said he  you enlarge my view of the possible  cerebral paresis  mental inertia  wonderful  he was too absurd to make me angry  indeed it was a waste of energy for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all the time  i contented myself with smiling wearily  it struck me that the man was small said i  look here he cried leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy sausage of a finger on to the picture  you see that plant behind the animal i suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a brussels sproutwhat  well it is a vegetable ivory palm and they run to about fifty or sixty feet  dont you see that the man is put in for a purpose  he couldnt really have stood in front of that brute and lived to draw it  he sketched himself in to give a scale of heights he was we will say over five feet high  the tree is ten times bigger which is what one would expect  good heavens i cried  then you think the beast was why charing cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute  apart from exaggeration he is certainly a wellgrown specimen said the professor complacently  but i cried surely the whole experience of the human race is not to be set aside on account of a single sketchi had turned over the leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the booka single sketch by a wandering american artist who may have done it under hashish or in the delirium of fever or simply in order to gratify a freakish imagination  you cant as a man of science defend such a position as that  for answer the professor took a book down from a shelf  this is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend ray lankester said he  there is an illustration here which would interest you  ah yes here it is  the inscription beneath it runs  probable appearance in life of the jurassic dinosaur stegosaurus  the hind leg alone is twice as tall as a fullgrown man  well what do you make of that  he handed me the open book  i started as i looked at the picture  in this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was certainly a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist  that is certainly remarkable said i  but you wont admit that it is final  surely it might be a coincidence or this american may have seen a picture of the kind and carried it in his memory  it would be likely to recur to a man in a delirium  very good said the professor indulgently we leave it at that  i will now ask you to look at this bone he handed over the one which he had already described as part of the dead mans possessions  it was about six inches long and thicker than my thumb with some indications of dried cartilage at one end of it  to what known creature does that bone belong asked the professor  i examined it with care and tried to recall some halfforgotten knowledge  it might be a very thick human collarbone i said  my companion waved his hand in contemptuous deprecation  the human collarbone is curved  this is straight  there is a groove upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it which could not be the case with a clavicle  then i must confess that i dont know what it is  you need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance for i dont suppose the whole south kensington staff could give a name to it he took a little bone the size of a bean out of a pillbox  so far as i am a judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand  that will give you some idea of the size of the creature  you will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen but recent  what do you say to that  surely in an elephant  he winced as if in pain  dont  dont talk of elephants in south america  even in these days of board schools  well i interrupted any large south american animala tapir for example  you may take it young man that i am versed in the elements of my business  this is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any other creature known to zoology  it belongs to a very large a very strong and by all analogy a very fierce animal which exists upon the face of the earth but has not yet come under the notice of science you are still unconvinced  i am at least deeply interested  then your case is not hopeless  i feel that there is reason lurking in you somewhere so we will patiently grope round for it  we will now leave the dead american and proceed with my narrative  you can imagine that i could hardly come away from the amazon without probing deeper into the matter  there were indications as to the direction from which the dead traveler had come  indian legends would alone have been my guide for i found that rumors of a strange land were common among all the riverine tribes  you have heard no doubt of curupuri  never  curupuri is the spirit of the woods something terrible something malevolent something to be avoided  none can describe its shape or nature but it is a word of terror along the amazon  now all tribes agree as to the direction in which curupuri lives  it was the same direction from which the american had come  something terrible lay that way  it was my business to find out what it was  what did you do  my flippancy was all gone  this massive man compelled ones attention and respect  i overcame the extreme reluctance of the nativesa reluctance which extends even to talk upon the subjectand by judicious persuasion and gifts aided i will admit by some threats of coercion i got two of them to act as guides  after many adventures which i need not describe and after traveling a distance which i will not mention in a direction which i withhold we came at last to a tract of country which has never been described nor indeed visited save by my unfortunate predecessor  would you kindly look at this  he handed me a photographhalfplate size  the unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact said he that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which contained the undeveloped films was broken with disastrous results nearly all of them were totally ruinedan irreparable loss  this is one of the few which partially escaped  this explanation of deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept  there was talk of faking  i am not in a mood to argue such a point  the photograph was certainly very offcolored  an unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted that dim surface  it was a dull gray landscape and as i gradually deciphered the details of it i realized that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance with a sloping treeclad plain in the foreground  i believe it is the same place as the painted picture said i  it is the same place the professor answered  i found traces of the fellows camp  now look at this  it was a nearer view of the same scene though the photograph was extremely defective  i could distinctly see the isolated treecrowned pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag  i have no doubt of it at all said i  well that is something gained said he  we progress do we not now will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle  do you observe something there  an enormous tree  but on the tree  a large bird said i  he handed me a lens  yes i said peering through it a large bird stands on the tree it appears to have a considerable beak  i should say it was a pelican  i cannot congratulate you upon your eyesight said the professor it is not a pelican nor indeed is it a bird  it may interest you to know that i succeeded in shooting that particular specimen  it was the only absolute proof of my experiences which i was able to bring away with me  you have it then  here at last was tangible corroboration  i had it  it was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same boat accident which ruined my photographs  i clutched at it as it disappeared in the swirl of the rapids and part of its wing was left in my hand  i was insensible when washed ashore but the miserable remnant of my superb specimen was still intact i now lay it before you  from a drawer he produced what seemed to me to be the upper portion of the wing of a large bat  it was at least two feet in length a curved bone with a membranous veil beneath it  a monstrous bat i suggested  nothing of the sort said the professor severely  living as i do in an educated and scientific atmosphere i could not have conceived that the first principles of zoology were so little known  is it possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative anatomy that the wing of a bird is really the forearm while the wing of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between now in this case the bone is certainly not the forearm and you can see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single bone and therefore that it cannot belong to a bat  but if it is neither bird nor bat what is it  my small stock of knowledge was exhausted  i really do not know said i  he opened the standard work to which he had already referred me  here said he pointing to the picture of an extraordinary flying monster is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon or pterodactyl a flying reptile of the jurassic period  on the next page is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing  kindly compare it with the specimen in your hand  a wave of amazement passed over me as i looked  i was convinced there could be no getting away from it  the cumulative proof was overwhelming  the sketch the photographs the narrative and now the actual specimenthe evidence was complete  i said soi said so warmly for i felt that the professor was an illused man  he leaned back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile basking in this sudden gleam of sunshine  its just the very biggest thing that i ever heard of said i though it was my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that was roused  it is colossal  you are a columbus of science who has discovered a lost world  im awfully sorry if i seemed to doubt you it was all so unthinkable  but i understand evidence when i see it and this should be good enough for anyone  the professor purred with satisfaction  and then sir what did you do next  it was the wet season mr malone and my stores were exhausted  i explored some portion of this huge cliff but i was unable to find any way to scale it  the pyramidal rock upon which i saw and shot the pterodactyl was more accessible  being something of a cragsman i did manage to get half way to the top of that  from that height i had a better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags  it appeared to be very large neither to east nor to west could i see any end to the vista of greencapped cliffs  below it is a swampy jungly region full of snakes insects and fever  it is a natural protection to this singular country  did you see any other trace of life  no sir i did not but during the week that we lay encamped at the base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above  but the creature that the american drew  how do you account for that  we can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and seen it there  we know therefore that there is a way up  we know equally that it must be a very difficult one otherwise the creatures would have come down and overrun the surrounding country  surely that is clear  but how did they come to be there  i do not think that the problem is a very obscure one said the professor there can only be one explanation  south america is as you may have heard a granite continent  at this single point in the interior there has been in some far distant age a great sudden volcanic upheaval  these cliffs i may remark are basaltic and therefore plutonic  an area as large perhaps as sussex has been lifted up en bloc with all its living contents and cut off by perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all the rest of the continent  what is the result  why the ordinary laws of nature are suspended  the various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered  creatures survive which would otherwise disappear  you will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are jurassic and therefore of a great age in the order of life  they have been artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions  but surely your evidence is conclusive  you have only to lay it before the proper authorities  so in my simplicity i had imagined said the professor bitterly i can only tell you that it was not so that i was met at every turn by incredulity born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy  it is not my nature sir to cringe to any man or to seek to prove a fact if my word has been doubted  after the first i have not condescended to show such corroborative proofs as i possess  the subject became hateful to mei would not speak of it  when men like yourself who represent the foolish curiosity of the public came to disturb my privacy i was unable to meet them with dignified reserve  by nature i am i admit somewhat fiery and under provocation i am inclined to be violent  i fear you may have remarked it  i nursed my eye and was silent  my wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject and yet i fancy that any man of honor would feel the same  tonight however i propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over the emotions  i invite you to be present at the exhibition  he handed me a card from his desk  you will perceive that mr percival waldron a naturalist of some popular repute is announced to lecture at eightthirty at the zoological institutes hall upon the record of the ages i have been specially invited to be present upon the platform and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer  while doing so i shall make it my business with infinite tact and delicacy to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter nothing contentious you understand but only an indication that there are greater deeps beyond  i shall hold myself strongly in leash and see whether by this selfrestraint i attain a more favorable result  and i may come i asked eagerly  why surely he answered cordially  he had an enormously massive genial manner which was almost as overpowering as his violence  his smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing when his cheeks would suddenly bunch into two red apples between his halfclosed eyes and his great black beard  by all means come  it will be a comfort to me to know that i have one ally in the hall however inefficient and ignorant of the subject he may be  i fancy there will be a large audience for waldron though an absolute charlatan has a considerable popular following  now mr malone i have given you rather more of my time than i had intended  the individual must not monopolize what is meant for the world  i shall be pleased to see you at the lecture tonight  in the meantime you will understand that no public use is to be made of any of the material that i have given you  but mr mcardlemy news editor you knowwill want to know what i have done  tell him what you like  you can say among other things that if he sends anyone else to intrude upon me i shall call upon him with a ridingwhip  but i leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in print  very good  then the zoological institutes hall at eightthirty tonight  i had a last impression of red cheeks blue rippling beard and intolerant eyes as he waved me out of the room                                 chapter v                             question  what with the physical shocks incidental to my first interview with professor challenger and the mental ones which accompanied the second i was a somewhat demoralized journalist by the time i found myself in enmore park once more  in my aching head the one thought was throbbing that there really was truth in this mans story that it was of tremendous consequence and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the gazette when i could obtain permission to use it  a taxicab was waiting at the end of the road so i sprang into it and drove down to the office  mcardle was at his post as usual  well he cried expectantly what may it run to  im thinking young man you have been in the wars  dont tell me that he assaulted you  we had a little difference at first  what a man it is  what did you do  well he became more reasonable and we had a chat  but i got nothing out of himnothing for publication  im not so sure about that  you got a black eye out of him and thats for publication  we cant have this reign of terror mr malone  we must bring the man to his bearings  ill have a leaderette on him tomorrow that will raise a blister  just give me the material and i will engage to brand the fellow for ever  professor munchausenhows that for an inset headline  sir john mandeville redivivuscagliostroall the imposters and bullies in history  ill show him up for the fraud he is  i wouldnt do that sir  why not  because he is not a fraud at all  what roared mcardle  you dont mean to say you really believe this stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents  well i dont know about that  i dont think he makes any claims of that kind  but i do believe he has got something new  then for heavens sake man write it up  im longing to but all i know he gave me in confidence and on condition that i didnt  i condensed into a few sentences the professors narrative  thats how it stands  mcardle looked deeply incredulous  well mr malone he said at last about this scientific meeting tonight there can be no privacy about that anyhow  i dont suppose any paper will want to report it for waldron has been reported already a dozen times and no one is aware that challenger will speak  we may get a scoop if we are lucky  youll be there in any case so youll just give us a pretty full report  ill keep space up to midnight  my day was a busy one and i had an early dinner at the savage club with tarp henry to whom i gave some account of my adventures  he listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face and roared with laughter on hearing that the professor had convinced me  my dear chap things dont happen like that in real life  people dont stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence leave that to the novelists  the fellow is as full of tricks as the monkeyhouse at the zoo  its all bosh  but the american poet  he never existed  i saw his sketchbook  challengers sketchbook  you think he drew that animal  of course he did  who else  well then the photographs  there was nothing in the photographs  by your own admission you only saw a bird  a pterodactyl  thats what he says  he put the pterodactyl into your head  well then the bones  first one out of an irish stew  second one vamped up for the occasion  if you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone as easily as you can a photograph  i began to feel uneasy  perhaps after all i had been premature in my acquiescence  then i had a sudden happy thought  will you come to the meeting i asked  tarp henry looked thoughtful  he is not a popular person the genial challenger said he  a lot of people have accounts to settle with him  i should say he is about the besthated man in london  if the medical students turn out there will be no end of a rag  i dont want to get into a beargarden  you might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case  well perhaps its only fair  all right  im your man for the evening  when we arrived at the hall we found a much greater concourse than i had expected  a line of electric broughams discharged their little cargoes of whitebearded professors while the dark stream of humbler pedestrians who crowded through the arched doorway showed that the audience would be popular as well as scientific  indeed it became evident to us as soon as we had taken our seats that a youthful and even boyish spirit was abroad in the gallery and the back portions of the hall  looking behind me i could see rows of faces of the familiar medical student type  apparently the great hospitals had each sent down their contingent  the behavior of the audience at present was goodhumored but mischievous  scraps of popular songs were chorused with an enthusiasm which was a strange prelude to a scientific lecture and there was already a tendency to personal chaff which promised a jovial evening to others however embarrassing it might be to the recipients of these dubious honors  thus when old doctor meldrum with his wellknown curlybrimmed operahat appeared upon the platform there was such a universal query of where did you get that tile that he hurriedly removed it and concealed it furtively under his chair  when gouty professor wadley limped down to his seat there were general affectionate inquiries from all parts of the hall as to the exact state of his poor toe which caused him obvious embarrassment  the greatest demonstration of all however was at the entrance of my new acquaintance professor challenger when he passed down to take his place at the extreme end of the front row of the platform  such a yell of welcome broke forth when his black beard first protruded round the corner that i began to suspect tarp henry was right in his surmise and that this assemblage was there not merely for the sake of the lecture but because it had got rumored abroad that the famous professor would take part in the proceedings  there was some sympathetic laughter on his entrance among the front benches of welldressed spectators as though the demonstration of the students in this instance was not unwelcome to them  that greeting was indeed a frightful outburst of sound the uproar of the carnivora cage when the step of the bucketbearing keeper is heard in the distance  there was an offensive tone in it perhaps and yet in the main it struck me as mere riotous outcry the noisy reception of one who amused and interested them rather than of one they disliked or despised  challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt as a kindly man would meet the yapping of a litter of puppies  he sat slowly down blew out his chest passed his hand caressingly down his beard and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the crowded hall before him  the uproar of his advent had not yet died away when professor ronald murray the chairman and mr waldron the lecturer threaded their way to the front and the proceedings began  professor murray will i am sure excuse me if i say that he has the common fault of most englishmen of being inaudible  why on earth people who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange mysteries of modern life  their methods are as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a nonconducting pipe which could by the least effort be opened professor murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to the watercarafe upon the table with a humorous twinkling aside to the silver candlestick upon his right  then he sat down and mr waldron the famous popular lecturer rose amid a general murmur of applause  he was a stern gaunt man with a harsh voice and an aggressive manner but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate the ideas of other men and to pass them on in a way which was intelligible and even interesting to the lay public with a happy knack of being funny about the most unlikely objects so that the precession of the equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly humorous process as treated by him  it was a birdseye view of creation as interpreted by science which in language always clear and sometimes picturesque he unfolded before us  he told us of the globe a huge mass of flaming gas flaring through the heavens  then he pictured the solidification the cooling the wrinkling which formed the mountains the steam which turned to water the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played the inexplicable drama of life  on the origin of life itself he was discreetly vague  that the germs of it could hardly have survived the original roasting was he declared fairly certain  therefore it had come later  had it built itself out of the cooling inorganic elements of the globe  very likely  had the germs of it arrived from outside upon a meteor  it was hardly conceivable  on the whole the wisest man was the least dogmatic upon the point  we could notor at least we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our laboratories out of inorganic materials  the gulf between the dead and the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge but there was a higher and subtler chemistry of nature which working with great forces over long epochs might well produce results which were impossible for us  there the matter must be left  this brought the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life beginning low down in molluscs and feeble sea creatures then up rung by rung through reptiles and fishes till at last we came to a kangaroorat a creature which brought forth its young alive the direct ancestor of all mammals and presumably therefore of everyone in the audience no no from a sceptical student in the back row  if the young gentleman in the red tie who cried no no and who presumably claimed to have been hatched out of an egg would wait upon him after the lecture he would be glad to see such a curiosity  laughter  it was strange to think that the climax of all the agelong process of nature had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie  but had the process stopped  was this gentleman to be taken as the final typethe beall and endall of development  he hoped that he would not hurt the feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life still the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they were to end entirely in his production  evolution was not a spent force but one still working and even greater achievements were in store  having thus amid a general titter played very prettily with his interrupter the lecturer went back to his picture of the past the drying of the seas the emergence of the sandbank the sluggish viscous life which lay upon their margins the overcrowded lagoons the tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mudflats the abundance of food awaiting them their consequent enormous growth hence ladies and gentlemen he added that frightful brood of saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the wealden or in the solenhofen slates but which were fortunately extinct long before the first appearance of mankind upon this planet  question boomed a voice from the platform  mr waldron was a strict disciplinarian with a gift of acid humor as exemplified upon the gentleman with the red tie which made it perilous to interrupt him  but this interjection appeared to him so absurd that he was at a loss how to deal with it  so looks the shakespearean who is confronted by a rancid baconian or the astronomer who is assailed by a flatearth fanatic  he paused for a moment and then raising his voice repeated slowly the words  which were extinct before the coming of man  question boomed the voice once more  waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of challenger who leaned back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression as if he were smiling in his sleep  i see said waldron with a shrug  it is my friend professor challenger and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a final explanation and no more need be said  but the incident was far from being closed  whatever path the lecturer took amid the wilds of the past seemed invariably to lead him to some assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the same bulls bellow from the professor  the audience began to anticipate it and to roar with delight when it came  the packed benches of students joined in and every time challengers beard opened before any sound could come forth there was a yell of question from a hundred voices and an answering counter cry of order and shame from as many more  waldron though a hardened lecturer and a strong man became rattled  he hesitated stammered repeated himself got snarled in a long sentence and finally turned furiously upon the cause of his troubles  this is really intolerable he cried glaring across the platform i must ask you professor challenger to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruptions  there was a hush over the hall the students rigid with delight at seeing the high gods on olympus quarrelling among themselves challenger levered his bulky figure slowly out of his chair  i must in turn ask you mr waldron he said to cease to make assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact  the words unloosed a tempest  shame  shame  give him a hearing put him out  shove him off the platform  fair play emerged from a general roar of amusement or execration  the chairman was on his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly  professor challengerpersonalviewslater were the solid peaks above his clouds of inaudible mutter  the interrupter bowed smiled stroked his beard and relapsed into his chair  waldron very flushed and warlike continued his observations  now and then as he made an assertion he shot a venomous glance at his opponent who seemed to be slumbering deeply with the same broad happy smile upon his face  at last the lecture came to an endi am inclined to think that it was a premature one as the peroration was hurried and disconnected  the thread of the argument had been rudely broken and the audience was restless and expectant  waldron sat down and after a chirrup from the chairman professor challenger rose and advanced to the edge of the platform  in the interests of my paper i took down his speech verbatim  ladies and gentlemen he began amid a sustained interruption from the back  i beg pardonladies gentlemen and childreni must apologize i had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this audience tumult during which the professor stood with one hand raised and his enormous head nodding sympathetically as if he were bestowing a pontifical blessing upon the crowd i have been selected to move a vote of thanks to mr waldron for the very picturesque and imaginative address to which we have just listened  there are points in it with which i disagree and it has been my duty to indicate them as they arose but none the less mr waldron has accomplished his object well that object being to give a simple and interesting account of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet  popular lectures are the easiest to listen to but mr waldron here he beamed and blinked at the lecturer will excuse me when i say that they are necessarily both superficial and misleading since they have to be graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience  ironical cheering  popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic  angry gesture of protest from mr waldron  they exploit for fame or cash the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren one smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory one brick built into the temple of science far outweighs any secondhand exposition which passes an idle hour but can leave no useful result behind it  i put forward this obvious reflection not out of any desire to disparage mr waldron in particular but that you may not lose your sense of proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest at this point mr waldron whispered to the chairman who half rose and said something severely to his watercarafe  but enough of this  loud and prolonged cheers  let me pass to some subject of wider interest what is the particular point upon which i as an original investigator have challenged our lecturers accuracy  it is upon the permanence of certain types of animal life upon the earth  i do not speak upon this subject as an amateur nor i may add as a popular lecturer but i speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts when i say that mr waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a socalled prehistoric animal therefore these creatures no longer exist  they are indeed as he has said our ancestors but they are if i may use the expression our contemporary ancestors who can still be found with all their hideous and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood to seek their haunts  creatures which were supposed to be jurassic monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest mammals still exist cries of bosh prove it how do you know question how do i know you ask me i know because i have visited their secret haunts  i know because i have seen some of them applause uproar and a voice liar  am i a liar general hearty and noisy assent  did i hear someone say that i was a liar will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that i may know him  a voice here he is sir and an inoffensive little person in spectacles struggling violently was held up among a group of students  did you venture to call me a liar  no sir no shouted the accused and disappeared like a jackinthebox  if any person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity i shall be glad to have a few words with him after the lecture  liar  who said that again the inoffensive one plunging desperately was elevated high into the air if i come down among you general chorus of come love come which interrupted the proceedings for some moments while the chairman standing up and waving both his arms seemed to be conducting the music  the professor with his face flushed his nostrils dilated and his beard bristling was now in a proper berserk mood  every great discoverer has been met with the same incredulitythe sure brand of a generation of fools  when great facts are laid before you you have not the intuition the imagination which would help you to understand them  you can only throw mud at the men who have risked their lives to open new fields to science  you persecute the prophets  galileo  darwin and i prolonged cheering and complete interruption  all this is from my hurried notes taken at the time which give little notion of the absolute chaos to which the assembly had by this time been reduced  so terrific was the uproar that several ladies had already beaten a hurried retreat  grave and reverend seniors seemed to have caught the prevailing spirit as badly as the students and i saw whitebearded men rising and shaking their fists at the obdurate professor  the whole great audience seethed and simmered like a boiling pot  the professor took a step forward and raised both his hands  there was something so big and arresting and virile in the man that the clatter and shouting died gradually away before his commanding gesture and his masterful eyes  he seemed to have a definite message they hushed to hear it  i will not detain you he said  it is not worth it  truth is truth and the noise of a number of foolish young menand i fear i must add of their equally foolish seniorscannot affect the matter i claim that i have opened a new field of science  you dispute it cheers  then i put you to the test  will you accredit one or more of your own number to go out as your representatives and test my statement in your name  mr summerlee the veteran professor of comparative anatomy rose among the audience a tall thin bitter man with the withered aspect of a theologian  he wished he said to ask professor challenger whether the results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained during a journey to the headwaters of the amazon made by him two years before  professor challenger answered that they had  mr summerlee desired to know how it was that professor challenger claimed to have made discoveries in those regions which had been overlooked by wallace bates and other previous explorers of established scientific repute  professor challenger answered that mr summerlee appeared to be confusing the amazon with the thames that it was in reality a somewhat larger river that mr summerlee might be interested to know that with the orinoco which communicated with it some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed  mr summerlee declared with an acid smile that he fully appreciated the difference between the thames and the amazon which lay in the fact that any assertion about the former could be tested while about the latter it could not  he would be obliged if professor challenger would give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric animals were to be found  professor challenger replied that he reserved such information for good reasons of his own but would be prepared to give it with proper precautions to a committee chosen from the audience  would mr summerlee serve on such a committee and test his story in person  mr summerlee  yes i will  great cheering  professor challenger  then i guarantee that i will place in your hands such material as will enable you to find your way  it is only right however since mr summerlee goes to check my statement that i should have one or more with him who may check his  i will not disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers  mr summerlee will need a younger colleague  may i ask for volunteers  it is thus that the great crisis of a mans life springs out at him could i have imagined when i entered that hall that i was about to pledge myself to a wilder adventure than had ever come to me in my dreams  but gladyswas it not the very opportunity of which she spoke  gladys would have told me to go  i had sprung to my feet  i was speaking and yet i had prepared no words  tarp henry my companion was plucking at my skirts and i heard him whispering sit down malone dont make a public ass of yourself  at the same time i was aware that a tall thin man with dark gingery hair a few seats in front of me was also upon his feet  he glared back at me with hard angry eyes but i refused to give way  i will go mr chairman i kept repeating over and over again  name  name cried the audience  my name is edward dunn malone  i am the reporter of the daily gazette  i claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness  what is your name sir the chairman asked of my tall rival  i am lord john roxton  i have already been up the amazon i know all the ground and have special qualifications for this investigation  lord john roxtons reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is of course worldfamous said the chairman at the same time it would certainly be as well to have a member of the press upon such an expedition  then i move said professor challenger that both these gentlemen be elected as representatives of this meeting to accompany professor summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth of my statements  and so amid shouting and cheering our fate was decided and i found myself borne away in the human current which swirled towards the door with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so suddenly before it  as i emerged from the hall i was conscious for a moment of a rush of laughing studentsdown the pavement and of an arm wielding a heavy umbrella which rose and fell in the midst of them then amid a mixture of groans and cheers professor challengers electric brougham slid from the curb and i found myself walking under the silvery lights of regent street full of thoughts of gladys and of wonder as to my future  suddenly there was a touch at my elbow  i turned and found myself looking into the humorous masterful eyes of the tall thin man who had volunteered to be my companion on this strange quest  mr malone i understand said he  we are to be companionswhat my rooms are just over the road in the albany  perhaps you would have the kindness to spare me half an hour for there are one or two things that i badly want to say to you                                 chapter vi                    i was the flail of the lord  lord john roxton and i turned down vigo street together and through the dingy portals of the famous aristocratic rookery  at the end of a long drab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an electric switch  a number of lamps shining through tinted shades bathed the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance  standing in the doorway and glancing round me i had a general impression of extraordinary comfort and elegance combined with an atmosphere of masculine virility  everywhere there were mingled the luxury of the wealthy man of taste and the careless untidiness of the bachelor  rich furs and strange iridescent mats from some oriental bazaar were scattered upon the floor  pictures and prints which even my unpractised eyes could recognize as being of great price and rarity hung thick upon the walls  sketches of boxers of balletgirls and of racehorses alternated with a sensuous fragonard a martial girardet and a dreamy turner  but amid these varied ornaments there were scattered the trophies which brought back strongly to my recollection the fact that lord john roxton was one of the great allround sportsmen and athletes of his day  a darkblue oar crossed with a cherrypink one above his mantelpiece spoke of the old oxonian and leander man while the foils and boxinggloves above and below them were the tools of a man who had won supremacy with each  like a dado round the room was the jutting line of splendid heavy gameheads the best of their sort from every quarter of the world with the rare white rhinoceros of the lado enclave drooping its supercilious lip above them all  in the center of the rich red carpet was a black and gold louis quinze table a lovely antique now sacrilegiously desecrated with marks of glasses and the scars of cigarstumps  on it stood a silver tray of smokables and a burnished spiritstand from which and an adjacent siphon my silent host proceeded to charge two high glasses  having indicated an armchair to me and placed my refreshment near it he handed me a long smooth havana  then seating himself opposite to me he looked at me long and fixedly with his strange twinkling reckless eyeseyes of a cold light blue the color of a glacier lake  through the thin haze of my cigarsmoke i noted the details of a face which was already familiar to me from many photographsthe stronglycurved nose the hollow worn cheeks the dark ruddy hair thin at the top the crisp virile moustaches the small aggressive tuft upon his projecting chin  something there was of napoleon iii something of don quixote and yet again something which was the essence of the english country gentleman the keen alert openair lover of dogs and of horses  his skin was of a rich flowerpot red from sun and wind  his eyebrows were tufted and overhanging which gave those naturally cold eyes an almost ferocious aspect an impression which was increased by his strong and furrowed brow  in figure he was spare but very strongly builtindeed he had often proved that there were few men in england capable of such sustained exertions  his height was a little over six feet but he seemed shorter on account of a peculiar rounding of the shoulders  such was the famous lord john roxton as he sat opposite to me biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily in a long and embarrassing silence  well said he at last weve gone and done it young fellah my lad  this curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one wordyoungfellahmelad  yes weve taken a jump you an me  i suppose now when you went into that room there was no such notion in your headwhat  no thought of it  the same here  no thought of it  and here we are up to our necks in the tureen  why ive only been back three weeks from uganda and taken a place in scotland and signed the lease and all  pretty goins onwhat  how does it hit you  well it is all in the main line of my business  i am a journalist on the gazette  of courseyou said so when you took it on  by the way ive got a small job for you if youll help me  with pleasure  dont mind takin a risk do you  what is the risk  well its ballingerhes the risk  youve heard of him  no  why young fellah where have you lived  sir john ballinger is the best gentleman jock in the north country  i could hold him on the flat at my best but over jumps hes my master  well its an open secret that when hes out of trainin he drinks hardstrikin an average he calls it  he got delirium on toosday and has been ragin like a devil ever since  his room is above this  the doctors say that it is all up with the old dear unless some food is got into him but as he lies in bed with a revolver on his coverlet and swears he will put six of the best through anyone that comes near him theres been a bit of a strike among the servingmen  hes a hard nail is jack and a dead shot too but you cant leave a grand national winner to die like thatwhat  what do you mean to do then i asked  well my idea was that you and i could rush him  he may be dozin and at the worst he can only wing one of us and the other should have him  if we can get his bolstercover round his arms and then phone up a stomachpump well give the old dear the supper of his life  it was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into ones days work  i dont think that i am a particularly brave man  i have an irish imagination which makes the unknown and the untried more terrible than they are  on the other hand i was brought up with a horror of cowardice and with a terror of such a stigma  i dare say that i could throw myself over a precipice like the hun in the history books if my courage to do it were questioned and yet it would surely be pride and fear rather than courage which would be my inspiration  therefore although every nerve in my body shrank from the whiskymaddened figure which i pictured in the room above i still answered in as careless a voice as i could command that i was ready to go  some further remark of lord roxtons about the danger only made me irritable  talking wont make it any better said i come on  i rose from my chair and he from his  then with a little confidential chuckle of laughter he patted me two or three times on the chest finally pushing me back into my chair  all right sonny my ladyoull do said he  i looked up in surprise  i saw after jack ballinger myself this mornin  he blew a hole in the skirt of my kimono bless his shaky old hand but we got a jacket on him and hes to be all right in a week  i say young fellah i hope you dont mindwhat  you see between you an me closetiled i look on this south american business as a mighty serious thing and if i have a pal with me i want a man i can bank on  so i sized you down and im bound to say that you came well out of it  you see its all up to you and me for this old summerlee man will want drynursin from the first  by the way are you by any chance the malone who is expected to get his rugby cap for ireland  a reserve perhaps  i thought i remembered your face  why i was there when you got that try against richmondas fine a swervin run as i saw the whole season i never miss a rugby match if i can help it for it is the manliest game we have left  well i didnt ask you in here just to talk sport weve got to fix our business  here are the sailins on the first page of the times  theres a booth boat for para next wednesday week and if the professor and you can work it i think we should take itwhat  very good ill fix it with him  what about your outfit  my paper will see to that  can you shoot  about average territorial standard  good lord as bad as that  its the last thing you young fellahs think of learnin  youre all bees without stings so far as lookin after the hive goes  youll look silly some o these days when someone comes along an sneaks the honey  but youll need to hold your gun straight in south america for unless our friend the professor is a madman or a liar we may see some queer things before we get back what gun have you  he crossed to an oaken cupboard and as he threw it open i caught a glimpse of glistening rows of parallel barrels like the pipes of an organ  ill see what i can spare you out of my own battery said he  one by one he took out a succession of beautiful rifles opening and shutting them with a snap and a clang and then patting them as he put them back into the rack as tenderly as a mother would fondle her children  this is a blands 577 axite express said he  i got that big fellow with it  he glanced up at the white rhinoceros  ten more yards and hed would have added me to his collection           on that conical bullet his one chance hangs          tis the weak ones advantage fair  hope you know your gordon for hes the poet of the horse and the gun and the man that handles both  now heres a useful tool470 telescopic sight double ejector pointblank up to threefifty thats the rifle i used against the peruvian slavedrivers three years ago  i was the flail of the lord up in those parts i may tell you though you wont find it in any bluebook  there are times young fellah when every one of us must make a stand for human right and justice or you never feel clean again  thats why i made a little war on my own  declared it myself waged it myself ended it myself  each of those nicks is for a slave murderera good row of themwhat  that big one is for pedro lopez the king of them all that i killed in a backwater of the putomayo river  now heres something that would do for you  he took out a beautiful brownandsilver rifle  well rubbered at the stock sharply sighted five cartridges to the clip you can trust your life to that  he handed it to me and closed the door of his oak cabinet  by the way he continued coming back to his chair what do you know of this professor challenger  i never saw him till today  well neither did i  its funny we should both sail under sealed orders from a man we dont know  he seemed an uppish old bird  his brothers of science dont seem too fond of him either  how came you to take an interest in the affair  i told him shortly my experiences of the morning and he listened intently  then he drew out a map of south america and laid it on the table  i believe every single word he said to you was the truth said he earnestly and mind you i have something to go on when i speak like that  south america is a place i love and i think if you take it right through from darien to fuego its the grandest richest most wonderful bit of earth upon this planet  people dont know it yet and dont realize what it may become  ive been up an down it from end to end and had two dry seasons in those very parts as i told you when i spoke of the war i made on the slavedealers  well when i was up there i heard some yarns of the same kindtraditions of indians and the like but with somethin behind them no doubt  the more you knew of that country young fellah the more you would understand that anythin was possibleanythin  there are just some narrow waterlanes along which folk travel and outside that it is all darkness  now down here in the matto grandehe swept his cigar over a part of the mapor up in this corner where three countries meet nothin would surprise me  as that chap said tonight there are fiftythousand miles of waterway runnin through a forest that is very near the size of europe  you and i could be as far away from each other as scotland is from constantinople and yet each of us be in the same great brazilian forest  man has just made a track here and a scrape there in the maze  why the river rises and falls the best part of forty feet and half the country is a morass that you cant pass over  why shouldnt somethin new and wonderful lie in such a country and why shouldnt we be the men to find it out  besides he added his queer gaunt face shining with delight theres a sportin risk in every mile of it  im like an old golfballive had all the white paint knocked off me long ago  life can whack me about now and it cant leave a mark  but a sportin risk young fellah thats the salt of existence  then its worth livin again  were all gettin a deal too soft and dull and comfy  give me the great waste lands and the wide spaces with a gun in my fist and somethin to look for thats worth findin  ive tried war and steeplechasin and aeroplanes but this huntin of beasts that look like a lobstersupper dream is a brandnew sensation he chuckled with glee at the prospect  perhaps i have dwelt too long upon this new acquaintance but he is to be my comrade for many a day and so i have tried to set him down as i first saw him with his quaint personality and his queer little tricks of speech and of thought  it was only the need of getting in the account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company  i left him seated amid his pink radiance oiling the lock of his favorite rifle while he still chuckled to himself at the thought of the adventures which awaited us  it was very clear to me that if dangers lay before us i could not in all england have found a cooler head or a braver spirit with which to share them  that night wearied as i was after the wonderful happenings of the day i sat late with mcardle the news editor explaining to him the whole situation which he thought important enough to bring next morning before the notice of sir george beaumont the chief  it was agreed that i should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of successive letters to mcardle and that these should either be edited for the gazette as they arrived or held back to be published later according to the wishes of professor challenger since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land  in response to a telephone inquiry we received nothing more definite than a fulmination against the press ending up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would hand us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the moment of starting  a second question from us failed to elicit any answer at all save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband was in a very violent temper already and that she hoped we would do nothing to make it worse  a third attempt later in the day provoked a terrific crash and a subsequent message from the central exchange that professor challengers receiver had been shattered after that we abandoned all attempt at communication  and now my patient readers i can address you directly no longer  from now onwards if indeed any continuation of this narrative should ever reach you it can only be through the paper which i represent  in the hands of the editor i leave this account of the events which have led up to one of the most remarkable expeditions of all time so that if i never return to england there shall be some record as to how the affair came about  i am writing these last lines in the saloon of the booth liner francisca and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of mr mcardle  let me draw one last picture before i close the notebooka picture which is the last memory of the old country which i bear away with me  it is a wet foggy morning in the late spring a thin cold rain is falling  three shining mackintoshed figures are walking down the quay making for the gangplank of the great liner from which the bluepeter is flying  in front of them a porter pushes a trolley piled high with trunks wraps and guncases  professor summerlee a long melancholy figure walks with dragging steps and drooping head as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself lord john roxton steps briskly and his thin eager face beams forth between his huntingcap and his muffler  as for myself i am glad to have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leavetaking behind me and i have no doubt that i show it in my bearing  suddenly just as we reach the vessel there is a shout behind us  it is professor challenger who had promised to see us off  he runs after us a puffing redfaced irascible figure  no thank you says he i should much prefer not to go aboard  i have only a few words to say to you and they can very well be said where we are  i beg you not to imagine that i am in any way indebted to you for making this journey  i would have you to understand that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me and i refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation  truth is truth and nothing which you can report can affect it in any way though it may excite the emotions and allay the curiosity of a number of very ineffectual people  my directions for your instruction and guidance are in this sealed envelope  you will open it when you reach a town upon the amazon which is called manaos but not until the date and hour which is marked upon the outside  have i made myself clear  i leave the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor  no mr malone i will place no restriction upon your correspondence since the ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey but i demand that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination and that nothing be actually published until your return  goodbye sir you have done something to mitigate my feelings for the loathsome profession to which you unhappily belong  goodbye lord john science is as i understand a sealed book to you but you may congratulate yourself upon the huntingfield which awaits you  you will no doubt have the opportunity of describing in the field how you brought down the rocketing dimorphodon  and goodbye to you also professor summerlee  if you are still capable of selfimprovement of which i am frankly unconvinced you will surely return to london a wiser man  so he turned upon his heel and a minute later from the deck i could see his short squat figure bobbing about in the distance as he made his way back to his train  well we are well down channel now theres the last bell for letters and its goodbye to the pilot well be down hulldown on the old trail from now on  god bless all we leave behind us and send us safely back                                chapter vii              tomorrow we disappear into the unknown  i will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the booth liner nor will i tell of our weeks stay at para save that i should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the pereira da pinta company in helping us to get together our equipment  i will also allude very briefly to our river journey up a wide slowmoving claytinted stream in a steamer which was little smaller than that which had carried us across the atlantic eventually we found ourselves through the narrows of obidos and reached the town of manaos  here we were rescued from the limited attractions of the local inn by mr shortman the representative of the british and brazilian trading company  in his hospital fazenda we spent our time until the day when we were empowered to open the letter of instructions given to us by professor challenger  before i reach the surprising events of that date i would desire to give a clearer sketch of my comrades in this enterprise and of the associates whom we had already gathered together in south america  i speak freely and i leave the use of my material to your own discretion mr mcardle since it is through your hands that this report must pass before it reaches the world  the scientific attainments of professor summerlee are too well known for me to trouble to recapitulate them  he is better equipped for a rough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight his tall gaunt stringy figure is insensible to fatigue and his dry halfsarcastic and often wholly unsympathetic manner is uninfluenced by any change in his surroundings  though in his sixtysixth year i have never heard him express any dissatisfaction at the occasional hardships which we have had to encounter  i had regarded his presence as an encumbrance to the expedition but as a matter of fact i am now well convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own  in temper he is naturally acid and sceptical  from the beginning he has never concealed his belief that professor challenger is an absolute fraud that we are all embarked upon an absurd wildgoose chase and that we are likely to reap nothing but disappointment and danger in south america and corresponding ridicule in england  such are the views which with much passionate distortion of his thin features and wagging of his thin goatlike beard he poured into our ears all the way from southampton to manaos  since landing from the boat he has obtained some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and bird life around him for he is absolutely wholehearted in his devotion to science  he spends his days flitting through the woods with his shotgun and his butterflynet and his evenings in mounting the many specimens he has acquired  among his minor peculiarities are that he is careless as to his attire unclean in his person exceedingly absentminded in his habits and addicted to smoking a short briar pipe which is seldom out of his mouth  he has been upon several scientific expeditions in his youth he was with robertson in papua and the life of the camp and the canoe is nothing fresh to him  lord john roxton has some points in common with professor summerlee and others in which they are the very antithesis to each other  he is twenty years younger but has something of the same spare scraggy physique  as to his appearance i have as i recollect described it in that portion of my narrative which i have left behind me in london he is exceedingly neat and prim in his ways dresses always with great care in white drill suits and high brown mosquitoboots and shaves at least once a day  like most men of action he is laconic in speech and sinks readily into his own thoughts but he is always quick to answer a question or join in a conversation talking in a queer jerky halfhumorous fashion  his knowledge of the world and very especially of south america is surprising and he has a wholehearted belief in the possibilities of our journey which is not to be dashed by the sneers of professor summerlee  he has a gentle voice and a quiet manner but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution the more dangerous because they are held in leash  he spoke little of his own exploits in brazil and peru but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which was caused by his presence among the riverine natives who looked upon him as their champion and protector  the exploits of the red chief as they called him had become legends among them but the real facts as far as i could learn them were amazing enough  these were that lord john had found himself some years before in that nomansland which is formed by the halfdefined frontiers between peru brazil and columbia  in this great district the wild rubber tree flourishes and has become as in the congo a curse to the natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the spaniards upon the old silver mines of darien  a handful of villainous halfbreeds dominated the country armed such indians as would support them and turned the rest into slaves terrorizing them with the most inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the indiarubber which was then floated down the river to para  lord john roxton expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims and received nothing but threats and insults for his pains  he then formally declared war against pedro lopez the leader of the slavedrivers enrolled a band of runaway slaves in his service armed them and conducted a campaign which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious halfbreed and breaking down the system which he represented  no wonder that the gingerheaded man with the silky voice and the free and easy manners was now looked upon with deep interest upon the banks of the great south american river though the feelings he inspired were naturally mixed since the gratitude of the natives was equaled by the resentment of those who desired to exploit them  one useful result of his former experiences was that he could talk fluently in the lingoa geral which is the peculiar talk onethird portuguese and twothirds indian which is current all over brazil  i have said before that lord john roxton was a south americomaniac  he could not speak of that great country without ardor and this ardor was infectious for ignorant as i was he fixed my attention and stimulated my curiosity  how i wish i could reproduce the glamour of his discourses the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy imagination which gave them their fascination until even the professors cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his thin face as he listened  he would tell the history of the mighty river so rapidly explored for some of the first conquerors of peru actually crossed the entire continent upon its waters and yet so unknown in regard to all that lay behind its everchanging banks  what is there he would cry pointing to the north  wood and marsh and unpenetrated jungle  who knows what it may shelter  and there to the south  a wilderness of swampy forest where no white man has ever been  the unknown is up against us on every side  outside the narrow lines of the rivers what does anyone know  who will say what is possible in such a country  why should old man challenger not be right  at which direct defiance the stubborn sneer would reappear upon professor summerlees face and he would sit shaking his sardonic head in unsympathetic silence behind the cloud of his briarroot pipe   so much for the moment for my two white companions whose characters and limitations will be further exposed as surely as my own as this narrative proceeds  but already we have enrolled certain retainers who may play no small part in what is to come  the first is a gigantic negro named zambo who is a black hercules as willing as any horse and about as intelligent  him we enlisted at para on the recommendation of the steamship company on whose vessels he had learned to speak a halting english  it was at para also that we engaged gomez and manuel two halfbreeds from up the river just come down with a cargo of redwood  they were swarthy fellows bearded and fierce as active and wiry as panthers both of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the amazon which we were about to explore and it was this recommendation which had caused lord john to engage them  one of them gomez had the further advantage that he could speak excellent english  these men were willing to act as our personal servants to cook to row or to make themselves useful in any way at a payment of fifteen dollars a month  besides these we had engaged three mojo indians from bolivia who are the most skilful at fishing and boat work of all the river tribes  the chief of these we called mojo after his tribe and the others are known as jose and fernando  three white men then two halfbreeds one negro and three indians made up the personnel of the little expedition which lay waiting for its instructions at manaos before starting upon its singular quest  at last after a weary week the day had come and the hour  i ask you to picture the shaded sittingroom of the fazenda st  ignatio two miles inland from the town of manaos  outside lay the yellow brassy glare of the sunshine with the shadows of the palm trees as black and definite as the trees themselves  the air was calm full of the eternal hum of insects a tropical chorus of many octaves from the deep drone of the bee to the high keen pipe of the mosquito  beyond the veranda was a small cleared garden bounded with cactus hedges and adorned with clumps of flowering shrubs round which the great blue butterflies and the tiny hummingbirds fluttered and darted in crescents of sparkling light  within we were seated round the cane table on which lay a sealed envelope  inscribed upon it in the jagged handwriting of professor challenger were the words   instructions to lord john roxton and party  to be opened at manaos upon july 15th at 12 oclock precisely   lord john had placed his watch upon the table beside him  we have seven more minutes said he  the old dear is very precise  professor summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in his gaunt hand  what can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven minutes said he  it is all part and parcel of the same system of quackery and nonsense for which i regret to say that the writer is notorious  oh come we must play the game accordin to rules said lord john its old man challengers show and we are here by his good will so it would be rotten bad form if we didnt follow his instructions to the letter  a pretty business it is cried the professor bitterly  it struck me as preposterous in london but im bound to say that it seems even more so upon closer acquaintance  i dont know what is inside this envelope but unless it is something pretty definite i shall be much tempted to take the next downriver boat and catch the bolivia at para after all i have some more responsible work in the world than to run about disproving the assertions of a lunatic  now roxton surely it is time  time it is said lord john  you can blow the whistle he took up the envelope and cut it with his penknife  from it he drew a folded sheet of paper  this he carefully opened out and flattened on the table  it was a blank sheet  he turned it over  again it was blank we looked at each other in a bewildered silence which was broken by a discordant burst of derisive laughter from professor summerlee  it is an open admission he cried  what more do you want  the fellow is a selfconfessed humbug  we have only to return home and report him as the brazen imposter that he is  invisible ink i suggested  i dont think said lord roxton holding the paper to the light no young fellah my lad there is no use deceiving yourself  ill go bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper  may i come in boomed a voice from the veranda  the shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight that voice  that monstrous breadth of shoulder  we sprang to our feet with a gasp of astonishment as challenger in a round boyish strawhat with a colored ribbonchallenger with his hands in his jacketpockets and his canvas shoes daintily pointing as he walkedappeared in the open space before us  he threw back his head and there he stood in the golden glow with all his old assyrian luxuriance of beard all his native insolence of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes  i fear said he taking out his watch that i am a few minutes too late  when i gave you this envelope i must confess that i had never intended that you should open it for it had been my fixed intention to be with you before the hour  the unfortunate delay can be apportioned between a blundering pilot and an intrusive sandbank  i fear that it has given my colleague professor summerlee occasion to blaspheme  i am bound to say sir said lord john with some sternness of voice that your turning up is a considerable relief to us for our mission seemed to have come to a premature end  even now i cant for the life of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a manner  instead of answering professor challenger entered shook hands with myself and lord john bowed with ponderous insolence to professor summerlee and sank back into a basketchair which creaked and swayed beneath his weight  is all ready for your journey he asked  we can start tomorrow  then so you shall  you need no chart of directions now since you will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance  from the first i had determined that i would myself preside over your investigation the most elaborate charts would as you will readily admit be a poor substitute for my own intelligence and advice  as to the small ruse which i played upon you in the matter of the envelope it is clear that had i told you all my intentions i should have been forced to resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you  not from me sir exclaimed professor summerlee heartily  so long as there was another ship upon the atlantic  challenger waved him away with his great hairy hand  your common sense will i am sure sustain my objection and realize that it was better that i should direct my own movements and appear only at the exact moment when my presence was needed  that moment has now arrived  you are in safe hands  you will not now fail to reach your destination  from henceforth i take command of this expedition and i must ask you to complete your preparations tonight so that we may be able to make an early start in the morning  my time is of value and the same thing may be said no doubt in a lesser degree of your own  i propose therefore that we push on as rapidly as possible until i have demonstrated what you have come to see  lord john roxton has chartered a large steam launch the esmeralda which was to carry us up the river  so far as climate goes it was immaterial what time we chose for our expedition as the temperature ranges from seventyfive to ninety degrees both summer and winter with no appreciable difference in heat  in moisture however it is otherwise from december to may is the period of the rains and during this time the river slowly rises until it attains a height of nearly forty feet above its lowwater mark  it floods the banks extends in great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country and forms a huge district called locally the gapo which is for the most part too marshy for foottravel and too shallow for boating  about june the waters begin to fall and are at their lowest at october or november thus our expedition was at the time of the dry season when the great river and its tributaries were more or less in a normal condition  the current of the river is a slight one the drop being not greater than eight inches in a mile  no stream could be more convenient for navigation since the prevailing wind is southeast and sailing boats may make a continuous progress to the peruvian frontier dropping down again with the current  in our own case the excellent engines of the esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream and we made as rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake  for three days we steamed northwestwards up a stream which even here a thousand miles from its mouth was still so enormous that from its center the two banks were mere shadows upon the distant skyline  on the fourth day after leaving manaos we turned into a tributary which at its mouth was little smaller than the main stream  it narrowed rapidly however and after two more days steaming we reached an indian village where the professor insisted that we should land and that the esmeralda should be sent back to manaos  we should soon come upon rapids he explained which would make its further use impossible  he added privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would be  to this end also he made each of us give our word of honor that we would publish or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the whereabouts of our travels while the servants were all solemnly sworn to the same effect  it is for this reason that i am compelled to be vague in my narrative and i would warn my readers that in any map or diagram which i may give the relation of places to each other may be correct but the points of the compass are carefully confused so that in no way can it be taken as an actual guide to the country  professor challengers reasons for secrecy may be valid or not but we had no choice but to adopt them for he was prepared to abandon the whole expedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide us  it was august 2nd when we snapped our last link with the outer world by bidding farewell to the esmeralda  since then four days have passed during which we have engaged two large canoes from the indians made of so light a material skins over a bamboo framework that we should be able to carry them round any obstacle  these we have loaded with all our effects and have engaged two additional indians to help us in the navigation  i understand that they are the very twoataca and ipetu by namewho accompanied professor challenger upon his previous journey  they appeared to be terrified at the prospect of repeating it but the chief has patriarchal powers in these countries and if the bargain is good in his eyes the clansman has little choice in the matter  so tomorrow we disappear into the unknown  this account i am transmitting down the river by canoe and it may be our last word to those who are interested in our fate  i have according to our arrangement addressed it to you my dear mr mcardle and i leave it to your discretion to delete alter or do what you like with it  from the assurance of professor challengers mannerand in spite of the continued scepticism of professor summerleei have no doubt that our leader will make good his statement and that we are really on the eve of some most remarkable experiences                                chapter viii               the outlying pickets of the new world  our friends at home may well rejoice with us for we are at our goal and up to a point at least we have shown that the statement of professor challenger can be verified  we have not it is true ascended the plateau but it lies before us and even professor summerlee is in a more chastened mood  not that he will for an instant admit that his rival could be right but he is less persistent in his incessant objections and has sunk for the most part into an observant silence  i must hark back however and continue my narrative from where i dropped it  we are sending home one of our local indians who is injured and i am committing this letter to his charge with considerable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand  when i wrote last we were about to leave the indian village where we had been deposited by the esmeralda  i have to begin my report by bad news for the first serious personal trouble i pass over the incessant bickerings between the professors occurred this evening and might have had a tragic ending  i have spoken of our englishspeaking halfbreed gomeza fine worker and a willing fellow but afflicted i fancy with the vice of curiosity which is common enough among such men  on the last evening he seems to have hid himself near the hut in which we were discussing our plans and being observed by our huge negro zambo who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all his race bear to the halfbreeds he was dragged out and carried into our presence  gomez whipped out his knife however and but for the huge strength of his captor which enabled him to disarm him with one hand he would certainly have stabbed him  the matter has ended in reprimands the opponents have been compelled to shake hands and there is every hope that all will be well  as to the feuds of the two learned men they are continuous and bitter  it must be admitted that challenger is provocative in the last degree but summerlee has an acid tongue which makes matters worse  last night challenger said that he never cared to walk on the thames embankment and look up the river as it was always sad to see ones own eventual goal  he is convinced of course that he is destined for westminster abbey  summerlee rejoined however with a sour smile by saying that he understood that millbank prison had been pulled down  challengers conceit is too colossal to allow him to be really annoyed  he only smiled in his beard and repeated really  really in the pitying tone one would use to a child  indeed they are children boththe one wizened and cantankerous the other formidable and overbearing yet each with a brain which has put him in the front rank of his scientific age brain character soulonly as one sees more of life does one understand how distinct is each  the very next day we did actually make our start upon this remarkable expedition  we found that all our possessions fitted very easily into the two canoes and we divided our personnel six in each taking the obvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one professor into each canoe  personally i was with challenger who was in a beatific humor moving about as one in a silent ecstasy and beaming benevolence from every feature  i have had some experience of him in other moods however and shall be the less surprised when the thunderstorms suddenly come up amidst the sunshine  if it is impossible to be at your ease it is equally impossible to be dull in his company for one is always in a state of halftremulous doubt as to what sudden turn his formidable temper may take  for two days we made our way up a goodsized river some hundreds of yards broad and dark in color but transparent so that one could usually see the bottom  the affluents of the amazon are half of them of this nature while the other half are whitish and opaque the difference depending upon the class of country through which they have flowed  the dark indicate vegetable decay while the others point to clayey soil  twice we came across rapids and in each case made a portage of half a mile or so to avoid them  the woods on either side were primeval which are more easily penetrated than woods of the second growth and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes through them  how shall i ever forget the solemn mystery of it  the height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything which i in my townbred life could have imagined shooting upwards in magnificent columns until at an enormous distance above our heads we could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their sidebranches into gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof of verdure through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the majestic obscurity  as we walked noiselessly amid the thick soft carpet of decaying vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes upon us in the twilight of the abbey and even professor challengers fullchested notes sank into a whisper  alone i should have been ignorant of the names of these giant growths but our men of science pointed out the cedars the great silk cotton trees and the redwood trees with all that profusion of various plants which has made this continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gifts of nature which depend upon the vegetable world while it is the most backward in those products which come from animal life  vivid orchids and wonderful colored lichens smoldered upon the swarthy treetrunks and where a wandering shaft of light fell full upon the golden allamanda the scarlet starclusters of the tacsonia or the rich deep blue of ipomaea the effect was as a dream of fairyland  in these great wastes of forest life which abhors darkness struggles ever upwards to the light  every plant even the smaller ones curls and writhes to the green surface twining itself round its stronger and taller brethren in the effort  climbing plants are monstrous and luxuriant but others which have never been known to climb elsewhere learn the art as an escape from that somber shadow so that the common nettle the jasmine and even the jacitara palm tree can be seen circling the stems of the cedars and striving to reach their crowns  of animal life there was no movement amid the majestic vaulted aisles which stretched from us as we walked but a constant movement far above our heads told of that multitudinous world of snake and monkey bird and sloth which lived in the sunshine and looked down in wonder at our tiny dark stumbling figures in the obscure depths immeasurably below them  at dawn and at sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke into shrill chatter but during the hot hours of the day only the full drone of insects like the beat of a distant surf filled the ear while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks fading away into the darkness which held us in  once some bandylegged lurching creature an anteater or a bear scuttled clumsily amid the shadows  it was the only sign of earth life which i saw in this great amazonian forest  and yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far from us in those mysterious recesses  on the third day out we were aware of a singular deep throbbing in the air rhythmic and solemn coming and going fitfully throughout the morning  the two boats were paddling within a few yards of each other when first we heard it and our indians remained motionless as if they had been turned to bronze listening intently with expressions of terror upon their faces  what is it then i asked  drums said lord john carelessly war drums  i have heard them before  yes sir war drums said gomez the halfbreed  wild indians bravos not mansos they watch us every mile of the way kill us if they can  how can they watch us i asked gazing into the dark motionless void  the halfbreed shrugged his broad shoulders  the indians know  they have their own way  they watch us  they talk the drum talk to each other  kill us if they can  by the afternoon of that daymy pocket diary shows me that it was tuesday august 18that least six or seven drums were throbbing from various points  sometimes they beat quickly sometimes slowly sometimes in obvious question and answer one far to the east breaking out in a high staccato rattle and being followed after a pause by a deep roll from the north  there was something indescribably nerveshaking and menacing in that constant mutter which seemed to shape itself into the very syllables of the halfbreed endlessly repeated we will kill you if we can  we will kill you if we can no one ever moved in the silent woods  all the peace and soothing of quiet nature lay in that dark curtain of vegetation but away from behind there came ever the one message from our fellowman  we will kill you if we can said the men in the east  we will kill you if we can said the men in the north  all day the drums rumbled and whispered while their menace reflected itself in the faces of our colored companions  even the hardy swaggering halfbreed seemed cowed  i learned however that day once for all that both summerlee and challenger possessed that highest type of bravery the bravery of the scientific mind  theirs was the spirit which upheld darwin among the gauchos of the argentine or wallace among the headhunters of malaya  it is decreed by a merciful nature that the human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously so that if it be steeped in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely personal considerations  all day amid that incessant and mysterious menace our two professors watched every bird upon the wing and every shrub upon the bank with many a sharp wordy contention when the snarl of summerlee came quick upon the deep growl of challenger but with no more sense of danger and no more reference to drumbeating indians than if they were seated together in the smokingroom of the royal societys club in st  jamess street  once only did they condescend to discuss them  miranha or amajuaca cannibals said challenger jerking his thumb towards the reverberating wood  no doubt sir summerlee answered  like all such tribes i shall expect to find them of polysynthetic speech and of mongolian type  polysynthetic certainly said challenger indulgently  i am not aware that any other type of language exists in this continent and i have notes of more than a hundred  the mongolian theory i regard with deep suspicion  i should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative anatomy would have helped to verify it said summerlee bitterly  challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he was all beard and hatrim  no doubt sir a limited knowledge would have that effect when ones knowledge is exhaustive one comes to other conclusions they glared at each other in mutual defiance while all round rose the distant whisper we will kill youwe will kill you if we can  that night we moored our canoes with heavy stones for anchors in the center of the stream and made every preparation for a possible attack nothing came however and with the dawn we pushed upon our way the drumbeating dying out behind us  about three oclock in the afternoon we came to a very steep rapid more than a mile longthe very one in which professor challenger had suffered disaster upon his first journey  i confess that the sight of it consoled me for it was really the first direct corroboration slight as it was of the truth of his story  the indians carried first our canoes and then our stores through the brushwood which is very thick at this point while we four whites our rifles on our shoulders walked between them and any danger coming from the woods  before evening we had successfully passed the rapids and made our way some ten miles above them where we anchored for the night  at this point i reckoned that we had come not less than a hundred miles up the tributary from the main stream  it was in the early forenoon of the next day that we made the great departure  since dawn professor challenger had been acutely uneasy continually scanning each bank of the river  suddenly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction and pointed to a single tree which projected at a peculiar angle over the side of the stream  what do you make of that he asked  it is surely an assai palm said summerlee  exactly  it was an assai palm which i took for my landmark  the secret opening is half a mile onwards upon the other side of the river there is no break in the trees  that is the wonder and the mystery of it  there where you see lightgreen rushes instead of darkgreen undergrowth there between the great cotton woods that is my private gate into the unknown  push through and you will understand  it was indeed a wonderful place  having reached the spot marked by a line of lightgreen rushes we poled out two canoes through them for some hundreds of yards and eventually emerged into a placid and shallow stream running clear and transparent over a sandy bottom  it may have been twenty yards across and was banked in on each side by most luxuriant vegetation  no one who had not observed that for a short distance reeds had taken the place of shrubs could possibly have guessed the existence of such a stream or dreamed of the fairyland beyond  for a fairyland it wasthe most wonderful that the imagination of man could conceive  the thick vegetation met overhead interlacing into a natural pergola and through this tunnel of verdure in a golden twilight flowed the green pellucid river beautiful in itself but marvelous from the strange tints thrown by the vivid light from above filtered and tempered in its fall  clear as crystal motionless as a sheet of glass green as the edge of an iceberg it stretched in front of us under its leafy archway every stroke of our paddles sending a thousand ripples across its shining surface  it was a fitting avenue to a land of wonders  all sign of the indians had passed away but animal life was more frequent and the tameness of the creatures showed that they knew nothing of the hunter  fuzzy little blackvelvet monkeys with snowwhite teeth and gleaming mocking eyes chattered at us as we passed  with a dull heavy splash an occasional cayman plunged in from the bank  once a dark clumsy tapir stared at us from a gap in the bushes and then lumbered away through the forest once too the yellow sinuous form of a great puma whisked amid the brushwood and its green baleful eyes glared hatred at us over its tawny shoulder  bird life was abundant especially the wading birds stork heron and ibis gathering in little groups blue scarlet and white upon every log which jutted from the bank while beneath us the crystal water was alive with fish of every shape and color  for three days we made our way up this tunnel of hazy green sunshine on the longer stretches one could hardly tell as one looked ahead where the distant green water ended and the distant green archway began  the deep peace of this strange waterway was unbroken by any sign of man  no indian here  too much afraid  curupuri said gomez  curupuri is the spirit of the woods lord john explained  its a name for any kind of devil  the poor beggars think that there is something fearsome in this direction and therefore they avoid it  on the third day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could not last much longer for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow twice in as many hours we stuck upon the bottom  finally we pulled the boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the river  in the morning lord john and i made our way for a couple of miles through the forest keeping parallel with the stream but as it grew ever shallower we returned and reported what professor challenger had already suspected that we had reached the highest point to which the canoes could be brought  we drew them up therefore and concealed them among the bushes blazing a tree with our axes so that we should find them again  then we distributed the various burdens among usguns ammunition food a tent blankets and the restand shouldering our packages we set forth upon the more laborious stage of our journey  an unfortunate quarrel between our pepperpots marked the outset of our new stage  challenger had from the moment of joining us issued directions to the whole party much to the evident discontent of summerlee  now upon his assigning some duty to his fellowprofessor it was only the carrying of an aneroid barometer the matter suddenly came to a head  may i ask sir said summerlee with vicious calm in what capacity you take it upon yourself to issue these orders  challenger glared and bristled  i do it professor summerlee as leader of this expedition  i am compelled to tell you sir that i do not recognize you in that capacity  indeed challenger bowed with unwieldy sarcasm  perhaps you would define my exact position  yes sir  you are a man whose veracity is upon trial and this committee is here to try it  you walk sir with your judges  dear me said challenger seating himself on the side of one of the canoes  in that case you will of course go on your way and i will follow at my leisure  if i am not the leader you cannot expect me to lead  thank heaven that there were two sane menlord john roxton and myselfto prevent the petulance and folly of our learned professors from sending us back emptyhanded to london  such arguing and pleading and explaining before we could get them mollified  then at last summerlee with his sneer and his pipe would move forwards and challenger would come rolling and grumbling after  by some good fortune we discovered about this time that both our savants had the very poorest opinion of dr illingworth of edinburgh  thenceforward that was our one safety and every strained situation was relieved by our introducing the name of the scotch zoologist when both our professors would form a temporary alliance and friendship in their detestation and abuse of this common rival  advancing in single file along the bank of the stream we soon found that it narrowed down to a mere brook and finally that it lost itself in a great green morass of spongelike mosses into which we sank up to our knees  the place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and every form of flying pest so we were glad to find solid ground again and to make a circuit among the trees which enabled us to outflank this pestilent morass which droned like an organ in the distance so loud was it with insect life  on the second day after leaving our canoes we found that the whole character of the country changed  our road was persistently upwards and as we ascended the woods became thinner and lost their tropical luxuriance  the huge trees of the alluvial amazonian plain gave place to the phoenix and coco palms growing in scattered clumps with thick brushwood between  in the damper hollows the mauritia palms threw out their graceful drooping fronds  we traveled entirely by compass and once or twice there were differences of opinion between challenger and the two indians when to quote the professors indignant words the whole party agreed to trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped savages rather than the highest product of modern european culture that we were justified in doing so was shown upon the third day when challenger admitted that he recognized several landmarks of his former journey and in one spot we actually came upon four fireblackened stones which must have marked a campingplace  the road still ascended and we crossed a rockstudded slope which took two days to traverse  the vegetation had again changed and only the vegetable ivory tree remained with a great profusion of wonderful orchids among which i learned to recognize the rare nuttonia vexillaria and the glorious pink and scarlet blossoms of cattleya and odontoglossum  occasional brooks with pebbly bottoms and ferndraped banks gurgled down the shallow gorges in the hill and offered good campinggrounds every evening on the banks of some rockstudded pool where swarms of little bluebacked fish about the size and shape of english trout gave us a delicious supper  on the ninth day after leaving the canoes having done as i reckon about a hundred and twenty miles we began to emerge from the trees which had grown smaller until they were mere shrubs  their place was taken by an immense wilderness of bamboo which grew so thickly that we could only penetrate it by cutting a pathway with the machetes and billhooks of the indians  it took us a long day traveling from seven in the morning till eight at night with only two breaks of one hour each to get through this obstacle  anything more monotonous and wearying could not be imagined for even at the most open places i could not see more than ten or twelve yards while usually my vision was limited to the back of lord johns cotton jacket in front of me and to the yellow wall within a foot of me on either side  from above came one thin knifeedge of sunshine and fifteen feet over our heads one saw the tops of the reeds swaying against the deep blue sky  i do not know what kind of creatures inhabit such a thicket but several times we heard the plunging of large heavy animals quite close to us from their sounds lord john judged them to be some form of wild cattle just as night fell we cleared the belt of bamboos and at once formed our camp exhausted by the interminable day  early next morning we were again afoot and found that the character of the country had changed once again  behind us was the wall of bamboo as definite as if it marked the course of a river  in front was an open plain sloping slightly upwards and dotted with clumps of treeferns the whole curving before us until it ended in a long whalebacked ridge  this we reached about midday only to find a shallow valley beyond rising once again into a gentle incline which led to a low rounded skyline  it was here while we crossed the first of these hills that an incident occurred which may or may not have been important  professor challenger who with the two local indians was in the van of the party stopped suddenly and pointed excitedly to the right  as he did so we saw at the distance of a mile or so something which appeared to be a huge gray bird flap slowly up from the ground and skim smoothly off flying very low and straight until it was lost among the treeferns  did you see it cried challenger in exultation  summerlee did you see it  his colleague was staring at the spot where the creature had disappeared  what do you claim that it was he asked  to the best of my belief a pterodactyl  summerlee burst into derisive laughter a pterfiddlestick said he it was a stork if ever i saw one  challenger was too furious to speak  he simply swung his pack upon his back and continued upon his march  lord john came abreast of me however and his face was more grave than was his wont  he had his zeiss glasses in his hand  i focused it before it got over the trees said he i wont undertake to say what it was but ill risk my reputation as a sportsman that it wasnt any bird that ever i clapped eyes on in my life  so there the matter stands  are we really just at the edge of the unknown encountering the outlying pickets of this lost world of which our leader speaks  i give you the incident as it occurred and you will know as much as i do  it stands alone for we saw nothing more which could be called remarkable  and now my readers if ever i have any i have brought you up the broad river and through the screen of rushes and down the green tunnel and up the long slope of palm trees and through the bamboo brake and across the plain of treeferns  at last our destination lay in full sight of us  when we had crossed the second ridge we saw before us an irregular palmstudded plain and then the line of high red cliffs which i have seen in the picture  there it lies even as i write and there can be no question that it is the same  at the nearest point it is about seven miles from our present camp and it curves away stretching as far as i can see  challenger struts about like a prize peacock and summerlee is silent but still sceptical another day should bring some of our doubts to an end  meanwhile as jose whose arm was pierced by a broken bamboo insists upon returning i send this letter back in his charge and only hope that it may eventually come to hand  i will write again as the occasion serves  i have enclosed with this a rough chart of our journey which may have the effect of making the account rather easier to understand                                 chapter ix                    who could have foreseen it  a dreadful thing has happened to us  who could have foreseen it  i cannot foresee any end to our troubles  it may be that we are condemned to spend our whole lives in this strange inaccessible place i am still so confused that i can hardly think clearly of the facts of the present or of the chances of the future  to my astounded senses the one seems most terrible and the other as black as night  no men have ever found themselves in a worse position nor is there any use in disclosing to you our exact geographical situation and asking our friends for a relief party  even if they could send one our fate will in all human probability be decided long before it could arrive in south america  we are in truth as far from any human aid as if we were in the moon if we are to win through it is only our own qualities which can save us  i have as companions three remarkable men men of great brainpower and of unshaken courage  there lies our one and only hope it is only when i look upon the untroubled faces of my comrades that i see some glimmer through the darkness  outwardly i trust that i appear as unconcerned as they  inwardly i am filled with apprehension  let me give you with as much detail as i can the sequence of events which have led us to this catastrophe  when i finished my last letter i stated that we were within seven miles from an enormous line of ruddy cliffs which encircled beyond all doubt the plateau of which professor challenger spoke  their height as we approached them seemed to me in some places to be greater than he had statedrunning up in parts to at least a thousand feetand they were curiously striated in a manner which is i believe characteristic of basaltic upheavals  something of the sort is to be seen in salisbury crags at edinburgh  the summit showed every sign of a luxuriant vegetation with bushes near the edge and farther back many high trees  there was no indication of any life that we could see  that night we pitched our camp immediately under the cliffa most wild and desolate spot  the crags above us were not merely perpendicular but curved outwards at the top so that ascent was out of the question close to us was the high thin pinnacle of rock which i believe i mentioned earlier in this narrative  it is like a broad red church spire the top of it being level with the plateau but a great chasm gaping between  on the summit of it there grew one high tree  both pinnacle and cliff were comparatively lowsome five or six hundred feet i should think  it was on that said professor challenger pointing to this tree that the pterodactyl was perched  i climbed halfway up the rock before i shot him  i am inclined to think that a good mountaineer like myself could ascend the rock to the top though he would of course be no nearer to the plateau when he had done so  as challenger spoke of his pterodactyl i glanced at professor summerlee and for the first time i seemed to see some signs of a dawning credulity and repentance  there was no sneer upon his thin lips but on the contrary a gray drawn look of excitement and amazement  challenger saw it too and reveled in the first taste of victory  of course said he  with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm professor summerlee will understand that when i speak of a pterodactyl i mean a storkonly it is the kind of stork which has no feathers a leathery skin membranous wings and teeth in its jaws  he grinned and blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away  in the morning after a frugal breakfast of coffee and maniocwe had to be economical of our storeswe held a council of war as to the best method of ascending to the plateau above us  challenger presided with a solemnity as if he were the lord chief justice on the bench  picture him seated upon a rock his absurd boyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head his supercilious eyes dominating us from under his drooping lids his great black beard wagging as he slowly defined our present situation and our future movements  beneath him you might have seen the three of usmyself sunburnt young and vigorous after our openair tramp summerlee solemn but still critical behind his eternal pipe lord john as keen as a razoredge with his supple alert figure leaning upon his rifle and his eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the speaker  behind us were grouped the two swarthy halfbreeds and the little knot of indians while in front and above us towered those huge ruddy ribs of rocks which kept us from our goal  i need not say said our leader that on the occasion of my last visit i exhausted every means of climbing the cliff and where i failed i do not think that anyone else is likely to succeed for i am something of a mountaineer  i had none of the appliances of a rockclimber with me but i have taken the precaution to bring them now  with their aid i am positive i could climb that detached pinnacle to the summit but so long as the main cliff overhangs it is vain to attempt ascending that  i was hurried upon my last visit by the approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies these considerations limited my time and i can only claim that i have surveyed about six miles of the cliff to the east of us finding no possible way up  what then shall we now do  there seems to be only one reasonable course said professor summerlee  if you have explored the east we should travel along the base of the cliff to the west and seek for a practicable point for our ascent  thats it said lord john  the odds are that this plateau is of no great size and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy way up it or come back to the point from which we started  i have already explained to our young friend here said challenger he has a way of alluding to me as if i were a school child ten years old that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival  yet i admit that there may very well be places where an expert human climber may reach the summit and yet a cumbrous and heavy animal be unable to descend  it is certain that there is a point where an ascent is possible  how do you know that sir asked summerlee sharply  because my predecessor the american maple white actually made such an ascent  how otherwise could he have seen the monster which he sketched in his notebook  there you reason somewhat ahead of the proved facts said the stubborn summerlee  i admit your plateau because i have seen it but i have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life whatever  what you admit sir or what you do not admit is really of inconceivably small importance  i am glad to perceive that the plateau itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence he glanced up at it and then to our amazement he sprang from his rock and seizing summerlee by the neck he tilted his face into the air  now sir he shouted hoarse with excitement  do i help you to realize that the plateau contains some animal life  i have said that a thick fringe of green overhung the edge of the cliff  out of this there had emerged a black glistening object  as it came slowly forth and overhung the chasm we saw that it was a very large snake with a peculiar flat spadelike head  it wavered and quivered above us for a minute the morning sun gleaming upon its sleek sinuous coils  then it slowly drew inwards and disappeared  summerlee had been so interested that he had stood unresisting while challenger tilted his head into the air  now he shook his colleague off and came back to his dignity  i should be glad professor challenger said he if you could see your way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me by the chin  even the appearance of a very ordinary rock python does not appear to justify such a liberty  but there is life upon the plateau all the same his colleague replied in triumph  and now having demonstrated this important conclusion so that it is clear to anyone however prejudiced or obtuse i am of opinion that we cannot do better than break up our camp and travel to westward until we find some means of ascent  the ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the going was slow and difficult  suddenly we came however upon something which cheered our hearts  it was the site of an old encampment with several empty chicago meat tins a bottle labeled brandy a broken tinopener and a quantity of other travelers debris  a crumpled disintegrated newspaper revealed itself as the chicago democrat though the date had been obliterated  not mine said challenger  it must be maple whites  lord john had been gazing curiously at a great treefern which overshadowed the encampment  i say look at this said he  i believe it is meant for a signpost  a slip of hard wood had been nailed to the tree in such a way as to point to the westward  most certainly a signpost said challenger  what else  finding himself upon a dangerous errand our pioneer has left this sign so that any party which follows him may know the way he has taken  perhaps we shall come upon some other indications as we proceed  we did indeed but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature immediately beneath the cliff there grew a considerable patch of high bamboo like that which we had traversed in our journey  many of these stems were twenty feet high with sharp strong tops so that even as they stood they made formidable spears  we were passing along the edge of this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white within it  thrusting in my head between the stems i found myself gazing at a fleshless skull  the whole skeleton was there but the skull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open  with a few blows from the machetes of our indians we cleared the spot and were able to study the details of this old tragedy  only a few shreds of clothes could still be distinguished but there were the remains of boots upon the bony feet and it was very clear that the dead man was a european  a gold watch by hudson of new york and a chain which held a stylographic pen lay among the bones  there was also a silver cigarettecase with j c from a e s upon the lid  the state of the metal seemed to show that the catastrophe had occurred no great time before  who can he be asked lord john  poor devil every bone in his body seems to be broken  and the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs said summerlee  it is a fastgrowing plant but it is surely inconceivable that this body could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length  as to the mans identity said professor challenger i have no doubt whatever upon that point  as i made my way up the river before i reached you at the fazenda i instituted very particular inquiries about maple white  at para they knew nothing  fortunately i had a definite clew for there was a particular picture in his sketchbook which showed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at rosario  this priest i was able to find and though he proved a very argumentative fellow who took it absurdly amiss that i should point out to him the corrosive effect which modern science must have upon his beliefs he none the less gave me some positive information  maple white passed rosario four years ago or two years before i saw his dead body  he was not alone at the time but there was a friend an american named james colver who remained in the boat and did not meet this ecclesiastic  i think therefore that there can be no doubt that we are now looking upon the remains of this james colver  nor said lord john is there much doubt as to how he met his death he has fallen or been chucked from the top and so been impaled  how else could he come by his broken bones and how could he have been stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads  a hush came over us as we stood round these shattered remains and realized the truth of lord john roxtons words  the beetling head of the cliff projected over the canebrake  undoubtedly he had fallen from above  but had he fallen  had it been an accident  oralready ominous and terrible possibilities began to form round that unknown land  we moved off in silence and continued to coast round the line of cliffs which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous antarctic icefields which i have seen depicted as stretching from horizon to horizon and towering high above the mastheads of the exploring vessel  in five miles we saw no rift or break  and then suddenly we perceived something which filled us with new hope  in a hollow of the rock protected from rain there was drawn a rough arrow in chalk pointing still to the westwards  maple white again said professor challenger  he had some presentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him  he had chalk then  a box of colored chalks was among the effects i found in his knapsack i remember that the white one was worn to a stump  that is certainly good evidence said summerlee  we can only accept his guidance and follow on to the westward  we had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow upon the rocks  it was at a point where the face of the cliff was for the first time split into a narrow cleft  inside the cleft was a second guidance mark which pointed right up it with the tip somewhat elevated as if the spot indicated were above the level of the ground  it was a solemn place for the walls were so gigantic and the slit of blue sky so narrow and so obscured by a double fringe of verdure that only a dim and shadowy light penetrated to the bottom  we had had no food for many hours and were very weary with the stony and irregular journey but our nerves were too strung to allow us to halt  we ordered the camp to be pitched however and leaving the indians to arrange it we four with the two halfbreeds proceeded up the narrow gorge  it was not more than forty feet across at the mouth but it rapidly closed until it ended in an acute angle too straight and smooth for an ascent  certainly it was not this which our pioneer had attempted to indicate  we made our way backthe whole gorge was not more than a quarter of a mile deepand then suddenly the quick eyes of lord john fell upon what we were seeking  high up above our heads amid the dark shadows there was one circle of deeper gloom  surely it could only be the opening of a cave  the base of the cliff was heaped with loose stones at the spot and it was not difficult to clamber up  when we reached it all doubt was removed  not only was it an opening into the rock but on the side of it there was marked once again the sign of the arrow  here was the point and this the means by which maple white and his illfated comrade had made their ascent  we were too excited to return to the camp but must make our first exploration at once  lord john had an electric torch in his knapsack and this had to serve us as light  he advanced throwing his little clear circlet of yellow radiance before him while in single file we followed at his heels  the cave had evidently been waterworn the sides being smooth and the floor covered with rounded stones  it was of such a size that a single man could just fit through by stooping  for fifty yards it ran almost straight into the rock and then it ascended at an angle of fortyfive presently this incline became even steeper and we found ourselves climbing upon hands and knees among loose rubble which slid from beneath us  suddenly an exclamation broke from lord roxton  its blocked said he  clustering behind him we saw in the yellow field of light a wall of broken basalt which extended to the ceiling  the roof has fallen in  in vain we dragged out some of the pieces  the only effect was that the larger ones became detached and threatened to roll down the gradient and crush us  it was evident that the obstacle was far beyond any efforts which we could make to remove it  the road by which maple white had ascended was no longer available  too much cast down to speak we stumbled down the dark tunnel and made our way back to the camp  one incident occurred however before we left the gorge which is of importance in view of what came afterwards  we had gathered in a little group at the bottom of the chasm some forty feet beneath the mouth of the cave when a huge rock rolled suddenly downwardsand shot past us with tremendous force  it was the narrowest escape for one or all of us  we could not ourselves see whence the rock had come but our halfbreed servants who were still at the opening of the cave said that it had flown past them and must therefore have fallen from the summit  looking upwards we could see no sign of movement above us amidst the green jungle which topped the cliff  there could be little doubt however that the stone was aimed at us so the incident surely pointed to humanityand malevolent humanityupon the plateau  we withdrew hurriedly from the chasm our minds full of this new development and its bearing upon our plans  the situation was difficult enough before but if the obstructions of nature were increased by the deliberate opposition of man then our case was indeed a hopeless one  and yet as we looked up at that beautiful fringe of verdure only a few hundreds of feet above our heads there was not one of us who could conceive the idea of returning to london until we had explored it to its depths  on discussing the situation we determined that our best course was to continue to coast round the plateau in the hope of finding some other means of reaching the top  the line of cliffs which had decreased considerably in height had already begun to trend from west to north and if we could take this as representing the arc of a circle the whole circumference could not be very great  at the worst then we should be back in a few days at our startingpoint  we made a march that day which totaled some twoandtwenty miles without any change in our prospects  i may mention that our aneroid shows us that in the continual incline which we have ascended since we abandoned our canoes we have risen to no less than three thousand feet above sealevel  hence there is a considerable change both in the temperature and in the vegetation  we have shaken off some of that horrible insect life which is the bane of tropical travel  a few palms still survive and many treeferns but the amazonian trees have been all left behind  it was pleasant to see the convolvulus the passionflower and the begonia all reminding me of home here among these inhospitable rocks  there was a red begonia just the same color as one that is kept in a pot in the window of a certain villa in streathambut i am drifting into private reminiscence  that nighti am still speaking of the first day of our circumnavigation of the plateaua great experience awaited us and one which for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have had as to the wonders so near us  you will realize as you read it my dear mr mcardle and possibly for the first time that the paper has not sent me on a wildgoose chase and that there is inconceivably fine copy waiting for the world whenever we have the professors leave to make use of it  i shall not dare to publish these articles unless i can bring back my proofs to england or i shall be hailed as the journalistic munchausen of all time  i have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such articles must of necessity elicit  so this wonderful incident which would make such a headline for the old paper must still wait its turn in the editorial drawer  and yet it was all over in a flash and there was no sequel to it save in our own convictions  what occurred was this  lord john had shot an ajoutiwhich is a small piglike animaland half of it having been given to the indians we were cooking the other half upon our fire  there is a chill in the  air after dark and we had all drawn close to the blaze the night was moonless but there were some stars and one could see for a little distance across the plain  well suddenly out of the darkness out of the night there swooped something with a swish like an aeroplane  the whole group of us were covered for an instant by a canopy of leathery wings and i had a momentary vision of a long snakelike neck a fierce red greedy eye and a great snapping beak filled to my amazement with little gleaming teeth  the next instant it was goneand so was our dinner  a huge black shadow twenty feet across skimmed up into the air for an instant the monster wings blotted out the stars and then it vanished over the brow of the cliff above us  we all sat in amazed silence round the fire like the heroes of virgil when the harpies came down upon them  it was summerlee who was the first to speak  professor challenger said he in a solemn voice which quavered with emotion i owe you an apology  sir i am very much in the wrong and i beg that you will forget what is past  it was handsomely said and the two men for the first time shook hands so much we have gained by this clear vision of our first pterodactyl it was worth a stolen supper to bring two such men together  but if prehistoric life existed upon the plateau it was not superabundant for we had no further glimpse of it during the next three days  during this time we traversed a barren and forbidding country which alternated between stony desert and desolate marshes full of many wildfowl upon the north and east of the cliffs  from that direction the place is really inaccessible and were it not for a hardish ledge which runs at the very base of the precipice we should have had to turn back  many times we were up to our waists in the slime and blubber of an old semitropical swamp  to make matters worse the place seemed to be a favorite breedingplace of the jaracaca snake the most venomous and aggressive in south america  again and again these horrible creatures came writhing and springing towards us across the surface of this putrid bog and it was only by keeping our shotguns for ever ready that we could feel safe from them  one funnelshaped depression in the morass of a livid green in color from some lichen which festered in it will always remain as a nightmare memory in my mind  it seems to have been a special nest of these vermins and the slopes were alive with them all writhing in our direction for it is a peculiarity of the jaracaca that he will always attack man at first sight  there were too many for us to shoot so we fairly took to our heels and ran until we were exhausted  i shall always remember as we looked back how far behind we could see the heads and necks of our horrible pursuers rising and falling amid the reeds jaracaca swamp we named it in the map which we are constructing  the cliffs upon the farther side had lost their ruddy tint being chocolatebrown in color the vegetation was more scattered along the top of them and they had sunk to three or four hundred feet in height but in no place did we find any point where they could be ascended  if anything they were more impossible than at the first point where we had met them  their absolute steepness is indicated in the photograph which i took over the stony desert  surely said i as we discussed the situation the rain must find its way down somehow  there are bound to be waterchannels in the rocks  our young friend has glimpses of lucidity said professor challenger patting me upon the shoulder  the rain must go somewhere i repeated  he keeps a firm grip upon actuality  the only drawback is that we have conclusively proved by ocular demonstration that there are no water channels down the rocks  where then does it go i persisted  i think it may be fairly assumed that if it does not come outwards it must run inwards  then there is a lake in the center  so i should suppose  it is more than likely that the lake may be an old crater said summerlee  the whole formation is of course highly volcanic  but however that may be i should expect to find the surface of the plateau slope inwards with a considerable sheet of water in the center which may drain off by some subterranean channel into the marshes of the jaracaca swamp  or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium remarked challenger and the two learned men wandered off into one of their usual scientific arguments which were as comprehensible as chinese to the layman  on the sixth day we completed our first circuit of the cliffs and found ourselves back at the first camp beside the isolated pinnacle of rock  we were a disconsolate party for nothing could have been more minute than our investigation and it was absolutely certain that there was no single point where the most active human being could possibly hope to scale the cliff  the place which maple whites chalkmarks had indicated as his own means of access was now entirely impassable  what were we to do now  our stores of provisions supplemented by our guns were holding out well but the day must come when they would need replenishment  in a couple of months the rains might be expected and we should be washed out of our camp  the rock was harder than marble and any attempt at cutting a path for so great a height was more than our time or resources would admit  no wonder that we looked gloomily at each other that night and sought our blankets with hardly a word exchanged  i remember that as i dropped off to sleep my last recollection was that challenger was squatting like a monstrous bullfrog by the fire his huge head in his hands sunk apparently in the deepest thought and entirely oblivious to the goodnight which i wished him  but it was a very different challenger who greeted us in the morninga challenger with contentment and selfcongratulation shining from his whole person  he faced us as we assembled for breakfast with a deprecating false modesty in his eyes as who should say i know that i deserve all that you can say but i pray you to spare my blushes by not saying it  his beard bristled exultantly his chest was thrown out and his hand was thrust into the front of his jacket  so in his fancy may he see himself sometimes gracing the vacant pedestal in trafalgar square and adding one more to the horrors of the london streets  eureka he cried his teeth shining through his beard  gentlemen you may congratulate me and we may congratulate each other  the problem is solved  you have found a way up  i venture to think so  and where  for answer he pointed to the spirelike pinnacle upon our right  our facesor mine at leastfell as we surveyed it  that it could be climbed we had our companions assurance  but a horrible abyss lay between it and the plateau  we can never get across i gasped  we can at least all reach the summit said he  when we are up i may be able to show you that the resources of an inventive mind are not yet exhausted  after breakfast we unpacked the bundle in which our leader had brought his climbing accessories  from it he took a coil of the strongest and lightest rope a hundred and fifty feet in length with climbing irons clamps and other devices  lord john was an experienced mountaineer and summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times so that i was really the novice at rockwork of the party but my strength and activity may have made up for my want of experience  it was not in reality a very stiff task though there were moments which made my hair bristle upon my head  the first half was perfectly easy but from there upwards it became continually steeper until for the last fifty feet we were literally clinging with our fingers and toes to tiny ledges and crevices in the rock  i could not have accomplished it nor could summerlee if challenger had not gained the summit it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a creature and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the considerable tree which grew there  with this as our support we were soon able to scramble up the jagged wall until we found ourselves upon the small grassy platform some twentyfive feet each way which formed the summit  the first impression which i received when i had recovered my breath was of the extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed the whole brazilian plain seemed to lie beneath us extending away and away until it ended in dim blue mists upon the farthest skyline  in the foreground was the long slope strewn with rocks and dotted with treeferns farther off in the middle distance looking over the saddleback hill i could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboos through which we had passed and then gradually the vegetation increased until it formed the huge forest which extended as far as the eyes could reach and for a good two thousand miles beyond  i was still drinking in this wonderful panorama when the heavy hand of the professor fell upon my shoulder  this way my young friend said he vestigia nulla retrorsum  never look rearwards but always to our glorious goal  the level of the plateau when i turned was exactly that on which we stood and the green bank of bushes with occasional trees was so near that it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained  at a rough guess the gulf was forty feet across but so far as i could see it might as well have been forty miles  i placed one arm round the trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss  far down were the small dark figures of our servants looking up at us  the wall was absolutely precipitous as was that which faced me  this is indeed curious said the creaking voice of professor summerlee  i turned and found that he was examining with great interest the tree to which i clung  that smooth bark and those small ribbed leaves seemed familiar to my eyes  why i cried its a beech  exactly said summerlee  a fellowcountryman in a far land  not only a fellowcountryman my good sir said challenger but also if i may be allowed to enlarge your simile an ally of the first value  this beech tree will be our saviour  by george cried lord john a bridge  exactly my friends a bridge  it is not for nothing that i expended an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation  i have some recollection of once remarking to our young friend here that g e c is at his best when his back is to the wall  last night you will admit that all our backs were to the wall  but where willpower and intellect go together there is always a way out  a drawbridge had to be found which could be dropped across the abyss  behold it  it was certainly a brilliant idea  the tree was a good sixty feet in height and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the chasm  challenger had slung the camp axe over his shoulder when he ascended  now he handed it to me  our young friend has the thews and sinews said he  i think he will be the most useful at this task  i must beg however that you will kindly refrain from thinking for yourself and that you will do exactly what you are told  under his direction i cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as would ensure that it should fall as we desired  it had already a strong natural tilt in the direction of the plateau so that the matter was not difficult  finally i set to work in earnest upon the trunk taking turn and turn with lord john  in a little over an hour there was a loud crack the tree swayed forward and then crashed over burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side  the severed trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform and for one terrible second we all thought it was over  it balanced itself however a few inches from the edge and there was our bridge to the unknown  all of us without a word shook hands with professor challenger who raised his straw hat and bowed deeply to each in turn  i claim the honor said he to be the first to cross to the unknown landa fitting subject no doubt for some future historical painting  he had approached the bridge when lord john laid his hand upon his coat  my dear chap said he i really cannot allow it  cannot allow it sir  the head went back and the beard forward  when it is a matter of science dont you know i follow your lead because you are by way of bein a man of science  but its up to you to follow me when you come into my department  your department sir  we all have our professions and soldierin is mine  we are accordin to my ideas invadin a new country which may or may not be chockfull of enemies of sorts  to barge blindly into it for want of a little common sense and patience isnt my notion of management  the remonstrance was too reasonable to be disregarded  challenger tossed his head and shrugged his heavy shoulders  well sir what do you propose  for all i know there may be a tribe of cannibals waitin for lunchtime among those very bushes said lord john looking across the bridge  its better to learn wisdom before you get into a cookinpot so we will content ourselves with hopin that there is no trouble waitin for us and at the same time we will act as if there were  malone and i will go down again therefore and we will fetch up the four rifles together with gomez and the other  one man can then go across and the rest will cover him with guns until he sees that it is safe for the whole crowd to come along  challenger sat down upon the cut stump and groaned his impatience but summerlee and i were of one mind that lord john was our leader when such practical details were in question  the climb was a more simple thing now that the rope dangled down the face of the worst part of the ascent  within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shotgun the halfbreeds had ascended also and under lord johns orders they had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration should be a long one  we had each bandoliers of cartridges  now challenger if you really insist upon being the first man in said lord john when every preparation was complete  i am much indebted to you for your gracious permission said the angry professor for never was a man so intolerant of every form of authority  since you are good enough to allow it i shall most certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion  seating himself with a leg overhanging the abyss on each side and his hatchet slung upon his back challenger hopped his way across the trunk and was soon at the other side  he clambered up and waved his arms in the air  at last he cried at last  i gazed anxiously at him with a vague expectation that some terrible fate would dart at him from the curtain of green behind him  but all was quiet save that a strange manycolored bird flew up from under his feet and vanished among the trees  summerlee was the second  his wiry energy is wonderful in so frail a frame  he insisted upon having two rifles slung upon his back so that both professors were armed when he had made his transit  i came next and tried hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which i was passing  summerlee held out the buttend of his rifle and an instant later i was able to grasp his hand  as to lord john he walked acrossactually walked without support  he must have nerves of iron  and there we were the four of us upon the dreamland the lost world of maple white  to all of us it seemed the moment of our supreme triumph  who could have guessed that it was the prelude to our supreme disaster  let me say in a few words how the crushing blow fell upon us  we had turned away from the edge and had penetrated about fifty yards of close brushwood when there came a frightful rending crash from behind us  with one impulse we rushed back the way that we had come the bridge was gone  far down at the base of the cliff i saw as i looked over a tangled mass of branches and splintered trunk  it was our beech tree  had the edge of the platform crumbled and let it through  for a moment this explanation was in all our minds  the next from the farther side of the rocky pinnacle before us a swarthy face the face of gomez the halfbreed was slowly protruded  yes it was gomez but no longer the gomez of the demure smile and the masklike expression  here was a face with flashing eyes and distorted features a face convulsed with hatred and with the mad joy of gratified revenge  lord roxton he shouted  lord john roxton  well said our companion here i am  a shriek of laughter came across the abyss  yes there you are you english dog and there you will remain  i have waited and waited and now has come my chance  you found it hard to get up you will find it harder to get down  you cursed fools you are trapped every one of you  we were too astounded to speak  we could only stand there staring in amazement  a great broken bough upon the grass showed whence he had gained his leverage to tilt over our bridge  the face had vanished but presently it was up again more frantic than before  we nearly killed you with a stone at the cave he cried but this is better  it is slower and more terrible  your bones will whiten up there and none will know where you lie or come to cover them  as you lie dying think of lopez whom you shot five years ago on the putomayo river  i am his brother and come what will i will die happy now for his memory has been avenged a furious hand was shaken at us and then all was quiet  had the halfbreed simply wrought his vengeance and then escaped all might have been well with him  it was that foolish irresistible latin impulse to be dramatic which brought his own downfall  roxton the man who had earned himself the name of the flail of the lord through three countries was not one who could be safely taunted  the halfbreed was descending on the farther side of the pinnacle but before he could reach the ground lord john had run along the edge of the plateau and gained a point from which he could see his man  there was a single crack of his rifle and though we saw nothing we heard the scream and then the distant thud of the falling body  roxton came back to us with a face of granite  i have been a blind simpleton said he bitterly  its my folly that has brought you all into this trouble  i should have remembered that these people have long memories for bloodfeuds and have been more upon my guard  what about the other one  it took two of them to lever that tree over the edge  i could have shot him but i let him go  he may have had no part in it  perhaps it would have been better if i had killed him for he must as you say have lent a hand  now that we had the clue to his action each of us could cast back and remember some sinister act upon the part of the halfbreedhis constant desire to know our plans his arrest outside our tent when he was overhearing them the furtive looks of hatred which from time to time one or other of us had surprised  we were still discussing it endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions when a singular scene in the plain below arrested our attention  a man in white clothes who could only be the surviving halfbreed was running as one does run when death is the pacemaker  behind him only a few yards in his rear bounded the huge ebony figure of zambo our devoted negro  even as we looked he sprang upon the back of the fugitive and flung his arms round his neck  they rolled on the ground together  an instant afterwards zambo rose looked at the prostrate man and then waving his hand joyously to us came running in our direction  the white figure lay motionless in the middle of the great plain  our two traitors had been destroyed but the mischief that they had done lived after them  by no possible means could we get back to the pinnacle  we had been natives of the world now we were natives of the plateau  the two things were separate and apart  there was the plain which led to the canoes  yonder beyond the violet hazy horizon was the stream which led back to civilization  but the link between was missing  no human ingenuity could suggest a means of bridging the chasm which yawned between ourselves and our past lives  one instant had altered the whole conditions of our existence  it was at such a moment that i learned the stuff of which my three comrades were composed  they were grave it is true and thoughtful but of an invincible serenity  for the moment we could only sit among the bushes in patience and wait the coming of zambo  presently his honest black face topped the rocks and his herculean figure emerged upon the top of the pinnacle  what i do now he cried  you tell me and i do it  it was a question which it was easier to ask than to answer  one thing only was clear  he was our one trusty link with the outside world  on no account must he leave us  no no he cried  i not leave you  whatever come you always find me here  but no able to keep indians  already they say too much curupuri live on this place and they go home  now you leave them me no able to keep them  it was a fact that our indians had shown in many ways of late that they were weary of their journey and anxious to return  we realized that zambo spoke the truth and that it would be impossible for him to keep them  make them wait till tomorrow zambo i shouted then i can send letter back by them  very good sarr i promise they wait till tomorrow said the negro but what i do for you now  there was plenty for him to do and admirably the faithful fellow did it  first of all under our directions he undid the rope from the treestump and threw one end of it across to us  it was not thicker than a clothesline but it was of great strength and though we could not make a bridge of it we might well find it invaluable if we had any climbing to do  he then fastened his end of the rope to the package of supplies which had been carried up and we were able to drag it across this gave us the means of life for at least a week even if we found nothing else  finally he descended and carried up two other packets of mixed goodsa box of ammunition and a number of other things all of which we got across by throwing our rope to him and hauling it back it was evening when he at last climbed down with a final assurance that he would keep the indians till next morning  and so it is that i have spent nearly the whole of this our first night upon the plateau writing up our experiences by the light of a single candlelantern  we supped and camped at the very edge of the cliff quenching our thirst with two bottles of apollinaris which were in one of the cases it is vital to us to find water but i think even lord john himself had had adventures enough for one day and none of us felt inclined to make the first push into the unknown  we forbore to light a fire or to make any unnecessary sound  tomorrow or today rather for it is already dawn as i write we shall make our first venture into this strange land  when i shall be able to write againor if i ever shall write againi know not meanwhile i can see that the indians are still in their place and i am sure that the faithful zambo will be here presently to get my letter  i only trust that it will come to hand   psthe more i think the more desperate does our position seem  i see no possible hope of our return  if there were a high tree near the edge of the plateau we might drop a return bridge across but there is none within fifty yards  our united strength could not carry a trunk which would serve our purpose  the rope of course is far too short that we could descend by it  no our position is hopelesshopeless                                 chapter x              the most wonderful things have happened  the most wonderful things have happened and are continually happening to us  all the paper that i possess consists of five old notebooks and a lot of scraps and i have only the one stylographic pencil but so long as i can move my hand i will continue to set down our experiences and impressions for since we are the only men of the whole human race to see such things it is of enormous importance that i should record them whilst they are fresh in my memory and before that fate which seems to be constantly impending does actually overtake us whether zambo can at last take these letters to the river or whether i shall myself in some miraculous way carry them back with me or finally whether some daring explorer coming upon our tracks with the advantage perhaps of a perfected monoplane should find this bundle of manuscript in any case i can see that what i am writing is destined to immortality as a classic of true adventure  on the morning after our being trapped upon the plateau by the villainous gomez we began a new stage in our experiences  the first incident in it was not such as to give me a very favorable opinion of the place to which we had wandered  as i roused myself from a short nap after day had dawned my eyes fell upon a most singular appearance upon my own leg  my trouser had slipped up exposing a few inches of my skin above my sock  on this there rested a large purplish grape astonished at the sight i leaned forward to pick it off when to my horror it burst between my finger and thumb squirting blood in every direction  my cry of disgust had brought the two professors to my side  most interesting said summerlee bending over my shin  an enormous bloodtick as yet i believe unclassified  the firstfruits of our labors said challenger in his booming pedantic fashion  we cannot do less than call it ixodes maloni  the very small inconvenience of being bitten my young friend cannot i am sure weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of having your name inscribed in the deathless roll of zoology  unhappily you have crushed this fine specimen at the moment of satiation  filthy vermin i cried  professor challenger raised his great eyebrows in protest and placed a soothing paw upon my shoulder  you should cultivate the scientific eye and the detached scientific mind said he  to a man of philosophic temperament like myself the bloodtick with its lancetlike proboscis and its distending stomach is as beautiful a work of nature as the peacock or for that matter the aurora borealis  it pains me to hear you speak of it in so unappreciative a fashion  no doubt with due diligence we can secure some other specimen  there can be no doubt of that said summerlee grimly for one has just disappeared behind your shirtcollar  challenger sprang into the air bellowing like a bull and tore frantically at his coat and shirt to get them off  summerlee and i laughed so that we could hardly help him  at last we exposed that monstrous torso fiftyfour inches by the tailors tape  his body was all matted with black hair out of which jungle we picked the wandering tick before it had bitten him  but the bushes round were full of the horrible pests and it was clear that we must shift our camp  but first of all it was necessary to make our arrangements with the faithful negro who appeared presently on the pinnacle with a number of tins of cocoa and biscuits which he tossed over to us  of the stores which remained below he was ordered to retain as much as would keep him for two months  the indians were to have the remainder as a reward for their services and as payment for taking our letters back to the amazon  some hours later we saw them in single file far out upon the plain each with a bundle on his head making their way back along the path we had come  zambo occupied our little tent at the base of the pinnacle and there he remained our one link with the world below  and now we had to decide upon our immediate movements  we shifted our position from among the tickladen bushes until we came to a small clearing thickly surrounded by trees upon all sides  there were some flat slabs of rock in the center with an excellent well close by and there we sat in cleanly comfort while we made our first plans for the invasion of this new country  birds were calling among the foliageespecially one with a peculiar whooping cry which was new to usbut beyond these sounds there were no signs of life  our first care was to make some sort of list of our own stores so that we might know what we had to rely upon  what with the things we had ourselves brought up and those which zambo had sent across on the rope we were fairly well supplied  most important of all in view of the dangers which might surround us we had our four rifles and one thousand three hundred rounds also a shotgun but not more than a hundred and fifty medium pellet cartridges  in the matter of provisions we had enough to last for several weeks with a sufficiency of tobacco and a few scientific implements including a large telescope and a good fieldglass  all these things we collected together in the clearing and as a first precaution we cut down with our hatchet and knives a number of thorny bushes which we piled round in a circle some fifteen yards in diameter  this was to be our headquarters for the timeour place of refuge against sudden danger and the guardhouse for our stores  fort challenger we called it  it was midday before we had made ourselves secure but the heat was not oppressive and the general character of the plateau both in its temperature and in its vegetation was almost temperate  the beech the oak and even the birch were to be found among the tangle of trees which girt us in  one huge gingko tree topping all the others shot its great limbs and maidenhair foliage over the fort which we had constructed  in its shade we continued our discussion while lord john who had quickly taken command in the hour of action gave us his views  so long as neither man nor beast has seen or heard us we are safe said he  from the time they know we are here our troubles begin there are no signs that they have found us out as yet  so our game surely is to lie low for a time and spy out the land  we want to have a good look at our neighbors before we get on visitin terms  but we must advance i ventured to remark  by all means sonny my boy  we will advance  but with common sense we must never go so far that we cant get back to our base  above all we must never unless it is life or death fire off our guns  but you fired yesterday said summerlee  well it couldnt be helped  however the wind was strong and blew outwards  it is not likely that the sound could have traveled far into the plateau  by the way what shall we call this place  i suppose it is up to us to give it a name  there were several suggestions more or less happy but challengers was final  it can only have one name said he  it is called after the pioneer who discovered it  it is maple white land  maple white land it became and so it is named in that chart which has become my special task  so it will i trust appear in the atlas of the future  the peaceful penetration of maple white land was the pressing subject before us  we had the evidence of our own eyes that the place was inhabited by some unknown creatures and there was that of maple whites sketchbook to show that more dreadful and more dangerous monsters might still appear  that there might also prove to be human occupants and that they were of a malevolent character was suggested by the skeleton impaled upon the bamboos which could not have got there had it not been dropped from above  our situation stranded without possibility of escape in such a land was clearly full of danger and our reasons endorsed every measure of caution which lord johns experience could suggest  yet it was surely impossible that we should halt on the edge of this world of mystery when our very souls were tingling with impatience to push forward and to pluck the heart from it  we therefore blocked the entrance to our zareba by filling it up with several thorny bushes and left our camp with the stores entirely surrounded by this protecting hedge  we then slowly and cautiously set forth into the unknown following the course of the little stream which flowed from our spring as it should always serve us as a guide on our return  hardly had we started when we came across signs that there were indeed wonders awaiting us  after a few hundred yards of thick forest containing many trees which were quite unknown to me but which summerlee who was the botanist of the party recognized as forms of conifera and of cycadaceous plants which have long passed away in the world below we entered a region where the stream widened out and formed a considerable bog  high reeds of a peculiar type grew thickly before us which were pronounced to be equisetacea or marestails with treeferns scattered amongst them all of them swaying in a brisk wind  suddenly lord john who was walking first halted with uplifted hand  look at this said he  by george this must be the trail of the father of all birds  an enormous threetoed track was imprinted in the soft mud before us the creature whatever it was had crossed the swamp and had passed on into the forest  we all stopped to examine that monstrous spoor  if it were indeed a birdand what animal could leave such a markits foot was so much larger than an ostrichs that its height upon the same scale must be enormous  lord john looked eagerly round him and slipped two cartridges into his elephantgun  ill stake my good name as a shikarree said he that the track is a fresh one  the creature has not passed ten minutes  look how the water is still oozing into that deeper print  by jove  see here is the mark of a little one  sure enough smaller tracks of the same general form were running parallel to the large ones  but what do you make of this cried professor summerlee triumphantly pointing to what looked like the huge print of a fivefingered human hand appearing among the threetoed marks  wealden cried challenger in an ecstasy  ive seen them in the wealden clay  it is a creature walking erect upon threetoed feet and occasionally putting one of its fivefingered forepaws upon the ground not a bird my dear roxtonnot a bird  a beast  no a reptilea dinosaur  nothing else could have left such a track they puzzled a worthy sussex doctor some ninety years ago but who in the world could have hopedhopedto have seen a sight like that  his words died away into a whisper and we all stood in motionless amazement  following the tracks we had left the morass and passed through a screen of brushwood and trees  beyond was an open glade and in this were five of the most extraordinary creatures that i have ever seen  crouching down among the bushes we observed them at our leisure  there were as i say five of them two being adults and three young ones  in size they were enormous  even the babies were as big as elephants while the two large ones were far beyond all creatures i have ever seen  they had slatecolored skin which was scaled like a lizards and shimmered where the sun shone upon it  all five were sitting up balancing themselves upon their broad powerful tails and their huge threetoed hindfeet while with their small fivefingered frontfeet they pulled down the branches upon which they browsed  i do not know that i can bring their appearance home to you better than by saying that they looked like monstrous kangaroos twenty feet in length and with skins like black crocodiles  i do not know how long we stayed motionless gazing at this marvelous spectacle  a strong wind blew towards us and we were well concealed so there was no chance of discovery  from time to time the little ones played round their parents in unwieldy gambols the great beasts bounding into the air and falling with dull thuds upon the earth  the strength of the parents seemed to be limitless for one of them having some difficulty in reaching a bunch of foliage which grew upon a considerablesized tree put his forelegs round the trunk and tore it down as if it had been a sapling  the action seemed as i thought to show not only the great development of its muscles but also the small one of its brain for the whole weight came crashing down upon the top of it and it uttered a series of shrill yelps to show that big as it was there was a limit to what it could endure  the incident made it think apparently that the neighborhood was dangerous for it slowly lurched off through the wood followed by its mate and its three enormous infants  we saw the shimmering slaty gleam of their skins between the treetrunks and their heads undulating high above the brushwood  then they vanished from our sight  i looked at my comrades  lord john was standing at gaze with his finger on the trigger of his elephantgun his eager hunters soul shining from his fierce eyes  what would he not give for one such head to place between the two crossed oars above the mantelpiece in his snuggery at the albany  and yet his reason held him in for all our exploration of the wonders of this unknown land depended upon our presence being concealed from its inhabitants  the two professors were in silent ecstasy  in their excitement they had unconsciously seized each other by the hand and stood like two little children in the presence of a marvel challengers cheeks bunched up into a seraphic smile and summerlees sardonic face softening for the moment into wonder and reverence  nunc dimittis he cried at last  what will they say in england of this  my dear summerlee i will tell you with great confidence exactly what they will say in england said challenger  they will say that you are an infernal liar and a scientific charlatan exactly as you and others said of me  in the face of photographs  faked summerlee  clumsily faked  in the face of specimens  ah there we may have them  malone and his filthy fleet street crew may be all yelping our praises yet  august the twentyeighththe day we saw five live iguanodons in a glade of maple white land  put it down in your diary my young friend and send it to your rag  and be ready to get the toeend of the editorial boot in return said lord john  things look a bit different from the latitude of london young fellah my lad  theres many a man who never tells his adventures for he cant hope to be believed  whos to blame them for this will seem a bit of a dream to ourselves in a month or two what did you say they were  iguanodons said summerlee  youll find their footmarks all over the hastings sands in kent and in sussex  the south of england was alive with them when there was plenty of good lush greenstuff to keep them going  conditions have changed and the beasts died  here it seems that the conditions have not changed and the beasts have lived  if ever we get out of this alive i must have a head with me said lord john  lord how some of that somalilanduganda crowd would turn a beautiful peagreen if they saw it  i dont know what you chaps think but it strikes me that we are on mighty thin ice all this time  i had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us  in the gloom of the trees there seemed a constant menace and as we looked up into their shadowy foliage vague terrors crept into ones heart  it is true that these monstrous creatures which we had seen were lumbering inoffensive brutes which were unlikely to hurt anyone but in this world of wonders what other survivals might there not bewhat fierce active horrors ready to pounce upon us from their lair among the rocks or brushwood  i knew little of prehistoric life but i had a clear remembrance of one book which i had read in which it spoke of creatures who would live upon our lions and tigers as a cat lives upon mice what if these also were to be found in the woods of maple white land  it was destined that on this very morningour first in the new countrywe were to find out what strange hazards lay around us  it was a loathsome adventure and one of which i hate to think  if as lord john said the glade of the iguanodons will remain with us as a dream then surely the swamp of the pterodactyls will forever be our nightmare  let me set down exactly what occurred  we passed very slowly through the woods partly because lord roxton acted as scout before he would let us advance and partly because at every second step one or other of our professors would fall with a cry of wonder before some flower or insect which presented him with a new type  we may have traveled two or three miles in all keeping to the right of the line of the stream when we came upon a considerable opening in the trees  a belt of brushwood led up to a tangle of rocksthe whole plateau was strewn with boulders  we were walking slowly towards these rocks among bushes which reached over our waists when we became aware of a strange low gabbling and whistling sound which filled the air with a constant clamor and appeared to come from some spot immediately before us  lord john held up his hand as a signal for us to stop and he made his way swiftly stooping and running to the line of rocks  we saw him peep over them and give a gesture of amazement  then he stood staring as if forgetting us so utterly entranced was he by what he saw  finally he waved us to come on holding up his hand as a signal for caution  his whole bearing made me feel that something wonderful but dangerous lay before us  creeping to his side we looked over the rocks  the place into which we gazed was a pit and may in the early days have been one of the smaller volcanic blowholes of the plateau  it was bowlshaped and at the bottom some hundreds of yards from where we lay were pools of greenscummed stagnant water fringed with bullrushes  it was a weird place in itself but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the seven circles of dante  the place was a rookery of pterodactyls there were hundreds of them congregated within view  all the bottom area round the wateredge was alive with their young ones and with hideous mothers brooding upon their leathery yellowish eggs  from this crawling flapping mass of obscene reptilian life came the shocking clamor which filled the air and the mephitic horrible musty odor which turned us sick  but above perched each upon its own stone tall gray and withered more like dead and dried specimens than actual living creatures sat the horrible males absolutely motionless save for the rolling of their red eyes or an occasional snap of their rattrap beaks as a dragonfly went past them  their huge membranous wings were closed by folding their forearms so that they sat like gigantic old women wrapped in hideous webcolored shawls and with their ferocious heads protruding above them  large and small not less than a thousand of these filthy creatures lay in the hollow before us  our professors would gladly have stayed there all day so entranced were they by this opportunity of studying the life of a prehistoric age  they pointed out the fish and dead birds lying about among the rocks as proving the nature of the food of these creatures and i heard them congratulating each other on having cleared up the point why the bones of this flying dragon are found in such great numbers in certain welldefined areas as in the cambridge greensand since it was now seen that like penguins they lived in gregarious fashion  finally however challenger bent upon proving some point which summerlee had contested thrust his head over the rock and nearly brought destruction upon us all  in an instant the nearest male gave a shrill whistling cry and flapped its twentyfoot span of leathery wings as it soared up into the air  the females and young ones huddled together beside the water while the whole circle of sentinels rose one after the other and sailed off into the sky  it was a wonderful sight to see at least a hundred creatures of such enormous size and hideous appearance all swooping like swallows with swift shearing wingstrokes above us but soon we realized that it was not one on which we could afford to linger  at first the great brutes flew round in a huge ring as if to make sure what the exact extent of the danger might be  then the flight grew lower and the circle narrower until they were whizzing round and round us the dry rustling flap of their huge slatecolored wings filling the air with a volume of sound that made me think of hendon aerodrome upon a race day  make for the wood and keep together cried lord john clubbing his rifle  the brutes mean mischief  the moment we attempted to retreat the circle closed in upon us until the tips of the wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces we beat at them with the stocks of our guns but there was nothing solid or vulnerable to strike  then suddenly out of the whizzing slatecolored circle a long neck shot out and a fierce beak made a thrust at us  another and another followed  summerlee gave a cry and put his hand to his face from which the blood was streaming  i felt a prod at the back of my neck and turned dizzy with the shock challenger fell and as i stooped to pick him up i was again struck from behind and dropped on the top of him  at the same instant i heard the crash of lord johns elephantgun and looking up saw one of the creatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground spitting and gurgling at us with a wideopened beak and bloodshot goggled eyes like some devil in a medieval picture  its comrades had flown higher at the sudden sound and were circling above our heads  now cried lord john now for our lives  we staggered through the brushwood and even as we reached the trees the harpies were on us again  summerlee was knocked down but we tore him up and rushed among the trunks  once there we were safe for those huge wings had no space for their sweep beneath the branches  as we limped homewards sadly mauled and discomfited we saw them for a long time flying at a great height against the deep blue sky above our heads soaring round and round no bigger than woodpigeons with their eyes no doubt still following our progress  at last however as we reached the thicker woods they gave up the chase and we saw them no more  a most interesting and convincing experience said challenger as we halted beside the brook and he bathed a swollen knee  we are exceptionally well informed summerlee as to the habits of the enraged pterodactyl  summerlee was wiping the blood from a cut in his forehead while i was tying up a nasty stab in the muscle of the neck  lord john had the shoulder of his coat torn away but the creatures teeth had only grazed the flesh  it is worth noting challenger continued that our young friend has received an undoubted stab while lord johns coat could only have been torn by a bite  in my own case i was beaten about the head by their wings so we have had a remarkable exhibition of their various methods of offence  it has been touch and go for our lives said lord john gravely and i could not think of a more rotten sort of death than to be outed by such filthy vermin  i was sorry to fire my rifle but by jove there was no great choice  we should not be here if you hadnt said i with conviction  it may do no harm said he  among these woods there must be many loud cracks from splitting or falling trees which would be just like the sound of a gun  but now if you are of my opinion we have had thrills enough for one day and had best get back to the surgical box at the camp for some carbolic  who knows what venom these beasts may have in their hideous jaws  but surely no men ever had just such a day since the world began  some fresh surprise was ever in store for us  when following the course of our brook we at last reached our glade and saw the thorny barricade of our camp we thought that our adventures were at an end  but we had something more to think of before we could rest  the gate of fort challenger had been untouched the walls were unbroken and yet it had been visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence  no footmark showed a trace of its nature and only the overhanging branch of the enormous ginko tree suggested how it might have come and gone but of its malevolent strength there was ample evidence in the condition of our stores  they were strewn at random all over the ground and one tin of meat had been crushed into pieces so as to extract the contents  a case of cartridges had been shattered into matchwood and one of the brass shells lay shredded into pieces beside it  again the feeling of vague horror came upon our souls and we gazed round with frightened eyes at the dark shadows which lay around us in all of which some fearsome shape might be lurking  how good it was when we were hailed by the voice of zambo and going to the edge of the plateau saw him sitting grinning at us upon the top of the opposite pinnacle  all well massa challenger all well he cried  me stay here  no fear  you always find me when you want  his honest black face and the immense view before us which carried us halfway back to the affluent of the amazon helped us to remember that we really were upon this earth in the twentieth century and had not by some magic been conveyed to some raw planet in its earliest and wildest state  how difficult it was to realize that the violet line upon the far horizon was well advanced to that great river upon which huge steamers ran and folk talked of the small affairs of life while we marooned among the creatures of a bygone age could but gaze towards it and yearn for all that it meant  one other memory remains with me of this wonderful day and with it i will close this letter  the two professors their tempers aggravated no doubt by their injuries had fallen out as to whether our assailants were of the genus pterodactylus or dimorphodon and high words had ensued  to avoid their wrangling i moved some little way apart and was seated smoking upon the trunk of a fallen tree when lord john strolled over in my direction  i say malone said he do you remember that place where those beasts were  very clearly  a sort of volcanic pit was it not  exactly said i  did you notice the soil  rocks  but round the waterwhere the reeds were  it was a bluish soil  it looked like clay  exactly  a volcanic tube full of blue clay  what of that i asked  oh nothing nothing said he and strolled back to where the voices of the contending men of science rose in a prolonged duet the high strident note of summerlee rising and falling to the sonorous bass of challenger  i should have thought no more of lord johns remark were it not that once again that night i heard him mutter to himself  blue clayclay in a volcanic tube they were the last words i heard before i dropped into an exhausted sleep                                 chapter xi                      for once i was the hero  lord john roxton was right when he thought that some specially toxic quality might lie in the bite of the horrible creatures which had attacked us  on the morning after our first adventure upon the plateau both summerlee and i were in great pain and fever while challengers knee was so bruised that he could hardly limp  we kept to our camp all day therefore lord john busying himself with such help as we could give him in raising the height and thickness of the thorny walls which were our only defense  i remember that during the whole long day i was haunted by the feeling that we were closely observed though by whom or whence i could give no guess  so strong was the impression that i told professor challenger of it who put it down to the cerebral excitement caused by my fever  again and again i glanced round swiftly with the conviction that i was about to see something but only to meet the dark tangle of our hedge or the solemn and cavernous gloom of the great trees which arched above our heads  and yet the feeling grew ever stronger in my own mind that something observant and something malevolent was at our very elbow  i thought of the indian superstition of the curupurithe dreadful lurking spirit of the woodsand i could have imagined that his terrible presence haunted those who had invaded his most remote and sacred retreat  that night our third in maple white land we had an experience which left a fearful impression upon our minds and made us thankful that lord john had worked so hard in making our retreat impregnable  we were all sleeping round our dying fire when we were arousedor rather i should say shot out of our slumbersby a succession of the most frightful cries and screams to which i have ever listened  i know no sound to which i could compare this amazing tumult which seemed to come from some spot within a few hundred yards of our camp  it was as earsplitting as any whistle of a railwayengine but whereas the whistle is a clear mechanical sharpedged sound this was far deeper in volume and vibrant with the uttermost strain of agony and horror we clapped our hands to our ears to shut out that nerveshaking appeal a cold sweat broke out over my body and my heart turned sick at the misery of it  all the woes of tortured life all its stupendous indictment of high heaven its innumerable sorrows seemed to be centered and condensed into that one dreadful agonized cry  and then under this highpitched ringing sound there was another more intermittent a low deepchested laugh a growling throaty gurgle of merriment which formed a grotesque accompaniment to the shriek with which it was blended  for three or four minutes on end the fearsome duet continued while all the foliage rustled with the rising of startled birds  then it shut off as suddenly as it began  for a long time we sat in horrified silence  then lord john threw a bundle of twigs upon the fire and their red glare lit up the intent faces of my companions and flickered over the great boughs above our heads  what was it i whispered  we shall know in the morning said lord john  it  was close to usnot farther than the glade  we have been privileged to overhear a prehistoric tragedy the sort of drama which occurred among the reeds upon the border of some jurassic lagoon when the greater dragon pinned the lesser among the slime said challenger with more solemnity than i had ever heard in his voice  it was surely well for man that he came late in the order of creation  there were powers abroad in earlier days which no courage and no mechanism of his could have met  what could his sling his throwingstick or his arrow avail him against such forces as have been loose tonight  even with a modern rifle it would be all odds on the monster  i think i should back my little friend said lord john caressing his express  but the beast would certainly have a good sporting chance  summerlee raised his hand  hush he cried  surely i hear something  from the utter silence there emerged a deep regular patpat  it was the tread of some animalthe rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed cautiously upon the ground  it stole slowly round the camp and then halted near our gateway  there was a low sibilant rise and fallthe breathing of the creature  only our feeble hedge separated us from this horror of the night  each of us had seized his rifle and lord john had pulled out a small bush to make an embrasure in the hedge  by george he whispered  i think i can see it  i stooped and peered over his shoulder through the gap  yes i could see it too  in the deep shadow of the tree there was a deeper shadow yet black inchoate vaguea crouching form full of savage vigor and menace  it was no higher than a horse but the dim outline suggested vast bulk and strength  that hissing pant as regular and fullvolumed as the exhaust of an engine spoke of a monstrous organism  once as it moved i thought i saw the glint of two terrible greenish eyes there was an uneasy rustling as if it were crawling slowly forward  i believe it is going to spring said i cocking my rifle  dont fire  dont fire whispered lord john  the crash of a gun in this silent night would be heard for miles  keep it as a last card  if it gets over the hedge were done said summerlee and his voice crackled into a nervous laugh as he spoke  no it must not get over cried lord john but hold your fire to the last  perhaps i can make something of the fellow  ill chance it anyhow  it was as brave an act as ever i saw a man do  he stooped to the fire picked up a blazing branch and slipped in an instant through a sallyport which he had made in our gateway  the thing moved forward with a dreadful snarl  lord john never hesitated but running towards it with a quick light step he dashed the flaming wood into the brutes face  for one moment i had a vision of a horrible mask like a giant toads of a warty leprous skin and of a loose mouth all beslobbered with fresh blood  the next there was a crash in the underwood and our dreadful visitor was gone  i thought he wouldnt face the fire said lord john laughing as he came back and threw his branch among the faggots  you should not have taken such a risk we all cried  there was nothin else to be done  if he had got among us we should have shot each other in tryin to down him  on the other hand if we had fired through the hedge and wounded him he would soon have been on the top of usto say nothin of giving ourselves away  on the whole i think that we are jolly well out of it  what was he then  our learned men looked at each other with some hesitation  personally i am unable to classify the creature with any certainty said summerlee lighting his pipe from the fire  in refusing to commit yourself you are but showing a proper scientific reserve said challenger with massive condescension  i am not myself prepared to go farther than to say in general terms that we have almost certainly been in contact tonight with some form of carnivorous dinosaur  i have already expressed my anticipation that something of the sort might exist upon this plateau  we have to bear in mind remarked summerlee that there are many prehistoric forms which have never come down to us  it would be rash to suppose that we can give a name to all that we are likely to meet  exactly  a rough classification may be the best that we can attempt tomorrow some further evidence may help us to an identification meantime we can only renew our interrupted slumbers  but not without a sentinel said lord john with decision  we cant afford to take chances in a country like this  twohour spells in the future for each of us  then ill just finish my pipe in starting the first one said professor summerlee and from that time onwards we never trusted ourselves again without a watchman  in the morning it was not long before we discovered the source of the hideous uproar which had aroused us in the night  the iguanodon glade was the scene of a horrible butchery  from the pools of blood and the enormous lumps of flesh scattered in every direction over the green sward we imagined at first that a number of animals had been killed but on examining the remains more closely we discovered that all this carnage came from one of these unwieldy monsters which had been literally torn to pieces by some creature not larger perhaps but far more ferocious than itself  our two professors sat in absorbed argument examining piece after piece which showed the marks of savage teeth and of enormous claws  our judgment must still be in abeyance said professor challenger with a huge slab of whitishcolored flesh across his knee  the indications would be consistent with the presence of a sabertoothed tiger such as are still found among the breccia of our caverns but the creature actually seen was undoubtedly of a larger and more reptilian character  personally i should pronounce for allosaurus  or megalosaurus said summerlee  exactly  any one of the larger carnivorous dinosaurs would meet the case  among them are to be found all the most terrible types of animal life that have ever cursed the earth or blessed a museum he laughed sonorously at his own conceit for though he had little sense of humor the crudest pleasantry from his own lips moved him always to roars of appreciation  the less noise the better said lord roxton curtly  we dont know who or what may be near us  if this fellah comes back for his breakfast and catches us here we wont have so much to laugh at  by the way what is this mark upon the iguanodons hide  on the dull scaly slatecolored skin somewhere above the shoulder there was a singular black circle of some substance which looked like asphalt  none of us could suggest what it meant though summerlee was of opinion that he had seen something similar upon one of the young ones two days before  challenger said nothing but looked pompous and puffy as if he could if he would so that finally lord john asked his opinion direct  if your lordship will graciously permit me to open my mouth i shall be happy to express my sentiments said he with elaborate sarcasm i am not in the habit of being taken to task in the fashion which seems to be customary with your lordship  i was not aware that it was necessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless pleasantry  it was not until he had received his apology that our touchy friend would suffer himself to be appeased  when at last his ruffled feelings were at ease he addressed us at some length from his seat upon a fallen tree speaking as his habit was as if he were imparting most precious information to a class of a thousand  with regard to the marking said he i am inclined to agree with my friend and colleague professor summerlee that the stains are from asphalt  as this plateau is in its very nature highly volcanic and as asphalt is a substance which one associates with plutonic forces i cannot doubt that it exists in the free liquid state and that the creatures may have come in contact with it  a much more important problem is the question as to the existence of the carnivorous monster which has left its traces in this glade  we know roughly that this plateau is not larger than an average english county  within this confined space a certain number of creatures mostly types which have passed away in the world below have lived together for innumerable years  now it is very clear to me that in so long a period one would have expected that the carnivorous creatures multiplying unchecked would have exhausted their food supply and have been compelled to either modify their flesheating habits or die of hunger  this we see has not been so  we can only imagine therefore that the balance of nature is preserved by some check which limits the numbers of these ferocious creatures  one of the many interesting problems therefore which await our solution is to discover what that check may be and how it operates  i venture to trust that we may have some future opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs  and i venture to trust we may not i observed  the professor only raised his great eyebrows as the schoolmaster meets the irrelevant observation of the naughty boy  perhaps professor summerlee may have an observation to make he said and the two savants ascended together into some rarefied scientific atmosphere where the possibilities of a modification of the birthrate were weighed against the decline of the food supply as a check in the struggle for existence  that morning we mapped out a small portion of the plateau avoiding the swamp of the pterodactyls and keeping to the east of our brook instead of to the west  in that direction the country was still thickly wooded with so much undergrowth that our progress was very slow  i have dwelt up to now upon the terrors of maple white land but there was another side to the subject for all that morning we wandered among lovely flowersmostly as i observed white or yellow in color these being as our professors explained the primitive flowershades  in many places the ground was absolutely covered with them and as we walked ankledeep on that wonderful yielding carpet the scent was almost intoxicating in its sweetness and intensity  the homely english bee buzzed everywhere around us  many of the trees under which we passed had their branches bowed down with fruit some of which were of familiar sorts while other varieties were new  by observing which of them were pecked by the birds we avoided all danger of poison and added a delicious variety to our food reserve  in the jungle which we traversed were numerous hardtrodden paths made by the wild beasts and in the more marshy places we saw a profusion of strange footmarks including many of the iguanodon  once in a grove we observed several of these great creatures grazing and lord john with his glass was able to report that they also were spotted with asphalt though in a different place to the one which we had examined in the morning  what this phenomenon meant we could not imagine  we saw many small animals such as porcupines a scaly anteater and a wild pig piebald in color and with long curved tusks  once through a break in the trees we saw a clear shoulder of green hill some distance away and across this a large duncolored animal was traveling at a considerable pace  it passed so swiftly that we were unable to say what it was but if it were a deer as was claimed by lord john it must have been as large as those monstrous irish elk which are still dug up from time to time in the bogs of my native land  ever since the mysterious visit which had been paid to our camp we always returned to it with some misgivings  however on this occasion we found everything in order  that evening we had a grand discussion upon our present situation and future plans which i must describe at some length as it led to a new departure by which we were enabled to gain a more complete knowledge of maple white land than might have come in many weeks of exploring  it was summerlee who opened the debate  all day he had been querulous in manner and now some remark of lord johns as to what we should do on the morrow brought all his bitterness to a head  what we ought to be doing today tomorrow and all the time said he is finding some way out of the trap into which we have fallen you are all turning your brains towards getting into this country  i say that we should be scheming how to get out of it  i am surprised sir boomed challenger stroking his majestic beard that any man of science should commit himself to so ignoble a sentiment  you are in a land which offers such an inducement to the ambitious naturalist as none ever has since the world began and you suggest leaving it before we have acquired more than the most superficial knowledge of it or of its contents  i expected better things of you professor summerlee  you must remember said summerlee sourly that i have a large class in london who are at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient locum tenens  this makes my situation different from yours professor challenger since so far as i know you have never been entrusted with any responsible educational work  quite so said challenger  i have felt it to be a sacrilege to divert a brain which is capable of the highest original research to any lesser object  that is why i have sternly set my face against any proffered scholastic appointment  for example asked summerlee with a sneer but lord john hastened to change the conversation  i must say said he that i think it would be a mighty poor thing to go back to london before i know a great deal more of this place than i do at present  i could never dare to walk into the back office of my paper and face old mcardle said i  you will excuse the frankness of this report will you not sir  hed never forgive me for leaving such unexhausted copy behind me  besides so far as i can see it is not worth discussing since we cant get down even if we wanted  our young friend makes up for many obvious mental lacunae by some measure of primitive common sense remarked challenger  the interests of his deplorable profession are immaterial to us but as he observes we cannot get down in any case so it is a waste of energy to discuss it  it is a waste of energy to do anything else growled summerlee from behind his pipe  let me remind you that we came here upon a perfectly definite mission entrusted to us at the meeting of the zoological institute in london  that mission was to test the truth of professor challengers statements  those statements as i am bound to admit we are now in a position to endorse  our ostensible work is therefore done  as to the detail which remains to be worked out upon this plateau it is so enormous that only a large expedition with a very special equipment could hope to cope with it  should we attempt to do so ourselves the only possible result must be that we shall never return with the important contribution to science which we have already gained  professor challenger has devised means for getting us on to this plateau when it appeared to be inaccessible i think that we should now call upon him to use the same ingenuity in getting us back to the world from which we came  i confess that as summerlee stated his view it struck me as altogether reasonable  even challenger was affected by the consideration that his enemies would never stand confuted if the confirmation of his statements should never reach those who had doubted them  the problem of the descent is at first sight a formidable one said he and yet i cannot doubt that the intellect can solve it  i am prepared to agree with our colleague that a protracted stay in maple white land is at present inadvisable and that the question of our return will soon have to be faced  i absolutely refuse to leave however until we have made at least a superficial examination of this country and are able to take back with us something in the nature of a chart  professor summerlee gave a snort of impatience  we have spent two long days in exploration said he and we are no wiser as to the actual geography of the place than when we started  it is clear that it is all thickly wooded and it would take months to penetrate it and to learn the relations of one part to another  if there were some central peak it would be different but it all slopes downwards so far as we can see  the farther we go the less likely it is that we will get any general view  it was at that moment that i had my inspiration  my eyes chanced to light upon the enormous gnarled trunk of the gingko tree which cast its huge branches over us  surely if its bole exceeded that of all others its height must do the same  if the rim of the plateau was indeed the highest point then why should this mighty tree not prove to be a watchtower which commanded the whole country  now ever since i ran wild as a lad in ireland i have been a bold and skilled treeclimber  my comrades might be my masters on the rocks but i knew that i would be supreme among those branches  could i only get my legs on to the lowest of the giant offshoots then it would be strange indeed if i could not make my way to the top  my comrades were delighted at my idea  our young friend said challenger bunching up the red apples of his cheeks is capable of acrobatic exertions which would be impossible to a man of a more solid though possibly of a more commanding appearance  i applaud his resolution  by george young fellah youve put your hand on it said lord john clapping me on the back  how we never came to think of it before i cant imagine  theres not more than an hour of daylight left but if you take your notebook you may be able to get some rough sketch of the place  if we put these three ammunition cases under the branch i will soon hoist you on to it  he stood on the boxes while i faced the trunk and was gently raising me when challenger sprang forward and gave me such a thrust with his huge hand that he fairly shot me into the tree  with both arms clasping the branch i scrambled  hard with my feet until i had worked first my body and then my knees onto it  there were three excellent offshoots like huge rungs of a ladder above my head and a tangle of convenient branches beyond so that i clambered onwards with such speed that i soon lost sight of the ground and had nothing but foliage beneath me  now and then i encountered a check and once i had to shin up a creeper for eight or ten feet but i made excellent progress and the booming of challengers voice seemed to be a great distance beneath me the tree was however enormous and looking upwards i could see no thinning of the leaves above my head  there was some thick bushlike clump which seemed to be a parasite upon a branch up which i was swarming  i leaned my head round it in order to see what was beyond and i nearly fell out of the tree in my surprise and horror at what i saw  a face was gazing into mineat the distance of only a foot or two the creature that owned it had been crouching behind the parasite and had looked round it at the same instant that i did  it was a human faceor at least it was far more human than any monkeys that i have ever seen  it was long whitish and blotched with pimples the nose flattened and the lower jaw projecting with a bristle of coarse whiskers round the chin  the eyes which were under thick and heavy brows were bestial and ferocious and as it opened its mouth to snarl what sounded like a curse at me i observed that it had curved sharp canine teeth  for an instant i read hatred and menace in the evil eyes  then as quick as a flash came an expression of overpowering fear  there was a crash of broken boughs as it dived wildly down into the tangle of green  i caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a reddish pig and then it was gone amid a swirl of leaves and branches  whats the matter shouted roxton from below  anything wrong with you  did you see it i cried with my arms round the branch and all my nerves tingling  we heard a row as if your foot had slipped  what was it  i was so shocked at the sudden and strange appearance of this apeman that i hesitated whether i should not climb down again and tell my experience to my companions  but i was already so far up the great tree that it seemed a humiliation to return without having carried out my mission  after a long pause therefore to recover my breath and my courage i continued my ascent  once i put my weight upon a rotten branch and swung for a few seconds by my hands but in the main it was all easy climbing  gradually the leaves thinned around me and i was aware from the wind upon my face that i had topped all the trees of the forest  i was determined however not to look about me before i had reached the very highest point so i scrambled on until i had got so far that the topmost branch was bending beneath my weight  there i settled into a convenient fork and balancing myself securely i found myself looking down at a most wonderful panorama of this strange country in which we found ourselves  the sun was just above the western skyline and the evening was a particularly bright and clear one so that the whole extent of the plateau was visible beneath me  it was as seen from this height of an oval contour with a breadth of about thirty miles and a width of twenty  its general shape was that of a shallow funnel all the sides sloping down to a considerable lake in the center  this lake may have been ten miles in circumference and lay very green and beautiful in the evening light with a thick fringe of reeds at its edges and with its surface broken by several yellow sandbanks which gleamed golden in the mellow sunshine  a number of long dark objects which were too large for alligators and too long for canoes lay upon the edges of these patches of sand  with my glass i could clearly see that they were alive but what their nature might be i could not imagine  from the side of the plateau on which we were slopes of woodland with occasional glades stretched down for five or six miles to the central lake  i could see at my very feet the glade of the iguanodons and farther off was a round opening in the trees which marked the swamp of the pterodactyls  on the side facing me however the plateau presented a very different aspect  there the basalt cliffs of the outside were reproduced upon the inside forming an escarpment about two hundred feet high with a woody slope beneath it  along the base of these red cliffs some distance above the ground i could see a number of dark holes through the glass which i conjectured to be the mouths of caves  at the opening of one of these something white was shimmering but i was unable to make out what it was  i sat charting the country until the sun had set and it was so dark that i could no longer distinguish details  then i climbed down to my companions waiting for me so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree  for once i was the hero of the expedition  alone i had thought of it and alone i had done it and here was the chart which would save us a months blind groping among unknown dangers  each of them shook me solemnly by the hand  but before they discussed the details of my map i had to tell them of my encounter with the apeman among the branches  he has been there all the time said i  how do you know that asked lord john  because i have never been without that feeling that something malevolent was watching us i mentioned it to you professor challenger  our young friend certainly said something of the kind  he is also the one among us who is endowed with that celtic temperament which would make him sensitive to such impressions  the whole theory of telepathy began summerlee filling his pipe  is too vast to be now discussed said challenger with decision tell me now he added with the air of a bishop addressing a sundayschool did you happen to observe whether the creature could cross its thumb over its palm  no indeed  had it a tail  no  was the foot prehensile  i do not think it could have made off so fast among the branches if it could not get a grip with its feet  in south america there are if my memory serves meyou will check the observation professor summerleesome thirtysix species of monkeys but the anthropoid ape is unknown  it is clear however that he exists in this country and that he is not the hairy gorillalike variety which is never seen out of africa or the east  i was inclined to interpolate as i looked at him that i had seen his first cousin in kensington  this is a whiskered and colorless type the latter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spends his days in arboreal seclusion  the question which we have to face is whether he approaches more closely to the ape or the man  in the latter case he may well approximate to what the vulgar have called the missing link the solution of this problem is our immediate duty  it is nothing of the sort said summerlee abruptly  now that through the intelligence and activity of mr malone i cannot help quoting the words we have got our chart our one and only immediate duty is to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place  the fleshpots of civilization groaned challenger  the inkpots of civilization sir  it is our task to put on record what we have seen and to leave the further exploration to others  you all agreed as much before mr malone got us the chart  well said challenger i admit that my mind will be more at ease when i am assured that the result of our expedition has been conveyed to our friends  how we are to get down from this place i have not as yet an idea  i have never yet encountered any problem however which my inventive brain was unable to solve and i promise you that tomorrow i will turn my attention to the question of our descent and so the matter was allowed to rest  but that evening by the light of the fire and of a single candle the first map of the lost world was elaborated  every detail which i had roughly noted from my watchtower was drawn out in its relative place challengers pencil hovered over the great blank which marked the lake  what shall we call it he asked  why should you not take the chance of perpetuating your own name said summerlee with his usual touch of acidity  i trust sir that my name will have other and more personal claims upon posterity said challenger severely  any ignoramus can hand down his worthless memory by imposing it upon a mountain or a river  i need no such monument  summerlee with a twisted smile was about to make some fresh assault when lord john hastened to intervene  its up to you young fellah to name the lake said he  you saw it first and by george if you choose to put lake malone on it no one has a better right  by all means  let our young friend give it a name said challenger  then said i blushing i dare say as i said it let it be named lake gladys  dont you think the central lake would be more descriptive remarked summerlee  i should prefer lake gladys  challenger looked at me sympathetically and shook his great head in mock disapproval  boys will be boys said he  lake gladys let it be                                chapter xii                  it was dreadful in the forest  i have saidor perhaps i have not said for my memory plays me sad tricks these daysthat i glowed with pride when three such men as my comrades thanked me for having saved or at least greatly helped the situation  as the youngster of the party not merely in years but in experience character knowledge and all that goes to make a man i had been overshadowed from the first  and now i was coming into my own  i warmed at the thought  alas for the pride which goes before a fall  that little glow of selfsatisfaction that added measure of selfconfidence were to lead me on that very night to the most dreadful experience of my life ending with a shock which turns my heart sick when i think of it  it came about in this way  i had been unduly excited by the adventure of the tree and sleep seemed to be impossible  summerlee was on guard sitting hunched over our small fire a quaint angular figure his rifle across his knees and his pointed goatlike beard wagging with each weary nod of his head  lord john lay silent wrapped in the south american poncho which he wore while challenger snored with a roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods  the full moon was shining brightly and the air was crisply cold  what a night for a walk  and then suddenly came the thought why not  suppose i stole softly away suppose i made my way down to the central lake suppose i was back at breakfast with some record of the placewould i not in that case be thought an even more worthy associate  then if summerlee carried the day and some means of escape were found we should return to london with firsthand knowledge of the central mystery of the plateau to which i alone of all men would have penetrated  i thought of gladys with her there are heroisms all round us  i seemed to hear her voice as she said it  i thought also of mcardle  what a three column article for the paper  what a foundation for a career  a correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach  i clutched at a gunmy pockets were full of cartridgesand parting the thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba quickly slipped out  my last glance showed me the unconscious summerlee most futile of sentinels still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the smouldering fire  i had not gone a hundred yards before i deeply repented my rashness  i may have said somewhere in this chronicle that i am too imaginative to be a really courageous man but that i have an overpowering fear of seeming afraid  this was the power which now carried me onwards  i simply could not slink back with nothing done  even if my comrades should not have missed me and should never know of my weakness there would still remain some intolerable selfshame in my own soul  and yet i shuddered at the position in which i found myself and would have given all i possessed at that moment to have been honorably free of the whole business  it was dreadful in the forest  the trees grew so thickly and their foliage spread so widely that i could see nothing of the moonlight save that here and there the high branches made a tangled filigree against the starry sky  as the eyes became more used to the obscurity one learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the treesthat some were dimly visible while between and among them there were coalblack shadowed patches like the mouths of caves from which i shrank in horror as i passed  i thought of the despairing yell of the tortured iguanodonthat dreadful cry which had echoed through the woods  i thought too of the glimpse i had in the light of lord johns torch of that bloated warty bloodslavering muzzle  even now i was on its huntingground  at any instant it might spring upon me from the shadowsthis nameless and horrible monster  i stopped and picking a cartridge from my pocket i opened the breech of my gun  as i touched the lever my heart leaped within me  it was the shotgun not the rifle which i had taken  again the impulse to return swept over me  here surely was a most excellent reason for my failureone for which no one would think the less of me  but again the foolish pride fought against that very word i could notmust notfail  after all my rifle would probably have been as useless as a shotgun against such dangers as i might meet  if i were to go back to camp to change my weapon i could hardly expect to enter and to leave again without being seen  in that case there would be explanations and my attempt would no longer be all my own  after a little hesitation then i screwed up my courage and continued upon my way my useless gun under my arm  the darkness of the forest had been alarming but even worse was the white still flood of moonlight in the open glade of the iguanodons hid among the bushes i looked out at it  none of the great brutes were in sight  perhaps the tragedy which had befallen one of them had driven them from their feedingground  in the misty silvery night i could see no sign of any living thing  taking courage therefore i slipped rapidly across it and among the jungle on the farther side i picked up once again the brook which was my guide  it was a cheery companion gurgling and chuckling as it ran like the dear old troutstream in the west country where i have fished at night in my boyhood  so long as i followed it down i must come to the lake and so long as i followed it back i must come to the camp  often i had to lose sight of it on account of the tangled brushwood but i was always within earshot of its tinkle and splash  as one descended the slope the woods became thinner and bushes with occasional high trees took the place of the forest  i could make good progress therefore and i could see without being seen  i passed close to the pterodactyl swamp and as i did so with a dry crisp leathery rattle of wings one of these great creaturesit was twenty feet at least from tip to tiprose up from somewhere near me and soared into the air  as it passed across the face of the moon the light shone clearly through the membranous wings and it looked like a flying skeleton against the white tropical radiance  i crouched low among the bushes for i knew from past experience that with a single cry the creature could bring a hundred of its loathsome mates about my ears  it was not until it had settled again that i dared to steal onwards upon my journey  the night had been exceedingly still but as i advanced i became conscious of a low rumbling sound a continuous murmur somewhere in front of me  this grew louder as i proceeded until at last it was clearly quite close to me  when i stood still the sound was constant so that it seemed to come from some stationary cause  it was like a boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot  soon i came upon the source of it for in the center of a small clearing i found a lakeor a pool rather for it was not larger than the basin of the trafalgar square fountainof some black pitchlike stuff the surface of which rose and fell in great blisters of bursting gas  the air above it was shimmering with heat and the ground round was so hot that i could hardly bear to lay my hand on it  it was clear that the great volcanic outburst which had raised this strange plateau so many years ago had not yet entirely spent its forces  blackened rocks and mounds of lava i had already seen everywhere peeping out from amid the luxuriant vegetation which draped them but this asphalt pool in the jungle was the first sign that we had of actual existing activity on the slopes of the ancient crater  i had no time to examine it further for i had need to hurry if i were to be back in camp in the morning  it was a fearsome walk and one which will be with me so long as memory holds  in the great moonlight clearings i slunk along among the shadows on the margin  in the jungle i crept forward stopping with a beating heart whenever i heard as i often did the crash of breaking branches as some wild beast went past  now and then great shadows loomed up for an instant and were gonegreat silent shadows which seemed to prowl upon padded feet  how often i stopped with the intention of returning and yet every time my pride conquered my fear and sent me on again until my object should be attained  at last my watch showed that it was one in the morning i saw the gleam of water amid the openings of the jungle and ten minutes later i was among the reeds upon the borders of the central lake  i was exceedingly dry so i lay down and took a long draught of its waters which were fresh and cold  there was a broad pathway with many tracks upon it at the spot which i had found so that it was clearly one of the drinkingplaces of the animals  close to the waters edge there was a huge isolated block of lava  up this i climbed and lying on the top i had an excellent view in every direction  the first thing which i saw filled me with amazement  when i described the view from the summit of the great tree i said that on the farther cliff i could see a number of dark spots which appeared to be the mouths of caves  now as i looked up at the same cliffs i saw discs of light in every direction ruddy clearlydefined patches like the portholes of a liner in the darkness  for a moment i thought it was the lavaglow from some volcanic action but this could not be so  any volcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among the rocks  what then was the alternative  it was wonderful and yet it must surely be  these ruddy spots must be the reflection of fires within the cavesfires which could only be lit by the hand of man there were human beings then upon the plateau  how gloriously my expedition was justified  here was news indeed for us to bear back with us to london  for a long time i lay and watched these red quivering blotches of light  i suppose they were ten miles off from me yet even at that distance one could observe how from time to time they twinkled or were obscured as someone passed before them  what would i not have given to be able to crawl up to them to peep in and to take back some word to my comrades as to the appearance and character of the race who lived in so strange a place  it was out of the question for the moment and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we had some definite knowledge upon the point  lake gladysmy own lakelay like a sheet of quicksilver before me with a reflected moon shining brightly in the center of it  it was shallow for in many places i saw low sandbanks protruding above the water  everywhere upon the still surface i could see signs of life sometimes mere rings and ripples in the water sometimes the gleam of a great silversided fish in the air sometimes the arched slatecolored back of some passing monster  once upon a yellow sandbank i saw a creature like a huge swan with a clumsy body and a high flexible neck shuffling about upon the margin  presently it plunged in and for some time i could see the arched neck and darting head undulating over the water  then it dived and i saw it no more  my attention was soon drawn away from these distant sights and brought back to what was going on at my very feet  two creatures like large armadillos had come down to the drinkingplace and were squatting at the edge of the water their long flexible tongues like red ribbons shooting in and out as they lapped  a huge deer with branching horns a magnificent creature which carried itself like a king came down with its doe and two fawns and drank beside the armadillos  no such deer exist anywhere else upon earth for the moose or elks which i have seen would hardly have reached its shoulders  presently it gave a warning snort and was off with its family among the reeds while the armadillos also scuttled for shelter  a newcomer a most monstrous animal was coming down the path  for a moment i wondered where i could have seen that ungainly shape that arched back with triangular fringes along it that strange birdlike head held close to the ground  then it came back to me  it was the stegosaurusthe very creature which maple white had preserved in his sketchbook and which had been the first object which arrested the attention of challenger  there he wasperhaps the very specimen which the american artist had encountered  the ground shook beneath his tremendous weight and his gulpings of water resounded through the still night  for five minutes he was so close to my rock that by stretching out my hand i could have touched the hideous waving hackles upon his back  then he lumbered away and was lost among the boulders  looking at my watch i saw that it was halfpast two oclock and high time therefore that i started upon my homeward journey  there was no difficulty about the direction in which i should return for all along i had kept the little brook upon my left and it opened into the central lake within a stonesthrow of the boulder upon which i had been lying i set off therefore in high spirits for i felt that i had done good work and was bringing back a fine budget of news for my companions foremost of all of course were the sight of the fiery caves and the certainty that some troglodytic race inhabited them  but besides that i could speak from experience of the central lake  i could testify that it was full of strange creatures and i had seen several land forms of primeval life which we had not before encountered  i reflected as i walked that few men in the world could have spent a stranger night or added more to human knowledge in the course of it  i was plodding up the slope turning these thoughts over in my mind and had reached a point which may have been halfway to home when my mind was brought back to my own position by a strange noise behind me it was something between a snore and a growl low deep and exceedingly menacing  some strange creature was evidently near me but nothing could be seen so i hastened more rapidly upon my way  i had traversed half a mile or so when suddenly the sound was repeated still behind me but louder and more menacing than before  my heart stood still within me as it flashed across me that the beast whatever it was must surely be after me   my skin grew cold and my hair rose at the thought  that these monsters should tear each other to pieces was a part of the strange struggle for existence but that they should turn upon modern man that they should deliberately track and hunt down the predominant human was a staggering and fearsome thought  i remembered again the bloodbeslobbered face which we had seen in the glare of lord johns torch like some horrible vision from the deepest circle of dantes hell  with my knees shaking beneath me i stood and glared with starting eyes down the moonlit path which lay behind me  all was quiet as in a dream landscape  silver clearings and the black patches of the bushesnothing else could i see  then from out of the silence imminent and threatening there came once more that low throaty croaking far louder and closer than before  there could no longer be a doubt  something was on my trail and was closing in upon me every minute  i stood like a man paralyzed still staring at the ground which i had traversed  then suddenly i saw it  there was movement among the bushes at the far end of the clearing which i had just traversed  a great dark shadow disengaged itself and hopped out into the clear moonlight  i say hopped advisedly for the beast moved like a kangaroo springing along in an erect position upon its powerful hind legs while its front ones were held bent in front of it  it was of enormous size and power like an erect elephant but its movements in spite of its bulk were exceedingly alert  for a moment as i saw its shape i hoped that it was an iguanodon which i knew to be harmless but ignorant as i was i soon saw that this was a very different creature  instead of the gentle deershaped head of the great threetoed leafeater this beast had a broad squat toadlike face like that which had alarmed us in our camp  his ferocious cry and the horrible energy of his pursuit both assured me that this was surely one of the great flesheating dinosaurs the most terrible beasts which have ever walked this earth  as the huge brute loped along it dropped forward upon its forepaws and brought its nose to the ground every twenty yards or so  it was smelling out my trail  sometimes for an instant it was at fault  then it would catch it up again and come bounding swiftly along the path i had taken  even now when i think of that nightmare the sweat breaks out upon my brow  what could i do  my useless fowlingpiece was in my hand  what help could i get from that  i looked desperately round for some rock or tree but i was in a bushy jungle with nothing higher than a sapling within sight while i knew that the creature behind me could tear down an ordinary tree as though it were a reed  my only possible chance lay in flight  i could not move swiftly over the rough broken ground but as i looked round me in despair i saw a wellmarked hardbeaten path which ran across in front of me  we had seen several of the sort the runs of various wild beasts during our expeditions  along this i could perhaps hold my own for i was a fast runner and in excellent condition  flinging away my useless gun i set myself to do such a halfmile as i have never done before or since  my limbs ached my chest heaved i felt that my throat would burst for want of air and yet with that horror behind me i ran and i ran and ran  at last i paused hardly able to move  for a moment i thought that i had thrown him off  the path lay still behind me  and then suddenly with a crashing and a rending a thudding of giant feet and a panting of monster lungs the beast was upon me once more  he was at my very heels  i was lost  madman that i was to linger so long before i fled  up to then he had hunted by scent and his movement was slow  but he had actually seen me as i started to run  from then onwards he had hunted by sight for the path showed him where i had gone  now as he came round the curve he was springing in great bounds  the moonlight shone upon his huge projecting eyes the row of enormous teeth in his open mouth and the gleaming fringe of claws upon his short powerful forearms  with a scream of terror i turned and rushed wildly down the path  behind me the thick gasping breathing of the creature sounded louder and louder his heavy footfall was beside me  every instant i expected to feel his grip upon my back  and then suddenly there came a crashi was falling through space and everything beyond was darkness and rest  as i emerged from my unconsciousnesswhich could not i think have lasted more than a few minutesi was aware of a most dreadful and penetrating smell  putting out my hand in the darkness i came upon something which felt like a huge lump of meat while my other hand closed upon a large bone  up above me there was a circle of starlit sky which showed me that i was lying at the bottom of a deep pit slowly i staggered to my feet and felt myself all over  i was stiff and sore from head to foot but there was no limb which would not move no joint which would not bend  as the circumstances of my fall came back into my confused brain i looked up in terror expecting to see that dreadful head silhouetted against the paling sky  there was no sign of the monster however nor could i hear any sound from above  i began to walk slowly round therefore feeling in every direction to find out what this strange place could be into which i had been so opportunely precipitated  it was as i have said a pit with sharplysloping walls and a level bottom about twenty feet across  this bottom was littered with great gobbets of flesh most of which was in the last state of putridity the atmosphere was poisonous and horrible  after tripping and stumbling over these lumps of decay i came suddenly against something hard and i found that an upright post was firmly fixed in the center of the hollow  it was so high that i could not reach the top of it with my hand and it appeared to be covered with grease  suddenly i remembered that i had a tin box of waxvestas in my pocket striking one of them i was able at last to form some opinion of this place into which i had fallen  there could be no question as to its nature  it was a trapmade by the hand of man  the post in the center some nine feet long was sharpened at the upper end and was black with the stale blood of the creatures who had been impaled upon it  the remains scattered about were fragments of the victims which had been cut away in order to clear the stake for the next who might blunder in  i remembered that challenger had declared that man could not exist upon the plateau since with his feeble weapons he could not hold his own against the monsters who roamed over it  but now it was clear enough how it could be done  in their narrowmouthed caves the natives whoever they might be had refuges into which the huge saurians could not penetrate while with their developed brains they were capable of setting such traps covered with branches across the paths which marked the run of the animals as would destroy them in spite of all their strength and activity  man was always the master  the sloping wall of the pit was not difficult for an active man to climb but i hesitated long before i trusted myself within reach of the dreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me  how did i know that he was not lurking in the nearest clump of bushes waiting for my reappearance  i took heart however as i recalled a conversation between challenger and summerlee upon the habits of the great saurians both were agreed that the monsters were practically brainless that there was no room for reason in their tiny cranial cavities and that if they have disappeared from the rest of the world it was assuredly on account of their own stupidity which made it impossible for them to adapt themselves to changing conditions  to lie in wait for me now would mean that the creature had appreciated what had happened to me and this in turn would argue some power connecting cause and effect  surely it was more likely that a brainless creature acting solely by vague predatory instinct would give up the chase when i disappeared and after a pause of astonishment would wander away in search of some other prey  i clambered to the edge of the pit and looked over  the stars were fading the sky was whitening and the cold wind of morning blew pleasantly upon my face  i could see or hear nothing of my enemy slowly i climbed out and sat for a while upon the ground ready to spring back into my refuge if any danger should appear  then reassured by the absolute stillness and by the growing light i took my courage in both hands and stole back along the path which i had come some distance down it i picked up my gun and shortly afterwards struck the brook which was my guide  so with many a frightened backward glance i made for home  and suddenly there came something to remind me of my absent companions in the clear still morning air there sounded far away the sharp hard note of a single rifleshot  i paused and listened but there was nothing more  for a moment i was shocked at the thought that some sudden danger might have befallen them  but then a simpler and more natural explanation came to my mind  it was now broad daylight  no doubt my absence had been noticed  they had imagined that i was lost in the woods and had fired this shot to guide me home  it is true that we had made a strict resolution against firing but if it seemed to them that i might be in danger they would not hesitate  it was for me now to hurry on as fast as possible and so to reassure them  i was weary and spent so my progress was not so fast as i wished but at last i came into regions which i knew  there was the swamp of the pterodactyls upon my left there in front of me was the glade of the iguanodons  now i was in the last belt of trees which separated me from fort challenger  i raised my voice in a cheery shout to allay their fears  no answering greeting came back to me  my heart sank at that ominous stillness  i quickened my pace into a run  the zareba rose before me even as i had left it but the gate was open  i rushed in  in the cold morning light it was a fearful sight which met my eyes  our effects were scattered in wild confusion over the ground my comrades had disappeared and close to the smouldering ashes of our fire the grass was stained crimson with a hideous pool of blood  i was so stunned by this sudden shock that for a time i must have nearly lost my reason  i have a vague recollection as one remembers a bad dream of rushing about through the woods all round the empty camp calling wildly for my companions  no answer came back from the silent shadows  the horrible thought that i might never see them again that i might find myself abandoned all alone in that dreadful place with no possible way of descending into the world below that i might live and die in that nightmare country drove me to desperation  i could have torn my hair and beaten my head in my despair  only now did i realize how i had learned to lean upon my companions upon the serene selfconfidence of challenger and upon the masterful humorous coolness of lord john roxton  without them i was like a child in the dark helpless and powerless  i did not know which way to turn or what i should do first  after a period during which i sat in bewilderment i set myself to try and discover what sudden misfortune could have befallen my companions the whole disordered appearance of the camp showed that there had been some sort of attack and the rifleshot no doubt marked the time when it had occurred  that there should have been only one shot showed that it had been all over in an instant  the rifles still lay upon the ground and one of themlord johnshad the empty cartridge in the breech  the blankets of challenger and of summerlee beside the fire suggested that they had been asleep at the time  the cases of ammunition and of food were scattered about in a wild litter together with our unfortunate cameras and platecarriers but none of them were missing  on the other hand all the exposed provisionsand i remembered that there were a considerable quantity of themwere gone they were animals then and not natives who had made the inroad for surely the latter would have left nothing behind  but if animals or some single terrible animal then what had become of my comrades  a ferocious beast would surely have destroyed them and left their remains  it is true that there was that one hideous pool of blood which told of violence  such a monster as had pursued me during the night could have carried away a victim as easily as a cat would a mouse  in that case the others would have followed in pursuit  but then they would assuredly have taken their rifles with them  the more i tried to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could i find any plausible explanation  i searched round in the forest but could see no tracks which could help me to a conclusion  once i lost myself and it was only by good luck and after an hour of wandering that i found the camp once more  suddenly a thought came to me and brought some little comfort to my heart  i was not absolutely alone in the world  down at the bottom of the cliff and within call of me was waiting the faithful zambo  i went to the edge of the plateau and looked over  sure enough he was squatting among his blankets beside his fire in his little camp  but to my amazement a second man was seated in front of him  for an instant my heart leaped for joy as i thought that one of my comrades had made his way safely down  but a second glance dispelled the hope the rising sun shone red upon the mans skin  he was an indian  i shouted loudly and waved my handkerchief  presently zambo looked up waved his hand and turned to ascend the pinnacle  in a short time he was standing close to me and listening with deep distress to the story which i told him  devil got them for sure massa malone said he  you got into the devils country sah and he take you all to himself  you take advice massa malone and come down quick else he get you as well  how can i come down zambo  you get creepers from trees massa malone  throw them over here  i make fast to this stump and so you have bridge  we have thought of that  there are no creepers here which could bear us  send for ropes massa malone  who can i send and where  send to indian villages sah  plenty hide rope in indian village indian down below send him  who is he  one of our indians  other ones beat him and take away his pay  he come back to us  ready now to take letter bring ropeanything  to take a letter  why not  perhaps he might bring help but in any case he would ensure that our lives were not spent for nothing and that news of all that we had won for science should reach our friends at home  i had two completed letters already waiting  i would spend the day in writing a third which would bring my experiences absolutely up to date  the indian could bear this back to the world  i ordered zambo therefore to come again in the evening and i spent my miserable and lonely day in recording my own adventures of the night before  i also drew up a note to be given to any white merchant or captain of a steamboat whom the indian could find imploring them to see that ropes were sent to us since our lives must depend upon it these documents i threw to zambo in the evening and also my purse which contained three english sovereigns  these were to be given to the indian and he was promised twice as much if he returned with the ropes  so now you will understand my dear mr mcardle how this communication reaches you and you will also know the truth in case you never hear again from your unfortunate correspondent  tonight i am too weary and too depressed to make my plans  tomorrow i must think out some way by which i shall keep in touch with this camp and yet search round for any traces of my unhappy friends                                chapter xiii                 a sight which i shall never forget  just as the sun was setting upon that melancholy night i saw the lonely figure of the indian upon the vast plain beneath me and i watched him our one faint hope of salvation until he disappeared in the rising mists of evening which lay rosetinted from the setting sun between the faroff river and me  it was quite dark when i at last turned back to our stricken camp and my last vision as i went was the red gleam of zambos fire the one point of light in the wide world below as was his faithful presence in my own shadowed soul  and yet i felt happier than i had done since this crushing blow had fallen upon me for it was good to think that the world should know what we had done so that at the worst our names should not perish with our bodies but should go down to posterity associated with the result of our labors  it was an awesome thing to sleep in that illfated camp and yet it was even more unnerving to do so in the jungle  one or the other it must be  prudence on the one hand warned me that i should remain on guard but exhausted nature on the other declared that i should do nothing of the kind  i climbed up on to a limb of the great gingko tree but there was no secure perch on its rounded surface and i should certainly have fallen off and broken my neck the moment i began to doze  i got down therefore and pondered over what i should do finally i closed the door of the zareba lit three separate fires in a triangle and having eaten a hearty supper dropped off into a profound sleep from which i had a strange and most welcome awakening  in the early morning just as day was breaking a hand was laid upon my arm and starting up with all my nerves in a tingle and my hand feeling for a rifle i gave a cry of joy as in the cold gray light i saw lord john roxton kneeling beside me  it was heand yet it was not he  i had left him calm in his bearing correct in his person prim in his dress  now he was pale and wildeyed gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast his gaunt face was scratched and bloody his clothes were hanging in rags and his hat was gone  i stared in amazement but he gave me no chance for questions  he was grabbing at our stores all the time he spoke  quick young fellah  quick he cried  every moment counts  get the rifles both of them  i have the other two  now all the cartridges you can gather  fill up your pockets  now some food half a dozen tins will do  thats all right  dont wait to talk or think  get a move on or we are done  still halfawake and unable to imagine what it all might mean i found myself hurrying madly after him through the wood a rifle under each arm and a pile of various stores in my hands  he dodged in and out through the thickest of the scrub until he came to a dense clump of brushwood  into this he rushed regardless of thorns and threw himself into the heart of it pulling me down by his side  there he panted  i think we are safe here  theyll make for the camp as sure as fate  it will be their first idea  but this should puzzle em  what is it all i asked when i had got my breath  where are the professors  and who is it that is after us  the apemen he cried  my god what brutes  dont raise your voice for they have long earssharp eyes too but no power of scent so far as i could judge so i dont think they can sniff us out  where have you been young fellah  you were well out of it  in a few sentences i whispered what i had done  pretty bad said he when he had heard of the dinosaur and the pit it isnt quite the place for a rest cure  what  but i had no idea what its possibilities were until those devils got hold of us  the maneatin papuans had me once but they are chesterfields compared to this crowd  how did it happen i asked  it was in the early mornin  our learned friends were just stirrin hadnt even begun to argue yet  suddenly it rained apes  they came down as thick as apples out of a tree  they had been assemblin in the dark i suppose until that great tree over our heads was heavy with them  i shot one of them through the belly but before we knew where we were they had us spreadeagled on our backs  i call them apes but they carried sticks and stones in their hands and jabbered talk to each other and ended up by tyin our hands with creepers so they are ahead of any beast that i have seen in my wanderins  apementhats what they aremissin links and i wish they had stayed missin  they carried off their wounded comradehe was bleedin like a pigand then they sat around us and if ever i saw frozen murder it was in their faces  they were big fellows as big as a man and a deal stronger curious glassy gray eyes they have under red tufts and they just sat and gloated and gloated  challenger is no chicken but even he was cowed  he managed to struggle to his feet and yelled out at them to have done with it and get it over  i think he had gone a bit off his head at the suddenness of it for he raged and cursed at them like a lunatic  if they had been a row of his favorite pressmen he could not have slanged them worse  well what did they do  i was enthralled by the strange story which my companion was whispering into my ear while all the time his keen eyes were shooting in every direction and his hand grasping his cocked rifle  i thought it was the end of us but instead of that it started them on a new line  they all jabbered and chattered together  then one of them stood out beside challenger  youll smile young fellah but pon my word they might have been kinsmen  i couldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes  this old apemanhe was their chiefwas a sort of red challenger with every one of our friends beauty points only just a trifle more so  he had the short body the big shoulders the round chest no neck a great ruddy frill of a beard the tufted eyebrows the what do you want damn you look about the eyes and the whole catalogue  when the apeman stood by challenger and put his paw on his shoulder the thing was complete summerlee was a bit hysterical and he laughed till he cried  the apemen laughed tooor at least they put up the devil of a cacklinand they set to work to drag us off through the forest  they wouldnt touch the guns and thingsthought them dangerous i expectbut they carried away all our loose food  summerlee and i got some rough handlin on the waytheres my skin and my clothes to prove itfor they took us a beeline through the brambles and their own hides are like leather  but challenger was all right  four of them carried him shoulder high and he went like a roman emperor  whats that  it was a strange clicking noise in the distance not unlike castanets  there they go said my companion slipping cartridges into the second double barrelled express  load them all up young fellah my lad for were not going to be taken alive and dont you think it  thats the row they make when they are excited  by george theyll have something to excite them if they put us up  the last stand of the grays wont be in it   with their rifles grasped in their stiffened hands mid a ring of the dead and dyin as some fathead sings  can you hear them now  very far away  that little lot will do no good but i expect their search parties are all over the wood  well i was telling you my tale of woe  they got us soon to this town of theirsabout a thousand huts of branches and leaves in a great grove of trees near the edge of the cliff  its three or four miles from here  the filthy beasts fingered me all over and i feel as if i should never be clean again  they tied us upthe fellow who handled me could tie like a bosunand there we lay with our toes up beneath a tree while a great brute stood guard over us with a club in his hand  when i say we i mean summerlee and myself  old challenger was up a tree eatin pines and havin the time of his life im bound to say that he managed to get some fruit to us and with his own hands he loosened our bonds  if youd seen him sitting up in that tree hobnobbin with his twin brotherand singin in that rollin bass of his ring out wild bells cause music of any kind seemed to put em in a good humor youd have smiled but we werent in much mood for laughin as you can guess  they were inclined within limits to let him do what he liked but they drew the line pretty sharply at us it was a mighty consolation to us all to know that you were runnin loose and had the archives in your keepin  well now young fellah ill tell you what will surprise you  you say you saw signs of men and fires traps and the like  well we have seen the natives themselves  poor devils they were downfaced little chaps and had enough to make them so  it seems that the humans hold one side of this plateauover yonder where you saw the cavesand the apemen hold this side and there is bloody war between them all the time  thats the situation so far as i could follow it well yesterday the apemen got hold of a dozen of the humans and brought them in as prisoners  you never heard such a jabberin and shriekin in your life  the men were little red fellows and had been bitten and clawed so that they could hardly walk  the apemen put two of them to death there and thenfairly pulled the arm off one of themit was perfectly beastly  plucky little chaps they are and hardly gave a squeak  but it turned us absolutely sick  summerlee fainted and even challenger had as much as he could stand  i think they have cleared dont you  we listened intently but nothing save the calling of the birds broke the deep peace of the forest  lord roxton went on with his story  i think you have had the escape of your life young fellah my lad  it was catchin those indians that put you clean out of their heads else they would have been back to the camp for you as sure as fate and gathered you in  of course as you said they have been watchin us from the beginnin out of that tree and they knew perfectly well that we were one short  however they could think only of this new haul so it was i and not a bunch of apes that dropped in on you in the morning  well we had a horrid business afterwards  my god  what a nightmare the whole thing is  you remember the great bristle of sharp canes down below where we found the skeleton of the american  well that is just under apetown and thats the jumpinoff place of their prisoners  i expect theres heaps of skeletons there if we looked for em  they have a sort of clear paradeground on the top and they make a proper ceremony about it  one by one the poor devils have to jump and the game is to see whether they are merely dashed to pieces or whether they get skewered on the canes  they took us out to see it and the whole tribe lined up on the edge  four of the indians jumped and the canes went through em like knittin needles through a pat of butter  no wonder we found that poor yankees skeleton with the canes growin between his ribs  it was horriblebut it was doocedly interestin too  we were all fascinated to see them take the dive even when we thought it would be our turn next on the springboard  well it wasnt  they kept six of the indians up for todaythats how i understood itbut i fancy we were to be the star performers in the show  challenger might get off but summerlee and i were in the bill  their language is more than half signs and it was not hard to follow them  so i thought it was time we made a break for it  i had been plottin it out a bit and had one or two things clear in my mind it was all on me for summerlee was useless and challenger not much better  the only time they got together they got slangin because they couldnt agree upon the scientific classification of these redheaded devils that had got hold of us  one said it was the dryopithecus of java the other said it was pithecanthropus  madness i call itloonies both  but as i say i had thought out one or two points that were helpful  one was that these brutes could not run as fast as a man in the open  they have short bandy legs you see and heavy bodies  even challenger could give a few yards in a hundred to the best of them and you or i would be a perfect shrubb  another point was that they knew nothin about guns  i dont believe they ever understood how the fellow i shot came by his hurt  if we could get at our guns there was no sayin what we could do  so i broke away early this mornin gave my guard a kick in the tummy that laid him out and sprinted for the camp  there i got you and the guns and here we are  but the professors i cried in consternation  well we must just go back and fetch em  i couldnt bring em with me  challenger was up the tree and summerlee was not fit for the effort  the only chance was to get the guns and try a rescue  of course they may scupper them at once in revenge  i dont think they would touch challenger but i wouldnt answer for summerlee  but they would have had him in any case  of that i am certain  so i havent made matters any worse by boltin  but we are honor bound to go back and have them out or see it through with them  so you can make up your soul young fellah my lad for it will be one way or the other before evenin  i have tried to imitate here lord roxtons jerky talk his short strong sentences the halfhumorous halfreckless tone that ran through it all  but he was a born leader  as danger thickened his jaunty manner would increase his speech become more racy his cold eyes glitter into ardent life and his don quixote moustache bristle with joyous excitement  his love of danger his intense appreciation of the drama of an adventureall the more intense for being held tightly inhis consistent view that every peril in life is a form of sport a fierce game betwixt you and fate with death as a forfeit made him a wonderful companion at such hours  if it were not for our fears as to the fate of our companions it would have been a positive joy to throw myself with such a man into such an affair  we were rising from our brushwood hidingplace when suddenly i felt his grip upon my arm  by george he whispered here they come  from where we lay we could look down a brown aisle arched with green formed by the trunks and branches  along this a party of the apemen were passing  they went in single file with bent legs and rounded backs their hands occasionally touching the ground their heads turning to left and right as they trotted along  their crouching gait took away from their height but i should put them at five feet or so with long arms and enormous chests  many of them carried sticks and at the distance they looked like a line of very hairy and deformed human beings  for a moment i caught this clear glimpse of them  then they were lost among the bushes  not this time said lord john who had caught up his rifle  our best chance is to lie quiet until they have given up the search  then we shall see whether we cant get back to their town and hit em where it hurts most  give em an hour and well march  we filled in the time by opening one of our food tins and making sure of our breakfast  lord roxton had had nothing but some fruit since the morning before and ate like a starving man  then at last our pockets bulging with cartridges and a rifle in each hand we started off upon our mission of rescue  before leaving it we carefully marked our little hidingplace among the brushwood and its bearing to fort challenger that we might find it again if we needed it  we slunk through the bushes in silence until we came to the very edge of the cliff close to the old camp  there we halted and lord john gave me some idea of his plans  so long as we are among the thick trees these swine are our masters said he  they can see us and we cannot see them  but in the open it is different  there we can move faster than they  so we must stick to the open all we can  the edge of the plateau has fewer large trees than further inland  so thats our line of advance  go slowly keep your eyes open and your rifle ready  above all never let them get you prisoner while there is a cartridge leftthats my last word to you young fellah  when we reached the edge of the cliff i looked over and saw our good old black zambo sitting smoking on a rock below us  i would have given a great deal to have hailed him and told him how we were placed but it was too dangerous lest we should be heard  the woods seemed to be full of the apemen again and again we heard their curious clicking chatter  at such times we plunged into the nearest clump of bushes and lay still until the sound had passed away  our advance therefore was very slow and two hours at least must have passed before i saw by lord johns cautious movements that we must be close to our destination  he motioned to me to lie still and he crawled forward himself  in a minute he was back again his face quivering with eagerness  come said he  come quick i hope to the lord we are not too late already  i found myself shaking with nervous excitement as i scrambled forward and lay down beside him looking out through the bushes at a clearing which stretched before us  it was a sight which i shall never forget until my dying dayso weird so impossible that i do not know how i am to make you realize it or how in a few years i shall bring myself to believe in it if i live to sit once more on a lounge in the savage club and look out on the drab solidity of the embankment  i know that it will seem then to be some wild nightmare some delirium of fever  yet i will set it down now while it is still fresh in my memory and one at least the man who lay in the damp grasses by my side will know if i have lied  a wide open space lay before ussome hundreds of yards acrossall green turf and low bracken growing to the very edge of the cliff round this clearing there was a semicircle of trees with curious huts built of foliage piled one above the other among the branches  a rookery with every nest a little house would best convey the idea the openings of these huts and the branches of the trees were thronged with a dense mob of apepeople whom from their size i took to be the females and infants of the tribe  they formed the background of the picture and were all looking out with eager interest at the same scene which fascinated and bewildered us  in the open and near the edge of the cliff there had assembled a crowd of some hundred of these shaggy redhaired creatures many of them of immense size and all of them horrible to look upon  there was a certain discipline among them for none of them attempted to break the line which had been formed  in front there stood a small group of indianslittle cleanlimbed red fellows whose skins glowed like polished bronze in the strong sunlight  a tall thin white man was standing beside them his head bowed his arms folded his whole attitude expressive of his horror and dejection  there was no mistaking the angular form of professor summerlee  in front of and around this dejected group of prisoners were several apemen who watched them closely and made all escape impossible then right out from all the others and close to the edge of the cliff were two figures so strange and under other circumstances so ludicrous that they absorbed my attention  the one was our comrade professor challenger  the remains of his coat still hung in strips from his shoulders but his shirt had been all torn out and his great beard merged itself in the black tangle which covered his mighty chest he had lost his hat and his hair which had grown long in our wanderings was flying in wild disorder  a single day seemed to have changed him from the highest product of modern civilization to the most desperate savage in south america  beside him stood his master the king of the apemen  in all things he was as lord john had said the very image of our professor save that his coloring was red instead of black  the same short broad figure the same heavy shoulders the same forward hang of the arms the same bristling beard merging itself in the hairy chest  only above the eyebrows where the sloping forehead and low curved skull of the apeman were in sharp contrast to the broad brow and magnificent cranium of the european could one see any marked difference  at every other point the king was an absurd parody of the professor  all this which takes me so long to describe impressed itself upon me in a few seconds  then we had very different things to think of for an active drama was in progress  two of the apemen had seized one of the indians out of the group and dragged him forward to the edge of the cliff  the king raised his hand as a signal  they caught the man by his leg and arm and swung him three times backwards and forwards with tremendous violence  then with a frightful heave they shot the poor wretch over the precipice  with such force did they throw him that he curved high in the air before beginning to drop  as he vanished from sight the whole assembly except the guards rushed forward to the edge of the precipice and there was a long pause of absolute silence broken by a mad yell of delight  they sprang about tossing their long hairy arms in the air and howling with exultation  then they fell back from the edge formed themselves again into line and waited for the next victim  this time it was summerlee  two of his guards caught him by the wrists and pulled him brutally to the front  his thin figure and long limbs struggled and fluttered like a chicken being dragged from a coop challenger had turned to the king and waved his hands frantically before him  he was begging pleading imploring for his comrades life  the apeman pushed him roughly aside and shook his head  it was the last conscious movement he was to make upon earth  lord johns rifle cracked and the king sank down a tangled red sprawling thing upon the ground  shoot into the thick of them  shoot sonny shoot cried my companion  there are strange red depths in the soul of the most commonplace man i am tenderhearted by nature and have found my eyes moist many a time over the scream of a wounded hare  yet the blood lust was on me now i found myself on my feet emptying one magazine then the other clicking open the breech to reload snapping it to again while cheering and yelling with pure ferocity and joy of slaughter as i did so  with our four guns the two of us made a horrible havoc  both the guards who held summerlee were down and he was staggering about like a drunken man in his amazement unable to realize that he was a free man the dense mob of apemen ran about in bewilderment marveling whence this storm of death was coming or what it might mean  they waved gesticulated screamed and tripped up over those who had fallen then with a sudden impulse they all rushed in a howling crowd to the trees for shelter leaving the ground behind them spotted with their stricken comrades  the prisoners were left for the moment standing alone in the middle of the clearing  challengers quick brain had grasped the situation  he seized the bewildered summerlee by the arm and they both ran towards us  two of their guards bounded after them and fell to two bullets from lord john we ran forward into the open to meet our friends and pressed a loaded rifle into the hands of each  but summerlee was at the end of his strength  he could hardly totter  already the apemen were recovering from their panic  they were coming through the brushwood and threatening to cut us off  challenger and i ran summerlee along one at each of his elbows while lord john covered our retreat firing again and again as savage heads snarled at us out of the bushes  for a mile or more the chattering brutes were at our very heels  then the pursuit slackened for they learned our power and would no longer face that unerring rifle  when we had at last reached the camp we looked back and found ourselves alone  so it seemed to us and yet we were mistaken  we had hardly closed the thornbush door of our zareba clasped each others hands and thrown ourselves panting upon the ground beside our spring when we heard a patter of feet and then a gentle plaintive crying from outside our entrance  lord roxton rushed forward rifle in hand and threw it open  there prostrate upon their faces lay the little red figures of the four surviving indians trembling with fear of us and yet imploring our protection  with an expressive sweep of his hands one of them pointed to the woods around them and indicated that they were full of danger  then darting forward he threw his arms round lord johns legs and rested his face upon them  by george cried our peer pulling at his moustache in great perplexity i saywhat the deuce are we to do with these people  get up little chappie and take your face off my boots  summerlee was sitting up and stuffing some tobacco into his old briar  weve got to see them safe said he  youve pulled us all out of the jaws of death  my word it was a good bit of work  admirable cried challenger  admirable  not only we as individuals but european science collectively owe you a deep debt of gratitude for what you have done  i do not hesitate to say that the disappearance of professor summerlee and myself would have left an appreciable gap in modern zoological history  our young friend here and you have done most excellently well  he beamed at us with the old paternal smile but european science would have been somewhat amazed could they have seen their chosen child the hope of the future with his tangled unkempt head his bare chest and his tattered clothes  he had one of the meattins between his knees and sat with a large piece of cold australian mutton between his fingers  the indian looked up at him and then with a little yelp cringed to the ground and clung to lord johns leg  dont you be scared my bonnie boy said lord john patting the matted head in front of him  he cant stick your appearance challenger and by george i dont wonder  all right little chap hes only a human just the same as the rest of us  really sir cried the professor  well its lucky for you challenger that you are a little out of the ordinary  if you hadnt been so like the king  upon my word lord john you allow yourself great latitude  well its a fact  i beg sir that you will change the subject  your remarks are irrelevant and unintelligible  the question before us is what are we to do with these indians  the obvious thing is to escort them home if we knew where their home was  there is no difficulty about that said i  they live in the caves on the other side of the central lake  our young friend here knows where they live  i gather that it is some distance  a good twenty miles said i  summerlee gave a groan  i for one could never get there  surely i hear those brutes still howling upon our track  as he spoke from the dark recesses of the woods we heard far away the jabbering cry of the apemen  the indians once more set up a feeble wail of fear  we must move and move quick said lord john  you help summerlee young fellah  these indians will carry stores  now then come along before they can see us  in less than halfanhour we had reached our brushwood retreat and concealed ourselves  all day we heard the excited calling of the apemen in the direction of our old camp but none of them came our way and the tired fugitives red and white had a long deep sleep  i was dozing myself in the evening when someone plucked my sleeve and i found challenger kneeling beside me  you keep a diary of these events and you expect eventually to publish it mr malone said he with solemnity  i am only here as a press reporter i answered  exactly  you may have heard some rather fatuous remarks of lord john roxtons which seemed to imply that there was somesome resemblance  yes i heard them  i need not say that any publicity given to such an ideaany levity in your narrative of what occurredwould be exceedingly offensive to me  i will keep well within the truth  lord johns observations are frequently exceedingly fanciful and he is capable of attributing the most absurd reasons to the respect which is always shown by the most undeveloped races to dignity and character you follow my meaning  entirely  i leave the matter to your discretion  then after a long pause he added  the king of the apemen was really a creature of great distinctiona most remarkably handsome and intelligent personality did it not strike you  a most remarkable creature said i  and the professor much eased in his mind settled down to his slumber once more                                chapter xiv                  those were the real conquests  we had imagined that our pursuers the apemen knew nothing of our brushwood hidingplace but we were soon to find out our mistake there was no sound in the woodsnot a leaf moved upon the trees and all was peace around usbut we should have been warned by our first experience how cunningly and how patiently these creatures can watch and wait until their chance comes  whatever fate may be mine through life i am very sure that i shall never be nearer death than i was that morning  but i will tell you the thing in its due order  we all awoke exhausted after the terrific emotions and scanty food of yesterday  summerlee was still so weak that it was an effort for him to stand but the old man was full of a sort of surly courage which would never admit defeat  a council was held and it was agreed that we should wait quietly for an hour or two where we were have our muchneeded breakfast and then make our way across the plateau and round the central lake to the caves where my observations had shown that the indians lived  we relied upon the fact that we could count upon the good word of those whom we had rescued to ensure a warm welcome from their fellows  then with our mission accomplished and possessing a fuller knowledge of the secrets of maple white land we should turn our whole thoughts to the vital problem of our escape and return  even challenger was ready to admit that we should then have done all for which we had come and that our first duty from that time onwards was to carry back to civilization the amazing discoveries we had made  we were able now to take a more leisurely view of the indians whom we had rescued  they were small men wiry active and wellbuilt with lank black hair tied up in a bunch behind their heads with a leathern thong and leathern also were their loinclothes  their faces were hairless well formed and goodhumored  the lobes of their ears hanging ragged and bloody showed that they had been pierced for some ornaments which their captors had torn out  their speech though unintelligible to us was fluent among themselves and as they pointed to each other and uttered the word accala many times over we gathered that this was the name of the nation  occasionally with faces which were convulsed with fear and hatred they shook their clenched hands at the woods round and cried  doda  doda which was surely their term for their enemies  what do you make of them challenger asked lord john  one thing is very clear to me and that is that the little chap with the front of his head shaved is a chief among them  it was indeed evident that this man stood apart from the others and that they never ventured to address him without every sign of deep respect  he seemed to be the youngest of them all and yet so proud and high was his spirit that upon challenger laying his great hand upon his head he started like a spurred horse and with a quick flash of his dark eyes moved further away from the professor  then placing his hand upon his breast and holding himself with great dignity he uttered the word maretas several times  the professor unabashed seized the nearest indian by the shoulder and proceeded to lecture upon him as if he were a potted specimen in a classroom  the type of these people said he in his sonorous fashion whether judged by cranial capacity facial angle or any other test cannot be regarded as a low one on the contrary we must place it as considerably higher in the scale than many south american tribes which i can mention  on no possible supposition can we explain the evolution of such a race in this place  for that matter so great a gap separates these apemen from the primitive animals which have survived upon this plateau that it is inadmissible to think that they could have developed where we find them  then where the dooce did they drop from asked lord john  a question which will no doubt be eagerly discussed in every scientific society in europe and america the professor answered  my own reading of the situation for what it is worth he inflated his chest enormously and looked insolently around him at the wordsis that evolution has advanced under the peculiar conditions of this country up to the vertebrate stage the old types surviving and living on in company with the newer ones  thus we find such modern creatures as the tapiran animal with quite a respectable length of pedigreethe great deer and the anteater in the companionship of reptilian forms of jurassic type  so much is clear  and now come the apemen and the indian  what is the scientific mind to think of their presence  i can only account for it by an invasion from outside  it is probable that there existed an anthropoid ape in south america who in past ages found his way to this place and that he developed into the creatures we have seen some of whichhere he looked hard at mewere of an appearance and shape which if it had been accompanied by corresponding intelligence would i do not hesitate to say have reflected credit upon any living race  as to the indians i cannot doubt that they are more recent immigrants from below  under the stress of famine or of conquest they have made their way up here faced by ferocious creatures which they had never before seen they took refuge in the caves which our young friend has described but they have no doubt had a bitter fight to hold their own against wild beasts and especially against the apemen who would regard them as intruders and wage a merciless war upon them with a cunning which the larger beasts would lack  hence the fact that their numbers appear to be limited  well gentlemen have i read you the riddle aright or is there any point which you would query  professor summerlee for once was too depressed to argue though he shook his head violently as a token of general disagreement  lord john merely scratched his scanty locks with the remark that he couldnt put up a fight as he wasnt in the same weight or class  for my own part i performed my usual role of bringing things down to a strictly prosaic and practical level by the remark that one of the indians was missing  he has gone to fetch some water said lord roxton  we fitted him up with an empty beef tin and he is off  to the old camp i asked  no to the brook  its among the trees there  it cant be more than a couple of hundred yards  but the beggar is certainly taking his time  ill go and look after him said i  i picked up my rifle and strolled in the direction of the brook leaving my friends to lay out the scanty breakfast  it may seem to you rash that even for so short a distance i should quit the shelter of our friendly thicket but you will remember that we were many miles from apetown that so far as we knew the creatures had not discovered our retreat and that in any case with a rifle in my hands i had no fear of them  i had not yet learned their cunning or their strength  i could hear the murmur of our brook somewhere ahead of me but there was a tangle of trees and brushwood between me and it  i was making my way through this at a point which was just out of sight of my companions when under one of the trees i noticed something red huddled among the bushes  as i approached it i was shocked to see that it was the dead body of the missing indian  he lay upon his side his limbs drawn up and his head screwed round at a most unnatural angle so that he seemed to be looking straight over his own shoulder i gave a cry to warn my friends that something was amiss and running forwards i stooped over the body  surely my guardian angel was very near me then for some instinct of fear or it may have been some faint rustle of leaves made me glance upwards  out of the thick green foliage which hung low over my head two long muscular arms covered with reddish hair were slowly descending  another instant and the great stealthy hands would have been round my throat  i sprang backwards but quick as i was those hands were quicker still  through my sudden spring they missed a fatal grip but one of them caught the back of my neck and the other one my face  i threw my hands up to protect my throat and the next moment the huge paw had slid down my face and closed over them  i was lifted lightly from the ground and i felt an intolerable pressure forcing my head back and back until the strain upon the cervical spine was more than i could bear  my senses swam but i still tore at the hand and forced it out from my chin looking up i saw a frightful face with cold inexorable light blue eyes looking down into mine  there was something hypnotic in those terrible eyes  i could struggle no longer  as the creature felt me grow limp in his grasp two white canines gleamed for a moment at each side of the vile mouth and the grip tightened still more upon my chin forcing it always upwards and back  a thin ovaltinted mist formed before my eyes and little silvery bells tinkled in my ears  dully and far off i heard the crack of a rifle and was feebly aware of the shock as i was dropped to the earth where i lay without sense or motion  i awoke to find myself on my back upon the grass in our lair within the thicket  someone had brought the water from the brook and lord john was sprinkling my head with it while challenger and summerlee were propping me up with concern in their faces  for a moment i had a glimpse of the human spirits behind their scientific masks  it was really shock rather than any injury which had prostrated me and in halfanhour in spite of aching head and stiff neck i was sitting up and ready for anything  but youve had the escape of your life young fellah my lad said lord roxton  when i heard your cry and ran forward and saw your head twisted halfoff and your stohwassers kickin in the air i thought we were one short  i missed the beast in my flurry but he dropped you all right and was off like a streak  by george  i wish i had fifty men with rifles  id clear out the whole infernal gang of them and leave this country a bit cleaner than we found it  it was clear now that the apemen had in some way marked us down and that we were watched on every side  we had not so much to fear from them during the day but they would be very likely to rush us by night so the sooner we got away from their neighborhood the better  on three sides of us was absolute forest and there we might find ourselves in an ambush  but on the fourth sidethat which sloped down in the direction of the lakethere was only low scrub with scattered trees and occasional open glades  it was in fact the route which i had myself taken in my solitary journey and it led us straight for the indian caves  this then must for every reason be our road  one great regret we had and that was to leave our old camp behind us not only for the sake of the stores which remained there but even more because we were losing touch with zambo our link with the outside world  however we had a fair supply of cartridges and all our guns so for a time at least we could look after ourselves and we hoped soon to have a chance of returning and restoring our communications with our negro  he had faithfully promised to stay where he was and we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word  it was in the early afternoon that we started upon our journey  the young chief walked at our head as our guide but refused indignantly to carry any burden  behind him came the two surviving indians with our scanty possessions upon their backs  we four white men walked in the rear with rifles loaded and ready  as we started there broke from the thick silent woods behind us a sudden great ululation of the apemen which may have been a cheer of triumph at our departure or a jeer of contempt at our flight  looking back we saw only the dense screen of trees but that longdrawn yell told us how many of our enemies lurked among them  we saw no sign of pursuit however and soon we had got into more open country and beyond their power  as i tramped along the rearmost of the four i could not help smiling at the appearance of my three companions in front  was this the luxurious lord john roxton who had sat that evening in the albany amidst his persian rugs and his pictures in the pink radiance of the tinted lights  and was this the imposing professor who had swelled behind the great desk in his massive study at enmore park  and finally could this be the austere and prim figure which had risen before the meeting at the zoological institute  no three tramps that one could have met in a surrey lane could have looked more hopeless and bedraggled  we had it is true been only a week or so upon the top of the plateau but all our spare clothing was in our camp below and the one week had been a severe one upon us all though least to me who had not to endure the handling of the apemen  my three friends had all lost their hats and had now bound handkerchiefs round their heads their clothes hung in ribbons about them and their unshaven grimy faces were hardly to be recognized  both summerlee and challenger were limping heavily while i still dragged my feet from weakness after the shock of the morning and my neck was as stiff as a board from the murderous grip that held it  we were indeed a sorry crew and i did not wonder to see our indian companions glance back at us occasionally with horror and amazement on their faces  in the late afternoon we reached the margin of the lake and as we emerged from the bush and saw the sheet of water stretching before us our native friends set up a shrill cry of joy and pointed eagerly in front of them  it was indeed a wonderful sight which lay before us sweeping over the glassy surface was a great flotilla of canoes coming straight for the shore upon which we stood  they were some miles out when we first saw them but they shot forward with great swiftness and were soon so near that the rowers could distinguish our persons instantly a thunderous shout of delight burst from them and we saw them rise from their seats waving their paddles and spears madly in the air  then bending to their work once more they flew across the intervening water beached their boats upon the sloping sand and rushed up to us prostrating themselves with loud cries of greeting before the young chief  finally one of them an elderly man with a necklace and bracelet of great lustrous glass beads and the skin of some beautiful mottled ambercolored animal slung over his shoulders ran forward and embraced most tenderly the youth whom we had saved  he then looked at us and asked some questions after which he stepped up with much dignity and embraced us also each in turn  then at his order the whole tribe lay down upon the ground before us in homage personally i felt shy and uncomfortable at this obsequious adoration and i read the same feeling in the faces of roxton and summerlee but challenger expanded like a flower in the sun  they may be undeveloped types said he stroking his beard and looking round at them but their deportment in the presence of their superiors might be a lesson to some of our more advanced europeans strange how correct are the instincts of the natural man  it was clear that the natives had come out upon the warpath for every man carried his speara long bamboo tipped with bonehis bow and arrows and some sort of club or stone battleaxe slung at his side their dark angry glances at the woods from which we had come and the frequent repetition of the word doda made it clear enough that this was a rescue party who had set forth to save or revenge the old chiefs son for such we gathered that the youth must be  a council was now held by the whole tribe squatting in a circle whilst we sat near on a slab of basalt and watched their proceedings  two or three warriors spoke and finally our young friend made a spirited harangue with such eloquent features and gestures that we could understand it all as clearly as if we had known his language  what is the use of returning he said  sooner or later the thing must be done  your comrades have been murdered  what if i have returned safe  these others have been done to death  there is no safety for any of us  we are assembled now and ready then he pointed to us  these strange men are our friends  they are great fighters and they hate the apemen even as we do  they command here he pointed up to heaven the thunder and the lightning  when shall we have such a chance again  let us go forward and either die now or live for the future in safety  how else shall we go back unashamed to our women  the little red warriors hung upon the words of the speaker and when he had finished they burst into a roar of applause waving their rude weapons in the air  the old chief stepped forward to us and asked us some questions pointing at the same time to the woods  lord john made a sign to him that he should wait for an answer and then he turned to us  well its up to you to say what you will do said he for my part i have a score to settle with these monkeyfolk and if it ends by wiping them off the face of the earth i dont see that the earth need fret about it  im goin with our little red pals and i mean to see them through the scrap  what do you say young fellah  of course i will come  and you challenger  i will assuredly cooperate  and you summerlee  we seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition lord john  i assure you that i little thought when i left my professional chair in london that it was for the purpose of heading a raid of savages upon a colony of anthropoid apes  to such base uses do we come said lord john smiling  but we are up against it so whats the decision  it seems a most questionable step said summerlee argumentative to the last but if you are all going i hardly see how i can remain behind  then it is settled said lord john and turning to the chief he nodded and slapped his rifle  the old fellow clasped our hands each in turn while his men cheered louder than ever  it was too late to advance that night so the indians settled down into a rude bivouac  on all sides their fires began to glimmer and smoke  some of them who had disappeared into the jungle came back presently driving a young iguanodon before them  like the others it had a daub of asphalt upon its shoulder and it was only when we saw one of the natives step forward with the air of an owner and give his consent to the beasts slaughter that we understood at last that these great creatures were as much private property as a herd of cattle and that these symbols which had so perplexed us were nothing more than the marks of the owner  helpless torpid and vegetarian with great limbs but a minute brain they could be rounded up and driven by a child  in a few minutes the huge beast had been cut up and slabs of him were hanging over a dozen camp fires together with great scaly ganoid fish which had been speared in the lake  summerlee had lain down and slept upon the sand but we others roamed round the edge of the water seeking to learn something more of this strange country  twice we found pits of blue clay such as we had already seen in the swamp of the pterodactyls  these were old volcanic vents and for some reason excited the greatest interest in lord john what attracted challenger on the other hand was a bubbling gurgling mud geyser where some strange gas formed great bursting bubbles upon the surface  he thrust a hollow reed into it and cried out with delight like a schoolboy then he was able on touching it with a lighted match to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far end of the tube  still more pleased was he when inverting a leathern pouch over the end of the reed and so filling it with the gas he was able to send it soaring up into the air  an inflammable gas and one markedly lighter than the atmosphere  i should say beyond doubt that it contained a considerable proportion of free hydrogen  the resources of g e c are not yet exhausted my young friend  i may yet show you how a great mind molds all nature to its use he swelled with some secret purpose but would say no more  there was nothing which we could see upon the shore which seemed to me so wonderful as the great sheet of water before us  our numbers and our noise had frightened all living creatures away and save for a few pterodactyls which soared round high above our heads while they waited for the carrion all was still around the camp  but it was different out upon the rosetinted waters of the central lake  it boiled and heaved with strange life  great slatecolored backs and high serrated dorsal fins shot up with a fringe of silver and then rolled down into the depths again  the sandbanks far out were spotted with uncouth crawling forms huge turtles strange saurians and one great flat creature like a writhing palpitating mat of black greasy leather which flopped its way slowly to the lake  here and there high serpent heads projected out of the water cutting swiftly through it with a little collar of foam in front and a long swirling wake behind rising and falling in graceful swanlike undulations as they went  it was not until one of these creatures wriggled on to a sandbank within a few hundred yards of us and exposed a barrelshaped body and huge flippers behind the long serpent neck that challenger and summerlee who had joined us broke out into their duet of wonder and admiration  plesiosaurus  a freshwater plesiosaurus cried summerlee  that i should have lived to see such a sight  we are blessed my dear challenger above all zoologists since the world began  it was not until the night had fallen and the fires of our savage allies glowed red in the shadows that our two men of science could be dragged away from the fascinations of that primeval lake  even in the darkness as we lay upon the strand we heard from time to time the snort and plunge of the huge creatures who lived therein  at earliest dawn our camp was astir and an hour later we had started upon our memorable expedition  often in my dreams have i thought that i might live to be a war correspondent  in what wildest one could i have conceived the nature of the campaign which it should be my lot to report  here then is my first despatch from a field of battle  our numbers had been reinforced during the night by a fresh batch of natives from the caves and we may have been four or five hundred strong when we made our advance  a fringe of scouts was thrown out in front and behind them the whole force in a solid column made their way up the long slope of the bush country until we were near the edge of the forest  here they spread out into a long straggling line of spearmen and bowmen  roxton and summerlee took their position upon the right flank while challenger and i were on the left  it was a host of the stone age that we were accompanying to battlewe with the last word of the gunsmiths art from st james street and the strand  we had not long to wait for our enemy  a wild shrill clamor rose from the edge of the wood and suddenly a body of apemen rushed out with clubs and stones and made for the center of the indian line  it was a valiant move but a foolish one for the great bandylegged creatures were slow of foot while their opponents were as active as cats  it was horrible to see the fierce brutes with foaming mouths and glaring eyes rushing and grasping but forever missing their elusive enemies while arrow after arrow buried itself in their hides  one great fellow ran past me roaring with pain with a dozen darts sticking from his chest and ribs  in mercy i put a bullet through his skull and he fell sprawling among the aloes  but this was the only shot fired for the attack had been on the center of the line and the indians there had needed no help of ours in repulsing it  of all the apemen who had rushed out into the open i do not think that one got back to cover  but the matter was more deadly when we came among the trees  for an hour or more after we entered the wood there was a desperate struggle in which for a time we hardly held our own  springing out from among the scrub the apemen with huge clubs broke in upon the indians and often felled three or four of them before they could be speared  their frightful blows shattered everything upon which they fell  one of them knocked summerlees rifle to matchwood and the next would have crushed his skull had an indian not stabbed the beast to the heart  other apemen in the trees above us hurled down stones and logs of wood occasionally dropping bodily on to our ranks and fighting furiously until they were felled  once our allies broke under the pressure and had it not been for the execution done by our rifles they would certainly have taken to their heels  but they were gallantly rallied by their old chief and came on with such a rush that the apemen began in turn to give way  summerlee was weaponless but i was emptying my magazine as quick as i could fire and on the further flank we heard the continuous cracking of our companions rifles  then in a moment came the panic and the collapse  screaming and howling the great creatures rushed away in all directions through the brushwood while our allies yelled in their savage delight following swiftly after their flying enemies  all the feuds of countless generations all the hatreds and cruelties of their narrow history all the memories of illusage and persecution were to be purged that day at last man was to be supreme and the manbeast to find forever his allotted place  fly as they would the fugitives were too slow to escape from the active savages and from every side in the tangled woods we heard the exultant yells the twanging of bows and the crash and thud as apemen were brought down from their hidingplaces in the trees  i was following the others when i found that lord john and challenger had come across to join us  its over said lord john  i think we can leave the tidying up to them  perhaps the less we see of it the better we shall sleep  challengers eyes were shining with the lust of slaughter  we have been privileged he cried strutting about like a gamecock to be present at one of the typical decisive battles of historythe battles which have determined the fate of the world  what my friends is the conquest of one nation by another  it is meaningless  each produces the same result  but those fierce fights when in the dawn of the ages the cavedwellers held their own against the tiger folk or the elephants first found that they had a master those were the real conqueststhe victories that count  by this strange turn of fate we have seen and helped to decide even such a contest  now upon this plateau the future must ever be for man  it needed a robust faith in the end to justify such tragic means  as we advanced together through the woods we found the apemen lying thick transfixed with spears or arrows  here and there a little group of shattered indians marked where one of the anthropoids had turned to bay and sold his life dearly  always in front of us we heard the yelling and roaring which showed the direction of the pursuit  the apemen had been driven back to their city they had made a last stand there once again they had been broken and now we were in time to see the final fearful scene of all  some eighty or a hundred males the last survivors had been driven across that same little clearing which led to the edge of the cliff the scene of our own exploit two days before  as we arrived the indians a semicircle of spearmen had closed in on them and in a minute it was over thirty or forty died where they stood  the others screaming and clawing were thrust over the precipice and went hurtling down as their prisoners had of old on to the sharp bamboos six hundred feet below  it was as challenger had said and the reign of man was assured forever in maple white land the males were exterminated ape town was destroyed the females and young were driven away to live in bondage and the long rivalry of untold centuries had reached its bloody end  for us the victory brought much advantage  once again we were able to visit our camp and get at our stores  once more also we were able to communicate with zambo who had been terrified by the spectacle from afar of an avalanche of apes falling from the edge of the cliff  come away massas come away he cried his eyes starting from his head  the debbil get you sure if you stay up there  it is the voice of sanity said summerlee with conviction  we have had adventures enough and they are neither suitable to our character or our position  i hold you to your word challenger  from now  onwards you devote your energies to getting us out of this horrible country and back once more to civilization                                 chapter xv                  our eyes have seen great wonders  i write this from day to day but i trust that before i come to the end of it i may be able to say that the light shines at last through our clouds  we are held here with no clear means of making our escape and bitterly we chafe against it yet i can well imagine that the day may come when we may be glad that we were kept against our will to see something more of the wonders of this singular place and of the creatures who inhabit it  the victory of the indians and the annihilation of the apemen marked the turning point of our fortunes  from then onwards we were in truth masters of the plateau for the natives looked upon us with a mixture of fear and gratitude since by our strange powers we had aided them to destroy their hereditary foe  for their own sakes they would perhaps be glad to see the departure of such formidable and incalculable people but they have not themselves suggested any way by which we may reach the plains below  there had been so far as we could follow their signs a tunnel by which the place could be approached the lower exit of which we had seen from below  by this no doubt both apemen and indians had at different epochs reached the top and maple white with his companion had taken the same way  only the year before however there had been a terrific earthquake and the upper end of the tunnel had fallen in and completely disappeared  the indians now could only shake their heads and shrug their shoulders when we expressed by signs our desire to descend  it may be that they cannot but it may also be that they will not help us to get away  at the end of the victorious campaign the surviving apefolk were driven across the plateau their wailings were horrible and established in the neighborhood of the indian caves where they would from now onwards be a servile race under the eyes of their masters it was a rude raw primeval version of the jews in babylon or the israelites in egypt  at night we could hear from amid the trees the longdrawn cry as some primitive ezekiel mourned for fallen greatness and recalled the departed glories of ape town  hewers of wood and drawers of water such were they from now onwards  we had returned across the plateau with our allies two days after the battle and made our camp at the foot of their cliffs  they would have had us share their caves with them but lord john would by no means consent to it considering that to do so would put us in their power if they were treacherously disposed  we kept our independence therefore and had our weapons ready for any emergency while preserving the most friendly relations  we also continually visited their caves which were most remarkable places though whether made by man or by nature we have never been able to determine  they were all on the one stratum hollowed out of some soft rock which lay between the volcanic basalt forming the ruddy cliffs above them and the hard granite which formed their base  the openings were about eighty feet above the ground and were led up to by long stone stairs so narrow and steep that no large animal could mount them  inside they were warm and dry running in straight passages of varying length into the side of the hill with smooth gray walls decorated with many excellent pictures done with charred sticks and representing the various animals of the plateau  if every living thing were swept from the country the future explorer would find upon the walls of these caves ample evidence of the strange faunathe dinosaurs iguanodons and fish lizardswhich had lived so recently upon earth  since we had learned that the huge iguanodons were kept as tame herds by their owners and were simply walking meatstores we had conceived that man even with his primitive weapons had established his ascendancy upon the plateau  we were soon to discover that it was not so and that he was still there upon tolerance  it was on the third day after our forming our camp near the indian caves that the tragedy occurred  challenger and summerlee had gone off together that day to the lake where some of the natives under their direction were engaged in harpooning specimens of the great lizards lord john and i had remained in our camp while a number of the indians were scattered about upon the grassy slope in front of the caves engaged in different ways  suddenly there was a shrill cry of alarm with the word stoa resounding from a hundred tongues  from every side men women and children were rushing wildly for shelter swarming up the staircases and into the caves in a mad stampede  looking up we could see them waving their arms from the rocks above and beckoning to us to join them in their refuge  we had both seized our magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be suddenly from the near belt of trees there broke forth a group of twelve or fifteen indians running for their lives and at their very heels two of those frightful monsters which had disturbed our camp and pursued me upon my solitary journey  in shape they were like horrible toads and moved in a succession of springs but in size they were of an incredible bulk larger than the largest elephant  we had never before seen them save at night  and indeed they are nocturnal animals save when disturbed in their lairs as these had been  we now stood amazed at the sight for their blotched and warty skins were of a curious fishlike iridescence and the sunlight struck them with an evervarying rainbow bloom as they moved  we had little time to watch them however for in an instant they had overtaken the fugitives and were making a dire slaughter among them their method was to fall forward with their full weight upon each in turn leaving him crushed and mangled to bound on after the others the wretched indians screamed with terror but were helpless run as they would before the relentless purpose and horrible activity of these monstrous creatures  one after another they went down and there were not halfadozen surviving by the time my companion and i could come to their help  but our aid was of little avail and only involved us in the same peril  at the range of a couple of hundred yards we emptied our magazines firing bullet after bullet into the beasts but with no more effect than if we were pelting them with pellets of paper their slow reptilian natures cared nothing for wounds and the springs of their lives with no special brain center but scattered throughout their spinal cords could not be tapped by any modern weapons  the most that we could do was to check their progress by distracting their attention with the flash and roar of our guns and so to give both the natives and ourselves time to reach the steps which led to safety  but where the conical explosive bullets of the twentieth century were of no avail the poisoned arrows of the natives dipped in the juice of strophanthus and steeped afterwards in decayed carrion could succeed such arrows were of little avail to the hunter who attacked the beast because their action in that torpid circulation was slow and before its powers failed it could certainly overtake and slay its assailant but now as the two monsters hounded us to the very foot of the stairs a drift of darts came whistling from every chink in the cliff above them  in a minute they were feathered with them and yet with no sign of pain they clawed and slobbered with impotent rage at the steps which would lead them to their victims mounting clumsily up for a few yards and then sliding down again to the ground  but at last the poison worked  one of them gave a deep rumbling groan and dropped his huge squat head on to the earth  the other bounded round in an eccentric circle with shrill wailing cries and then lying down writhed in agony for some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still  with yells of triumph the indians came flocking down from their caves and danced a frenzied dance of victory round the dead bodies in mad joy that two more of the most dangerous of all their enemies had been slain  that night they cut up and removed the bodies not to eatfor the poison was still activebut lest they should breed a pestilence  the great reptilian hearts however each as large as a cushion still lay there beating slowly and steadily with a gentle rise and fall in horrible independent life  it was only upon the third day that the ganglia ran down and the dreadful things were still  some day when i have a better desk than a meattin and more helpful tools than a worn stub of pencil and a last tattered notebook i will write some fuller account of the accala indiansof our life amongst them and of the glimpses which we had of the strange conditions of wondrous maple white land  memory at least will never fail me for so long as the breath of life is in me every hour and every action of that period will stand out as hard and clear as do the first strange happenings of our childhood  no new impressions could efface those which are so deeply cut  when the time comes i will describe that wondrous moonlit night upon the great lake when a young ichthyosaurusa strange creature half seal half fish to look at with bonecovered eyes on each side of his snout and a third eye fixed upon the top of his headwas entangled in an indian net and nearly upset our canoe before we towed it ashore the same night that a green watersnake shot out from the rushes and carried off in its coils the steersman of challengers canoe  i will tell too of the great nocturnal white thingto this day we do not know whether it was beast or reptilewhich lived in a vile swamp to the east of the lake and flitted about with a faint phosphorescent glimmer in the darkness  the indians were so terrified at it that they would not go near the place and though we twice made expeditions and saw it each time we could not make our way through the deep marsh in which it lived  i can only say that it seemed to be larger than a cow and had the strangest musky odor  i will tell also of the huge bird which chased challenger to the shelter of the rocks one daya great running bird far taller than an ostrich with a vulturelike neck and cruel head which made it a walking death  as challenger climbed to safety one dart of that savage curving beak shore off the heel of his boot as if it had been cut with a chisel  this time at least modern weapons prevailed and the great creature twelve feet from head to footphororachus its name according to our panting but exultant professorwent down before lord roxtons rifle in a flurry of waving feathers and kicking limbs with two remorseless yellow eyes glaring up from the midst of it  may i live to see that flattened vicious skull in its own niche amid the trophies of the albany  finally i will assuredly give some account of the toxodon the giant tenfoot guinea pig with projecting chisel teeth which we killed as it drank in the gray of the morning by the side of the lake  all this i shall some day write at fuller length and amidst these more stirring days i would tenderly sketch in these lovely summer evenings when with the deep blue sky above us we lay in good comradeship among the long grasses by the wood and marveled at the strange fowl that swept over us and the quaint new creatures which crept from their burrows to watch us while above us the boughs of the bushes were heavy with luscious fruit and below us strange and lovely flowers peeped at us from among the herbage or those long moonlit nights when we lay out upon the shimmering surface of the great lake and watched with wonder and awe the huge circles rippling out from the sudden splash of some fantastic monster or the greenish gleam far down in the deep water of some strange creature upon the confines of darkness  these are the scenes which my mind and my pen will dwell upon in every detail at some future day  but you will ask why these experiences and why this delay when you and your comrades should have been occupied day and night in the devising of some means by which you could return to the outer world my answer is that there was not one of us who was not working for this end but that our work had been in vain  one fact we had very speedily discovered  the indians would do nothing to help us  in every other way they were our friendsone might almost say our devoted slavesbut when it was suggested that they should help us to make and carry a plank which would bridge the chasm or when we wished to get from them thongs of leather or liana to weave ropes which might help us we were met by a goodhumored but an invincible refusal  they would smile twinkle their eyes shake their heads and there was the end of it even the old chief met us with the same obstinate denial and it was only maretas the youngster whom we had saved who looked wistfully at us and told us by his gestures that he was grieved for our thwarted wishes  ever since their crowning triumph with the apemen they looked upon us as supermen who bore victory in the tubes of strange weapons and they believed that so long as we remained with them good fortune would be theirs  a little redskinned wife and a cave of our own were freely offered to each of us if we would but forget our own people and dwell forever upon the plateau  so far all had been kindly however far apart our desires might be but we felt well assured that our actual plans of a descent must be kept secret for we had reason to fear that at the last they might try to hold us by force  in spite of the danger from dinosaurs which is not great save at night for as i may have said before they are mostly nocturnal in their habits i have twice in the last three weeks been over to our old camp in order to see our negro who still kept watch and ward below the cliff  my eyes strained eagerly across the great plain in the hope of seeing afar off the help for which we had prayed  but the long cactusstrewn levels still stretched away empty and bare to the distant line of the canebrake  they will soon come now massa malone  before another week pass indian come back and bring rope and fetch you down  such was the cheery cry of our excellent zambo  i had one strange experience as i came from this second visit which had involved my being away for a night from my companions  i was returning along the wellremembered route and had reached a spot within a mile or so of the marsh of the pterodactyls when i saw an extraordinary object approaching me  it was a man who walked inside a framework made of bent canes so that he was enclosed on all sides in a bellshaped cage  as i drew nearer i was more amazed still to see that it was lord john roxton  when he saw me he slipped from under his curious protection and came towards me laughing and yet as i thought with some confusion in his manner  well young fellah said he who would have thought of meetin you up here  what in the world are you doing i asked  visitin my friends the pterodactyls said  he  but why  interestin beasts dont you think  but unsociable  nasty rude ways with strangers as you may remember  so i rigged this framework which keeps them from bein too pressin in their attentions  but what do you want in the swamp  he looked at me with a very questioning eye and i read hesitation in his face  dont you think other people besides professors can want to know things he said at last  im studyin the pretty dears  thats enough for you  no offense said i  his goodhumor returned and he laughed  no offense young fellah  im goin to get a young devil chick for challenger  thats one of my jobs  no i dont want your company im safe in this cage and you are not  so long and ill be back in camp by nightfall  he turned away and i left him wandering on through the wood with his extraordinary cage around him  if lord johns behavior at this time was strange that of challenger was more so  i may say that he seemed to possess an extraordinary fascination for the indian women and that he always carried a large spreading palm branch with which he beat them off as if they were flies when their attentions became too pressing  to see him walking like a comic opera sultan with this badge of authority in his hand his black beard bristling in front of him his toes pointing at each step and a train of wideeyed indian girls behind him clad in their slender drapery of bark cloth is one of the most grotesque of all the pictures which i will carry back with me  as to summerlee he was absorbed in the insect and bird life of the plateau and spent his whole time save that considerable portion which was devoted to abusing challenger for not getting us out of our difficulties in cleaning and mounting his specimens  challenger had been in the habit of walking off by himself every morning and returning from time to time with looks of portentous solemnity as one who bears the full weight of a great enterprise upon his shoulders  one day palm branch in hand and his crowd of adoring devotees behind him he led us down to his hidden workshop and took us into the secret of his plans  the place was a small clearing in the center of a palm grove  in this was one of those boiling mud geysers which i have already described around its edge were scattered a number of leathern thongs cut from iguanodon hide and a large collapsed membrane which proved to be the dried and scraped stomach of one of the great fish lizards from the lake  this huge sack had been sewn up at one end and only a small orifice left at the other  into this opening several bamboo canes had been inserted and the other ends of these canes were in contact with conical clay funnels which collected the gas bubbling up through the mud of the geyser  soon the flaccid organ began to slowly expand and show such a tendency to upward movements that challenger fastened the cords which held it to the trunks of the surrounding trees  in half an hour a goodsized gasbag had been formed and the jerking and straining upon the thongs showed that it was capable of considerable lift  challenger like a glad father in the presence of his firstborn stood smiling and stroking his beard in silent selfsatisfied content as he gazed at the creation of his brain  it was summerlee who first broke the silence  you dont mean us to go up in that thing challenger said he in an acid voice  i mean my dear summerlee to give you such a demonstration of its powers that after seeing it you will i am sure have no hesitation in trusting yourself to it  you can put it right out of your head now at once said summerlee with decision nothing on earth would induce me to commit such a folly  lord john i trust that you will not countenance such madness  dooced ingenious i call it said our peer  id like to see how it works  so you shall said challenger  for some days i have exerted my whole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these cliffs  we have satisfied ourselves that we cannot climb down and that there is no tunnel  we are also unable to construct any kind of bridge which may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came  how then shall i find a means to convey us  some little time ago i had remarked to our young friend here that free hydrogen was evolved from the geyser  the idea of a balloon naturally followed  i was i will admit somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to contain the gas but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem  behold the result  he put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly with the other  by this time the gasbag had swollen to a goodly rotundity and was jerking strongly upon its lashings  midsummer madness snorted summerlee  lord john was delighted with the whole idea  clever old dear aint he he whispered to me and then louder to challenger  what about a car  the car will be my next care  i have already planned how it is to be made and attached  meanwhile i will simply show you how capable my apparatus is of supporting the weight of each of us  all of us surely  no it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a parachute and the balloon be drawn back by means which i shall have no difficulty in perfecting  if it will support the weight of one and let him gently down it will have done all that is required of it  i will now show you its capacity in that direction  he brought out a lump of basalt of a considerable size constructed in the middle so that a cord could be easily attached to it  this cord was the one which we had brought with us on to the plateau after we had used it for climbing the pinnacle  it was over a hundred feet long and though it was thin it was very strong  he had prepared a sort of collar of leather with many straps depending from it  this collar was placed over the dome of the balloon and the hanging thongs were gathered together below so that the pressure of any weight would be diffused over a considerable surface  then the lump of basalt was fastened to the thongs and the rope was allowed to hang from the end of it being passed three times round the professors arm  i will now said challenger with a smile of pleased anticipation demonstrate the carrying power of my balloon as he said so he cut with a knife the various lashings that held it  never was our expedition in more imminent danger of complete annihilation  the inflated membrane shot up with frightful velocity into the air  in an instant challenger was pulled off his feet and dragged after it  i had just time to throw my arms round his ascending waist when i was myself whipped up into the air  lord john had me with a rattrap grip round the legs but i felt that he also was coming off the ground  for a moment i had a vision of four adventurers floating like a string of sausages over the land that they had explored  but happily there were limits to the strain which the rope would stand though none apparently to the lifting powers of this infernal machine there was a sharp crack and we were in a heap upon the ground with coils of rope all over us  when we were able to stagger to our feet we saw far off in the deep blue sky one dark spot where the lump of basalt was speeding upon its way  splendid cried the undaunted challenger rubbing his injured arm a most thorough and satisfactory demonstration  i could not have anticipated such a success  within a week gentlemen i promise that a second balloon will be prepared and that you can count upon taking in safety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey so far i have written each of the foregoing events as it occurred  now i am rounding off my narrative from the old camp where zambo has waited so long with all our difficulties and dangers left like a dream behind us upon the summit of those vast ruddy crags which tower above our heads we have descended in safety though in a most unexpected fashion and all is well with us  in six weeks or two months we shall be in london and it is possible that this letter may not reach you much earlier than we do ourselves  already our hearts yearn and our spirits fly towards the great mother city which holds so much that is dear to us  it was on the very evening of our perilous adventure with challengers homemade balloon that the change came in our fortunes  i have said that the one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our attempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued  he alone had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land  he had told us as much by his expressive language of signs  that evening after dusk he came down to our little camp handed me for some reason he had always shown his attentions to me perhaps because i was the one who was nearest his age a small roll of the bark of a tree and then pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him he had put his finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to his people  i took the slip of bark to the firelight and we examined it together it was about a foot square and on the inner side there was a singular arrangement of lines which i here reproduce   they were neatly done in charcoal upon the white surface and looked to me at first sight like some sort of rough musical score  whatever it is i can swear that it is of importance to us said i i could read that on his face as he gave it  unless we have come upon a primitive practical joker summerlee suggested which i should think would be one of the most elementary developments of man  it is clearly some sort of script said challenger  looks like a guinea puzzle competition remarked lord john craning his neck to have a look at it  then suddenly he stretched out his hand and seized the puzzle  by george he cried i believe ive got it  the boy guessed right the very first time  see here  how many marks are on that paper eighteen  well if you come to think of it there are eighteen cave openings on the hillside above us  he pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me said i  well that settles it  this is a chart of the caves  what  eighteen of them all in a row some short some deep some branching same as we saw them  its a map and heres a cross on it whats the cross for it is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others  one that goes through i cried  i believe our young friend has read the riddle said challenger  if the cave does not go through i do not understand why this person who has every reason to mean us well should have drawn our attention to it  but if it does go through and comes out at the corresponding point on the other side we should not have more than a hundred feet to descend  a hundred feet grumbled summerlee  well our rope is still more than a hundred feet long i cried surely we could get down  how about the indians in the cave summerlee objected  there are no indians in any of the caves above our heads said i they are all used as barns and storehouses  why should we not go up now at once and spy out the land  there is a dry bituminous wood upon the plateaua species of araucaria according to our botanistwhich is always used by the indians for torches  each of us picked up a faggot of this and we made our way up weedcovered steps to the particular cave which was marked in the drawing  it was as i had said empty save for a great number of enormous bats which flapped round our heads as we advanced into it  as we had no desire to draw the attention of the indians to our proceedings we stumbled along in the dark until we had gone round several curves and penetrated a considerable distance into the cavern then at last we lit our torches  it was a beautiful dry tunnel with smooth gray walls covered with native symbols a curved roof which arched over our heads and white glistening sand beneath our feet  we hurried eagerly along it until with a deep groan of bitter disappointment we were brought to a halt  a sheer wall of rock had appeared before us with no chink through which a mouse could have slipped  there was no escape for us there  we stood with bitter hearts staring at this unexpected obstacle  it was not the result of any convulsion as in the case of the ascending tunnel  the end wall was exactly like the side ones  it was and had always been a culdesac  never mind my friends said the indomitable challenger  you have still my firm promise of a balloon  summerlee groaned  can we be in the wrong cave i suggested  no use young fellah said lord john with his finger on the chart seventeen from the right and second from the left  this is the cave sure enough  i looked at the mark to which his finger pointed and i gave a sudden cry of joy  i believe i have it  follow me  follow me  i hurried back along the way we had come my torch in my hand  here said i pointing to some matches upon the ground is where we lit up  exactly  well it is marked as a forked cave and in the darkness we passed the fork before the torches were lit  on the right side as we go out we should find the longer arm  it was as i had said  we had not gone thirty yards before a great black opening loomed in the wall  we turned into it to find that we were in a much larger passage than before  along it we hurried in breathless impatience for many hundreds of yards  then suddenly in the black darkness of the arch in front of us we saw a gleam of dark red light  we stared in amazement  a sheet of steady flame seemed to cross the passage and to bar our way  we hastened towards it  no sound no heat no movement came from it but still the great luminous curtain glowed before us silvering all the cave and turning the sand to powdered jewels until as we drew closer it discovered a circular edge  the moon by george cried lord john  we are through boys  we are through  it was indeed the full moon which shone straight down the aperture which opened upon the cliffs  it was a small rift not larger than a window but it was enough for all our purposes  as we craned our necks through it we could see that the descent was not a very difficult one and that the level ground was no very great way below us  it was no wonder that from below we had not observed the place as the cliffs curved overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seemed so impossible as to discourage close inspection  we satisfied ourselves that with the help of our rope we could find our way down and then returned rejoicing to our camp to make our preparations for the next evening  what we did we had to do quickly and secretly since even at this last hour the indians might hold us back  our stores we would leave behind us save only our guns and cartridges  but challenger had some unwieldy stuff which he ardently desired to take with him and one particular package of which i may not speak which gave us more labor than any  slowly the day passed but when the darkness fell we were ready for our departure  with much labor we got our things up the steps and then looking back took one last long survey of that strange land soon i fear to be vulgarized the prey of hunter and prospector but to each of us a dreamland of glamour and romance a land where we had dared much suffered much and learned muchour land as we shall ever fondly call it  along upon our left the neighboring caves each threw out its ruddy cheery firelight into the gloom  from the slope below us rose the voices of the indians as they laughed and sang  beyond was the long sweep of the woods and in the center shimmering vaguely through the gloom was the great lake the mother of strange monsters  even as we looked a high whickering cry the call of some weird animal rang clear out of the darkness  it was the very voice of maple white land bidding us goodbye  we turned and plunged into the cave which led to home  two hours later we our packages and all we owned were at the foot of the cliff  save for challengers luggage we had never a difficulty leaving it all where we descended we started at once for zambos camp in the early morning we approached it but only to find to our amazement not one fire but a dozen upon the plain  the rescue party had arrived  there were twenty indians from the river with stakes ropes and all that could be useful for bridging the chasm  at least we shall have no difficulty now in carrying our packages when tomorrow we begin to make our way back to the amazon  and so in humble and thankful mood i close this account  our eyes have seen great wonders and our souls are chastened by what we have endured  each is in his own way a better and deeper man  it may be that when we reach para we shall stop to refit  if we do this letter will be a mail ahead  if not it will reach london on the very day that i do  in either case my dear mr mcardle i hope very soon to shake you by the hand                                chapter xvi                    a procession  a procession  i should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our friends upon the amazon for the very great kindness and hospitality which was shown to us upon our return journey  very particularly would i thank senhor penalosa and other officials of the brazilian government for the special arrangements by which we were helped upon our way and senhor pereira of para to whose forethought we owe the complete outfit for a decent appearance in the civilized world which we found ready for us at that town  it seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors but under the circumstances we had really no alternative and i hereby tell them that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our traces  even the names have been altered in our accounts and i am very sure that no one from the most careful study of them could come within a thousand miles of our unknown land  the excitement which had been caused through those parts of south america which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local and i can assure our friends in england that we had no notion of the uproar which the mere rumor of our experiences had caused through europe  it was not until the ivernia was within five hundred miles of southampton that the wireless messages from paper after paper and agency after agency offering huge prices for a short return message as to our actual results showed us how strained was the attention not only of the scientific world but of the general public  it was agreed among us however that no definite statement should be given to the press until we had met the members of the zoological institute since as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body from which we had received our commission of investigation  thus although we found southampton full of pressmen we absolutely refused to give any information which had the natural effect of focussing public attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening of november 7th  for this gathering the zoological hall which had been the scene of the inception of our task was found to be far too small and it was only in the queens hall in regent street that accommodation could be found  it is now common knowledge the promoters might have ventured upon the albert hall and still found their space too scanty  it was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting had been fixed  for the first we had each no doubt our own pressing personal affairs to absorb us  of mine i cannot yet speak  it may be that as it stands further from me i may think of it and even speak of it with less emotion  i have shown the reader in the beginning of this narrative where lay the springs of my action  it is but right perhaps that i should carry on the tale and show also the results and yet the day may come when i would not have it otherwise  at least i have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure and i cannot but be thankful to the force that drove me  and now i turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure as i was racking my brain as to how i should best describe it my eyes fell upon the issue of my own journal for the morning of the 8th of november with the full and excellent account of my friend and fellowreporter macdona  what can i do better than transcribe his narrativeheadlines and all  i admit that the paper was exuberant in the matter out of compliment to its own enterprise in sending a correspondent but the other great dailies were hardly less full in their account  thus then friend mac in his report                              the new world                  great meeting at the queens hall                           scenes of uproar                        extraordinary incident                             what was it                  nocturnal riot in regent street                              special   the muchdiscussed meeting of the zoological institute convened to hear the report of the committee of investigation sent out last year to south america to test the assertions made by professor challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that continent was held last night in the greater queens hall and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of science for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them  oh brother scribe macdona what a monstrous opening sentence  the tickets were theoretically confined to members and their friends but the latter is an elastic term and long before eight oclock the hour fixed for the commencement of the proceedings all parts of the great hall were tightly packed  the general public however which most unreasonably entertained a grievance at having been excluded stormed the doors at a quarter to eight after a prolonged melee in which several people were injured including inspector scoble of h division whose leg was unfortunately broken  after this unwarrantable invasion which not only filled every passage but even intruded upon the space set apart for the press it is estimated that nearly five thousand people awaited the arrival of the travelers  when they eventually appeared they took their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the leading scientific men not only of this country but of france and of germany  sweden was also represented in the person of professor sergius the famous zoologist of the university of upsala  the entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes  an acute observer might however have detected some signs of dissent amid the applause and gathered that the proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious  it may safely be prophesied however that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take  of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said since their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers they bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have undergone  professor challengers beard may be more shaggy professor summerlees features more ascetic lord john roxtons figure more gaunt and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left our shores but each appeared to be in most excellent health  as to our own representative the wellknown athlete and international rugby football player e d  malone he looks trained to a hair and as he surveyed the crowd a smile of goodhumored contentment pervaded his honest but homely face  all right mac wait till i get you alone  when quiet had been restored and the audience resumed their seats after the ovation which they had given to the travelers the chairman the duke of durham addressed the meeting  he would not he said stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the treat which lay before them  it was not for him to anticipate what professor summerlee who was the spokesman of the committee had to say to them but it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by extraordinary success  applause  apparently the age of romance was not dead and there was common ground upon which the wildest imaginings of the novelist could meet the actual scientific investigations of the searcher for truth  he would only add before he sat down that he rejoicedand all of them would rejoicethat these gentlemen had returned safe and sound from their difficult and dangerous task for it cannot be denied that any disaster to such an expedition would have inflicted a wellnigh irreparable loss to the cause of zoological science great applause in which professor challenger was observed to join  professor summerlees rising was the signal for another extraordinary outbreak of enthusiasm which broke out again at intervals throughout his address  that address will not be given in extenso in these columns for the reason that a full account of the whole adventures of the expedition is being published as a supplement from the pen of our own special correspondent  some general indications will therefore suffice having described the genesis of their journey and paid a handsome tribute to his friend professor challenger coupled with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertions now fully vindicated had been received he gave the actual course of their journey carefully withholding such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau  having described in general terms their course from the main river up to the time that they actually reached the base of the cliffs he enthralled his hearers by his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in their repeated attempts to mount them and finally described how they succeeded in their desperate endeavors which cost the lives of their two devoted halfbreed servants this amazing reading of the affair was the result of summerlees endeavors to avoid raising any questionable matter at the meeting  having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit and marooned them there by reason of the fall of their bridge the professor proceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that remarkable land  of personal adventures he said little but laid stress upon the rich harvest reaped by science in the observations of the wonderful beast bird insect and plant life of the plateau peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera fortysix new species of the one and ninetyfour of the other had been secured in the course of a few weeks  it was however in the larger animals and especially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct that the interest of the public was naturally centered  of these he was able to give a goodly list but had little doubt that it would be largely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated he and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures most of them at a distance which corresponded with nothing at present known to science  these would in time be duly classified and examined  he instanced a snake the cast skin of which deep purple in color was fiftyone feet in length and mentioned a white creature supposed to be mammalian which gave forth wellmarked phosphorescence in the darkness also a large black moth the bite of which was supposed by the indians to be highly poisonous  setting aside these entirely new forms of life the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms dating back in some cases to early jurassic times  among these he mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus seen once by mr malone at a drinkingplace by the lake and drawn in the sketchbook of that adventurous american who had first penetrated this unknown world he described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyltwo of the first of the wonders which they had encountered  he then thrilled the assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs which had on more than one occasion pursued members of the party and which were the most formidable of all the creatures which they had encountered  thence he passed to the huge and ferocious bird the phororachus and to the great elk which still roams upon this upland it was not however until he sketched the mysteries of the central lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were aroused  one had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was awake as one heard this sane and practical professor in cold measured tones describing the monstrous threeeyed fishlizards and the huge watersnakes which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water  next he touched upon the indians and upon the extraordinary colony of anthropoid apes which might be looked upon as an advance upon the pithecanthropus of java and as coming therefore nearer than any known form to that hypothetical creation the missing link  finally he described amongst some merriment the ingenious but highly dangerous aeronautic invention of professor challenger and wound up a most memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee did at last find their way back to civilization  it had been hoped that the proceedings would end there and that a vote of thanks and congratulation moved by professor sergius of upsala university would be duly seconded and carried but it was soon evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly symptoms of opposition had been evident from time to time during the evening and now dr james illingworth of edinburgh rose in the center of the hall  dr illingworth asked whether an amendment should not be taken before a resolution  the chairman  yes sir if there must be an amendment  dr illingworth  your grace there must be an amendment  the chairman  then let us take it at once  professor summerlee springing to his feet  might i explain your grace that this man is my personal enemy ever since our controversy in the quarterly journal of science as to the true nature of bathybius  the chairman  i fear i cannot go into personal matters  proceed  dr illingworth was imperfectly heard in part of his remarks on account of the strenuous opposition of the friends of the explorers some attempts were also made to pull him down  being a man of enormous physique however and possessed of a very powerful voice he dominated the tumult and succeeded in finishing his speech  it was clear from the moment of his rising that he had a number of friends and sympathizers in the hall though they formed a minority in the audience  the attitude of the greater part of the public might be described as one of attentive neutrality  dr illingworth began his remarks by expressing his high appreciation of the scientific work both of professor challenger and of professor summerlee  he much regretted that any personal bias should have been read into his remarks which were entirely dictated by his desire for scientific truth  his position in fact was substantially the same as that taken up by professor summerlee at the last meeting  at that last meeting professor challenger had made certain assertions which had been queried by his colleague  now this colleague came forward himself with the same assertions and expected them to remain unquestioned  was this reasonable  yes no and prolonged interruption during which professor challenger was heard from the press box to ask leave from the chairman to put dr illingworth into the street a year ago one man said certain things  now four men said other and more startling ones was this to constitute a final proof where the matters in question were of the most revolutionary and incredible character  there had been recent examples of travelers arriving from the unknown with certain tales which had been too readily accepted  was the london zoological institute to place itself in this position  he admitted that the members of the committee were men of character  but human nature was very complex  even professors might be misled by the desire for notoriety  like moths we all love best to flutter in the light heavygame shots liked to be in a position to cap the tales of their rivals and journalists were not averse from sensational coups even when imagination had to aid fact in the process  each member of the committee had his own motive for making the most of his results shame shame  he had no desire to be offensive  you are and interruption  the corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of the most slender description  what did it amount to  some photographs was it possible that in this age of ingenious manipulation photographs could be accepted as evidence  what more we have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the production of larger specimens  it was ingenious but not convincing it was understood that lord john roxton claimed to have the skull of a phororachus  he could only say that he would like to see that skull  lord john roxton  is this fellow calling me a liar uproar  the chairman  order order  dr illingworth i must direct you to bring your remarks to a conclusion and to move your amendment  dr illingworth  your grace i have more to say but i bow to your ruling  i move then that while professor summerlee be thanked for his interesting address the whole matter shall be regarded as nonproven and shall be referred back to a larger and possibly more reliable committee of investigation  it is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment  a large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of dont put it  withdraw  turn him out  on the other hand the malcontentsand it cannot be denied that they were fairly numerouscheered for the amendment with cries of order chair and fair play  a scuffle broke out in the back benches and blows were freely exchanged among the medical students who crowded that part of the hall  it was only the moderating influence of the presence of large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot  suddenly however there was a pause a hush and then complete silence professor challenger was on his feet  his appearance and manner are peculiarly arresting and as he raised his hand for order the whole audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing  it will be within the recollection of many present said professor challenger that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last meeting at which i have been able to address them  on that occasion professor summerlee was the chief offender and though he is now chastened and contrite the matter could not be entirely forgotten  i have heard tonight similar but even more offensive sentiments from the person who has just sat down and though it is a conscious effort of selfeffacement to come down to that persons mental level i will endeavor to do so in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the minds of anyone  laughter and interruption i need not remind this audience that though professor summerlee as the head of the committee of investigation has been put up to speak tonight still it is i who am the real prime mover in this business and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed  i have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot mentioned and i have as you have heard convinced them of the accuracy of my previous account  we had hoped that we should find upon our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint conclusions  warned however by my previous experience i have not come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man  as explained by professor summerlee our cameras have been tampered with by the apemen when they ransacked our camp and most of our negatives ruined jeers laughter and tell us another from the back  i have mentioned the apemen and i cannot forbear from saying that some of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures laughter  in spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negatives there still remains in our collection a certain number of corroborative photographs showing the conditions of life upon the plateau  did they accuse them of having forged these photographs a voice yes and considerable interruption which ended in several men being put out of the hall  the negatives were open to the inspection of experts  but what other evidence had they  under the conditions of their escape it was naturally impossible to bring a large amount of baggage but they had rescued professor summerlees collections of butterflies and beetles containing many new species  was this not evidence  several voices no who said no  dr illingworth rising  our point is that such a collection might have been made in other places than a prehistoric plateau applause  professor challenger  no doubt sir we have to bow to your scientific authority although i must admit that the name is unfamiliar  passing then both the photographs and the entomological collection i come to the varied and accurate information which we bring with us upon points which have never before been elucidated  for example upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyla voice bosh and uproari say that upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl we can throw a flood of light  i can exhibit to you from my portfolio a picture of that creature taken from life which would convince you  dr illingworth  no picture could convince us of anything  professor challenger  you would require to see the thing itself  dr illingworth  undoubtedly  professor challenger  and you would accept that  dr illingworth laughing  beyond a doubt  it was at this point that the sensation of the evening arosea sensation so dramatic that it can never have been paralleled in the history of scientific gatherings  professor challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal and at once our colleague mr e d malone was observed to rise and to make his way to the back of the platform an instant later he reappeared in company of a gigantic negro the two of them bearing between them a large square packingcase  it was evidently of great weight and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the professors chair  all sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them  professor challenger drew off the top of the case which formed a sliding lid peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the press seat to say come then pretty pretty in a coaxing voice  an instant later with a scratching rattling sound a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case  even the unexpected fall of the duke of durham into the orchestra which occurred at this moment could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience  the face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived  it was malicious horrible with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal  its long savage mouth which was held halfopen was full of a double row of sharklike teeth  its shoulders were humped and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl  it was the devil of our childhood in person  there was a turmoil in the audiencesomeone screamed two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra  for a moment there was danger of a general panic  professor challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion but the movement alarmed the creature beside him  its strange shawl suddenly unfurled spread and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings  its owner grabbed at its legs but too late to hold it  it had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the queens hall with a dry leathery flapping of its tenfoot wings while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room  the cries of the people in the galleries who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak excited the creature to a frenzy faster and faster it flew beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm  the window  for heavens sake shut that window roared the professor from the platform dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension  alas his warning was too late in a moment the creature beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gasshade came upon the opening squeezed its hideous bulk through it and was gone  professor challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands while the audience gave one long deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over  thenoh how shall one describe what took place thenwhen the full exuberance of the majority and the full reaction of the minority united to make one great wave of enthusiasm which rolled from the back of the hall gathering volume as it came swept over the orchestra submerged the platform and carried the four heroes away upon its crest  good for you mac  if the audience had done less than justice surely it made ample amends  every one was on his feet  every one was moving shouting gesticulating  a dense crowd of cheering men were round the four travelers  up with them up with them cried a hundred voices in a moment four figures shot up above the crowd  in vain they strove to break loose  they were held in their lofty places of honor  it would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished so dense was the crowd around them  regent street  regent street sounded the voices  there was a swirl in the packed multitude and a slow current bearing the four upon their shoulders made for the door  out in the street the scene was extraordinary  an assemblage of not less than a hundred thousand people was waiting  the closepacked throng extended from the other side of the langham hotel to oxford circus  a roar of acclamation greeted the four adventurers as they appeared high above the heads of the people under the vivid electric lamps outside the hall  a procession  a procession was the cry  in a dense phalanx blocking the streets from side to side the crowd set forth taking the route of regent street pall mall st jamess street and piccadilly  the whole central traffic of london was held up and many collisions were reported between the demonstrators upon the one side and the police and taxicabmen upon the other  finally it was not until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the entrance to lord john roxtons chambers in the albany and that the exuberant crowd having sung they are jolly good fellows in chorus concluded their program with god save the king so ended one of the most remarkable evenings that london has seen for a considerable time  so far my friend macdona and it may be taken as a fairly accurate if florid account of the proceedings  as to the main incident it was a bewildering surprise to the audience but not i need hardly say to us  the reader will remember how i met lord john roxton upon the very occasion when in his protective crinoline he had gone to bring the devils chick as he called it for professor challenger  i have hinted also at the trouble which the professors baggage gave us when we left the plateau and had i described our voyage i might have said a good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of our filthy companion  if i have not said much about it before it was of course that the professors earnest desire was that no possible rumor of the unanswerable argument which we carried should be allowed to leak out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted  one word as to the fate of the london pterodactyl  nothing can be said to be certain upon this point  there is the evidence of two frightened women that it perched upon the roof of the queens hall and remained there like a diabolical statue for some hours  the next day it came out in the evening papers that private miles of the coldstream guards on duty outside marlborough house had deserted his post without leave and was therefore courtmartialed  private miles account that he dropped his rifle and took to his heels down the mall because on looking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon was not accepted by the court and yet it may have a direct bearing upon the point at issue  the only other evidence which i can adduce is from the log of the ss friesland a dutchamerican liner which asserts that at nine next morning start point being at the time ten miles upon their starboard quarter they were passed by something between a flying goat and a monstrous bat which was heading at a prodigious pace south and west  if its homing instinct led it upon the right line there can be no doubt that somewhere out in the wastes of the atlantic the last european pterodactyl found its end  and gladysoh my gladysgladys of the mystic lake now to be renamed the central for never shall she have immortality through me did i not always see some hard fiber in her nature  did i not even at the time when i was proud to obey her behest feel that it was surely a poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it did i not in my truest thoughts always recurring and always dismissed see past the beauty of the face and peering into the soul discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it  did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its own noble sake or was it for the glory which might without effort or sacrifice be reflected upon herself  or are these thoughts the vain wisdom which comes after the event  it was the shock of my life  for a moment it had turned me to a cynic  but already as i write a week has passed and we have had our momentous interview with lord john roxton andwell perhaps things might be worse  let me tell it in a few words  no letter or telegram had come to me at southampton and i reached the little villa at streatham about ten oclock that night in a fever of alarm  was she dead or alive  where were all my nightly dreams of the open arms the smiling face the words of praise for her man who had risked his life to humor her whim already i was down from the high peaks and standing flatfooted upon earth  yet some good reasons given might still lift me to the clouds once more  i rushed down the garden path hammered at the door heard the voice of gladys within pushed past the staring maid and strode into the sittingroom  she was seated in a low settee under the shaded standard lamp by the piano  in three steps i was across the room and had both her hands in mine  gladys i cried gladys  she looked up with amazement in her face  she was altered in some subtle way  the expression of her eyes the hard upward stare the set of the lips was new to me  she drew back her hands  what do you mean she said  gladys i cried  what is the matter  you are my gladys are you notlittle gladys hungerton  no said she i am gladys potts  let me introduce you to my husband  how absurd life is  i found myself mechanically bowing and shaking hands with a little gingerhaired man who was coiled up in the deep armchair which had once been sacred to my own use  we bobbed and grinned in front of each other  father lets us stay here  we are getting our house ready said gladys  oh yes said i  you didnt get my letter at para then  no i got no letter  oh what a pity  it would have made all clear  it is quite clear said i  ive told william all about you said she  we have no secrets  i am so sorry about it  but it couldnt have been so very deep could it if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here alone  youre not crabby are you  no no not at all  i think ill go  have some refreshment said the little man and he added in a confidential way its always like this aint it  and must be unless you had polygamy only the other way round you understand he laughed like an idiot while i made for the door  i was through it when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me and i went back to my successful rival who looked nervously at the electric push  will you answer a question i asked  well within reason said he  how did you do it  have you searched for hidden treasure or discovered a pole or done time on a pirate or flown the channel or what  where is the glamour of romance  how did you get it  he stared at me with a hopeless expression upon his vacuous goodnatured scrubby little face  dont you think all this is a little too personal he said  well just one question i cried  what are you  what is your profession  i am a solicitors clerk said he  second man at johnson and merivales 41 chancery lane  goodnight said i and vanished like all disconsolate and brokenhearted heroes into the darkness with grief and rage and laughter all simmering within me like a boiling pot  one more little scene and i have done  last night we all supped at lord john roxtons rooms and sitting together afterwards we smoked in good comradeship and talked our adventures over  it was strange under these altered surroundings to see the old wellknown faces and figures  there was challenger with his smile of condescension his drooping eyelids his intolerant eyes his aggressive beard his huge chest swelling and puffing as he laid down the law to summerlee  and summerlee too there he was with his short briar between his thin moustache and his gray goatsbeard his worn face protruded in eager debate as he queried all challengers propositions  finally there was our host with his rugged eagle face and his cold blue glacier eyes with always a shimmer of devilment and of humor down in the depths of them  such is the last picture of them that i have carried away  it was after supper in his own sanctumthe room of the pink radiance and the innumerable trophiesthat lord john roxton had something to say to us  from a cupboard he had brought an old cigarbox and this he laid before him on the table  theres one thing said he that maybe i should have spoken about before this but i wanted to know a little more clearly where i was no use to raise hopes and let them down again  but its facts not hopes with us now  you may remember that day we found the pterodactyl rookery in the swampwhat  well somethin in the lie of the land took my notice  perhaps it has escaped you so i will tell you  it was a volcanic vent full of blue clay the professors nodded  well now in the whole world ive only had to do with one place that was a volcanic vent of blue clay  that was the great de beers diamond mine of kimberleywhat  so you see i got diamonds into my head  i rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts and i spent a happy day there with a spud  this is what i got  he opened his cigarbox and tilting it over he poured about twenty or thirty rough stones varying from the size of beans to that of chestnuts on the table  perhaps you think i should have told you then  well so i should only i know there are a lot of traps for the unwary and that stones may be of any size and yet of little value where color and consistency are clean off  therefore i brought them back and on the first day at home i took one round to spinks and asked him to have it roughly cut and valued  he took a pillbox from his pocket and spilled out of it a beautiful glittering diamond one of the finest stones that i have ever seen  theres the result said he  he prices the lot at a minimum of two hundred thousand pounds  of course it is fair shares between us  i wont hear of anythin else  well challenger what will you do with your fifty thousand  if you really persist in your generous view said the professor i should found a private museum which has long been one of my dreams  and you summerlee  i would retire from teaching and so find time for my final classification of the chalk fossils  ill use my own said lord john roxton in fitting a wellformed expedition and having another look at the dear old plateau  as to you young fellah you of course will spend yours in gettin married  not just yet said i with a rueful smile  i think if you will have me that i would rather go with you  lord roxton said nothing but a brown hand was stretched out to me across the table
