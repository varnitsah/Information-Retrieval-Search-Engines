10574746	the historical nights entertainment second series  by rafael sabatini    to david whitelaw  my dear david  since the narratives collected here as well as in the preceding volume under the title of the historical nights entertainmentnarratives originally published in the premier magazine which you so ably editowe their being to your suggestion it is fitting that some acknowledgment of the fact should be made to what is hardly less than a duty allow me to add the pleasure of dedicating to you in earnest of my friendship and esteem not merely this volume but the work of which this volume is the second  sincerely yours  rafael sabatini  london june 1919     preface  the kindly reception accorded to the first volume of the historical nights entertainment issued in december of 1917 has encouraged me to prepare the second series here assembled  as in the case of the narratives that made up the first volume i set out again with the same ambitious aim of adhering scrupulously in every instance to actual recorded facts and once again i find it desirable at the outset to reveal how far the achievement may have fallen short of the admitted aim  on the whole i have to confess to having allowed myself perhaps a wider latitude and to having taken greater liberties than was the case with the essays constituting the previous collection this however applies where applicable to the parts rather than to the whole  the only entirely apocryphal narrative here included is the firstthe absolution this is one of those stories which if resting upon no sufficient authority to compel its acceptance will nevertheless resist all attempts at final refutation having its roots at least in the soil of fact it is given in the rather discredited portuguese chronicles of acenheiro and finds place more or less as related here in duarte galvaos chronicle of affonso henriques whence it was taken by the portuguese historical writer alexandre herculano to be included in his lendas e narrativas if it is to be relegated to the limbo of the ben trovato at least i esteem it to afford us a precious glimpse of the naive spirit of the age in which it is set and find in that my justification for including it  the next to require apology is his insolence of buckingham but only in so far as the incident of the diamond studs is concerned the remainder of the narrative the character of buckingham the details of his embassy to paris and the particulars of his audacious courtship of anne of austria rest upon unassailable evidence i would have omitted the very apocryphal incident of the studs but that i considered it of peculiar interest as revealing the source of the main theme of one of the most famous historical romances ever writtenthe three musketeers i give the story as related by la rochefoucauld in his memoirs whence alexandre dumas culled it that he might turn it to such excellent romantic account in la rochefoucaulds narrative it is the painter gerbier who in a far less heroic manner plays the part assigned by dumas to dartagnan and it is the countess of carlisle who carries out the political theft which dumas attributes to milady for the rest i do not invite you to attach undue credit to it which is not however to say that i account it wholly false  in the case of the hermosa fembra i confess to having blended together into one single narrative two historical episodes closely connected in time and place susans daughter was in fact herself the betrayer of her father and it was in penitence for that unnatural act that she desired her skull to be exhibited as i describe into the story of susans daughter i have woven that of another newchristian girl who like the hermosa fembra her taken a castilian loverin this case a youth of the house of guzman this youth was driven into concealment in circumstances more or less as i describe them he overheard the judaizing of several newchristians there assembled and bore word of it at once to ojeda the two episodes were separated in fact by an interval of three years and the first afforded ojeda a strong argument for the institution of the holy office in seville between the two there are many points of contact and each supplies what the other lacks to make an interesting narrative having for background the introduction of the inquisition to castile the denouement i supply is entirely fictitious and the introduction of torquemada is quite arbitrary ojeda was the inquisitor who dealt with both cases but if there i stray into fiction at least i claim to have sketched a faithful portrait of the grand inquisitor as i know him from fairly exhaustive researches into his life and times  the story of the false demetrius is here related from the point of view of my adopted solution of what is generally regarded as a historical mystery the mystery lies of course in the mans identity he has been held by some to have been the unfrocked monk grishka otropiev by others to have been a son of stephen bathory king of poland i am not aware that the theory that he was both at one and the same time has ever been put forward and whilst admitting that it is speculative yet i claim that no other would appear so aptly to fit all the known facts of his career or to shed light upon its mysteries  undoubtedly i have allowed myself a good deal of licence and speculation in treating certain unwitnessed scenes in the barren wooing but the theory that i develop in it to account for the miscarriage of the matrimonial plans of queen elizabeth and robert dudley seems to me to be not only very fully warranted by de quadras correspondence but the only theory that will convincingly explain the events elizabeth as i show was widely believed to be an accessory to the murder of amy robsart but in carefully following her words and actions at that critical time as reported by de quadra my reading of the transaction is as given here the most damning fact against elizabeth was held to be her own statement to de quadra on the eve of lady robert dudleys murder to the effect that lady robert was already dead or very nearly so this foreknowledge of the fate of that unfortunate lady has been accepted as positive evidence that the queen was a party to the crime at cumnor which was to set her lover free to marry again far from that however i account it positive proof of elizabeths innocence of any such part in the deed elizabeth was far too crafty and clearsighted not to realize how her words must incriminate her afterwards if she knew that the murder of lady robert was projected she must have been merely repeating what dudley himself had told her and what he must have told herand she believedwas that his wife was at the point of a natural death similarly dudley would not have told her this unless his aim had been to procure his wifes removal by means which would admit of a natural interpretation difficulties encountered much as i relate themand for which there is abundant evidencedrove his toozealous agents to rather desperate lengths and thus brought suspicion not only upon the guilty dudley but also upon the innocent queen the manner of amys murder is pure conjecture but it should not be far from what actually took place the possibility of an accidentextraordinarily and suspiciously opportune for dudley as it would have beencould not be altogether ruled out but for the further circumstance that lady robert had removed everybody from cumnor on that day to what can this pointunless we accept an altogether incredible chain of coincidencebut to some such plotting as i here suggest  in the remaining six essays in this volume the liberties taken with the absolute facts are so slight as to require no apology or comment  r s  london june 1919

peninsula recapturing lisbon and santarem in the west and pushing their conquest as far as the river mondego  to meet this revival of mohammedan power alfonso vi of castile summoned the chivalry of christendom to his aid among the knights who answered the call was count henry of burgundy grandson of robert first duke of burgundy to whom alfonso gave his natural daughter theresa in marriage together with the counties of oporto and coimbra with the title of count of portugal  that is the first chapter of the history of portugal  count henry fought hard to defend his southern frontiers from the incursion of the moors until his death in 1114 thereafter his widow theresa became regent of portugal during the minority of their son affonso henriques a woman of great energy resource and ambition she successfully waged war against the moors and in other ways laid the foundations upon which her son was to build the kingdom of portugal but her passionate infatuation for one of her knightsdon fernando peres de travaand the excessive honours she bestowed upon him made enemies for her in the new state and estranged her from her son  in 1127 alfonso vii of castile invaded portugal compelling theresa to recognize him as her suzerain but affonso henriques now aged seventeenand declared by the citizens of the capital to be of age and competent to reignincontinently refused to recognize the submission made by his mother and in the following year assembled an army for the purpose of expelling her and her lover from the country the warlike theresa resisted until defeated in the battle of san mamede and taken prisoner                                     he was little more than a boy although four years were sped already since as a mere lad of fourteen he had kept vigil throughout the night over his arms in the cathedral of zamora preparatory to receiving the honour of knighthood at the hands of his cousin alfonso vii of castile yet already he was looked upon as the very pattern of what a christian knight should be worthy son of the father who had devoted his life to doing battle against the infidel wheresoever he might be found he was wellgrown and tall and of a bodily strength that is almost a byword to this day in that portugal of which he was the real founder and first king he was skilled beyond the common wont in all knightly exercises of arms and horsemanship and equipped with far more learningthough much of it was illdigested as this story will serve to showthan the twelfth century considered useful or even proper in a knight and he was at least true to his time in that he combined a fervid piety with a weakness of the flesh and an impetuous arrogance that was to bring him under the ban of greater excommunication at the very outset of his reign  it happened that his imprisonment of his mother was not at all pleasing in the sight of rome dona theresa had powerful friends who so used their influence at the vatican on her behalf that the holy fatherconveniently ignoring the provocation she had given and the scandalous unmotherly conduct of which she had been guiltycame to consider the behaviour of the infante of portugal as reprehensibly unfilial and commanded him to deliver dona theresa at once from duress  this papal order backed by a threat of excommunication in the event of disobedience was brought to the young prince by the bishop of coimbra whom he counted among his friends  affonso henriques ever impetuous and quick to anger flushed scarlet when he heard that uncompromising message his dark eyes smouldered as they considered the aged prelate  you come here to bid me let loose again upon this land of portugal that author of strife to deliver over the people once more to the oppression of the lord of trava he asked and you tell me that unless by obeying this command i am false to the duty i owe this country you will launch the curse of rome against me you tell me this  the bishop deeply stirred torn between his duty to the holy see and his affection for his prince bowed his head and wrung his hands what choice have i he asked on a quavering note  i raised you from the dust thunder was rumbling in the princes voice myself i placed the episcopal ring upon your finger  my lord my lord could i forget all that i have i owe to yousave only my soul which i owe to god my faith which i owe to christ and my obedience which i owe to our holy father the pope  the prince considered him in silence mastering his passionate impetuous nature go he growled at last  the prelate bowed his head his eyes not daring to meet his princes  god keep you lord he almost sobbed and so went out  but though stirred by his affection for the prince to whom he owed so much though knowing in his inmost heart that affonso henriques was in the right the bishop of coimbra did not swerve from his duty to rome which was as plain as it was unpalatable betimes next morning word was brought to affonso henriques in the alcazar of coimbra that a parchment was nailed to the door of the cathedral setting forth his excommunication and that the bishopeither out of fear or out of sorrowhad left the city journeying northward towards oporto  affonso henriques passed swiftly from incredulity to anger then almost as swiftly came to a resolve which was as mad and harebrained as could have been expected from a lad in his eighteenth year who held the reins of power yet by its very directness and its superb ignoring of all obstacles legal and canonical it was invested with a certain wild sanity  in full armour a white cloak simply embroidered in gold at the edge and knotted at the shoulder he rode to the cathedral attended by his halfbrother pedro affonso and two of his knights emigio moniz and sancho nunes there on the great ironstudded doors he found as he had been warned the roman parchment pronouncing him accursed its sonorous latin periods set forth in a fine round clerkly hand  he swung down from his great horse and clanked up the cathedral steps his attendants following he had for witnesses no more than a few loiterers who had paused at sight of their prince  the interdict had so far attracted no attention for in the twelfth century the art of letters was a mystery to which there were few initiates  affonso henriques tore the sheepskin from its nails and crumpled it in his hand then he passed into the cathedral and thence came out presently into the cloisters overhead a bell was clanging by his orders summoning the chapter  to the infante waiting there in the sundrenched close came presently the canons austere aloof majestic in their unhurried progress through the fretted cloisters with flowing garments and hands tucked into their wide sleeves before them in a semicircle they arrayed themselves before him and waited impassively to learn his will overhead the bell had ceased  affonso henriques wasted no words  i have summoned you he announced to command that you proceed to the election of a bishop  a rustle stirred through the priestly throng the canons looked askance at the prince and at one another then one of them spoke  habemus episcopum he said gravely and several instantly made chorus we have a bishop  the eyes of the young sovereign kindled you are wrong he told them you had a bishop but he is here no longer he has deserted his see after publishing this shameful thing and he held aloft the crumpled interdict as i am a godfearing christian knight i will not live under this ban since the bishop who excommunicated me is gone you will at once elect another in his place who shall absolve me  they stood before him silent and impassive in their priestly dignity and in their assurance that the law was on their side  well the boy growled at them  habemus episcopum droned a voice again  amen boomed in chorus through the cloisters  i tell you that your bishop is gone he insisted his voice quivering now with anger and i tell you that he shall not return that he shall never set foot again within my city of coimbra proceed you therefore at once to the election of his successor  lord he was answered coldly by one of them no such election is possible or lawful  do you dare stand before my face and tell me this he roared infuriated by their cold resistance he flung out an arm in a gesture of terrible dismissal out of my sight you proud and evil men back to your cells to await my pleasure since in your arrogant stiffnecked pride you refuse to do my will you shall receive the bishop i shall myself select  he was so terrific in his rage that they dared not tell him that he had no power prince though he might be to make such an election bowed to him ever impassively and with their hands still folded unhurried as they had come they now turned and filed past him in departure  he watched them with scowling brows and tightened lips moniz and nunes silent behind him suddenly those dark watchful eyes of his were held by the last figure of all in that austere processiona tall gaunt young man whose coppercoloured skin and hawkfeatured face proclaimed his moorish blood instantly maliciously it flashed through the princes boyish mind how he might make of this man an instrument to humble the pride of that insolent clergy he raised his hand and beckoned the cleric to him  what is your name he asked him  i am called zuleyman lord he was answered and the name confirmedwhere indeed no confirmation was necessarythe fellows moorish origin  affonso henriques laughed it would be an excellent jest to thrust upon these arrogant priests who refused to appoint a bishop of their choice a bishop who was little better than a blackamoor  don zuleyman said the prince i name you bishop of coimbra in the room of the rebel who has fled you will prepare to celebrate high mass this morning and to pronounce my absolution  the christianized moor fell back a step his face paling under its copper skin to a sickly grey in the background the hindmost members of the retreating clerical procession turned and stood at gaze angered and scandalized by what they heard which was indeed a thing beyond belief  ah no my lord ah no don zuleyman was faltering not that  the prospect terrified him and in his agitation he had recourse to latin domine non sum dignus he cried and beat his breast  but the uncompromising affonso henriques gave him back latin for latin  dixii have spoken he answered sternly do not fail me in obedience on your life and on that he clanked out again with his attendants wellpleased with his mornings work  as he had disposed with boyish almost irresponsible rashness and in flagrant contravention of all canon law so it fell out don zuleyman wearing the bishops robes and the bishops mitre intoned the kyrie eleison before noon that day in the cathedral of coimbra and pronounced the absolution of the infante of portugal who knelt so submissively and devoutly before him  affonso henriques was very pleased with himself he made a jest of the affair and invited his intimates to laugh with him but emigio moniz and the elder members of his council refused to laugh they looked with awe upon a deed that went perilously near to sacrilege and implored him to take their own sober view of the thing he had done  by the bones of st james he cried a prince is not to be browbeaten by a priest  such a view in the twelfth century was little short of revolutionary the chapter of the cathedral of coimbra held the converse opinion that priests were not to be browbeaten by a prince and set themselves to make affonso henriques realize this to his bitter cost they dispatched to rome an account of his unconscionable highhanded incredible sacrilege and invited rome to administer condign spiritual flagellation upon this errant child of mother church rome made haste to vindicate her authority and dispatched a legate to the recalcitrant audacious boy who ruled in portugal but the distance being considerable and means of travel inadequate and slow it was not until don zuleyman had presided in the see of coimbra for a full two months that the papal legate made his appearance in affonso henriques capital  a very splendid prince of the church was cardinal corrado the envoy dispatched by pope honorius ii full armed with apostolic weapons to reduce the rebellious infante of portugal into proper subjection  his approach was heralded by the voice of rumour affonso henriques heard of it without perturbation his conscience at ease in the absolution which he had wrung from mother church after his own fashion he was entirely absorbed in preparations for a campaign against the moors which was to widen his dominions therefore when at length the thunderbolt descended it fellso far as he was concernedfrom a sky entirely clear  it was towards dusk of a summer evening when the legate in a litter slung in line between two mules entered coimbra he was attended by two nephews giannino and pierluigi da corrado both patricians of rome and a little knot of servants empanoplied in his sacred office the cardinal had no need of the protection of menatarms upon a journey through godfearing lands  he was borne straight to the old moorish palace where the infante resided and came upon him there amid a numerous company in the great pillared hall against a background of battle trophies livid weapons implements of war and suits of mail both saracen and christian with which the bare walls were hung moved a gailyclad courtly gathering of nobles and their womenfolk when the great cardinal clad from head to foot in scarlet entered unannounced  laughter rippled into silence a hush descended upon the company which stood now at gaze considering the imposing and unbidden guest slowly the legate followed by the two roman youths advanced down the hall the soft pad of his slippered feet and the rustle of his silken robes being at first the only sound on he came until he stood before the shallow dais where in a massively carved chair sat the infante of portugal mistrustfully observing him affonso henriques scented here an enemy an ally of his mothers the bearer of a fresh declaration of hostilities therefore of deliberate purpose he kept his seat as if to stress the fact that here he was the master  lord cardinal he greeted the legate be welcome to my land of portugal  the cardinal bowed stiffly resentful of this reception in his long journey across the spains princes and nobles had flocked to kiss his hand and bend the knee before him seeking his blessing yet this mere boy beardless save for a silky down about his firm young cheeks retained his seat and greeted him with no more submissiveness than if he had been the envoy of some temporal prince  i am the representative of our holy father he announced in a voice of stern reproof i am from rome with these my wellbeloved nephews  from rome quoth affonso henriques for all his length of limb and massive thews he could be impish upon occasion he was impish now although no good has ever yet come to me from rome you make me hopeful his holiness will have heard of the preparations i am making for a war against the infidel that shall carry the cross where new stands the crescent and sends me perhaps a gift of gold or assist me in this holy work  the mockery of it stung the legate sharply his sallow ascetic face empurpled  it is not gold i bring you he answered but a lesson in the faith which you would seem to have forgotten i am come to teach you your christian duty and to require of you immediate reparation of the sacrilegious wrongs you have done the holy father demands of you the instant reinstatement of the bishop of coimbra whom you have driven out with threats of violence and the degradation of the cleric you blasphemously appointed bishop in his stead  and is that all quoth the boy in a voice dangerously quiet  no fearless in his sense of right the legate towered before him it is demanded of you further that you instantly release the lady your mother from the unjust confinement in which you hold her  that confinement is not unjust as all here can witness the infante answered rome may believe it because lies have been carried to rome dona theresas life was a scandal her regency an injustice to my people she and the infamous lord of trava lighted the torch of civil war in these dominions learn here the truth and carry it to rome thus shall you do worthy service  but the prelate was obstinate and proud  that is not the answer that our holy father awaits  it is the answer that i send  rash rebellious youth beware the cardinals anger flamed up and his voice swelled i come armed with spiritual weapons of destruction do not abuse the patience of mother church or you shall feel the full weight of her wrath released against you  exasperated affonso henriques bounded to his feet his face livid now with passion his eyes ablaze  out away he cried go my lord and go quickly or as god watches us i will add here and now yet another sacrilege to those of which you accuse me  the prelate gathered his ample robes about him if pale he was entirely calm once more with stern dignity he bowed to the angry youth and so departed but with such outward impassivity that it would have been difficult to say with whom lay the victory if affonso henriques thought that night that he had conquered morning was to shatter the illusion  he was awakened early by a chamberlain at the urgent instances of emigio moniz who was demanding immediate audience affonso henriques sat up in bed and bade him to be admitted  the elderly knight and faithful counsellor came in treading heavily his swarthy face was overcast his mouth set in stern lines under its grizzled beard  god keep you lord was his greeting so lugubriously delivered as to sound like a pious but rather hopeless wish  and you emigio answered him the infante you are early astir what is the cause  iii tidings lord he crossed the room unlatched and flung wide a window listen he bade the prince  on the still morning air arose a sound like the drone of some gigantic hive or of the sea when the tide is making affonso henriques recognized it for the murmur of the multitude  what does it mean he asked and thrust a sinewy leg from the bed  it means that the papal legate has done all that he threatened and something more he has placed your city of coimbra under a ban of excommunication the churches are closed and until the ban is lifted no priest will be found to baptize marry shrive or perform any other sacrament of holy church the people are stricken with terror knowing that they share the curse with you they are massing below at the gates of the alcazar demanding to see you that they may implore you to lift from them the horror of this excommunication  affonso henriques had come to his feet by now and he stood there staring at the old knight his face blenched his stout heart clutched by fear of these impalpable blasting weapons that were being used against him  my god he groaned and asked what must i do  moniz was preternaturally grave it is of the first importance that the people should be pacified  but how  there is one way onlyby a promise that you will submit to the will of the holy father and by penance seek absolution for yourself and your city  a red flush swept into the young cheeks that had been so pale  what he cried his voice a roar release my mother depose zuleyman recall that fugitive recreant who cursed me and humble myself to seek pardon at the hands of this insolent italian cleric may my bones rot may i roast for ever in hellfire if i show myself such a craven and do you counsel it emigiodo you really counsel that he was in a towering rage  listen to that voice emigio answered him and waved a hand to the open window how else will you silence it  affonso henriques sat down on the edge of the bed and took his head in his hands he was checkmatedand yet  he rose and beat his hands together summoning chamberlain and pages to help him dress and arm  where is the legate lodged he asked moniz  he is gone the knight answered him he left at cockcrow taking the road to spain along the mondegoso i learnt from the watch at the river gate  how came they to open for him  his office lord is a key that opens all doors at any hour of day or night they dared not detain or delay him  ha grunted the infante we will go after him then and he made haste to complete his dressing then he buckled on his great sword and they departed  in the courtyard of the alcazar he summoned sancho nunes and a halfdozen menatarms to attend him mounted a charger and with emigio moniz at his side and the others following he rode out across the drawbridge into the open space that was thronged with the clamant inhabitants of the stricken city  a great cry went up when he showed himselfa mighty appeal to him for mercy and the remission of the curse then silence fell a silence that invited him to answer and give comfort  he reined in his horse and standing in his stirrups very tall and virile he addressed them  people of coimbra he announced i go to obtain this citys absolution from the ban that has been laid upon it i shall return before sunset till then do you keep the peace  the voice of the multitude was raised again this time to hail him as the father and protector of the portuguese and to invoke the blessing of heaven upon his handsome head  riding between moniz and nunes and followed by his glittering menatarms he crossed the city and took the road along the river by which it was known that the legate had departed all that morning they rode briskly amain the infante fasting as he had risen yet unconscious of hunger and of all else but the purpose that was consuming him he rode in utter silence his face set his brows stern and moniz watching him furtively the while wondered what thoughts were stirring in that rash impetuous young brain and was afraid  towards noon at last they overtook the legates party they espied his mulelitter at the door of an inn in a little village some ten miles beyond the foothills of the bussaco range the infante reined up sharply a hoarse fierce cry escaping him akin to that of some creature of the wild when it espies its prey  moniz put forth a hand to seize his arm  my lord my lord he cried fearfully what is your purpose  the prince looked him between the eyes and his lips curled in a smile that was not altogether sweet  i am going to beg cardinal corrado to have compassion on me he answered subtly mocking and on that he swung down from his horse and tossed the reins to a manatarms  into the inn he clanked moniz and nunes following closely he thrust aside the vinter who not knowing him would have hindered him great lord though he seemed from disturbing the holy guest who was honouring the house he strode on and into the room where the cardinal with his noble nephews sat at dinner  at sight of him fearing violence giannino and pierluigi came instantly to their feet their hands upon their daggers but cardinal da corrado sat unmoved he looked up a smile of ineffable gentleness upon his ascetic face  i had hoped that you would come after me my son he said if you come a penitent then has my prayer been heard  a penitent cried affonso henriques he laughed wickedly and plucked his dagger from its sheath  sancho nunes in terror set a detaining hand upon his princes arm  my lord he cried in a voice that shook you will not strike the lords anointedthat were to destroy yourself for ever  a curse said affonso henriques perishes with him that uttered it he could reason loosely you see this hotblooded impetuous young cutter of gordian knots and it imports above all else that the curse should be lifted from my city of coimbra  it shall be my son as soon as you show penitence and a christian submission to the holy fathers will said the undaunted cardinal  god give me patience with you affonso henriques answered him listen to me now lord cardinal and he leaned forward on his dagger burying the point of it some inches into the deal table that you should punish me with the weapons of the faith for the sins that you allege against me i can understand and suffer there is reason in that perhaps but will you tell me what reasons there can be in punishing a whole city for an offence which if it exists at all is mine aloneand in punishing it by a curse so terrible that all the consolations of religion are denied those true children of mother church that no priestly office may be performed within the city that men and women may not approach the altars of the faith that they must die unshriven with their sins upon them and so be damned through all eternity where is the reason that urges this  the cardinals smile had changed from one of benignity to one of guile  why i will answer you out of their terror they will be moved to revolt against you unless you relieve them of the ban thus lord prince i hold you in check you make submission or else you are destroyed  affonso henriques considered him a moment you answer me indeed said he and then his voice swelled up in denunciation but this is statecraft not religion and when a prince has no statecraft to match that which is opposed to him do you know what follows he has recourse to force lord cardinal you compel me to it upon your own head the consequences  the legate almost sneered what is the force of your poor lethal weapons compared with the spiritual power i wield do you threaten me with death do you think i fear it he rose in a surge of sudden wrath and tore open his scarlet robe strike here with your poniard i wear no mail strike if you dare and by the sacrilegious blow destroy yourself in this world and the next  the infante considered him slowly he sheathed his dagger smiling a little then he beat his hands together his menatarms came in  seize me those two roman whelps he commanded and pointed to giannino and pierlulgi seize them and make them fast about it  lord prince cried the legate in a voice of appeal wherein fear and anger trembled  it was the note of fear that heartened affonso henriques about it he cried again though needlessly for already his menatarms were at grips with the cardinals nephews in a trice the kicking biting swearing pair were overpowered deprived of arms and pinioned the men looked to their prince for further orders in the background moniz and nunes witnessed all with troubled countenances whilst the cardinal beyond the table white to the lips demanded in a quavering voice to know what violence was intended implored the infante to consider and in the same breath threatened him with dread consequences of this affront  affonso henriques unmoved pointed through the window to a stalwart oak that stood before the inn  take them out there and hang them unshriven he commanded  the cardinal swayed and almost fell forward he clutched the table speechless with terror for those lads who were as the very apple of his eye he who so fearlessly had bared his own breast to the steel  the two comely italian youths were dragged out writhing in their captors hands  at last the halfswooning legate found his voice lord prince he gasped lord prince you cannot do this infamy you cannot i warn you that that the threat perished unuttered slain by mounting terror mercy have mercy lord as you hope for mercy  what mercy do you practice you who preach a gospel of mercy in the world and cry for mercy now the infante asked him  but this is an infamy what harm have those poor children done what concern is it of theirs that i have offended you in performing my sacred duty  swift into that opening flashed the homethrust of the infantes answer  what harm have my people of coimbra done what concern is it of theirs that i have offended you yet to master me you did not hesitate to strike at them with the spiritual weapons that are yours to master you i do not hesitate to strike at your nephews with the lethal weapons that are mine when you shall have seen them hang you will understand the things that argument could not make clear to you in the vileness of my act you will see a reflection of the vileness of your own and perhaps your heart will be touched your monstrous pride abated  outside under the tree the figures of the menatarms were moving expeditiously and with indifference they went about the preparations for the task entrusted to them  the cardinal writhed and fought for breath lord prince this must not be he stretched forth supplicating hands lord prince you must release my nephews  lord cardinal you must absolve my people  if if you will first make submission my duty to the holy see oh god will nothing move you  when they have been hanged you will understand and out of your own affliction learn compassion the infantes voice was so cold his mien so resolute that the legate despaired of conquering his purpose abruptly he capitulated even as the halters went about the necks of his two cherished lads  stop he screamed bid them stop the curse shall be lifted  affonso henriques opened the window with a leisureliness which to the legate seemed to belong to the realm of nightmare  wait yet a moment the infante called to those outside about whom by now a little knot of awestricken villagers had gathered then he turned again to cardinal corrado who had sunk to his chair like a man exhausted and sat now panting his elbows on the table his head in his hands here said the prince are the terms upon which you may have their lives complete absolution and apostolic benediction for my people and myself this very night i on my side making submission to the holy fathers will to the extent of releasing my mother from duress with the condition that she leaves portugal at once and does not return as for the banished bishop and his successor matters must remain as they are but you can satisfy your conscience on that score by yourself confirming the appointment of don zuleyman come my lord i am being generous i think in the enlargement of my mother i afford you the means of satisfying rome if you have learnt your lesson from what i here proposed your conscience should satisfy you of the rest  be it so the cardinal answered hoarsely i will return with you to coimbra and do your will  thereupon without any tinge of mockery but in completest sincerity in token that the feud between them was now completely healed affonso henriques went down upon his knees like the true and humble son of holy church he accounted himself to ask a blessing at the cardinals hands      ii the false demetrius  boris godunov and the pretended son of ivan the terrible    the news of it first reached him whilst he sat at supper in the great hall of his palace in the kremlin it came at a time when already there was enough to distract his mind for although the table before him was spread and equipped as became an emperors the gaunt spectre of famine stalked outside in the streets of moscow and men and women were so reduced by it that cannibalism was alleged to be breaking out amongst them  alone save for the ministering pages sat boris godunov under the iron lamps that made of the table with its white napery and vessels of gold and silver plate an island of light in the gloom of that vast apartment the air was fragrant with the scent of burning pine for although the time of year was may the nights were chill and a great logfire was blazing on the distant hearth to him as he sat there came his trusted basmanov with those tidings which startled him at first seeming to herald that at last the sword of nemesis was swung above his sinful head  basmanov a flush tinting the prominent cheekbones of his sallow face an excited glitter in his long eyes began by ordering the pages out of earshot then leaning forward quickly muttered forth his news  at the first words of it the tsars knife clashed into his golden platter and his short powerful hands clutched the carved arms of his great gilded chair quickly he controlled himself and then as he continued to listen he was moved to scorn and a faint smile began to stir under his grizzled beard  a man had appeared in polandsuch was the burden of basmanovs storycoming none knew exactly whence who claimed to be demetrius the son of ivan vassielivitch and lawful tsar of russiademetrius who was believed to have died at uglich ten years ago and whose remains lay buried in moscow in the church of st michael this man had found shelter in lithuania in the house of prince wisniowiecki and thither the nobles of poland were now flocking to do him homage acknowledging him the son of ivan the terrible he was said to be the living image of the dead tsar save that he was swarthy and blackhaired like the dowager tsarina and there were two warts on his face such as it was remembered had disfigured the countenance of the boy demetrius  thus basmanov adding that he had dispatched a messenger into lithuania to obtain more precise confirmation of the story that messengerchosen in consequence of something else that basmanov had been toldwas smirnoy otrepiev  the tsar boris sat back in his chair his eyes on the gem encrusted goblet the stem of which his fingers were mechanically turning there was now no vestige of the smile on his round white face it had grown set and thoughtful  find prince shuiski he said presently and send him to me here  upon the tale the boyar had brought him he offered now no comment  we will talk of this again basmanov was all he said in acknowledgment that he had heard and in dismissal  but when the boyar had gone boris godunov heaved himself to his feet and strode over to the fire his great head sunk between his massive shoulders he was a short thickset bowlegged man inclining to corpulence he set a foot shod in red leather reversed with ermine upon an andiron and leaning an elbow on the carved overmantel rested his brow against his hand his eyes stared into the very heart of the fire as if they beheld there the pageant of the past upon which his mind was bent  nineteen years were sped since ivan the terrible had passed away leaving two sons feodor ivanovitch who had succeeded him and the infant demetrius feodor a weakling who was almost imbecile had married irene the daughter of boris godunov whereby it had fallen out that boris became the real ruler of russia the power behind the throne but his insatiable ambition coveted still more he must wear the crown as well as wield the sceptre and this could not be until the ruric dynasty which had ruled russia for nearly seven centuries should be stamped out between himself and the throne stood his daughters husband and their child and the boy demetrius who had been dispatched with his mother the dowager tsarina to uglich the three must be removed  boris began with the last and sought at first to drive him out of the succession without bloodshed he attempted to have him pronounced illegitimate on the ground that he was the son of ivans seventh wife the orthodox church recognizing no wife as legitimate beyond the third but in this he failed the memory of the terrible tsar the fear of him was still alive in superstitious russia and none dared to dishonour his son so boris had recourse to other and surer means he dispatched his agents to uglich and presently there came thence a story that the boy whilst playing with a knife had been taken with a fit of epilepsy and had fallen running the blade into his throat but it was not a story that could carry conviction to the muscovites since with it came the news that the town of uglich had risen against the emissaries of boris charging them with the murder of the boy and killing them out of hand  terrible had been the vengeance which boris had exacted of the luckless inhabitants of the town two hundred were put to death by his orders and the rest sent into banishment beyond the ural mountains whilst the tsarina maria demetriuss mother for having said that her boy was murdered at the instigation of boris was packed off to a convent and had remained there ever since in close confinement  that had been in 1591 the next to go was feodors infant son and lastlyin 1598feodor himself succumbing to a mysterious illness and leaving boris a clear path to the throne but he ascended it under the burden of his daughters curse feodors widow had boldly faced her father boldly accused him of poisoning her husband to gratify his remorseless ambitions and on a passionate appeal to god to let it be done by him as he had done by others she had departed to a convent swearing never to set eyes upon him again  the thought of her was with him now as he stood there looking into the heart of the fire and perhaps it was the memory of her curse that turned his stout heart to water and made him afraid where there could surely be no cause for fear for five years now had he been tsar of russia and in these five years he had taken such a grip of power as was not lightly to be loosened  long he stood there and there he was found by the magnificent prince shuiski whom he had bidden basmanov to summon  you went to uglich when the tsarevitch demetrius was slain said boris his voice and mien were calm and normal yourself you saw the body there is no possibility that you could have been mistaken in it  mistaken the boyar was taken aback by the question he was a tall man considerably younger than boris who was in his fiftieth year his face was lean and saturnine and there was something sinister in the dark closeset eyes under a single heavy line of eyebrow  boris explained his question telling him what he had learnt from basmanov basil shuiski laughed the story was an absurd one demetrius was dead himself he had held the body in his arms and no mistake was possible  despite himself a sigh of relief fluttered from the lips of boris shuiski was right it was an absurd story this there was nothing to fear he had been a fool to have trembled for a moment  nevertheless in the weeks that followed he brooded more and more over all that basmanov had said it was in the thought that the nobility of poland was flocking to the house of wisniowiecki to do honour to this false son of ivan the terrible that boris found the chief cause of uneasiness there was famine in moscow and empty bellies do not make for loyalty then too the muscovite nobles did not love him he had ruled too sternly and had curbed their power there were men like basil shuiski who knew too muchgreedy ambitious men who might turn their knowledge to evil account the moment might be propitious to the pretender however false his claim therefore boris dispatched a messenger to wisniowiecki with the offer of a heavy bribe if he would yield up the person of this false demetrius  but that messenger returned emptyhanded he had reached bragin too late the pretender had already left the place and was safely lodged in the castle of george mniszek the palatine of sandomir to whose daughter maryna he was betrothed if these were ill tidings for boris there were worse to follow soon within a few months he learned from sandomir that demetrius had removed to cracow and that there he had been publicly acknowledged by sigismund iii of poland as the son of ivan vassielivitch the rightful heir to the crown of russia he heard too the story upon which this belief was founded demetrius had declared that one of the agents employed by boris godunov to procure his murder at uglich had bribed his physician simon to perform the deed simon had pretended to agree as the only means of saving him he had dressed the son of a serf who slightly resembled demetrius in garments similar to those worn by the young prince and thereafter cut the lads throat leaving those who had found the body to presume it to be the princes meanwhile demetrius himself had been concealed by the physician and very shortly thereafter carried away from uglich to be placed in safety in a monastery where he had been educated  such in brief was the story with which demetrius convinced the court of poland and not a few who had known the boy at uglich came forward now to identify with him the grown man who carried in his face so strong a resemblance to ivan the terrible that story which boris now heard was soon heard by all russia and boris realized that something must be done to refute it  but something more than assuranceshis own assuranceswere necessary if the muscovites were to believe him and so at last boris bethought him of the tsarina maria the mother of the murdered boy he had her fetched to moscow from her convent and told her of this pretender who was setting up a claim to the throne of russia supported by the king of poland  she listened impassively standing before him in the black robes and conventual coif which his tyranny had imposed upon her when he had done a faint smile swept over the face that had grown so hard in these last twelve years since that day when her boy had been slain almost under her very eyes  it is a circumstantial tale she said it is perhaps true it is probably true  true he bounded from his seat true what are you saying woman yourself you saw the boy dead  i did and i know who killed him  but you saw him you recognized him for your own since you set the people on to kill those whom you believed had slain him  yes she answered and added the question what do you want of me now  what do i want he was amazed that she should ask exasperated had the conventual confinement turned her head i want your testimony i want you to denounce this fellow for the impostor that he is the people will believe you  you think they will interest had kindled in her glance  what else are you not the mother of demetrius and shall not a mother know her own son  you forget he was ten years of age thena child now he is a grown man of threeandtwenty how can i be sure how can i be sure of anything  he swore a full round oath at her because you saw him dead  yet i may have been mistaken i thought i knew the agents of yours who killed him yet you made me swearas the price of my brothers livesthat i was mistaken perhaps i was more mistaken than we thought perhaps my little demetrius was not slain at all perhaps this mans tale is true  perhaps he broke off to stare at her mistrustfully searchingly what do you mean he asked her sharply  again that wan smile crossed the hard sharpfeatured face that once had been so lovely i mean that if the devil came out of hell and called himself my son i should acknowledge him to your undoing  thus the pentup hate and bitterness of years of brooding upon her wrongs broke forth taken aback he quailed before it his jaw dropped foolishly and he stared at her with wide unblinking eyes  the people will believe me you saythey will believe that a mother should know her own son then are your hours of usurpation numbered  if for a moment it appalled him yet in the end forewarned he was forearmed it was foolish of her to let him look upon the weapon with which she could destroy him the result of it was that she went back to her convent under close guard and was thereafter confined with greater rigour than hitherto  desperately boris heard how the belief in demetrius was gaining ground in russia with the people the nobles might still be sceptical but boris knew that he could not trust them since they had no cause to love him he began perhaps to realize that it is not good to rule by fear  and then at last came smirnoy otrepiev back from cracow where he had been sent by basmanov to obtain with his own eyes confirmation of the rumour which had reached the boyar on the score of the pretenders real identity  the rumour he declared was right the false demetrius was none other than his own nephew grishka otrepiev who had once been a monk but unfrocked had embraced the roman heresy and had abandoned himself to licentious ways you realize now why smirnoy had been chosen by basmanov for this particular mission  the news heartened boris at last he could denounce the impostor in proper terms and denounce him he did he sent an envoy to sigismund iii to proclaim the fellows true identity and to demand his expulsion from the kingdom of poland and his denunciation was supported by a solemn excommunication pronounced by the patriarch of moscow against the unfrocked monk grishka otrepiev who now falsely called himself demetrius ivanovitch  but the denunciation did not carry the conviction that boris expected it was reported that the tsarevitch was a courtly accomplished man speaking polish and latin as well as russian skilled in horsemanship and in the use of arms and it was asked how an unfrocked monk had come by these accomplishments moreover although boris forewarned had prevented the tsarina maria from supporting the pretender out of motives of revenge he had forgotten her two brothers he had not foreseen that actuated by the same motives they might do that which he had prevented her from doing this was what occurred the brothers nagoy repaired to cracow publicly to acknowledge demetrius their nephew and to enrol themselves under his banner  against this boris realized that mere words were useless the sword of nemesis was drawn indeed his sins had found him out nothing remained him but to arm and go forth to meet the impostor who was advancing upon moscow with a great host of poles and cossacks  he appraised the support of the nagoys at its right value they too had been at uglich and had seen the dead boy almost seen him slain vengeance upon himself was their sole motive but was it possible that sigismund of poland was really deceived as well as the palatine of sandomir whose daughter was betrothed to the adventurer prince adam wisniowiecki in whose house the false demetrius had first made his appearance and all those polish nobles who flocked to his banner or were they too moved by some ulterior motive which he could not fathom  that was the riddle that plagued boris godunov what timein the winter of 1604he sent his armies to meet the invader he sent them because crippled now by gout even the satisfaction of leading them was denied him he was forced to stay at home in the gloomy apartments of the kremlin fretted by care with the ghosts of his evil past to keep him company and assure him that the hour of judgment was at hand  with deepening rage he heard how town after town capitulated to the adventurer and mistrusting basmanov who was in command he sent shuiski to replace him in january of 1605 the armies met at dobrinichi and demetrius suffered a severe defeat which compelled him to fall back on putioli he lost all his infantry and every russian taken in arms on the pretenders side was remorselessly hanged as boris had directed  hope began to revive in the heart of boris but as months passed and no decision came those hopes faded again and the canker of the past gnawed at his vitals and sapped his strength and then there was ever present to his mind the nightmare riddle of the pretenders identity at last one evening in april he sent for smirnoy otrepiev to question him again concerning that nephew of his otrepiev came in fear this time it is not good to be the uncle of a man who is giving so much trouble to a great prince  boris glared at him from bloodinjected eyes his round white face was haggard his cheeks sagged and his fleshly body had lost all its erstwhile firm vigour  i have sent for you to question you again he said touching this lewd nephew of yours this grishka otrepiev this unfrocked monk who claims to be tsar of muscovy are you sure man that you have made no mistakeare you sure  otrepiev was shaken by the tsars manner by the ferocity of his mien but he made answer alas highness i could not be mistaken i am sure  boris grunted and moved his body irritably in his chair his terrible eyes watched otrepiev mistrustfully he had reached the mental stage in which he mistrusted everything and everybody  you lie you dog he snarled savagely  highness i swear  lies boris roared him down and heres the proof would sigismund of poland have acknowledged him had he been what you say when i denounced him the unfrocked monk grishka otrepiev would not sigismund have verified the statement had it been true  the brothers nagoy the uncles of the dead demetrius otrepiev was beginning when again boris interrupted him  their acknowledgment of him came after sigismunds afterlong aftermy denunciation he broke into oaths i say you lie will you stand there and pelter with me man will you wait until the rack pulls you joint from joint before you speak the truth  highness cried otrepiev i have served you faithfully these years  the truth man as you hope for life thundered the tsar the whole truth of this foul nephew of yours if so be he is your nephew  and otrepiev spoke the whole truth at last in his great dread he is not my nephew  not it was a roar of rage you dared lie to me  otrepievs knees were loosened by terror and he went down upon them before the irate tsar  i did not lienot altogether i told you a halftruth highness his name is grishka otrepiev it is the name by which he always has been known and he is an unfrocked monk all as i said and the son of my brothers wife  then then boris was bewildered suddenly he understood and his father  was stephen bathory king of poland grishka otrepiev is king stephens natural son  boris seemed to fight for breath for a moment  this is true he asked and himself answered the question of course it is true it is the light at last at last you may go  otrepiev stumbled out thankful surprised to escape so lightly he could not know of how little account to boris was the deception he had practiced in comparison with the truth he had now revealed a truth that shed a fearful dazzling light upon the dark mystery of the false demetrius the problem that so long had plagued the tsar was solved at last  this pretended demetrius this unfrocked monk was a natural son of stephen bathory and a roman catholic such men as sigismund of poland and the voyvode of sandomir were not deceived on the score of his identity they and no doubt other of the leading nobles of poland knew the man for what he was and because of it supported him using the fiction of his being demetrius ivanovitch to impose upon the masses and facilitate the pretenders occupation of the throne of russia and the object of it was to set up in muscovy a ruler who should be a pole and a roman catholic boris knew the bigotry of sigismund who already had sacrificed a thronethat of swedento his devout conscience and he saw clearly to the heart of this intrigue had he not heard that a papal nuncio had been at cracow and that this nuncio had been a stout supporter of the pretenders claim what could be the popes concern in the muscovite succession why should a roman priest support the claim of a prince to the throne of a country devoted to the greek faith  at last all was clear indeed to boris rome was at the bottom of this business whose true aim was the romanization of russia and sigismund had fetched rome into it had set rome on himself an elected king of poland sigismund may have seen in the ambitious son of stephen bathory one who might perhaps supplant him on the polish throne to divert his ambition into another channel he had fatheredif he had not inventedthis fiction that the pretender was the dead demetrius  had that fool smirnoy otrepiev but dealt frankly with him from the first what months of annoyance might he not have been spared how easy it might have been to prick this bubble of imposture but better late than never tomorrow he would publish the true facts and all the world should know the truth and it was a truth that must give pause to those fools in this superstitious russia so devoted to the orthodox greek church who favoured the pretender they should see the trap that was being baited for them  there was a banquet in the kremlin that night to certain foreign envoys and boris came to table in better spirits than he had been for many a day he was heartened by the thought of what was now to do by the conviction that he held the false demetrius in the hollow of his hand there to those envoys he would announce tonight what tomorrow he would announce to all russiatell them of the discovery he had made and reveal to his subjects the peril in which they stood towards the close of the banquet he rose to address his guests announcing that he had an important communication for them in silence they waited for him to speak and then abruptly with no word yet spoken he sank back into his chair fighting for breath clawing the air his face empurpling until suddenly the blood gushed copiously from his mouth and nostrils  he was vouchsafed time in which to strip off his splendid apparel and wrap himself in a monks robe thus symbolizing the putting aside of earthly vanities and then he expired  it has been now and then suggested that he was poisoned his death was certainly most opportune to demetrius but there is nothing in the manner of it to justify the opinion that it resulted from anything other than an apoplexy  his death brought the sinister opportunist shuiski back to moscow to place boriss son feodor on the throne but the reign of this lad of sixteen was very brief basmanov who had gone back to the army being now inspired by jealousy and fear of the ambitious shuiski went over at once to the pretender and proclaimed him tsar of russia thereafter events moved swiftly basmanov marched on moscow entered it in triumph and again proclaimed demetrius whereupon the people rose in revolt against the son of the usurper boris stormed the kremlin and strangled the boy and his mother  basil shuiski would have shared their fate had he not bought his life at the price of betrayal publicly he declared to the muscovites that the boy whose body he had seen at uglich was not that of demetrius but of a peasants son who had been murdered in his stead  that statement cleared the last obstacle from the pretenders path and he advanced now to take possession of his throne yet before he occupied it he showed the real principles that actuated him proved how true had been boriss conclusion he ordered the arrest and degradation of the patriarch who had denounced and excommunicated him and in his place appointed ignatius bishop of riazan a man suspected of belonging to the roman communion  on the 30th of june of that year 1605 demetrius made his triumphal entry into moscow he went to prostrate himself before the tomb of ivan the terrible and then to visit the tsarina maria who after a brief communion with him in private came forth publicly to acknowledge him as her son  just as shuiski had purchased his life by a falsehood so did she purchase her enlargement from that convent where so long she had been a prisoner and restoration to the rank that was her proper due after all she had cause for gratitude to demetrius who in addition to restoring her these things had avenged her upon the hated boris godunov  his coronation followed in due season and at last this amazing adventurer found himself firmly seated upon the throne of russia with basmanov at his right hand to help and guide him and at first all went well and the young tsar earned a certain measure of popularity if his swarthy face was coarsefeatured yet his bearing was so courtly and gracious that he won his way quickly to the hearts of his people for the rest he was of a tall graceful figure a fine horseman and of a knightly address at arms  but he soon found himself in the impossible position of having to serve two masters on the one hand there was russia and the orthodox russians whose tsar he was and on the other there were the poles who had made him so at a price and who now demanded payment because he saw that this payment would be difficult and fraught with peril to himself he wouldafter the common wont of princes who have attained their objectshave repudiated the debt and so he was disposed to ignore or at least to evade the persistent reminders that reached him from the papal nuncio to whom he had promised the introduction into russia of the roman faith  but presently came a letter from sigismund couched in different terms the king of poland wrote to demetrius that word had reached him that boris godunov was still alive and that he had taken refuge in england adding that he might be tempted to restore the fugitive to the throne of muscovy  the threat contained in that bitter piece of sarcasm aroused demetrius to a sense of the responsibilities he had undertaken which were precisely as boris godunov had surmised as a beginning he granted the jesuits permission to build a church within the sacred walls of the kremlin whereby he gave great scandal soon followed other signs that he was not a true son of the orthodox greek church he gave offence by his indifference to public worship by his neglect of russian customs and by surrounding himself with roman catholic poles upon whom he conferred high offices and dignities  and there were those at hand ready to stir up public feeling against him resentful boyars quick to suspect that perhaps they had been swindled foremost among these was the sinister turncoat shuiski who had not derived from his perjury all the profit he expected who resented above all to see basmanovwho had ever been his rivalinvested with a power second only to that of the tsar himself shuiski skilled in intrigue went to work in his underground burrowing fashion he wrought upon the clergy who in their turn wrought upon the populace and presently all was seething disaffection under a surface apparently calm  the eruption came in the following may when maryna the daughter of the palatine of sandomir made her splendid entry into moscow the brideelect of the young tsar the dazzling procession and the feasting that followed found little favour in the eyes of the muscovites who now beheld their city aswarm with heretic poles  the marriage was magnificently solemnized on the 18th of may 1606 and now shuiski applied a match to the train he had so skilfully laid demetrius had caused a timber fort to be built before the walls of moscow for a martial spectacle which he had planned for the entertainment of his bride shuiski put it abroad that the fort was intended to serve as an engine of destruction and that the martial spectacle was a pretence the real object being that from the fort the poles were to cast firebrands into the city and then proceed to the slaughter of the inhabitants  no more was necessary to infuriate an already exasperated populace they flew to arms and on the night of the 29th of may they stormed the kremlin led on by the archtraitor shuiski himself to the cry of death to the heretic death to the impostor  they broke into the palace and swarmed up the stairs into the tsars bedchamber slaying the faithful basmanov who stood sword in hand to bar the way and give his master time to escape the tsar leapt from a balcony thirty feet to the ground broke his leg and lay there helpless to be dispatched by his enemies who presently discovered him  he died firmly and fearlessly protesting that he was demetrius ivanovitch nevertheless he was grishka otrepiev the unfrocked monk  it has been said that he was no more than an instrument in the hands of priestcraft and that because he played his part badly he met his doom but something more he was he was an instrument indeed not of priestcraft but of fate to bring home to boris godunov the hideous sins that stained his soul and to avenge his victims by personating one of them in that personation he had haunted boris as effectively as if he had been the very ghost of the boy murdered at uglich haunted and tortured and finally broken him so that he died  that was the part assigned him by fate in the mysterious scheme of human things and that part being played the rest mattered little in the nature of him and of his position it was impossible that his imposture should be other than ephemeral      iii the hermosa fembra  an episode of the inquisition in seville    apprehension hung like a thundercloud over the city of seville in those early days of the year 1481 it had been growing since the previous october when the cardinal of spain and frey tomas de torquemada acting jointly on behalf of the sovereignsferdinand and isabellahad appointed the first inquisitors for castile ordering them to set up a tribunal of the faith in seville to deal with the apostatizing said to be rampant among the newchristians or baptized jews who made up so large a proportion of the population  among the many oppressive spanish enactments against the children of israel it was prescribed that all should wear the distinguishing circlet of red cloth on the shoulder of their gabardines that they should reside within the walled confines of their ghettos and never be found beyond them after nightfall and that they should not practice as doctors surgeons apothecaries or innkeepers the desire to emancipate themselves from these and other restrictions upon their commerce with christians and from the generally intolerable conditions of bondage and ignominy imposed upon them had driven many to accept baptism and embrace christianity  but even such newchristians as were sincere in their professions of faith failed to find in this baptism the peace they sought bitter racial hostility though sometimes tempered was never extinguished by their conversion  hence the alarm with which they viewed the gloomy funereal sinister pageantthe whiterobed blackmantled and hooded inquisitors with their attendant familiars and barefoot friarsheaded by a dominican bearing the white cross which invaded the city of seville one day towards the end of december and took its way to the convent of st paul there to establish the holy office of the inquisition the fear of the newchristians that they were to be the object of the attentions of this dread tribunal had sufficed to drive some thousands of them out of the city to seek refuge in such feudal lordships as those of the duke of medina sidonia the marquis of cadiz and the count of arcos  this exodus had led to the publication by the newly appointed inquisitors of the edict of 2nd january in which they set forth that inasmuch as it had come to their knowledge that many persons had departed out of seville in fear of prosecution upon grounds of heretical pravity they commanded the nobles of the kingdom of castile that within fifteen days they should make an exact return of the persons of both sexes who had sought refuge in their lordships or jurisdictions that they arrest all these and lodge them in the prison of the inquisition in seville confiscating their property and holding it at the disposal of the inquisitors that none should shelter any fugitive under pain of greater excommunication and of other penalties by law established against abettors of heretics  the harsh injustice that lay in this call to arrest men and women merely because they had departed from seville before departure was in any way forbidden revealed the severity with which the inquisitors intended to proceed it completed the consternation of the newchristians who had remained behind and how numerous these were may be gathered from the fact that in the district of seville alone they numbered a hundred thousand many of them occupying thanks to the industry and talent characteristic of their race positions of great eminence it even disquieted the wellfavoured young don rodrigo de cardona who in all his vain empty pampered and rather vicious life had never yet known perturbation not that he was a newchristian he was of a lineage that went back to the visigoths of purest red castilian blood untainted by any strain of that darkhued unclean fluid alleged to flow in hebrew veins but it happened that he was in love with the daughter of the millionaire diego de susan a girl whose beauty was so extraordinary that she was known throughout seville and for many a mile around as la hermosa fembra and he knew that such commercelicit or illicitly conductedwas disapproved by the holy fathers his relations with the girl had been perforce clandestine because the disapproval of the holy fathers was matched in thoroughness by that of diego de susan it had been vexatious enough on that account not to be able to boast himself the favoured of the beautiful and opulent isabella de susan it was exasperating to discover now a new and more imperative reason for this odious secrecy  never sped a lover to his mistress in a frame of mind more aggrieved than that which afflicted don rodrigo as tightwrapped in his black cloak he gained the calle de ataud on that january night  anon however when by way of a garden gate and an easily escaladed balcony he found himself in the presence of isabella the delight of her effaced all other considerations her father was from home as she had told him in the note that summoned him he was away at palacios on some merchants errand and would not return until the morrow the servants were all abed and so don rodrigo might put off his cloak and hat and lounge at his ease upon the low moorish divan what time she waited upon him with a saracen goblet filled with sweet wine of malaga the room in which she received him was one set apart for her own use her bower a long low ceilinged chamber furnished with luxury and taste the walls were hung with tapestries the floor spread with costly eastern rugs on an inlaid moorish table a tall threebeaked lamp of beaten copper charged with aromatic oil shed light and perfume through the apartment  don rodrigo sipped his wine and his dark hungry eyes followed her as she moved about him with vaguely voluptuous almost feline grace the wine the heavy perfume of the lamp and the beauty of her played havoc among them with his senses so that he forgot for the moment his castilian lineage and clean christian blood forgot that she derived from the accursed race of the crucifiers all that he remembered was that she was the loveliest woman in seville daughter to the wealthiest man and in that hour of weakness he decided to convert into reality that which had hitherto been no more than an infamous presence he would loyally fulfil the false disloyal promises he had made he would take her to wife it was a sacrifice which her beauty and her wealth should make worth while upon that impulse he spoke now abruptly  isabella when will you marry me  she stood before him looking down into his weak handsome face her fingers interlacing his own she merely smiled the question did not greatly move her not knowing him for the scoundrel that he was guessing nothing of the present perturbation of his senses she found it very natural that he should ask her to appoint the day  it is a question you must ask my father she answered him  i will said he tomorrow on his return and he drew her down beside him  but that father was nearer than either of them dreamed at that very moment the soft thud of the closing housedoor sounded through the house it brought her sharply to her feet and loose from his coiling arms with quickened breath and blanching face a moment she hung there tense then sped to the door of the room set it ajar and listened  up the stairs came the sound of footsteps and of muttering voices it was her father and others with him  with evermounting fear she turned to don rodrigo and breathed the question if they should come here  the castilian stood where he had risen by the divan his face paler now than its pale aristocratic wont his eyes reflecting the fear that glittered in her own he had no delusion as to what action diego de susan would take upon discovering him these jewish dogs were quickly stirred to passion and as jealous as their betters of the honour of their womenfolk already don rodrigo in imagination saw his clean red christian blood bespattering that hebrew floor for he had no weapon save the heavy toledo dagger at his girdle and diego de susan was not alone  it was he felt a ridiculous position for a hidalgo of spain but his dignity was to suffer still greater damage in another moment she had bundled him into an alcove behind the arras at the chambers end a tiny closet that was no better than a cupboard contrived for the storing of household linen she hadmoved with a swift precision which at another time might have provoked his admiration snatching up his cloak and hat and other evidences of his presence quenching the lamp and dragging him to that place of cramped concealment which she remained to share with him  came presently movements in the room beyond and the voice of her father  we shall be securest from intrusion here it is my daughters room if you will give me leave i will go down again to admit our other friends  those other friends as don rodrigo gathered continued to arrive for the next halfhour until in the end there must have been some twenty of them assembled in that chamber the mutter of voices had steadily increased but so confused that no more than odd words affording no clue to the reason of this gathering had reached the hidden couple  and then quite suddenly a silence fell and on that silence beat the sharp clear voice of diego de susan addressing them  my friends he said i have called you hither that we may concert measures for the protection of ourselves and all newchristians in seville from the fresh peril by which we are menaced the edict of the inquisitors reveals how much we have to fear you may gather from it that the court of the holy office is hardly likely to deal in justice and that the most innocent may find himself at any moment exposed to its cruel mercies therefore it is for us now to consider how to protect ourselves and our property from the unscrupulous activities of this tribunal you are the principal new christian citizens of seville you are wealthy not only in property but also in the goodwill of the people who trust and respect and at need will follow you if nothing less will serve we must have recourse to arms and so that we are resolute and united my friends we shall prevail against the inquisitors  within the alcove don rodrigo felt his skin roughening with horror at this speech which breathed sedition not only against the sovereigns but against the very church and with his horror was blent a certain increase of fear if his situation had been perilous before it was tenfold more dangerous now discovery since he had overheard this treason must mean his certain death and isabella realizing the same to the exclusion of all else clutched his arm and cowered against him in the dark  there was worse to follow susans address was received with a murmur of applause and then others spoke and several were named and their presence thus disclosed there was the influential manuel sauli who next to susan was the wealthiest man in seville there was torralba the governor of triana juan abolafio the farmer of the royal customs and his brother fernandez the licentiate and there were othersall of them men of substance some even holding office under the crown not one was there who dissented from anything that susan had said rather did each contribute some spur to the general resolve in the end it was concerted that each of those present should engage himself to raise a proportion of the men arms and money that would be needed for their enterprise and upon that the meeting was dissolved and they departed susan himself went with them he had work to do in the common cause he announced and he would do it that very night in which it was supposed that he was absent at palacios  at last when all had gone and the house was still again isabella and her lover crept forth from their concealment and in the light of the lamp which susan had left burning each looked into the others white startled face so shaken was don rodrigo with horror of what he had overheard and with the terror of discovery that it was with difficulty he kept his teeth from chattering  heaven protect us he gasped what judaizing was this  judaizing she echoed it was the term applied to apostacy to the relapse of newchristians to judaism an offense to be expiated at the stake here was no judaizing are you mad rodrigo you heard no single word that sinned against the faith  did i not i heard treason enough to  no nor treason either you heard honourable upright men considering measures of defence against oppression injustice and evil acquisitiveness masquerading in the holy garments of religion  he stared askance at her for a moment then his full lips curled into a sneer of course you would seek to justify them he said you are of that foul brood yourself but you cannot think to cozen me who am of clean oldchristian blood and a true son of mother church these men plot evil against the holy inquisition is that not judaizing when it is done by jews  she was white to the lips and a new horror stared at him from her great dark eyes her lovely bosom rose and fell in tumult yet still she sought to reason with him  they are not jewsnot one of them why perez is himself in holy orders all of them are christians and  newlybaptized he broke in sneering viciously a defilement of that holy sacrament to gain them worldly advantages that is revealed by what passed here just now jews they were born the sons of jews and jews they remain under their cloak of mock christianity to be damned as jews in the end he was panting now with fiery indignation a holy zeal inflamed this profligate defiler god forgive me that ever i entered here yet i do believe that it was his will that i should come to overhear what is being plotted let me depart from hence  with a passionate gesture of abhorrence he swung towards the door her clutch upon his arm arrested him  whither do you go she asked trim sharply he looked now into her eyes and of all that they contained he saw only fear he saw nothing of the hatred into which her love had been transmuted in that moment by his unsparing insults to herself her race and her home by the purpose which she clearly read in him  whither he echoed and sought to shake her off  whither my christian duty bids me  it was enough for her before he could prevent or suspect her purpose she had snatched the heavy toledo blade from his girdle and armed with it stood between the door and him  a moment don rodrigo do not attempt to advance or as heaven watches us i strike and it maybe that i shall kill you we must talk awhile before you go  amazed chapfallen halfpalsied he stood before her his fine religious zeal wiped out by fear of that knife in her weak womans hand rapidly tonight was she coming into real knowledge of this castilian gentleman whom with pride she had taken for her lover it was a knowledge that was to sear her presently with selfloathing and selfcontempt but for the moment her only consideration was that as a direct result of her own wantonness her father stood in mortal peril if he should perish through the deletion of this creature she would account herself his slayer  you have not considered that the deletion you intend will destroy my father she said quietly  there is my christian duty to consider answered he but without boldness now  perhaps but there is something you must set against it have you no duty as a loverno duty to me  no earthly duty can weigh against a spiritual obligation  ah wait have patience you have not well considered that is plain in coming here in secret you wronged my father you will not trouble to deny it  jointly we wronged him you and i will you then take advantage of something learnt whilst you were hiding there like a thief from the consequences of what you did and so do him yet this further wrong  must i wrong my conscience he asked her sullenly  indeed i fear you must  imperil my immortal soul he almost laughed  you talk in vain  but i have something more than words for you with her left hand she drew upon the fine gold chain about her neck and brought forth a tiny jewelled cross passing the chain over her head she held it out  take this she bade him take it i say now with that sacred symbol in your hand make solemn oath to divulge no word of what you have learnt here tonight or else resign yourself to an unshriven death for either you take that oath or i rouse the servants and have you dealt with as one who has intruded here unbidden for an evil end she backed away from him as she spoke and threw wide the door then confronting him from the threshold she admonished him again her voice no louder than a whisper quick now resolve yourself will you die here with all your sins upon you and so destroy for all eternity the immortal soul that urges you to this betrayal or will you take the oath that i require  he began an argument that was like a sermon of the faith but she cut him short for the last time she bade him will you decide  he chose the cowards part of course and did violence tomb fine conscience with the cross in his hand he repeated after her the words of the formidable oath that she administered an oath which it must damn his immortal soul to break because of that because she imagined that she had taken the measure of his faith she returned him his dagger and let him go at last she imagined that she had bound him fast in irrefragable spiritual bonds  and even on the morrow when her father and all those who had been present at that meeting at susans house were arrested by order of the holy office of the inquisition she still clung to that belief yet presently a doubt crept in a doubt that she must at all costs resolve and so presently she called for her litter and had herself carried to the convent of st paul where she asked to see frey alonso de ojeda the prior of the dominicans of seville  she was left to wait in a square cheerless dimlylighted room pervaded by a musty smell that had for only furniture a couple of chairs and a prayingstool and for only ornament a great gaunt crucifix hanging upon one of its whitewashed walls  thither came presently two dominican friars one of these was a harshfeatured man of middle height and square build the uncompromising zealot ojeda the other was tall and lean stooping slightly at the shoulders haggard and pale of countenance with deepset luminous dark eyes and a tender wistful mouth this was the queens confessor frey tomas de torquemada grand inquisitor of castile he approached her leaving ojeda in the background and stood a moment regarding her with eyes of infinite kindliness and compassion  you are the daughter of that misguided man diego de susan he said in a gentle voice god help and strengthen you my child against the trials that may be in store for you what do you seek at our poor hands speak child without fear  father she faltered i come to implore your pity  no need to implore it child should i withhold pity who stand myself in need of pity being a sinneras are we all  it is for my father that i come to beg your mercy  so i supposed a shade crossed the gentle wistful face the tender melancholy deepened in the eyes that regarded her if your father is innocent of what has been alleged against him the benign tribunal of the holy office will bring his innocence to light and rejoice therein if he is guilty if he has strayedas we may all stray unless fortified by heavenly gracehe shall be given the means of expiation that his salvation may be assured him  she shivered at the words she knew the mercy in which the inquisitors dealt a mercy so spiritual that it took no account of the temporal agonies inflicted to ensure it  my father is innocent of any sin against the faith said she  are you so sure croaked the harsh voice of ojeda breaking in consider well remember that your duty as a christian is above your duty as a daughter  almost had she bluntly demanded the name of her fathers accuser that thus she might reach the object of her visit betimes she checked the rash impulse perceiving that subtlety was here required that a direct question would close the door to all information skilfully then she chose her line of attack  i am sure she exclaimed that he is a more fervent and pious christiannewchristian though he bethan his accuser  the wistfulness faded from torquemadas eyes they grew keen as became the eyes of an inquisitor the eyes of a sleuth quick to fasten on a spoor but he shook his head  ojeda advanced that i cannot believe said he the deletion was made from a sense of duty so pure that the delator did not hesitate to confess the sin of his own commission through which he had discovered the treachery of don diego and his associates  she could have cried out in anguish at this answer to her unspoken question yet she controlled herself and that no single doubt should linger she thrust boldly home  he confessed it she cried seemingly aghast the friar slowly nodded don rodrigo confessed she insisted as will the incredulous  abruptly the friar nodded again and as abruptly checked recollecting himself  don rodrigo he echoed and asked who mentioned don rodrigo  but it was too late his assenting nod had betrayed the truth had confirmed her worst fear she swayed a little the room swam round her she felt as she would swoon then blind indignation against that forsworn betrayer surged to revive her if it was through her weakness and undutifulness that her father had been destroyed through her strength should he be avenged though in doing so she pulled down and destroyed herself  and he confessed to his own sin she was repeating slowly ever on that musing incredulous note he dared confess himself a judaizer  a judaizer sheer horror now overspread the friars grim countenance a judaizer don rodrigo oh impossible  but i thought you said he had confessed  why yes but but not to that her pale lips smiled sadly contemptuous  i see he set limits of prudence upon his confession he left out his judatting practices he did not tell you for instance that this deletion was an act of revenge against me who refused to marry him having discovered his unfaith and fearing its consequences in this world and the next  ojeda stared at her in sheer incredulous amazement  and then torquemada spoke do you say that don rodrigo de cardona is a judaizer oh it is unbelievable  yet i could give you evidence that should convince you  then so you shall it is your sacred duty lest you become an abettor of heresy and yourself liable to the extreme penalty  it would be a halfhour later perhaps when she quitted the convent of st paul to return home with hell in her heart knowing in life no purpose but that of avenging the parent her folly had destroyed as she was being carried past the alcazar she espied across the open space a tall slim figure in black in whom she recognized her lover and straightway she sent the page who paced beside her litter to call him to her side the summons surprised him after what had passed between them moreover considering her fathers present condition he was reluctant to be seen in attendance upon the beautiful wealthy isabella de susan nevertheless urged on by curiosity he went  her greeting increased his surprise  i am in deep distress rodrigo as you may judge she told him sadly you will have heard what has befallen my father  he looked at her sharply yet saw nothing but loveliness rendered more appealing by sorrow clearly she did not suspect him of betrayal did not realize that an oath extorted by violenceand an oath moreover to be false to a sacred dutycould not be accounted binding  i i heard of it an hour ago he lied a thought unsteadily i i commiserate you deeply  i deserve commiseration answered she and so does my poor father and those others it is plain that amongst those he trusted there was a traitor a spy who went straight from that meeting to inform against them if i but had a list it were easy to discover the betrayer one need but ascertain who is the one of all who were present whose arrest has been omitted her lovely sorrowful eyes turned full upon him what is to become of me now alone in the world she asked him my father was my only friend  the subtle appeal of her did its work swiftly besides he saw here a noble opportunity worth surely some little risk  your only friend he asked her thickly was there no one else is there no one else isabella  there was she said and sighed heavily but after what befell last night when you know what is in my mind i was distraught then mad with fear for this poor father of mine so that i could not even consider his sin in its full heinousness nor see how righteous was your intent to inform against him yet i am thankful that it was not by your deletion that he was taken the thought of that is today my only consolation  they had reached her house by now don rodrigo put forth his arm to assist her to alight from her litter and begged leave to accompany her within but she denied him  not nowthough i am grateful to you rodrigo soon if you will come and comfort me you may i will send you word when i am more able to receive youthat is if i am forgiven for  not another word he begged her i honour you for what you did it is i who should sue to you for forgiveness  you are very noble and generous don rodrigo god keep you and so she left him  she had found himhad she but known ita dejected miserable man in the act of reckoning up all that he had lost in betraying susan he had acted upon an impulse that sprang partly from rage and partly from a sense of religious duty in counting later the cost to himself he cursed the folly of his rage and began to wonder if such strict observance of religious duty was really worth while to a man who had his way to make in the world in short he was in the throes of reaction but now in her unsuspicion he found his hopes revive she need never know the holy office preserved inviolate secrecy on the score of deletionssince to do otherwise might be to discourage delatorsand there were no confrontations of accuser and accused such as took place in temporal courts don rodrigo left the calle de ataud better pleased with the world than he had been since morning  on the morrow he went openly to visit her but he was denied a servant announcing her indisposed this fretted him damped his hopes and thereby increased his longing but on the next day he received from her a letter which made him the most ample amends  rodrigothere is a matter on which we must come early to an understanding should my poor father be convicted of heresy and sentenced it follows that his property will be confiscated since as the daughter of a convicted heretic i may not inherit for myself i care little but i am concerned for you rodrigo since if in spite of what has happened you would still wish to make me your wife as you declared on monday it would be my wish to come to you well cowered now the inheritance which would be confiscated by the holy office from the daughter of a heretic might not be so confiscated from the wife of a gentleman of castile i say no more consider this well and decide as your heart dictates i shall receive you tomorrow if you come to me  isabella  she bade him consider well but the matter really needed little consideration diego de susan was sure to go to the fire his fortune was estimated at ten million maravedis that fortune it seemed rodrigo was given the chance to make his own by marrying the beautiful isabella at once before sentence came to be passed upon her father the holy office might impose a fine but would not go further where the inheritance of a castilian nobleman of clean lineage was concerned he was swayed between admiration of her shrewdness and amazement at his own good fortune also his vanity was immensely flattered  he sent her three lines to protest his undying love and his resolve to marry her upon the morrow and went next day in person as she had bidden him to carry out the resolve  she received him in the mansions best room a noble chamber furnished with a richness such as no other house in seville could have boasted she had arrayed herself for the interview with an almost wanton cunning that should enhance her natural endowments her highwaisted gown lowcut and closefitting in the bodice was of cloth of gold edged with miniver at skirt and cuffs and neck on her white bosom hung a priceless carcanet of limpid diamonds and through the heavy tresses of her bronzecoloured hair was coiled a string of lustrous pearls never had don rodrigo found her more desirable never had he felt so secure and glad in his possession of her the quickening blood flushing now his olive face he gathered her slim shapeliness into his arms kissing her cheek her lips her neck  my pearl my beautiful my wife he murmured rapturously then added the impatient question the priest where is the priest that shall make us one  deep unfathomable eyes looked up to meet his burning glance languorously she lay against his breast and her red lips parted in a smile that maddened him  you love me rodrigoin spite of all  love you it was a throbbing strangled cry an almost inarticulate ejaculation better than lifebetter than salvation  she fetched a sigh as of deep content and nestled closer oh i am gladso gladthat your love for me is truly strong i am about to put it to the test perhaps  he held her very close what is this test beloved  it is that i want this marriage knot so tied that it shall be indissoluble save by death  why so do i quoth he who had so much to gain  and therefore because after all though i profess christianity there is jewish blood in my veins i would have a marriage that must satisfy even my father when he regains his freedom as i believe he willfor after all he is not charged with any sin against the faith  she paused and he was conscious of a premonitory chill upon his ardour  what do you mean he asked her and his voice was strained  i meanyoull not be angry with mei mean that i would have us married not only by a christian priest and in the christian manner but also and first of all by a rabbi and in accordance with the jewish rites  upon the words she felt his encircling arms turn limp and relax their grip upon her whereupon she clung to him the more tightly  rodrigo rodrigo if you truly love me if you truly want me youll not deny me this condition for i swear to you that once i am your wife you shall never hear anything again to remind you that i am of jewish blood  his face turned ghastly pale his lips writhed and twitched and beads of sweat stood out upon his brow  my god he groaned what do you ask i i cant it were a desecration a defilement  she thrust him from her in a passion you regard it so you protest love and in the very hour when i propose to sacrifice all to you you will not make this little sacrifice for my sake you even insult the faith that was my forbears if it is not wholly mine i misjudged you else i had not bidden you here today i think you had better leave me  trembling appalled a prey to an ineffable tangle of emotion he sought to plead to extenuate his attitude to move her from her own he ranted torrentially but in vain she stood as cold and aloof as earlier she had been warm and clinging he had proved the measure of his love he could go his ways  the thing she proposed was to him as he had truly said a desecration a defilement yet to have dreamed yourself master of ten million maravedis and a matchless woman is a dream not easily relinquished there was enough cupidity in his nature enough neediness in his condition to make the realization of that dream worth the defilement of the abominable marriage rites upon which she insisted but fear remained where christian scruples were already halfeffaced  you do not realize he cried if it were known that i so much as contemplated this the holy office would account it clear proof of apostasy and send me to the fire  if that were your only objection it were easily overcome she informed him coldly for who should ever inform against you the rabbi who is waiting abovestairs dare not for his own lifes sake betray us and who else will ever know  you can be sure of that  he was conquered but she played him yet awhile compelling him in his turn to conquer the reluctance which his earlier hesitation had begotten in her until it was he who pleaded insistently for this jewish marriage that filled him with such repugnance  and so at last she yielded and led him up to that bower of hers in which the conspirators had met  where is the rabbi he asked impatiently looking round that empty room  i will summon him if you are quite sure that you desire him  sure have i not protested enough can you still doubt me  no she said she stood apart conning him steadily yet i would not have it supposed that you were in any way coerced to this they were odd words but he heeded not their oddness he was hardly master of the wits which in themselves were never of the brightest i require you to declare that it is your own desire that our marriage should be solemnized in accordance with the jewish rites and the law of moses  and he fretted now by impatience anxious to have this thing done and ended made answer hastily  why to be sure i do declare it to be my wish that we should be so marriedin the jewish manner and in accordance with the law of moses and now where is the rabbi he caught a sound and saw a quiver in the tapestries that masked the door of the alcove ah he is here i suppose  he checked abruptly and recoiled as from a blow throwing up his hands in a convulsive gesture the tapestry had been swept aside and forth stepped not the rabbi he expected but a tall gaunt man stooping slightly at the shoulders dressed in the white habit and black cloak of the order of st dominic his face lost in the shadows of a black cowl behind him stood two lay brothers of the order two armed familiars of the holy office displaying the white cross on their sable doublets  terrified by that apparition evoked as it seemed by those terribly damning words he had pronounced don rodrigo stood blankly at gaze a moment not even seeking to understand how this dread thing had come to pass  the friar pushed back his cowl as he advanced and displayed the tender compassionate infinitely wistful countenance of frey tomas de torquemada and infinitely compassionate and wistful came the voice of that deeply sincere and saintly man  my son i was told this of youthat you were a judaizeryet before i could bring myself to believe so incredible a thing in one of your lineage i required the evidence of my own senses oh my poor child by what wicked counsels have you been led so far astray the sweet tender eyes of the inquisitor were luminous with unshed tears sorrowing pity shook his gentle voice  and then don rodrigos terror changed to wrath and this exploded he flung out an arm towards isabella in passionate denunciation  it was that woman who bewitched and fooled and seduced me into this it was a trap she baited for my undoing  it was indeed she had my consent to do so to test the faith which i was told you lacked had your heart been free of heretical pravity the trap had never caught you had your faith been strong my son you could not have been seduced from loyalty to your redeemers  father hear me i implore you he flung down upon his knees and held out shaking supplicating hands  you shall be heard my son the holy office does not condemn any man unheard but what hope can you put in protestations i had been told that your life was disorderly and vain and i grieved that it should be so trembled for you when i heard how wide you opened the gates of your soul to evil but remembering that age and reason will often make good and penitent amends for the follies of early life i hoped and prayed for you yet that you should judaizethat you should be bound in wedlock by the unclean ties of judaismoh the melancholy voice broke off upon a sob and torquemada covered his pale face with his handslong white emaciated almost transparent hands pray now my child for grace and strength he exhorted offer up the little temporal suffering that may yet be yours in atonement for your error and so that your heart be truly contrite and penitent you shall deserve salvation from that divine mercy which is boundless you shall have my prayers my son i can do no more take him hence  on the 6th of february of that year 1481 seville witnessed the first auto de fe the sufferers being diego de susan his fellowconspirators and don rodrigo de cardona the function presented but little of the ghastly pomp that was soon to distinguish these proceedings but the essentials were already present  in a procession headed by a dominican bearing aloft the green cross of the inquisition swathed in a veil of crepe behind whom walked two by two the members of the confraternity of st peter the martyr the familiars of the holy office came the condemned candle in hand barefoot in the ignominious yellow penitential sack hemmed about by halberdiers they were paraded through the streets to the cathedral where mass was said and a sermon of the faith preached to them by the stern ojeda thereafter they were conveyed beyond the city to the meadows of tablada where the stake and faggots awaited them  thus the perjured accuser perished in the same holocaust with the accused thus was isabella de susan known as la hermosa fembra avenged by falseness upon the worthless lover who made her by falseness the instrument of her fathers ruin  for herself when all was over she sought the refuge of a convent but she quitted it without professing the past gave her no peace and she returned to the world to seek in excesses an oblivion which the cloister denied her and only death could give in her will she disposed that her skull should be placed over the doorway of the house in the calle de ataud as a measure of posthumous atonement for her sins and there the fleshless grinning skull of that once lovely head abode for close upon four hundred years it was still to be seen there when buonapartes legions demolished the holy office of the inquisition       iv the pastrycook of madrigal  the story of the false sebastian of portugal    there is not in all that bitter tragicomic record of human frailty which we call history a sadder story than this of the princess anne the natural daughter of the splendid don john of austria natural son of the emperor charles v and so halfbrother to the bowelless king philip ii of spain never was woman born to royal or semiroyal state who was more utterly the victim of the circumstances of her birth  of the natural sons of princes something could be made as witness the dazzling career of annes own father but for natural daughtersand especially for one who like herself bore a double load of cadencythere was little use or hope their royal blood set them in a class apart their bastardy denied them the worldly advantages of that spurious eminence their royal blood prescribed that they must mate with princes their bastardy raised obstacles to their doing so therefore since the world would seem to hold no worthy place for them it was expedient to withdraw them from the world before its vanities beglamoured them and to immure them in convents where they might aspire with confidence to the sterile dignity of abbesshood  thus it befell with anne at the early age of six she had been sent to the benedictine convent at burgos and in adolescence removed thence to the monastery of santa maria la real at madrigal where it was foreordained that she should take the veil she went unwillingly she had youth and youths hunger of life and not even the repressive conditions in which she had been reared had succeeded in extinguishing her high spirit or in concealing from her the fact that she was beautiful on the threshold of that convent which by her dread uncles will was to be her living tomb above whose gates her spirit may have beheld the inscription lasciate ogni speranza voi ch entrate she made her protest called upon the bishop who accompanied her to bear witness that she did not go of her own free will  but what she willed was a matter of no account king philips was under gods the only will in spain still less perhaps to soften the sacrifice imposed upon her than because of what he accounted due to one of his own blood his catholic majesty accorded her certain privileges unusual to members of religious communities he granted her a little civil listtwo ladiesinwaiting and two groomsand conferred upon her the title of excellency which she still retained even when after her hurried novitiate of a single year she had taken the veil she submitted where to have striven would have been to have spent herself in vain but her resignation was only of the body and this dejected body moved mechanically through the tasks and recreations that go to make up the grey monotone of conventual existence in which one day is as another day one hour as another hour in which the seasons of the year lose their significance in which time has no purpose save for its subdivision into periods devoted to sleeping and waking to eating and fasting to praying and contemplating until life loses all purpose and object and sterilizes itself into preparation for death  though they might command and compel her body her spirit remained unfettered in rebellion anon the claustral apathy might encompass her in time and by slow degrees she might become absorbed into the grey spirit of the place but that time was not yet for the present she must nourish her caged and starving soul with memories of glimpses caught in passing of the bright active stirring world without and where memory stopped she had now beside her a companion to regale her with tales of high adventure and romantic deeds and knightly feats which served but to feed and swell her yearnings  this companion frey miguel de souza was a portuguese friar of the order of st augustine a learned courtly man who had moved in the great world and spoke with the authority of an eyewitness and above all he loved to talk of that last romantic king of portugal with whom he had been intimate that highspirited headstrong gallant fairhaired lad sebastian who at the age of fourandtwenty had led the disastrous overseas expedition against the infidel which had been shattered on the field of alcacerelkebir some fifteen years ago  he loved to paint for her in words the dazzling knightly pageants he had seen along the quays at lisbon when that expedition was embarking with crusader ardour the files of portuguese knights and menatarms the array of german and italian mercenaries the young king in his bright armour bare of headan incarnation of st michaelmoving forward exultantly amid flowers and acclamations to take ship for africa and she would listen with parted lips and glistening eyes her slim body bending forward in her eagerness to miss no word of this great epic anon when he came to tell of that disastrous day of alcacerelkebir her dark eager eyes would fill with tears his tale of it was hardly truthful he did not say that military incompetence and a presumptuous vanity which would listen to no counsels had been the cause of a ruin that had engulfed the chivalry of portugal and finally the very kingdom itself he represented the defeat as due to the overwhelming numbers of the infidel and dwelt at length upon the closing scene told her in fullest detail how sebastian had scornfully rejected the counsels of those who urged him to fly when all was lost how the young king who had fought with a lionhearted courage unwilling to survive the days defeat had turned and ridden back alone into the saracen host to fight his last fight and find a knightly death thereafter he was seen no more  it was a tale she never tired of hearing and it moved her more and more deeply each time she listened to it she would ply him with questions touching this sebastian who had been her cousin concerning his ways of life his boyhood and his enactments when he came to the crown of portugal and all that frey miguel de souza told her served but to engrave more deeply upon her virgin mind the adorable image of the knightly king ever present in the daily thoughts of this ardent girl his empanoplied figure haunted now her sleep so real and vivid that her waking senses would dwell fondly upon the dreamfigure as upon the memory of someone seen in actual life likewise she treasured up the memory of the dreamwords he had uttered words it would seem begotten of the longings of her starved and empty heart words of a kind not calculated to bring peace to the soul of a nun professed she was enamoured deeply fervently and passionately enamoured of a myth a mental image of a man who had been dust these fifteen years she mourned him with a fond widows mourning prayed daily and nightly for the repose of his soul and in her exaltation waited now almost impatiently for death that should unite her with him taking joy in the thought that she should go to him a maid she ceased at last to resent the maidenhood that had been imposed upon her  one day a sudden wild thought filled her with a strange excitement  is it so certain that he is dead she asked when all is said none actually saw him die and you tell me that the body surrendered by mulaiahmedbenmahomet was disfigured beyond recognition is it not possible that he may have survived  the lean swarthy face of frey miguel grew pensive he did not impatiently scorn the suggestion as she had halffeared he would  in portugal he answered slowly it is firmly believed that he lives and that one day he will come like another redeemer to deliver his country from the thrall of spain  then then  wistfully he smiled a people will always believe what it wishes to believe  but you yourself she pressed him  he did not answer her at once the cloud of thought deepened on his ascetic face he half turned from herthey were standing in the shadow of the fretted cloistersand his pensive eyes roamed over the wide quadrangle that was at once the convent garden and burial ground out there in the sunshine amid the hum of invisible but ubiquitously pulsating life three nuns young and vigorous their arms bared to the elbows the skirts of their black habits shortened by a cincture of rope revealing feet roughly shod in wood were at work with spade and mattock digging their own graves in memento mori amid the shadows of the cloisters within sight but beyond earshot hovered dona maria de grado and dona luiza nieto the two noblyborn nuns appointed by king philip to an office as nearly akin to that of ladiesinwaiting as claustral conditions would permit  at length frey miguel seemed to resolve himself  since you ask me why should i not tell you when i was on my way to preach the funeral oration in the cathedral at lisbon as befitted one who had been don sebastians preacher i was warned by a person of eminence to have a care of what i said of don sebastian for not only was he alive but he would be secretly present at the requiem  he met her dilating glance noted the quivering of her parted lips  but that he added was fifteen years ago and since then i have had no sign at first i thought it possible there was a story afloat that might have been true but fifteen years he sighed and shook his head  what what was the story she was trembling from head to foot  on the night after the battle three horsemen rode up to the gates of the fortified coasttown of arzilla when the timid guard refused to open to them they announced that one of them was king sebastian and so won admittance one of the three was wrapped in a cloak his face concealed and his two companions were observed to show him the deference due to royalty  why then she was beginning  ah but afterwards he interrupted her afterwards when all portugal was thrown into commotion by that tale it was denied that king sebastian had been among these horsemen it was affirmed to have been no more than a ruse of those mens to gain the shelter of the city  she questioned and crossquestioned him upon that seeking to draw from him the admission that it was possible denial and explanation obeyed the wishes of the hidden prince  yes it is possible he admitted at length and it is believed by many to be the fact don sebastian was as sensitive as highspirited the shame of his defeat may have hung so heavily upon him that he preferred to remain in hiding and to sacrifice a throne of which he now felt himself unworthy half portugal believes it so and waits and hopes  when frey miguel parted from her that day he took with him the clear conviction that not in all portugal was there a soul who hoped more fervently than she that don sebastian lived or yearned more passionately to acclaim him should he show himself and that was much to think for the yearning of portugal was as the yearning of the slave for freedom  sebastians mother was king philips sister whereby king philip had claimed the succession and taken possession of the throne of portugal portugal writhed under the oppressive heel of that foreign rule and frey miguel de sousa himself a deeply passionately patriotic man had been foremost among those who had sought to liberate her when don antonio the sometime prior of crato sebastians natural cousin and a bold ambitious enterprising man had raised the standard of revolt the friar had been the most active of all his coadjutators in those days frey miguel who was the provincial of his order a man widely renowned for his learning and experience of affairs who had been preacher to don sebastian and confessor to don antonio had wielded a vast influence in portugal that influence he had unstintingly exerted on behalf of the pretender to whom he was profoundly devoted after don antonios army had been defeated on land by the duke of alba and his fleet shattered in the azores in 1582 by the marquis of santa cruz frey miguel found himself deeply compromised by his active share in the rebellion he was arrested and suffered a long imprisonment in spain in the end because he expressed repentance and because philip ii aware of the mans gifts and worth desired to attach him to himself by gratitude he was enlarged and appointed vicar of santa maria la real where he was now become confessor counsellor and confidant of the princess anne of austria  but his gratitude to king philip was not of a kind to change his nature to extinguish his devotion to the pretender don antoniowho restlessly ambitious continued ceaselessly to plot abroador yet to abate the fervour of his patriotism the dream of his life was ever the independence of portugal with a native prince upon the throne and because of annes fervent hope a hope that grew almost daily into conviction that sebastian had survived and would return one day to claim his kingdom those two at madrigal in that quiet eddy of the great stream of life were drawn more closely to each other  but as the years passed and annes prayers remained unanswered and the deliverer did not come her hopes began to fade again gradually she reverted to her earlier frame of mind in which all hopes were set upon a reunion with the unknown beloved in the world to come  one evening in the spring of 1594four years after the name of sebastian had first passed between the priest and the princessfrey miguel was walking down the main street of madrigal a village whose every inhabitant was known to him when he came suddenly face to face with a stranger a stranger would in any case have drawn his attention but there was about this man something familiar to the friar something that stirred in him vague memories of things long forgotten his garb of shabby black was that of a common townsman but there was something in his air and glance his soldierly carriage and the tilt of his bearded chin that belied his garb he bore upon his person the stamp of intrepidity and assurance  both halted each staring at the other a faint smile on the lips of the strangerwho in the fading light might have been of any age from thirty to fiftya puzzled frown upon the brow of the friar then the man swept off his broadbrimmed hat  god save your paternity was his greeting  god save you my son replied frey miguel still pondering him i seem to know you do i  the stranger laughed though all the world forget your paternity should remember me  and then frey miguel sucked in his breath sharply my god he cried and set a hand upon the fellows shoulder looking deeply into those bold grey eyes what make you here  i am a pastrycook  a pastrycook you  one must live and it is a more honest trade than most i was in valladolid when i heard that your paternity was the vicar of the convent here and so for the sake of old timesof happier timesi bethought me that i might claim your paternitys support he spoke with a careless arrogance halftinged with mockery  assuredly began the priest and then he checked where is your shop  just down the street will your paternity honour me  frey miguel bowed and together they departed  for three days thereafter the convent saw the friar only in the celebration of the mass but on the morning of the fourth he went straight from the sacristy to the parlour and despite the early hour desired to see her excellency  lady he told her i have great news news that will rejoice your heart she looked at him and saw the feverish glitter in his sunken eyes the hectic flush on his prominent cheekbones don sebastian lives i have seen him  a moment she stared at him as if she did not understand then she paled until her face became as white as the nuns coil upon her brow her breath came in a faint moan she stiffened and swayed upon her feet and caught at the back of a priedieu to steady and save herself from falling he saw that he had blundered by his abruptness that he had failed to gauge the full depth of her feelings for the hidden prince and for a moment feared that she would swoon under the shock of the news he had so recklessly delivered  what do you say oh what do you say she moaned her eyes halfclosed  he repeated the news in more measured careful terms exerting all the magnetism of his will to sustain her reeling senses gradually she quelled the storm of her emotions  and you say that you have seen him oh once more the colour suffused her cheeks and her eyes glowed her expression became radiant where is he  here here in madrigal  in madrigal she was all amazement but why in madrigal  he was in valladolid and there heard that ihis sometime preacher and counsellorwas vicar here at santa maria la real he came to seek me he comes disguised under the false name of gabriel de espinosa and setting up as a pastrycook until his term of penance shall be completed and he shall be free to disclose himself once more to his impatiently awaiting people  it was bewildering intoxicating news to her it set her mind in turmoil made of her soul a battleground for mad hope and dreadful fear this dreamprince who for four years had been the constant companion of her thoughts whom her exalted ardent imaginative starved soul had come to love with a consuming passion was a living reality near at hand to be seen in the flesh by the eyes of her body it was a thought that set her in an ecstasy of terror so that she dared not ask frey miguel to bring don sebastian to her but she plied him with questions and so elicited from him a very circumstantial story  sebastian after his defeat and escape had made a vow upon the holy sepulchre to lay aside the royal dignity of which he deemed that he had proved himself unworthy and to do penance for the pride that had brought him down by roaming the world in humble guise earning his bread by the labour of his hands and the sweat of his brow like any common hind until he should have purged his offense and rendered himself worthy once more to resume the estate to which he had been born  it was a tale that moved her pity to the point of tears it exalted her hero even beyond the eminence he had already held in her fond dreams particularly when to that general outline were added in the days that followed details of the wanderings and sufferings of the hidden prince at last some few weeks after that first startling announcement of his presence in the early days of august of that year 1594 frey miguel proposed to her the thing she most desired yet dared not beg  i have told his majesty of your attachment to his memory in all these years in which we thought him dead and he is deeply touched he desires your leave to come and prostrate himself at your feet  she crimsoned from brow to chin then paled again her bosom heaved in tumult between dread and yearning she spoke a faint consent  next day he came brought by frey miguel to the convent parlour where her excellency waited her two attendant nuns discreetly in the background her eager frightened eyes beheld a man of middle height dignified of mien and carriage dressed with extreme simplicity yet without the shabbiness in which frey miguel had first discovered him  his hair was of a light brownthe colour to which the golden locks of the boy who had sailed for africa some fifteen years ago might well have fadedhis beard of an auburn tint and his eyes were grey his face was handsome and save for the colour of his eyes and the high arch of his nose presented none of the distinguishing and marring features peculiar to the house of austria from which don sebastian derived through his mother  hat in hand he came forward and went down on one knee before her  i am here to receive your excellencys commands he said  she steadied her shuddering knees and trembling lips  are you gabriel de espinosa who has come to madrigal to set up as a pastrycook she asked him  to serve your excellency  then be welcome though i am sure that the trade you least understand is that of a pastrycook  the kneeling man bowed his handsome head and fetched a deep sigh  if in the past i had better understood another trade i should not now be reduced to following this one  she urged him now to rise hereafter the entertainment between them was very brief on that first occasion he departed upon a promise to come soon again and the undertaking on her side to procure for his shop the patronage of the convent  thereafter it became his custom to attend the morning mass celebrated by frey miguel in the convent chapelwhich was open to the publicand afterwards to seek the friar in the sacristy and accompany him thence to the convent parlour where the princess waited usually with one or another of her attendant nuns these daily interviews were brief at first but gradually they lengthened until they came to consume the hours to dinnertime and presently even that did not suffice and sebastian must come again later in the day  and as the interviews increased and lengthened so they grew also in intimacy between the royal pair and plans for sebastians future came to be discussed she urged him to proclaim himself his penance had been overlong already for what was really no fault at all since it is the heart rather than the deed that heaven judges and his heart had been pure his intention in making war upon the infidel loftily pious diffidently he admitted that it might be so but both he and frey miguel were of opinion that it would be wiser now to await the death of philip ii which considering his years and infirmities could not be long delayed out of jealousy for his possessions king philip might oppose sebastians claims  meanwhile these daily visits of espinosas and the long hours he spent in annes company gave as was inevitable rise to scandal within and without the convent she was a nun professed interdicted from seeing any man but her confessor other than through the parlour grating and even then not at such length or with such constancy as this the intimacy between themfostered and furthered by frey miguelhad so ripened in a few weeks that anne was justified in looking upon him as her saviour from the living tomb to which she had been condemned in hoping that he would restore her to the life and liberty for which she had ever yearned by taking her to queen when his time came to claim his own what if she was a nun professed her profession had been against her will preceded by only one year of novitiate and she was still within the five probationary years prescribed therefore in her view her vows were revocable  but this was a matter beyond the general consideration or knowledge and so the scandal grew within the convent there was none bold enough considering annes royal rank to offer remonstrance or advice particularly too considering that her behaviour had the sanction of frey miguel the convents spiritual adviser but from without from the provincial of the order of st augustine came at last a letter to anne respectfully stern in tone to inform her that the numerous visits she received from a pastrycook were giving rise to talk for which it would be wise to cease to give occasion that recommendation scorched her proud sensitive soul with shame she sent her servant roderos at once to fetch frey miguel and placed the letter in his hands  the friars dark eyes scanned it and grew troubled  it was to have been feared he said and sighed  there is but one remedy lest worse follow and all be ruined don sebastian must go  go fear robbed her of breath go where  away from madrigalanywhereand at once tomorrow at latest and then seeing the look of horror in her face what else what else he added impatiently this meddlesome provincial may be stirring up trouble already  she fought down her emotion i i shall see him before he goes she begged  i dont know it may not be wise i must consider he flung away in deepest perturbation leaving her with a sense that life was slipping from her  that late september evening as she sat stricken in her room hoping against hope for at least another glimpse of him dona maria de grado brought word that espinosa was even then in the convent in frey miguels cell fearful lest he should be smuggled thence without her seeing him and careless of the impropriety of the hourit was already eight oclock and dusk was fallingshe at once dispatched roderos to the friar bidding him bring espinosa to her in the parlour  the friar obeyed and the loversthey were no less by nowcame face to face in anguish  my lord my lord she cried casting all prudence to the winds what is decided  that i leave in the morning he answered  to go where she was distraught  where he shrugged to valladolid at first and then where god pleases  and when shall i see you again  when when god pleases  oh i am terrified if i should lose you if i should never see you more she was panting distraught  nay lady nay he answered i shall come for you when the time is ripe i shall return by all saints or by christmas at the latest and i shall bring with me one who will avouch me  what need any to avouch you to me she protested on a note of fierceness we belong to each other you and i but you are free to roam the world and i am caged here and helpless  ah but i shall free you soon and well go hence together see he stepped to the table there was an inkhorn a box of pounce some quills and a sheaf of paper there he took up a quill and wrote with labour for princes are notoriously poor scholars  i don sebastian by the grace of god king of portugal take to wife the most serene dona ulna of austria daughter of the most serene prince don john of austria by virtue of the dispensation which i hold from two pontiffs  and he signed itafter the manner of the kings of portugal in all agesel reythe king  will that content you lady he pleaded handing it to her  how shall this scrawl content me  it is a bond i shall redeem as soon as heaven will permit  thereafter she fell to weeping and he to protesting until frey miguel urged him to depart as it grew late and then she forgot her own grief and became all solicitude for him until naught would content her but she must empty into his hands her little store of treasurea hundred ducats and such jewels as she possessed including a gold watch set with diamonds and a ring bearing a cameo portrait of king philip and last of all a portrait of herself of the size of a playingcard  at last as ten was striking he was hurried away frey miguel had gone on his knees to him and kissed his hand what time he had passionately urged him not to linger and then sebastian had done the same by the princess both weeping now at last he was gone and on the arm of dona maria de grado the forlorn anne staggered back to her cell to weep and pray  in the days that followed she moved pale and listless oppressed by her sense of loss and desolation a desolation which at last she sought to mitigate by writing to him to valladolid whither he had repaired of all those letters only two survive  my king and lord she wrote in one of these alas how we suffer by absence i am so filled with the pain of it that if i did not seek the relief of writing to your majesty and thus spend some moments in communion with you there would be an end to me what i feel today is what i feel every day when i recall the happy moments sodeliciously spent which are no more this privation is for me so severe a punishment of heaven that i should call it unjust for without cause i find myself deprived of the happiness missed by me for so many years and purchased at the price of suffering and tears ah my lord how willingly nevertheless would i not suffer all over again the misfortunes that have crushed me if thus i might spare your majesty the least of them may he who rules the world grant my prayers and set a term to so great an unhappiness and to the intolerable torment i suffer through being deprived of the presence of your majesty it were impossible for long to suffer so much pain and live  i belong to you my lord you know it already the troth i plighted to you i shall keep in life and in death for death itself could not tear it from my soul and this immortal soul will harbour it through eternity  thus and much more in the same manner wrote the niece of king philip of spain to gabriel espinosa the pastrycook in his valladolid retreat how he filled his days we do not know beyond the fact that he moved freely abroad for it was in the streets of that town that meddlesome fate brought him face to face one day with gregorio gonzales under whom espinosa had been a scullion once in the service of the count of nyeba  gregorio hailed him staring roundeyed for although espinosas garments were not in their first freshness they were far from being those of a plebeian  in whose service may you be now quoth the intrigued gregorio so soon as greetings had passed between them  espinosa shook off his momentary embarrassment and took the hand of his sometime comrade times are changed friend gregorio i am not in anybodys service rather do i require servants myself  why what is your present situation  loftily espinosa put him off no matter for that he answered with a dignity that forbade further questions he gathered his cloak about him to proceed upon his way if there is anything you wish for i shall be happy for old times sake to oblige you  but gregorio was by no means disposed to part from him we do not readily part from an old friend whom we rediscover in an unsuspected state of affluence espinosa must home with gregorio gregorios wife would be charmed to renew his acquaintance and to hear from his own lips of his improved and prosperous state gregorio would take no refusal and in the end espinosa yielding to his insistence went with him to the sordid quarter where gregorio had his dwelling  about an unclean table of pine in a squalid room sat the threeespinosa gregorio and gregorios wife but the latter displayed none of the signs of satisfaction at espinosas prosperity which gregorio had promised perhaps espinosa observed her evil envy and it may have been to nourish itwhich is the surest way to punish envythat he made gregorio a magnificent offer of employment  enter my service said he and i will pay you fifty ducats down and four ducats a month  obviously they were incredulous of his affluence to convince them he displayed a gold watchmost rare possessionset with diamonds a ring of price and other costly jewels the couple stared now with dazzled eyes  but didnt you tell me when we were in madrid together that you had been a pastrycook at ocana burst from gregorio  espinosa smiled how many kings and princes have been compelled to conceal themselves under disguises he asked oracularly and seeing them stricken he must play upon them further nothing it seems was sacred to himnot even the portrait of that lovely desolate royal lady in her convent at madrigal forth he plucked it and thrust it to them across the stains of wine and oil that befouled their table  look at this beautiful lady the most beautiful in spain he bade them a prince could not have a lovelier bride  but she is dressed as a nun the woman protested how then can she marry  for kings there are no laws he told her with finality  at last he departed but bidding gregorio to think of the offer he had made him he would come again for the cooks reply leaving word meanwhile of where he was lodged  they deemed him mad and were disposed to be derisive yet the womans disbelief was quickened into malevolence by the jealous fear that what he had told them of himself might after all be true upon that malevolence she acted forthwith lodging an information with don rodrigo de santillan the alcalde of valladolid  very late that night espinosa was roused from his sleep to find his room invaded by alguazilesthe police of the alcalde he was arrested and dragged before don rodrigo to give an account of himself and of certain objects of value found in his possessionmore particularly of a ring on the cameo of which was carved a portrait of king philip  i am gabriel de espinosa he answered firmly a pastrycook of madrigal  then how come you by these jewels  they were given me by dona ana of austria to sell for her account that is the business that has brought me to valladolid  is this dona anas portrait  it is  and this lock of hair is that also dona anas and do you then pretend that these were also given you to sell  why else should they be given me  don rodrigo wondered they were useless things to steal and as for the lock of hair where should the fellow find a buyer for that the alcalde conned his man more closely and noted that dignity of bearing that calm assurance which usually is founded upon birth and worth he sent him to wait in prison what time he went to ransack the fellows house in madrigal  don rodrigo was prompt in acting yet even so his prisoner mysteriously found means to send a warning that enabled frey miguel to forestall the alcalde before don rodrigos arrival the friar had abstracted from espinosas house a box of papers which he reduced to ashes unfortunately espinosa had been careless four letters not confided to the box were discovered by the alguaziles two of them were from anneone of which supplies the extract i have given the other two from frey miguel himself  those letters startled don rodrigo de santillan he was a shrewd reasoner and wellinformed he knew how the justice of castile was kept on the alert by the persistent plottings of the portuguese pretender don antonio sometime prior of crato he was intimate with the past life of frey miguel knew his selfsacrificing patriotism and passionate devotion to the cause of don antonio remembered the firm dignity of his prisoner and leapt at a justifiable conclusion the man in his handsthe man whom the princess anne addressed in such passionate terms by the title of majestywas the prior of crato he conceived that he had stumbled here upon something grave and dangerous he ordered the arrest of frey miguel and then proceeded to visit dona ana at the convent his methods were crafty and depended upon the effect of surprise he opened the interview by holding up before her one of the letters he had found asking her if she acknowledged it for her own  she stared a moment panicstricken then snatched it from his hands tore it across and would have torn again but that he caught her wrists in a grip of iron to prevent her with little regard in that moment for the blood royal in her veins king philip was a stern master pitiless to blunderers and don rodrigo knew he never would be forgiven did he suffer that precious letter to be destroyed  overpowered in body and in spirit she surrendered the fragments and confessed the letter her own  what is the real name of this man who calls himself a pastrycook and to whom you write in such terms as these quoth the magistrate  he is don sebastian king of portugal and to that declaration she added briefly the story of his escape from alcacerelkebir and subsequent penitential wanderings  don rodrigo departed not knowing what to think or believe but convinced that it was time he laid the whole matter before king philip his catholic majesty was deeply perturbed he at once dispatched don juan de llano the apostolic commissary of the holy office to madrigal to sift the matter and ordered that anne should be solitarily confined in her cell and her nunsinwaiting and servants placed under arrest  espinosa for greater security was sent from valladolid to the prison of medina del campo he was taken thither in a coach with an escort of arquebusiers  why convey a poor pastrycook with so much honour he asked his guards halfmockingly  within the coach he was accompanied by a soldier named cervatos a travelled man who fell into talk with him and discovered that he spoke both french and german fluently but when cervatos addressed him in portuguese the prisoner seemed confused and replied that although he had been in portugal he could not speak the language  thereafter throughout that winter examinations of the three chief prisonersespinosa frey miguel and the princess annesucceeded one another with a wearisome monotony of results the apostolic commissary interrogated the princess and frey miguel don rodrigo conducted the examinations of espinosa but nothing was elicited that took the matter forward or tended to dispel its mystery  the princess replied with a candour that became more and more tinged with indignation under the persistent and at times insulting interrogatories she insisted that the prisoner was don sebastian and wrote passionate letters to espinosa begging him for her honours sake to proclaim himself what he really was declaring to him that the time had come to cast off all disguise  yet the prisoner unmoved by these appeals persisted that he was gabriel de espinosa a pastrycook but the mans bearing and the air of mystery cloaking him seemed in themselves to belie that asseveration that he could not be the prior of crato don rodrigo had now assured himself he fenced skilfully under exurnination ever evading the magistrates practiced point when it sought to pin him and he was no less careful to say nothing that should incriminate either of the other two prisoners he denied that he had ever given himself out to be don sebastian though he admitted that frey miguel and the princess had persuaded themselves that he was that lost prince  he pleaded ignorance when asked who were his parents stating that he had never known either of theman answer this which would have fitted the case of don sebastian who was born after his fathers death and quitted in early infancy by his mother  as for frey miguel he stated boldly under examination the conviction that don sebastian had survived the african expedition and the belief that espinosa might well be the missing monarch he protested that he had acted in good faith throughout and without any thought of disloyalty to the king of spain  late one night after he had been some three months in prison espinosa was roused from sleep by an unexpected visit from the alcalde at once he would have risen and dressed  nay said don rodrigo restraining him that is not necessary for what is intended  it was a dark phrase which the prisoner sitting up in bed with tousled hair and blinking in the light of the torches instantly interpreted into a threat of torture his face grew white  it is impossible he protested the king cannot have ordered what you suggest his majesty will take into account that i am a man of honour he may require my death but in an honourable manner and not upon the rack and as for its being used to make me speak i have nothing to add to what i have said already  the stern dark face of the alcalde was overspread by a grim smile  i would have you remark that you fall into contradictions sometimes you pretend to be of humble and lowly origin and sometimes a person of honourable degree to hear you at this moment one might suppose that to submit you to torture would be to outrage your dignity what then  don rodrigo broke off suddenly to stare then snatched a torch from the hand of his alguaziles and held it close to the face of the prisoner who cowered now knowing full well what it was the alcalde had detected in that strong light don rodrigo saw that the prisoners hair and beard had turned grey at the roots and so received the last proof that he had to do with the basest of impostures the fellow had been using dyes the supply of which had been cut short by his imprisonment don rodrigo departed wellsatisfied with the results of that surprise visit  thereafter espinosa immediately shaved himself but it was too late and even so before many weeks were past his hair had faded to its natural grey and he presented the appearance of what in fact he wasa man of sixty or thereabouts  yet the torture to which he was presently submitted drew nothing from him that could explain all that yet remained obscure it was from frey miguel after a thousand prevarications and tergiversations that the full truthknown to himself alonewas extracted by the rack  he confessed that inspired by the love of country and the ardent desire to liberate portugal from the spanish yoke he had never abandoned the hope of achieving this and of placing don antonio the prior of crato on the throne of his ancestors he had devised a plan primarily inspired by the ardent nature of the princess anne and her impatience of the conventual life it was while casting about for the chief instrument that he fortuitously met espinosa in the streets of madrigal espinosa had been a soldier and had seen the world during the war between spain and portugal he had served in the armies of king philip had befriended frey miguel when the friars convent was on the point of being invaded by soldiery and had rescued him from the peril of it thus they had become acquainted and frey miguel had had an instance of the mans resource and courage further he was of the height of don sebastian and of the build to which the king might have grown in the years that were sped and he presented other superficial resemblances to the late king the colour of his hair and beard could be corrected and he might be made to play the part of the hidden prince for whose return portugal was waiting so passionately and confidently there had been other impostors aforetime but they had lacked the endowments of espinosa and their origins could be traced without difficulty in addition to these natural endowments espinosa should be avouched by frey miguel than whom nobody in the world was better qualified in such a matterand by the niece of king philip to whom he would be married when he raised his standard it was arranged that the three should go to paris so soon as the arrangements were complete where the pretender would be accredited by the exiled friends of don antonio residing therethe prior of crato being a party to the plot from france frey miguel would have worked in portugal through his agents and presently would have gone there himself to stir up a national movement in favour of a pretender so fully accredited thus he had every hope of restoring portugal to her independence once this should have been accomplished don antonio would appear in lisbon unmask the impostor and himself assume the crown of the kingdom which had been forcibly and definitely wrenched from spain  that was the crafty plan which the priest had laid with a singleness of aim and a detachment from minor considerations that never hesitated to sacrifice the princess together with the chief instrument of the intrigue was the liberation of a kingdom the deliverance of a nation from servitude the happiness of a whole people to weigh in the balance against the fates of a natural daughter of don john of austria and a soldier of fortune turned pastrycook frey miguel thought not and his plot might well have succeeded but for the base strain in espinosa and the mans overweening vanity which had urged him to dazzle the gonzales at valladolid that vanity sustained him to the end which he suffered in october of 1595 a full year after his arrest to the last he avoided admissions that should throw light upon his obscure identity and origin  if it were known who i am he would say and there break off  he was hanged drawn and quartered and he endured his fate with calm fortitude frey miguel suffered in the same way with the like dignity after having undergone degradation from his priestly dignity  as for the unfortunate princess anne crushed under a load of shame and humiliation she had gone to her punishment in the previous july the apostolic commissary notified her of the sentence which king philip had confirmed she was to be transferred to another convent there to undergo a term of four years solitary confinement in her cell and to fast on bread and water every friday she was pronounced incapable of ever holding any office and was to be treated on the expiry of her term as an ordinary nun her civil list abolished her title of excellency to be extinguished together with all other honours and privileges conferred upon her by king philip  the piteous letters of supplication that she addressed to the king her uncle still exist but they left the cold implacable philip of spain unmoved her only sin was that yielding to the hunger of her starved heart and chafingunder the ascetic life imposed upon her she had allowed herself to be fascinated by the prospect of becoming the protectress of one whom she believed to be an unfortunate and romantic prince and of exchanging her convent for a throne  her punishmentpoor soulendured for close upon forty years but the most terrible part of it was not that which lay within the prescription of king philip but that which arose from her own broken and humiliated spirit she had been uplifted a moment by a glorious hope to be cast down again into the blackest despair to which a shame unspeakable and a tortured pride were added  than hers as i have said there is in history no sadder story      v the end of the vert galant  the assassination of henry iv    in the year 1609 died the last duke of cleves and king henry iv of france and navarre fell in love with charlotte de montmorency  in their conjunction these two events were to influence the destinies of europe in themselves they were trivial enough since it was as much a commonplace that an old gentleman should die as that henry of bearn should fall in love love had been the main relaxation of his otherwise strenuous life and neither the advancing yearshe was fiftysix at this datenor the recriminations of maria de medici his longsuffering florentine wife sufficed to curb his zest  possibly there may have been a husband more unfaithful than king henry probably there was not his gallantries were outrageous his taste in women catholic and his illegitimate progeny outnumbered that of his grandson the english sultan charles ii he differs however from the latter in that he was not quite as oriental in the manner of his selfindulgence charles by comparison was a mere dullard who turned whitehall into a seraglio henry preferred the romantic manner the high adventure and knew how to be gallant in two senses  this gallantry of his is not perhaps seen to best advantage in the affair of charlotte de montmorency to begin with he was as i have said in his fiftysixth year an age at which it is difficult without being ridiculous to unbridle a passion for a girl of twenty unfortunately for him charlotte does not appear to have found him so on the contrary her lovely empty head was so turned by the flattery of his addresses that she came to reciprocate the passion she inspired  her family had proposed to marry her to the gay and witty marshal de bassompierre and although his heart was not at all engaged the marshal found the match extremely suitable and was willing enough until the king declared himself henry used the most impudent frankness  bassompierre i will speak to you as a friend said he i am in love and desperately in love with mademoiselle de montmorency if you should marry her i should hate you if she should love me you would hate me a breach of our friendship would desolate me for i love you with sincere affection  that was enough for bassompierre he had no mind to go further with a marriage of convenience which in the sequel would most probably give him to choose between assuming the ridiculous role of a complacent husband and being involved in a feud with his prince he said as much and thanked the king for his frankness whereupon henry liking him more than ever for his good sense further opened his mind to him  i am thinking of marrying her to my nephew conde thus i shall have her in my family to be the comfort of my old age which is coming on conde who thinks of nothing but hunting shall have a hundred thousand livres a year with which to amuse himself  bassompierre understood perfectly the kind of bargain that was in henrys mind as for the prince de conde he appears to have been less acute no doubt because his vision was dazzled by the prospect of a hundred thousand livres a year so desperately poor was he that for half that sum he would have taken lucifers own daughter to wife without stopping to consider the disadvantages it might entail  the marriage was quietly celebrated at chantilly in february of 1609 trouble followed fast not only did conde perceive at last precisely what was expected of him and indignantly rebel against it but the queen too was carefully instructed in the matter by concino concini and his wife leonora galigai the ambitious adventurers who had come from florence in her train and who saw in the kings weakness their own opportunity  the scandal that ensued was appalling never before had the relations between henry and his queen been strained so nearly to breakingpoint and then whilst the trouble of henrys own making was growing about him until it threatened to overwhelm him he received a letter from vaucelas his ambassador at madrid containing revelations that changed his annoyance into stark apprehension  when the last duke of cleves died a few months before leaving all the world his heirsto use henrys own phrasethe emperor had stepped in and overriding the rights of certain german princes had bestowed the fief upon his own nephew the archduke leopold now this was an arrangement that did not suit henrys policy at all and being thenas the result of a wise husbanding of resourcesthe most powerful prince in europe henry was not likely to submit tamely to arrangements that did not suit him his instructions to vaucelas were to keep open the difference between france and the house of austria arising out of this matter of cleves all europe knew that henry desired to marry the dauphin to the heiress of lorraine so that this state might one day be united with france and it was partly to support this claim that he was now disposed to attach the german princes to his interests  yet what vaucelas told him in that letter was that certain agents at the court of spain chief among whom was the florentine ambassador acting upon instructions from certain members of the household of the queen of france and from others whom vaucelas said he dared not mention were intriguing to blast henrys designs against the house of austria and to bring him willynilly into a union with spain these agents had gone so far in their utter disregard of henrys own intentions as to propose to the council of madrid that the alliance should be cemented by a marriage between the dauphin and the infanta  that letter sent henry early one morning hotfoot to the arsenal where sully his minister of state had his residence maximilien de bethune duke of sully was not merely the kings servant he was his closest friend the very keeper of his soul and the king leaned upon him and sought his guidance not only in state affairs but in the most intimate and domestic matters often already had it fallen to sully to patch up the differences created between husband and wife by henrys persistent infidelities  the king arriving like the whirlwind turned everybody out of the closet in which the dukebut newly risenreceived him in bedgown and nightcap alone with his minister henry came abruptly to the matter  you have heard what is being said of me he burst out he stood with his back to the window a sturdy erect soldierly figure a little above the middle height dressed like a captain of fortune in jerkin and long boots of grey leather and a grey hat with a winecoloured ostrich plume his countenance matched his raiment keeneyed broad of brow with a highbridged pendulous nose red lips a tuft of beard and a pair of grizzled bristling moustachios he looked halfhero halfsatyr halfcaptain halfpolichinelle  sully tall and broad the incarnation of respectability and dignity despite bedgown and slippers and the nightcap covering his high bald crown made no presence of misunderstanding him  of you and the princesse de conde you mean sire quoth he and gravely he shook his head it is a matter that has filled me with apprehension for i foresee from it far greater trouble than from any former attachment of yours  so they have convinced you too grandmaster henrys tone was almost sorrowful yet i swear that all is greatly exaggerated it is the work of that dog concini ventre st gris if he has no respect for me at least he might consider how he slanders a child of such grace and wit and beauty a lady of her high birth and noble lineage  there was a dangerous quiver of emotion in his voice that was not missed by the keen ears of sully henry moved from the window and flung into a chair  concini works to enrage the queen against me and to drive her to take violent resolutions which might give colour to their pernicious designs  sire it was a cry of protest from sully  henry laughed grimly at his ministers incredulity and plucked forth the letter from vaucelas  read that  sully read and aghast at what the letter told him ejaculated they must be mad  oh no said the king they are not mad they are most wickedly sane which is why their designs fill me with apprehension what do you infer grandmaster from such deliberate plots against resolutions from which they know that nothing can turn me while i have life  what can i infer quoth sully aghast  in acting thusin daring to act thus the king expounded they proceed as if they knew that i can have but a short time to live  sire  what else they plan events which cannot take place until i am dead  sully stared at his master for a long moment in stupefied silence his loyal huguenot soul refusing to discount by flattery the truth that he perceived  sire he said at last bowing his fine head you must take your measures  ay but against whom who are these that vaucelas says he dare not name can you suggest another than he paused shrinking in horror from completing the utterance of his thought then with an abrupt gesture he went on  than the queen herself  sully quietly placed the letter on the table and sat down he took his chin in his hand and looked squarely across at henry  sire you have brought this upon yourself you have exasperated her majesty you have driven her in despair to seek and act upon the councils of this scoundrel concini there never was an attachment of yours that did not beget trouble with the queen but never such trouble as i have been foreseeing from your attachment to the princess of conde sire will you not consider where you stand  they are lies i tell you henry stormed but sully the uncompromising gravely shook his head at least henry amended they are gross exaggerations oh i confess to you my friend that i am sick with love of her day and night i see nothing but her gracious image i sigh and fret and fume like any callow lad of twenty i suffer the tortures of the damned and yet and yet i swear to you sully that i will curb this passion though it kill me i will stifle these fires though they consume my soul to ashes no harm shall come to her from me no harm has come yet i swear it these stories that are put about are the inventions of concini to set my wife against me do you know how far he and his wife have dared to go they have persuaded the queen to eat nothing that is not prepared in the kitchen they have set up for her in their own apartments what can you conclude from that but that they suggest that i desire to poison her  why suffer it sire quoth sully gravely send the pair packing back to florence and so be rid of them  henry rose in agitation i have a mind to ventre st gris i have a mind to yes it is the only thing you can manage it sully disabuse her mind of her suspicions regarding the princess of conde make my peace with her convince her of my sincerity of my firm intention to have done with gallantry so that she on her side will make me the sacrifice of banishing the concinis you will do this my friend  it was no less than sully had been expecting from past experience and the task was one in which he was by now wellpracticed but the situation had never before been quite so difficult he rose  why surely sire said he but her majesty on her side may require something more to reconcile her to the sacrifice she may reopen the question of her coronation so long andin her viewso unreasonably postponed  henrys face grew overcast his brows knit i have always had an instinct against it as you know grand master said he and this instinct is strengthened by what that letter has taught me if she will dare so much having so little real power what might she not do if he broke off and fell to musing if she demands it we must yield i suppose he said at length but give her to understand that if i discover any more of her designs with spain i shall be provoked to the last degree against her and as an antidote to these machinations at madrid you may publish my intention to uphold the claims of the german princes in the matter of cleves and let all the world know that we are arming to that end  he may have thoughtas was long afterwards allegedthat the threat itself should be sufficient for there was at that time no power in europe that could have stood against his armies in the field  on that they parted with a final injunction from sully that henry should see the princesse de conde no more  i swear to you grand master that i will use restraint and respect the sacred tie i formed between my nephew and charlotte solely so that i might impose silence upon my own passion  and the good sully writes in comment upon this i should have relied absolutely upon these assurances had i not known how easy it is for a heart tender and passionate as was his to deceive itselfwhich is the most amiable conceivable way of saying that he attached not the slightest faith to the kings promise  nevertheless he went about the task of making the peace between the royal couple with all the skill and tact that experience had taught him and he might have driven a good bargain on his masters behalf but for his masters own weakness in supporting him maria de medici would not hear of the banishment of the concinis to whom she was so deeply attached she insisted with perfect justice that she was a bitterly injured woman and refused to entertain any idea of reconciliation save with the condition that arrangements for her coronation as queen of francewhich was no more than her dueshould be made at once and that the king should give an undertaking not to make himself ridiculous any longer by his pursuit of the princess of conde of the matters contained in the letter of vaucelas she denied all knowledge nor would suffer any further inquisition  from henrys point of view this was anything but satisfactory but he yielded conscience made a coward of him he had wronged her so much in one way that he must make some compensating concessions to her in another this weakness was part of his mental attitude towards her which swung constantly between confidence and diffidence esteem and indifference affection and coldness at times he inclined to put her from him entirely at others he opined that no one on his council was more capable of the administration of affairs even in the indignation aroused by the proof he held of her disloyalty he was too just not to admit the provocation he had given her so he submitted to a reconciliation on her own terms and pledged himself to renounce charlotte we have no right to assume from the sequel that he was not sincere in the intention  by the following may events proved the accuracy of sullys judgment the court was at fontainebleau when the last bulwark of henrys prudence was battered down by the vanity of that lovely fool charlotte who must be encouraging her royal lover to resume his flattering homage but both appear to have reckoned without the ladys husband  henry presented charlotte with jewels to the value of eighteen thousand livres purchased from messier the jeweller of the pont au change and you conceive what the charitable ladies of the court had to say about it at the first hint of scandal monsieur de conde put himself into a fine heat and said things which pained and annoyed the king exceedingly henry had amassed a considerable and varied experience of jealous husbands in his time but he had never met one quite so intolerable as this nephew of his he complained of it in a letter to sully  my friendmonsieur the prince is here but he acts like a man possessed you will be angry and ashamed at the things he says of me i shall end by losing all patience with him in the meanwhile i am obliged to taut to him with severity  more severe than any talk was henrys instruction to sully to withhold payment of the last quarter of the princes allowance and to give refusals to his creditors and purveyors thus he intended also no doubt to make it clear to conde that he did not receive a pension of a hundred thousand livres a year for nothing  if this does not keep him in bounds henry concluded we must think of some other method for he says the most injurious things of me  so little did it keep the prince in boundsas henry understood the phrasethat he immediately packed his belongings and carried his wife off to his country house it was quite in vain that henry wrote to him representing that this conduct was dishonouring to them both and that the only place for a prince of the blood was the court of his sovereign  the end of it all was that the reckless and romantic henry took to nightprowling about the grounds of condes chateau in the disguise of a peasant you see his majesty of france and navarre whose will was law in europe shivering behind damp hedges ankledeep in wet grass spending long hours in lovelore ecstatic contemplation of her lighted window and allso far as we can gatherfor no other result than the aggravation of certain rheumatic troubles which should have reminded him that he was no longer of an age to pursue these amorous pernoctations  but where his stiffening joints failed the queen succeeded henry had been spied upon of course as he always was when he strayed from the path of matrimonial rectitude the concinis saw to that and when they judged the season ripe they put her majesty in possession of the facts so inflamed was she by this fresh breach of trust that war was declared anew between the royal couple and the best that sullys wit and labours could now accomplish was a sort of armed truce  and then at last in the following november the prince de conde took the desperate resolve of quitting france with his wife without troublingas was his dutyto obtain the kings consent on the last night of that month as henry was at cards in the louvre the chevalier du guet brought him the news of the princes flight  i never in my life says bassompierre who was present saw a man so distracted or in so violent a passion  he flung down his cards and rose sending his chair crashing over behind him i am undone was his cry undone this madman has carried off his wifeperhaps to kill her white and shaking he turned to bassompierre take care of my money he bade him and go on with the game  he lurched out of the room and dispatched a messenger to the arsenal to fetch m de sully sully obeyed the summons and came at once but in an extremely bad temper for it was late at night and he was overburdened with work  he found the king in the queens chamber walking backward and forward his head sunk upon his breast his hands clenched behind him the queen a squarelybuilt squarefaced woman sat apart attended by a few of her ladies and one or two gentlemen of her train her countenance was set and inscrutable and her brooding eyes were fixed upon the king  ha grand master was henrys greeting his voice harsh and strained what do you say to this what is to be done now  nothing at all sire says sully as calm as his master was excited  nothing what sort of advice is that  the best advice that you can follow sire this affair should be talked of as little as possible nor should it appear to be of any consequence to you or capable of giving you the least uneasiness  the queen cleared her throat huskily good advice monsieur le duc she approved him he will be wise to follow it her voice strained almost threatening but in this matter i doubt wisdom and he have long since become strangers  that put him in a passion and in a passion he left her to do the maddest thing he had ever done in the garb of a courier and with a patch over one eye to complete his disguise he set out in pursuit of the fugitives he had learnt that they had taken the road to landrecy which was enough for him stage by stage he followed them in that flight to flanders picking up the trail as he went and never pausing until he had reached the frontier without overtaking them  it was all most romantic and the lady when she learnt of it shed tears of mingled joy and rage and wrote him impassioned letters in which she addressed him as her knight and implored him as he loved her to come and deliver her from the detestable tyrant who held her in thrall those perfervid appeals completed his undoing drove him mad and blinded him to everythingeven to the fact that his wife too was shedding tears and that these were of rage undiluted by any more tender emotion  he began by sending praslin to require the archduke to order the prince of conde to leave his dominions and when the archduke declined with dignity to be guilty of any such breach of the law of nations henry dispatched coeuvres secretly to brussels to carry off thence the princess but maria de medici was on the alert anti frustrated the design by sending a warning of what was intended to the marquis spinola as a result of which the prince de conde and his wife were housed for greater security in the archdukes own palace  checkmated at all points yet goaded further by the letters which he continued to receive from that most foolish of princesses henry took the wild decision that to obtain her he would invade the low countries as the first step in the execution of that design of a war with spain which hitherto had been little more than a presence the matter of the duchy of cleves was a pretext ready to his hand to obtain the woman he desired he would set europe in a blaze  he took that monstrous resolve at the very beginning of the new year and in the months that followed france rang with preparations it rang too with other things which should have given him pause it rang with the voice of preachers giving expression to the popular vied that cleves was not worth fighting for that the war was unrighteousa war undertaken by catholic france to defend protestant interests against the very champions of catholicism in europe and soon it began to ring tool with prophecies of the kings approaching end  these prognostics rained upon him from every quarter thomassin and the astrologer la brosse warned him of a message from the stars that may would be fraught with danger for him from romefrom the very pope himself came notice of a conspiracy against him in which he was told that the very highest in the land were engaged from embrun bayonne and douai came messages of like purport and early in may a note was found one morning on the altar of the church of montargis announcing the kings approaching death  but that is to anticipate meanwhile henry had pursued his preparations undeterred by either warnings or prognostications there had been so many conspiracies against his life already that he was become careless and indifferent in such matters yet surely there never had been one that was so abundantly heralded from every quarter or ever one that was hatched under conditions so propitious as those which he had himself created now in his soul he was not at ease and the source of his uneasiness was the coronation of the queen for which the preparations were now going forward  he must have known that if danger of assassination threatened him from any quarter it was most to be feared from those whose influence with the queen was almost such as to give them a control over herthe concinis and their unavowed but obvious ally the duke of epernon if he were dead and the queen so left that she could be made absolute regent during the dauphins minority it was those adventurers who would become through her the true rulers of france and so enrich themselves and gratify to the full their covetous ambitions he saw clearly that his safety lay in opposing this coronationalready fixed for the 13th maywhich maria de medici was so insistent should take place before his departure for the wars the matter so preyed upon his mind that last he unburdened himself to sully one day at the arsenal  oh my friend he cried this coronation does not please me my heart tells me that some fatality will follow  he sat down grasping the case of his readingglass whilst sully could only stare at him amazed by this outburst thus he remained awhile in deep thought then he started up again  pardieu he cried i shall be murdered in this city it is their only resource i see it plainly this cursed coronation will be the cause of my death  what a thought sir  you think that i have been reading the almanach or paying heed to the prophets eh but listen to me now grand master and wrinkles deepened about the bold piercing eyes it is four months and more since we announced our intention of going to war and france has resounded with our preparations we have made no secret of it yet in spain not a finger has been lifted in preparation to resist us not a sword has been sharpened upon what does spain build whence her confidence that in despite of my firm resolve and my abundant preparations despite the fact announced that i am to march on the lath of this month despite the fact that my troops are already in champagne with a train of artillery so complete and wellfurnished that france has never seen the like of it and perhaps never will againwhence the confidence that despite all this there is no need to prepare defences upon what do they build i say when they assume as assume they must that there will be no war resolve me that grand master  but sully overwhelmed could only gasp and ejaculate  you had not thought of it eh yet it is clear enough spain builds on my death and who are the friends of spain here in france who was it intrigued with spain in such a way and to such ends as in my lifetime could never have been carried to an issue ha you see  i cannot sire it is too horrible it is impossible cried that loyal honest gentleman and yet if you are convinced of it you should break off this coronation your journey and your war if you wish it so it is not difficult to satisfy you  ay that is it he came to his feet and gripped the dukes shoulder in his strong nervous hand break off this coronation and never let me hear of it again that will suffice thus i can rid my mind of apprehensions and leave paris with nothing to fear  very well i will send at once to notre dame and to st denis to stop the preparations and dismiss the workmen  ah wait the eyes that for a moment had sparkled with new hope grew dull again the lines of care descended between the brows oh what to decide what to decide it is what i wish my friend but how will my wife take it  let her take it as she will i cannot believe that she will continue obstinate when she knows what apprehensions you have of disaster  perhaps not perhaps not he answered but his tone was not sanguine try to persuade her sully without her consent i cannot do this thing but you will know how to persuade her go to her  sully suspended the preparations for the coronation and sought the queen for three days he tells us he used prayers entreaties and arguments with which to endeavour to move her but all was labour lost maria de medici was not to be moved to all sullys arguments she opposed an argument that was unanswerable  unless she were crowned queen of france as was her absolute right she would be a person of no account and subject to the council of regency during the kings absence a position unworthy and intolerable to her the mother of the dauphin  and so it was henrys part to yield his hands were tied by the wrongs that he had done and the culminating wrong that he was doing her by this very war as he had himself openly acknowledged he had chanced one day to ask the papal nuncio what rome thought of this war  those who have the best information the nuncio answered boldly are of opinion that the principal object of the war is the princess of conde whom your majesty wishes to bring back to france  angered by this priestly insolence henrys answer had been an impudently defiant acknowledgment of the truth of that allegation  yes by god he cried yesmost certainly i want to have her back and i will have her back no one shall hinder me not even gods viceregent on earth  having uttered those words which he knew to have been carried to the queen and to have wounded her perhaps more deeply than anything that had yet happened in this affair his conscience left him despite his fears powerless now to thwart her even to the extent of removing those pernicious familiars of hers of whose plottings he had all but positive evidence  and so the coronation was at last performed with proper pomp and magnificence at st denis on thursday the 13th may it had been concerted that the festivities should last four days and conclude on the sunday with the queens public entry into paris on the monday the king was to set out to take command of his armies which were already marching upon the frontiers  thus henry proposed but the queenconvinced by his own admission of the real aim and object of the war and driven by outraged pride to hate the man who offered her this crowning insult and determined that at all costs it must be thwartedhad lent an ear to concinis purpose to avenge her and was ready to repay infidelity with infidelity concini and his fellowconspirators had gone to work so confidently that a week before the coronation a courier had appeared in liege announcing that he was going with news of henrys assassination to the princes of germany whilst at the same time accounts of the kings death were being published in france and italy  meanwhile whatever inward misgivings henry may have entertained outwardly at least he appeared serene and goodhumoured at his wifes coronation gaily greeting her at the end of the ceremony by the title of madam regent  the little incident may have touched her arousing her conscience for that night she disturbed his slumbers by sudden screams and when he sprang up in solicitous alarm she falteringly told him of a dream in which she had seen him slain and fell to imploring him with a tenderness such as had been utterly foreign to her of late to take great care of himself in the days to come in the morning she renewed those entreaties beseeching him not to leave the louvre that day urging that she had a premonition it would be fatal to him  he laughed for answer you have heard of the predictions of la brosse said he bah you should not attach credit to such nonsense  anon came the duke of vendome his natural son by the marquise de verneuil with a like warning and a like entreaty only to receive a like answer  being dull and indisposed as a consequence of last nights broken rest henry lay down after dinner but finding sleep denied him he rose pensive and gloomy and wandered aimlessly down and out into the courtyard there an exempt of the guard of whom he casually asked the time observing the kings pallor and listlessness took the liberty of suggesting that his majesty might benefit if he took the air  that chance remark decided henrys fate his eyes quickened responsively you advise well said he order my coach i will go to the arsenal to see the duc de sully who is indisposed  on the stones beyond the gates where lackeys were wont to await their masters sat a lean fellow of some thirty years of age in a dingy clerkly attire so repulsively evil of countenance that he had once been arrested on no better grounds than because it was deemed impossible that a man with such a face could be other than a villain  whilst the coach was being got ready henry reentered the louvre and startled the queen by announcing his intention with fearful insistence she besought him to countermand the order and not to leave the palace  i will but go there and back he said laughing at her fears i shall have returned before you realize that i have gone and so he went never to return alive  he sat at the back of the coach and the weather being fine all the curtains were drawn up so that he might view the decorations of the city against the queens public entry on sunday the duc depernon was on his right the duc de montbazon and the marquis de la force on his left lavordin and roquelaure were in the right boot whilst near the left boot opposite to henry sat mirebeau and du plessis liancourt he was attended only by a small number of gentlemen on horseback and some footmen  the coach turned from the rue st honore into the narrow rue de la ferronerie and there was brought to a halt by a block occasioned by the meeting of two carts one laden with hay the other with wine the footmen went ahead with the exception of two of these one advanced to clear a way for the royal vehicle whilst the other took the opportunity to fasten his garter  at that moment gliding like a shadow between the coach and the shops came that shabby hideous fellow who had been sitting on the stones outside the louvre an hour ago raising himself by deliberately standing upon one of the spokes of the stationary wheel he leaned over the duc depernon and whipping a long stout knife from his sleeve stabbed henry in the breast the king who was in the act of reading a letter cried out and threw up his arms in an instinctive warding movement thereby exposing his heart the assassin stabbed again and this time the blade went deep  with a little gasping cough henry sank together and blood gushed from his mouth  the predictions were fulfilled the tale borne by the courier riding through liege a week ago was made true as were the stories of his death already at that very hour circulating in antwerp malines brussels and elsewhere  the murderer aimed yet a third blow but this at last was parried by epernon whereupon the fellow stepped back from the coach and stood there making no attempt to escape or even to rid himself of the incriminating knife st michel one of the kings gentlemeninwaiting who had followed the coach whipped out his sword and would have slain him on the spot had he not been restrained by epernon the footmen seized the fellow and delivered him over to the captain of the guard he proved to be a schoolmaster of angoulemewhich was epernons country his name was ravaillac  the curtains of the coach were drawn the vehicle was put about and driven back to the louvre whilst to avoid all disturbance it was announced to the people that the king was merely wounded  but st michel went on to the arsenal taking with him the knife that had stabbed his master to bear the sinister tidings to henrys loyal and devoted friend sully knew enough to gauge exactly whence the blow had proceeded with anger and grief in his heart he got to horse ill as he was and calling together his people set out presently for the louvre with a train one hundred strong which was presently increased to twice that number by many of the kings faithful servants who joined his company as he advanced in the rue de la pourpointicre a man in passing slipped a note into his hand  it was a brief scrawl monsieur where are ye going it is done i have seen him dead if you enter the louvre you will not escape any more than he did  nearing st innocent the warning was repeated this time by a gentleman named du jon who stopped to mutter  monsieur le duc our evil is without remedy look to yourself for this strange blow will have fearful consequences  again in the rue st honore another note was thrown him whose contents were akin to those of the first yet with misgivings mounting swiftly to certainty sully rode amain towards the louvre his train by now amounting to some three hundred horse but at the end of the street he was stopped by m de vitry who drew rein as they met  ah monsieur vitry greeted him where are you going with such a following they will never suffer you to enter the louvre with more than two or three attendants which i would not advise you to do for this plot does not end here i have seen some persons so little sensible of the loss they have sustained that they cannot even simulate the grief they should feel go back monsieur there is enough for you to do without going to the louvre  persuaded by vitrys solemnity and by what he knew in his heart sully faced about and set out to retrace his steps but presently he was overtaken by a messenger from the queen begging him to come at once to her at the louvre and to bring as few persons as possible with him this proposal he writes to go alone and deliver myself into the hands of my enemies who filled the louvre was not calculated to allay my suspicions  moreover he received word at that moment that an exempt of the guards and a force of soldiers were already at the gates of the arsenal that others had been sent to the temple where the powder was stored and others again to the treasurer of the exchequer to stop all the money there  convey to the queen my duty and service he bade the messenger and assure her that until she acquaints me with her orders i shall continue assiduously to attend the affairs of my office and with that he went to shut himself up in the bastille whither he was presently followed by a stream of her majestys envoys all bidding him to the louvre but sully ill as he was and now utterly prostrated by all that he had endured put himself to bed and made of his indisposition a sufficient excuse  yet on the morrow he allowed himself to be persuaded to obey her summons receiving certain assurances that he had no ground for any apprehensions moreover he may by now have felt a certain security in the esteem in which the parisians held him an attempt against him in the louvre itself would prove that the blow that had killed his master was not the independent act of a fanatic as it was being represented and vengeance would follow swiftly upon the heads of those who would thus betray themselves of having made of that poor wretchs fanaticism an instrument to their evil ends  in that assurance he went and he has left on record the burning indignation aroused in him at the signs of satisfaction complacency and even mirth that he discovered in that house of death the queen herself however overwrought by the events and perhaps consciencestricken by the tragedy which in the eleventh hour she had sought to avert burst into tears at sight of sully and brought in the dauphin who flung himself upon the dukes neck  my son the queen addressed him this is monsieur de sully you must love him well for he was one of the best and most faithful servants of the king your father and i entreat him to continue to serve you in the same manner  words so fair might have convinced a man less astute that all his suspicions were unworthy but even then the sequel would very quickly have undeceived him for very soon thereafter his fall was brought about by the concinis and their creatures so that no obstacle should remain between themselves and the full gratification of their fell ambitions  at once he saw the whole policy of the dead king subversed he saw the renouncing of all ancient alliances and the union of the crowns of france and spain the repealing of all acts of pacification the destruction of the protestants the dissipation of the treasures amassed by henry the disgrace of those who would not receive the yoke of the new favourites all this sully witnessed in his declining years and he witnessed too the rapid rise to the greatest power and dignity in the state of that florentine adventurer concino concininow bearing the title of marshal dancrewho had so cunningly known how to profit by a queens jealousy and a kings indiscretions  as for the miserable ravaillac it is pretended that he maintained under torture and to the very hour of his death that he had no accomplices that what he had done he had done to prevent an unrighteous war against catholicism and the popewhich was no doubt the falsehood with which those who used him played upon his fanaticism and whetted him to their service i say pretended because after all complete records of his examinations are not discoverable and there is a story that when at the point of death seeing himself abandoned by those in whom perhaps he had trusted he signified a desire to confess and did so confess but the notary voisin who took his depositions in articulo mortis set them down in a hand so slovenly as to be afterwards undecipherable  that may or may not be true but the statement that when the president du harlay sought to pursue inquiries into certain allegations by a woman named descoman which incriminated the duc depernon he received a royal order to desist rests upon sound authority                                     that is the story of the assassination of henry iv retold in the light of certain records which appear to me to have been insufficiently studied they should suggest a train of speculation leading to inferences which whilst obvious i hesitate to define absolutely  if it be asked says perefixe who were the friends that suggested to ravaillac so damnable a design history replies that it is ignorant and that upon an action of such consequences it is not permissible to give suspicions and conjectures for certain truths the judges themselves who interrogated him dared not open their mouths and never mentioned the matter but with gestures of horror and amazement      vi the barren wooing  the murder of amy robsart    there had been a banquet followed by a masque and this again by a dance in which the young queen had paired off with lord robert dudley who in repute was the handsomest man in europe just as in fact he was the vainest shallowest and most unscrupulous there had been homage and flattery lavishly expressed and there was a hint of masked hostility from certain quarters to spice the adventure and to thrill her bold young spirit never yet in all the months of her reign since her coronation in january of last year had she felt so much a queen and so conscious of the power of her high estate never so much a woman and so conscious of the weakness of her sex the interaction of those conflicting senses wrought upon her like a heady wine she leaned more heavily upon the silken arm of her handsome master of the horse and careless in her intoxication of what might be thought or said shewho by the intimate favour shown him had already loosed the tongue of scandal and set it chattering in every court in europedrew him forth from that thronged and glittering chamber of the palace of whitehall into the outer solitude and friendly gloom  and he nothing loth to obey the suasion of that white hand upon his arm exultant indeed to parade before them all the power he had with her went willingly enough let norfolk and sussex scowl let arundel bite his lip until it bled and sober cecil stare cold disapproval they should mend their countenances soon and weigh their words or be for ever silenced when he was master in england and that he would soon be master he was assured tonight by every glance of her blue eyes by the pressure of that fair hand upon his arm by the languishing abandonment with which that warm young body swayed towards him as they passed out from the blaze of lights and the strains of music into the gloom and silence of the gallery leading to the terrace  outlet us go out robin let me have air she almost panted as she drew him on  assuredly he would be master soon indeed he might have been master already but for that wife of his that stumblingblock to his ambition who practiced the housewifely virtues at cumnor place and clung so tenaciously and so inconsiderately to life in spite of all his plans to relieve her of the burden of it  for a year and more his name had been coupled with the queens in a tale that hurt her honour as a woman and imperilled her dignity as a sovereign already in october of 1559 alvarez de quadra the spanish ambassador had written home i have learnt certain things as to the terms on which the queen and lord robert stand towards each other which i could not have believed  that was at a time when de quadra was one of a dozen ambassadors who were competing for her hand and lord robert had himself appeared to be an ally of de quadra and an advocate of the spanish marriage with the archduke charles but it was a presence which nowise deceived the astute spaniard who employed a legion of spies to keep him well informed  all the dallying with us he wrote all the dallying with the swede all the dallying there will be with the rest one after another is merely to keep lord roberts enemies in play until his villainy about his wife can be executed  what that particular villainy was the ambassador had already stated earlier in his letter i have learnt from a person who usually gives me true information that lord robert has sent to have his wife poisoned  what had actually happened was that sir richard verneya trusted retainer of lord robertshad reported to dr bayley of new college oxford that lady robert dudley was sad and ailing and had asked him for a potion but the doctor was learned in more matters than physic he had caught an echo of the tale of lord roberts ambition he had heard a whisper that whatever suitors might come from overseas for elizabeth she would marry none but my lordas lord robert was now commonly styled more he had aforetime heard rumours of the indispositions of lady robert yet had never found those rumours verified by the fact some months ago it had been reported that her ladyship was suffering from cancer of the breast and likely soon to die of it yet dr bayley had reason to know that a healthier woman did not live in berkshire  the good doctor was a capable deductive reasoner and the conclusion to which he came was that if they poisoned her under cover of his potionshe standing in no need of physiche might afterwards be hanged as a cover for their crime so he refused to prescribe as he was invited nor troubled to make a secret of invitation and refusal  for awhile then lord robert had prudently held his hand moreover the urgency there had been a year ago when that host of foreign suitors laid siege to elizabeth of england had passed and his lordship could afford to wait but now of a sudden the urgency was returned under the pressure brought to bear upon her to choose a husband elizabeth had halfcommitted herself to marry the archduke charles promising the spanish ambassador a definite answer within a few days  lord robert had felt the earth to be quaking under him he had seen the ruin of his high ambitions he had watched with rage the expanding mockery upon the countenances of norfolk sussex and those others who hated and despised him and he had cursed that wife of his who knew not when to die but for that obstinacy with which she clung to life he had been the queens husband these many months so making an end to suspense and to the danger that lies in delay  tonight the wantonness with which the queen flaunted before the eyes of all her court the predilection in which she held him came not merely to lull his recent doubts and fears to feed his egregious vanity and to assure him that in her heart he need fear no rival it came also to set his soul quiver impotent rage he had but to put forth his hands to possess himself of this splendid prize yet those hands of his were bound while that woman lived at cumnor conceive his feelings as they stole away together like any pair of lovers  arm in arm they came by a stone gallery where a stalwart scarlet sentinel a yeoman of the guard with a tudor rose embroidered in gold upon his back stood under a lamp set in the wall with grounded pike and body stiffly erect  the tall young queen was in crimson satin with cunninglywrought silver embroideries trimmed with tufted silver fringe her stomacher stiff with silver bullion studded with gold rosettes and roman pearls her bodice cut low to display her splendid neck decked by a carcanet of pearls and rubies and surmounted by a fanlike cuff of guipure high behind and sloping towards the bust thus she appeared to the sentinel as the rays of the single lamp behind him struck fire from her redgold hair as if by her very gait to express the wantonness of her mood she pointed her toes and walked with head thrown back smiling up into the gipsy face of her companion who was arrayed from head to foot in shimmering ivory satin with an elegance no man in england could have matched  they came by that stone gallery to a little terrace above the privy steps a crescent moon hung low over the lambeth marshes across the river from a barge that floated gay with lights in midstream came a tinkle of lutes and the sweet voice of a singing boy a moment the lovers stood at gaze entranced by the beauty of the soft tepid september night so subtly adapted to their mood then she fetched a sigh and hung more heavily upon his arm leaned nearer to his tall vigorous graceful figure  robin robin was all she said but in her voice throbbed a world of passionate longing an exquisite blend of delight and pain  judging the season ripe his arm flashed round her and drew her fiercely close for a moment she was content to yield her head against his stalwart shoulder a very woman nestling to the mate of her choice surrendering to her master then the queen in her awoke and strangled nature roughly she disengaged herself from his arm and stood away her breathing quickened   gods death robin there was a harsh note in the voice that lately had cooed so softly you are strangely free i think  but he impudence incarnate nothing abashed accustomed to her gusty moods to her alternations between the two natures she had inheritedfrom overbearing father and wanton motherwas determined at all costs to take the fullest advantage of the hour to make an end of suspense  i am not free but enslavedby love and worship of you would you deny me would you  not i but fate she answered heavily and he knew that the woman at cumnor was in her mind  fate will soon mend the wrong that fate has donevery soon now he took her hand and melted again from her dignity she let it lie in his when that is done sweet then will i claim you for my own  when that is done robin she questioned almost fearfully as if a sudden dread suspicion broke upon her mind when what is done  he paused a moment to choose his words what time she stared intently into the face that gleamed white in the surrounding gloom  when that poor ailing spirit is at rest and he added it will be soon  thou hast said the same aforetime robin yet it has not so fallen out  she has clung to life beyond what could have been believed of her condition he explained unconscious of any sinister ambiguity but the end i know is very neara matter but of days  of days she shivered and moved forward to the edge of the terrace he keeping step beside her then she stood awhile in silence looking down at the dark oily surge of water you loved her once robin she asked in a queer unnatural voice  i never loved but once answered that perfect courtier  yet you married hermen say it was a love marriage it was a marriage anyway and you can speak so calmly of her death her tone was brooding she sought understanding that should silence her own lingering doubt of him  where lies the blame who made me what i am again his bold arm encompassed her side by side they peered down through the gloom at the rushing waters and he seized an image from them our love is like that seething tide he said to resist it is to labour in agony awhile and then to perish  and to yield is to be swept away  to happiness he cried and reverted to his earlier prayer say that when that afterwards i may claim you for my own be true to yourself obey the voice of instinct and so win to happiness  she looked up at him seeking to scan the handsome face in that dim light that baffled her and he observed the tumultuous heave of her white breast  can i trust thee robin can i trust thee answer me true she implored him adorably weak entirely woman now  what does your own heart answer you quoth he loaning close above her  i think i can robin and anyway i must i cannot help myself i am but a woman after all she murmured and sighed be it as thou wilt come to me again when thou art free  he bent lower murmuring incoherently and she put up a hand to pat his swarthy bearded cheek  i shall make thee greater than any man in england so thou make me happier than any woman  he caught the hand in his and kissed it passionately his soul singing a triumph song within him norfolk and sussex and those other scowling ones should soon be whistled to the masters heel  as they turned arm in arm into the gallery to retrace their steps they came suddenly face to face with a slim sleek gentleman who bowed profoundly a smile upon h is crafty shaven priestly face in a smooth voice and an accent markedly foreign he explained that he too sought the cool of the terrace not thinking to intrude and upon that bowing again he passed on and effaced himself it was alvarez de quadra bishop of aquila the arguseyed ambassador of spain  the young face of the queen hardened  i would i were as well served abroad as the king of spain is here she said aloud that the retreating ambassador might hear the dubious compliment and for my lords ear alone she added under her breath the spy philip of spain will hear of this  so that he hears something more what shall it signify quoth my lord and laughed  they paced the length of the gallery in silence past the yeoman of the guard who kept his watch and into the first antechamber perhaps it was that meeting with de quadra and my lords answer to her comment that prompted what now she asked what is it ails her robin  a wasting sickness he answered never doubting to whom the question alluded  you said i think that that the end is very near  he caught her meaning instantly indeed if she is not dead already she is very nearly so  he lied for never had amy dudley been in better health and yet he spoke the truth for in so much as her life depended upon his will it was as good as spent this was he knew a decisive moment of his career the hour was big with fate if now he were weak or hesitant the chance might slip away and be for ever lost to him elizabeths moods were as uncertain as were certain the hostile activities of my lords enemies he must strike quickly whilst she was in her present frame of mind and bring her to wedlock be it in public or in private but first he must shake off the paralysing encumbrance of that housewife down at cumnor  i believefrom evidence that i account abundantthat he considered it with the cold remorselessness of the monstrous egotist he was an upstart greatgrandson to a carpenter noble only in two descents and in both of them stained by the block he found a queenthe victim of a physical passion that took no account of the worthlessness underlying his splendid exteriorreaching out a hand to raise him to a throne being what he was he weighed his young wifes life at naught in the evil scales of his ambition and yet he had loved her once more truly perhaps than he could now pretend to love the queen  it was some ten years since as a lad of eighteen he had taken sir john robsarts nineteenyearold daughter to wife she had brought him considerable wealth and still more devotion because of this devotion she was content to spend her days at cumnor whilst he ruffled it at court content to take such crumbs of attention as he could spare her upon occasion and during the past year whilst he had been plotting her death she had been diligently caring for his interests and fostering the prosperity of the berkshire estate if he thought of this at all he allowed no weakly sentiment to turn him from his purpose there was too much at stake for thata throne no less  and so on the morning after that halfsurrender of elizabeths we find my lord closeted with his henchman sir richard verney sir richardlike his masterwas a greedy unscrupulous ambitious scoundrel prepared to go to any lengths for the sake of such worldly advancement as it lay in my lords power to give him my lord perforce used perfect frankness with this perfect servant  thoult rise or fall with me dick quoth he help me up then and so mount with me when i am king as soon now i shall be look to me now to the thing that is to do thoult have guessed it  to sir richard it was an easy guess considering how much already he had been about this business he signified as much  my lord shifted in his elbowchair and drew his embroidered bedgown of yellow satin closer about his shapely limbs  hast failed me twice before richard said he gods death man fail me not again or the last chance may go the way of the others theres a magic in the number three see that i profit by it or i am undone and thou with me  id not have failed before but for that suspicious dotard bayley grumbled verney your lordship bade me see that all was covered  aye aye and i bid thee so again on thy life leave no footprints by which we may be tracked bayley is not the only physician in oxford about it then and swiftly time is the very soul of fortune in this business with the spaniard straining at the leash and cecil and the rest pleading his case with her succeed and thy fortunes made fail and trouble not to seek me again  sir richard bowed and took his leave as he reached the door his lordship stayed him if thou bungle do not look to me the court goes to windsor tomorrow bring me word there within the week he rose magnificently tall and stately in his bedgown of embroidered yellow satin his handsome head thrown back and went after his retainer thoult not fail me dick said he a hand upon the lesser scoundrels shoulder there is much at issue for me and for thee with me  i will not fail you my lord sir richard rashly promised and on that they parted  sir richard did not mean to fail he knew the importance of succeeding and he appreciated the urgency of the business as much as did my lord himself but between his cold remorseless will to succeed and success itself there lay a gulf which it needed all his resource to bridge he paid a short visit to lady robert at cumnor and professed deepest concern to find in her a pallor and an ailing air which no one else had yet observed he expressed himself on the subject to mrs buttelar and the other members of her ladyships household reproaching them with their lack of care of their mistress mrs buttelar became indignant under his reproaches  nay now sir richard do you wonder that my lady is sad and downcast with such tales as are going of my lords doings at court and of what there is twixt the queen and him her ladyship may be too proud to complain but she suffers the more for that poor lamb there was talk of a divorce awhile ago that got to her ears  old wives tales snorted sir richard  likely agreed mrs buttelar yet when my lord neither comes to cumnor nor requires her ladyship to go to him what is she to think poor soul  sir richard made light of all and went off to oxford to find a physician more accommodating than dr bayley but dr bayley had talked too much and it was in vain that sir richard pleaded with each of the two physicians he sought that her ladyship was ailingsad and heavyand that he must have a potion for her  each in turn shook his head they had no medicine for sorrow was their discreet answer from his description of her condition said each it was plain that her ladyships sickness was of the mind and considering the tales that were afloat neither was surprised  sir richard went back to his oxford lodging with the feeling of a man checkmated for two whole days of that precious time he lay there considering what to do he thought of going to seek a physician in abingdon but fearing no better success in that quarter fearing indeed that in view of the rumours abroad he would merely be multiplying what my lord called footprints he decided to take some other way to his masters ends he was a resourceful inventive scoundrel and soon he had devised a plan  on friday he wrote from oxford to lady robert stating that he had a communication for her on the subject of his lordship as secret as it was urgent that he desired to come to her at cumnor again but dared not do so openly he would come if she would contrive that her servants should be absent and he exhorted her to let no one of them know that he was coming else he might be ruined out of his desire to serve her  that letter he dispatched by the hand of his servant nunweek desiring him to bring an answer it was a communication that had upon her ladyships troubled mind precisely the effect that the rascal conceived there was about sir richards personality nothing that could suggest the villain he was a smiling blueeyed florid gentleman of a kindly manner that led folk to trust him and on the occasion of his late visit to cumnor he had displayed such tender solicitude that her ladyshipstarved of affection as she washad been deeply touched  his letter so cunningly couched filled her with vague alarm and with anxiety she had heard so many and such afflicting rumours and had received in my lords cruel neglect of her such circumstantial confirmation of them that she fastened avidly upon what she deemed the chance of learning at last the truth sir richard verney had my lords confidence and was much about the court in his attendance upon my lord he would know the truth and what could this letter mean but that he was disposed to tell it  so she sent him back a line in answer bidding him come on sunday afternoon she would contrive to be alone in the house so that he need not fear being seen by any  as she promised so she performed and on the sunday packed off her household to the fair that was being held at abingdon that day using insistence with the reluctant and particularly with one of her women a mrs oddingsell who expressed herself strongly against leaving her ladyship alone in that lonely house at length however the last of them was got off and my lady was left impatiently to await her secret visitor it was late afternoon when he arrived accompanied by nunweek whom he left to hold the horses under the chestnuts in the avenue himself he reached the house across the garden where the blighting hand of autumn was already at work  within the porch he found her waiting fretted by her impatience  it is very good in you to have come sir richard was her gracious greeting  i am your ladyships devoted servant was his sufficient answer and he doffed his plumed bonnet and bowed low before her we shall be private in your bower above stairs he added  why we are private anywhere i am all alone as you desired  that is very wisemost wise said he will your ladyship lead the way  so they went up that steep spiral staircase which had loomed so prominently in the plans the ingenious scoundrel had evolved across the gallery on the first floor they entered a little room whose windows overlooked the garden this was her boweran intimate cosy room reflecting on every hand the gentle industrious personality of the owner on an oak table near the window were spread some papers and accountbooks concerned with the estatewith which she had sought to beguile the time of waiting she led the way towards this and sinking into the highbacked chair that stood before it she looked up at him expectantly she was pale there were dark stains under her eyes and wistful lines had crept into the sweet face of that neglected wife  contemplating his poor victim now sir richard may have compared her with the woman by whom my lord desired so impatiently to supplant her she was tall and beautifully shaped despite an almost maidenly slenderness her countenance was gentle and adorable with its soft grey eyes and light brown hair and tender wistful mouth  it was not difficult to believe that lord robert had as ardently desired her to wife five years ago as he now desired to be rid of her then he obeyed the insistent spur of passion now he obeyed the remorseless spur of ambition in reality then as now his beaconlight was love of self  seeing her so frail and trusting trembling in her anxious impatience to hear the news of her lord which he had promised her sir richard may have felt some pang of pity but like my lord he was of those whose love of self suffers the rivalry of no weak emotion  your news sir richard she besought him her dovelike glance upon his florid faceless florid now than was its wont  he leaned against the table his back to the window why it is briefly this said he my lord and then he checked and fell into a listening attitude  what was that did you hear anything my lady  no what is it her face betrayed alarm her anxiety mounting under so much mystery  sh stay you here he enjoined if we are spied upon he left the sentence there already he was moving quickly stealthily towards the door he paused before opening it stay where you are my lady he enjoined again so gravely that she could have no thought of disobeying him i will return at once  he stepped out closed the door and crossed to the stairs there he stopped from his pouch he had drawn a fine length of whipcord attached at one end to a tiny bodkin of needle sharpness that bodkin he drove into the edge of one of the panels of the wainscot in line with the topmost step drawing the cord taut at a height of a foot or so above this step he made fast its other end to the newelpost at the stairhead he had so rehearsed the thing in his mind that the performance of it occupied but a few seconds such dim light of that autumn afternoon as reached the spot would leave that fine cord invisible  sir richard went back to her ladyship she had not moved in his absence so brief as scarcely to have left her time in which to resolve upon disobeying his injunction  we move in secret like conspirators said he and so we are easily affrighted i should have known it could be none but my lord himself here  my lord she interrupted coming excitedly to her feet lord robert  to be sure my lady it was he had need to visit you in secretfor did the queen have knowledge of his coming here it would mean the tower for him you cannot think what out of love for you his lordship suffers the queen  but do you say that he is here man her voice shrilled up in excitement  he is below my lady such is his peril that he dared not set foot in cumnor until he was certain beyond doubt that you are here alone  he is below she cried and a flush dyed her pale cheeks a light of gladness quickened her sad eyes already she had gathered from his cunning words a new and comforting explanation of the things reported to her he is below she repeated oh she turned from him and in an instant was speeding towards the door  he stood rooted there his nether lip between his teeth his face a ghastly white whilst she ran on  my lord robin robin he heard her calling as she crossed the corridor then came a piercing scream that echoed through the silent house a pause a crashing thud below andsilence  sir richard remained by the table immovable blood was trickling down his chin he had sunk his teeth through his lip when that scream rang out a long moment thus as if entranced awestricken then he braced himself and went forward reeling at first like a drunken man but by the time he had reached the stairs he was master of himself again swiftly for all his trembling fingers he unfastened the cords end from the newelpost the wrench upon it had already pulled the bodkin from the wainscot he went down that abrupt spiral staircase at a moderate pace mechanically coiling the length of whipcord and bestowing it with the bodkin in his pouch again and all the while his eyes were fixed upon the grey bundle that lay so still at the stairs foot  he came to it at last and pausing looked more closely he was thankful that there was not the need to touch it the position of the brownhaired head was such as to leave no doubt of the complete success of his design her neck was broken lord robert dudley was free to marry the queen  deliberately sir richard stepped over the huddled body of that poor victim of a knaves ambition crossed the hall and passed out closing the door an excellent days work thought he most excellently accomplished the servants returning from abingdon fair on that sunday evening would find her there they would publish the fact that in their absence her ladyship had fallen downstairs and broken her neck and that was the end of the matter                                     but that was not the end at all fate the ironic interloper had taken a hand in this evil game  the court had moved a few days earlier to windsor and thither on the fridaythe 6th of septembercame alvarez de quadra to seek the definite answer which the queen had promised him on the subject of the spanish marriage what he had seen that night at whitehall coupled with his mistrust of her promises and experience of her fickleness had rendered him uneasy either she was trifling with him or else she was behaving in a manner utterly unbecoming the future wife of the archduke in either case some explanation was necessary de quadra must know where he stood having failed to obtain an audience before the court left london he had followed it to windsor cursing all women and contemplating the advantages of the salic law  he found at windsor an atmosphere of constraint and it was not until the morrow that he obtained an audience with the queen even then this was due to chance rather than to design on the part of elizabeth for they met on the terrace as she was returning from hunting she dismissed those about her including the stalwart robert dudley and alone with de quadra invited him to speak  madame he said i am writing to my master and i desire to know whether your majesty would wish me to add anything to what you have announced already as your intention regarding the archduke  she knit her brows the wily spaniard fenced so closely that there was no alternative but to come to grips  why sir she answered dryly you may tell his majesty that i have come to an absolute decision which is that i will not marry the archduke  the colour mounted to the spaniards sallow cheeks iron selfcontrol alone saved him from uttering unpardonable words even so he spoke sternly  this madame is not what you had led me to believe when last we talked upon the subject  at another time elizabeth might have turned upon him and rent him for that speech but it happened that she was in high goodhumour that afternoon and disposed to indulgence she laughed surveying herself in the small steel mirror that dangled from her waist  you are ungallant to remind me my lord said she my sex you may have heard is privileged to change of mind  then madame i pray that you may change it yet again his tone was bitter  your prayer will not be heard this time i am resolved  de quadra bowed the king my master will not be pleased i fear  she looked him straightly in the face her dark eyes kindling  gods death said she i marry to please myself and not the king your master  you are resolved on marriage then flashed he  and it please you she mocked him archly her mood of joyousness already conquering her momentary indignation  what pleases you must please me also madame he answered in a tone so cold that it belied his words that it please you is reason enough why you should marry whom did your majesty say  nay i named no names yet one so astute might hazard a shrewd guess halfchallenging halfcoy she eyed him over her fan  a guess nay madame i might affront your majesty  how so  if i were deluded by appearances if i named a subject who signally enjoys your royal favour  you mean lord robert dudley she paled a little and her bosoms heave was quickened why should the guess affront me  because a queena wise queen madamedoes not mate with a subjectparticularly with one who has a wife already  he had stung her he had wounded at once the pride of the woman and the dignity of the queen yet in a way that made it difficult for her to take direct offense she bit her lip and mastered her surge of anger then she laughed a thought sneeringly  why as to my lord roberts wife it seems you are less wellinformed than usual sir lady robert dudley is dead or very nearly so  and as blank amazement overspread his face she passed upon her way and left him  but anon considering she grew vaguely uneasy and that very night expressed her afflicting doubt to my lord reporting to him de quadras words his lordship who was mentally nearsighted laughed  hell change his tone before long said he  she set her hands upon his shoulders and looked up adoringly into his handsome gipsy face never had he known her so fond as in these last days since her surrender to him that night upon the terrace at whitehall never had she been more the woman and less the queen in her bearing towards him  you are sure robin you are quite sure she pleaded  he drew her close she yielding herself to his embrace with so much at stake could i be less than sure sweet said he and so convinced herthe more easily since he afforded her the conviction she desired  that was on the night of saturday and early on monday came the news which justified him of his assurances it was brought him to windsor by one of amys cumnor servants a fellow named bowes who with the others had been away at abingdon fair yesterday afternoon and had returned to find his mistress dead at the stairs footthe result of an accident as all believed  it was not quite the news that my lord had been expecting it staggered him a little that an accident so very opportune should have come to resolve his difficulties obviating the need for recourse to those more dangerous measures with which he had charged sir richard verney he perceived how suspicion might now fall upon himself how his enemies would direct it and on the instant made provision there and then he seized a pen and wrote to his kinsman sir thomas blount who even then was on his way to cumnor he stated in the letter what he had learnt from bowes bade blount engage the coroner to make the strictest investigation and send for amys natural brother appleyard have no respect to any living person was the final injunction of that letter which he sent blount by the hand of bowes  and then before he could carry to the queen the news of this accident which had broken his matrimonial shackles sir richard verney arrived with the true account he had expected praise and thanks from his master instead he met first dismay and then anger and fierce reproaches  my lord this is unjust the faithful retainer protested knowing the urgency i took the only waycontrived the accident  pray god said dudley that the jury find it to have been an accident for if the truth should come to be discovered i leave you to the consequences i warned you of that before you engaged in this look for no help from me  i look for none said sir richard stung to hot contempt by the meanness and cowardice so characteristic of the miserable egotist he served nor will there be the need for i have left no footprints  i hope that may be so for i tell you man that i have ordered a strict inquiry bidding them have no respect to any living person and to that i shall adhere  and if in spite of that i am not hanged quoth sir richard a sneer upon his white face  come to me again when the affair is closed and we will talk of it  sir richard went out rage and disgust in his heart leaving my lord with rage and fear in his  grown calmer now my lord dressed himself with care and sought the queen to tell her of the accident that had removed the obstacle to their marriage and that same night her majesty coldly informed de quadra that lady robert dudley had fallen down a flight of stairs and broken her neck  the spaniard received the information with a countenance that was inscrutable  your majestys gift of prophecy is not so widely known as it deserves to be was his cryptic comment  she stared at him blankly a moment then a sudden uneasy memory awakened by his words she drew him forward to a window embrasure apart from those who had stood about her and for greater security addressed him as he tells us in italian  i do not think i understand you sir will you be plain with me she stood erect and stiff and frowned upon him after the manner of her bullying father but de quadra held the trumps and was not easily intimidated  about the prophecy said he why did not your majesty foretell the poor ladys death a full day before it came to pass did you not say that she was already dead or nearly so  he saw her blench saw fear stare from those dark eyes that could be so very bold then her everready anger followed swiftly  sblood man what do you imply she cried and went on without waiting for his answer the poor woman was sick and ill and must soon have succumbed it will no doubt be found that the accident which anticipated nature was due to her condition  gently he shook his head relishing her discomfiture taking satisfaction in torturing her who had flouted him and his master in punishing her whom he had every reason to believe guilty  your majesty i fear has been illinformed on that score the poor lady was in excellent healthand like to have lived for many yearsat least so i gather from sir william cecil whose information is usually exact  she clutched his arm you told him what i had said  it was indiscreet perhaps yet how was i to know he left his sentence there i but expressed my chagrin at your decision on the score of the archdukehardly a wise decision if i may be so bold he added slyly  she caught the suggestion of a bargain and became instantly suspicious  you transcend the duties of your office my lord she rebuked him and turned away  but soon that night she was closeted with dudley and closely questioning him about the affair my lord was mightily vehement  i take heaven to be my witness quoth he when she all but taxed him with having procured his ladys death that i am innocent of any part in it my injunctions to blount who has gone to cumnor are that the matter be sifted without respect to any person and if it can be shown that this is other than the accident i deem it the murderer shall hang  she flung her arms about his neck and laid her head on his shoulder oh robin robin i am full of fears she wailed and was nearer to tears than he had ever seen her  but anon as the days passed their fears diminished and finally the jury at cumnordelayed in their finding and spurred by my lord to exhaustive inquiriesreturned a verdict of found dead which in all the circumstances left his lordshipwho was known moreover to have been at windsor when his lady diedfully acquitted both he and the queen took courage from that finding and made no secret of it now that they would very soon be wed  but there were many whom that finding did not convince who read my lord too well and would never suffer him to reap the fruits of his evil deed prominent among these were arundelwho himself had aimed at the queens handnorfolk and pembroke and behind them was a great mass of the people indignation against lord robert was blazing out fanned by such screaming preachers as lever who from the london pulpits denounced the projected marriage hinting darkly at the truth of amy dudleys death  what was hinted at home was openly expressed abroad and in paris mary stuart ventured a cruel witticism that elizabeth was to conserve in her memory the queen of england she said is about to marry her horsekeeper who has killed his wife to make a place for her  yet elizabeth persisted in her intent to marry dudley until the sober cecil conveyed to her towards the end of that month of september some notion of the rebellion that was smouldering  she flared out at him of course but he stood his ground  there is he reminded her this unfortunate matter of a prophecy as the bishop of aquila persists in calling it  gods body is the rogue blabbing  what else did your majesty expect from a man smarting under a sense of injury he has published it broadcast that on the day before lady robert broke her neck you told him that she was dead or nearly so and he argues from it a guilty foreknowledge on your majestys part of what was planned  a guilty foreknowledge she almost choked in rage and then fell to swearing as furiously in that moment as old king harry at his worst  madame he cried shaken by her vehemence i but report the phrase he uses it is not mine  do you believe it  i do not madame if i did i should not be here at present  does any subject of mine believe it  they suspend their judgment they wait to learn the truth from the sequel  you mean  that if your motive prove to be such as de quadra and others allege they will be in danger of believing  be plain man in gods name what exactly is alleged  he obeyed her very fully  that my lord contrived the killing of his wife so that he might have liberty to marry your majesty and that your majesty was privy to the deed he spoke out boldly and hurried on before she could let loose her wrath it is still in your power madame to save your honour which is now in peril but there is only one way in which you can accomplish it if you put from you all thought of marrying lord robert england will believe that de quadra and those others lied if you persist and carry out your intention you proclaim the truth of his report and you see what must inevitably follow  she saw indeed and seeing was afraid  within a few hours of that interview she delivered her answer to cecil which was that she had no intention of marrying dudley  because of her fear she saved her honour by sacrificing her heart by renouncing marriage with the only man she could have taken for her mate of all who had wooed her yet the wound of that renunciation was slow to heal she trifled with the notion of other marriages but ever and anon in her despair perhaps we see her turning longing eyes towards the handsome lord robert later made earl of leicester once indeed some six years after amys death there was again some talk of her marrying him which was quickly quelled by a reopening of the question of how amy died between these two between the fulfilment of her desire and his ambition stood the irreconcilable ghost of his poor murdered wife  perhaps it was some thought of this that found expression in her passionate outburst when she learnt of the birth of mary stuarts child the queen of scots is lighter of a fair son and i am but a barren stock      vii sir judas  the betrayal of sir walter ralegh    sir walter was met on landing at plymouth from his illstarred voyage to el dorado by sir lewis stukeley which was but natural seeing that sir lewis was not only viceadmiral of devon but also sir walters very good friend and kinsman  if sir walter doubted whether it was in his quality as kinsman or as viceadmiral that sir lewis met him the cordiality of the latters embrace and the noble entertainment following at the house of sir christopher hare near the port whither sir lewis conducted him set this doubt at rest and relighted the lamp of hope in the despairing soul of our adventurer in sir lewis he saw only his kinsmanhis very good friend and kinsman to insist upon stukeleys own description of himselfat a time when of all others in his crowded life he needed the support of a kinsman and the guidance of a friend  you know the story of this sir walter who had been one of the brightest ornaments of the reign of queen elizabeth and might have added lustre to that of king james had not his sowshipto employ the title bestowed upon that prince by his own queenbeen too mean of soul to appreciate the mans great worth courtier philosopher soldier man of letters and man of action alike ralegh was at once the greatest prosewriter and one of the greatest captains of his age the last survivor of that glorious companywhose other members were drake and frobisher and hawkinsthat had given england supremacy upon the seas that had broken the power and lowered the pride of spain  his was a name that had resounded to the honour and glory of england throughout the world a name that like drakes was a thing of hate and terror to king philip and his spaniards yet the king of scots unclean of body and of mind who had succeeded to the throne of elizabeth must affect ignorance of that great name which shall never die while england lives  when the splendid courtier stood before himfor at fifty sir walter was still handsome of person and magnificent of appareljames looked him over and inquired who he might be when they had told him  ive rawly heard of thee quoth the royal punster who sought by such atrocities of speech to be acclaimed a wit  it was ominous of what must follow and soon thereafter you see this great and gallant gentleman arrested on a trumpedup charge of high treason bullied vituperated and insulted by venal peddling lawyers and finally although his wit and sincerity had shattered every fragment of evidence brought against him sentenced to death thus far james went but he hesitated to go further hesitated to carry out the sentence sir walter had too many friends in england then the memory of his glorious deeds was still too fresh in the public mind and execution might have been attended by serious consequences for king james besides one at least of the main objects was achieved sir walters broad acres were confiscate by virtue of that sentence and king james wanted the landfilched thus from one who was englands prideto bestow it upon one of those golden calves of his who were englands shame  i maun hae the land for carr i maun hae it was his brazen and peevish answer to an appeal against the confiscation  for thirteen years sir walter lay in the tower under that sentence of death passed in 1603 enjoying after a season a certain liberty visited there by his dear lady and his friends among whom was henry prince of wales who did not hesitate to publish that no man but his fatherwhom he detestedwould keep such a bird in a cage he beguiled the time in literary and scientific pursuits distilling his essences and writing that stupendous work of his the history of the world thus old age crept upon him but far from quenching the fires of enterprise within his adventurers soul it brought a restlessness that urged him at last to make a bid for liberty despairing of winning it from the clemency of james he applied his wits to extracting it from the kings cupidity  throughout his life since the day when first he had brought himself to the notice of a queen by making of his cloak a carpet for her feet he had retained side by side with the dignity of the sage and the greatness of the hero the craft and opportunism of the adventurer his opportunity now was the straitened condition of the royal treasury a hint of which had been let fall by winwood the secretary of state he announced at once that he knew of a gold mine in guiana the el dorado of the spaniards  on his return from a voyage to guiana in 1595 he had written of it thus  there the common soldier shall fight for gold instead of pence pay himself with plates half a foot broad whereas he breaks his bones in other wars for provant and penury those commanders and chieftains that shoot at honour and abundance shall find here more rich and beautiful cities more temples adorned with golden images more sepulchres filled with treasure than either cortez found in mexico or pizarro in peru  winwood now reminded him that as a consequence many expeditions had gone out but failed to discover any of these things  that said ralegh is because those adventurers were ignorant alike of the country and of the art of conciliating its inhabitants were i permitted to go i would make guiana to england what peru has been to spain  that statement reported to james in his need was enough to fire his cupidity and when ralegh had further added that he would guarantee to the crown onefifth of the treasure without asking any contribution towards the adventure either in money or in ships he was permitted to come forth and prepare for the expedition   his friends came to his assistance and in march of 1617 he set sail for el dorado with a wellmanned and wellequipped fleet of fourteen ships the earls of arundel and pembroke standing sureties for his return  from the outset the fates were unpropitious disaster closed the adventure gondomar the ambassador of spain at whitehall too wellinformed of what was afoot had warned his master spanish ships waited to frustrate sir walter who was under pledge to avoid all conflict with the forces of king philip but conflict there was and bloodshed in plenty about the city of manoa which the spaniards held as the key to the country into which the english adventurers sought to penetrate among the slain were the governor of manoa who was gondomars own brother and sir walters eldest son  to ralegh waiting at the mouth of the orinoco came his beaten forces in retreat with the terrible news of a happening that meant his ruin halfmaddened his anguish increased by the loss of his boy he upbraided them so fiercely that keymis who had been in charge of the expedition shut himself up in his cabin and shot himself with a pocketpistol mutiny followed and whitneymost trusted of sir walters captainsset sail for england being followed by six other ships of that fleet which meanwhile had been reduced to twelve with the remaining five the stricken sir walter had followed more at leisure what need to hurry disgrace and perhaps death awaited him in england he knew the power of spain with james who was so set upon a spanish marriage for his heir knew spains hatred of himself and what eloquence it would gather in the mouth of gondomar intent upon avenging his brothers death  he feared the worst and so was glad upon landing to have by him a kinsman upon whom he could lean for counsel and guidance in this the darkest hour of all his life sitting late that night in the library of sir christopher hares house sir walter told his cousin in detail the story of his misadventure and confessed to his misgivings  my brains are broken was his cry  stukeley combed his beard in thought he had little comfort to offer  it was not expected said he that you would return  not expected sir walters bowed white head was suddenly flung back indignation blazed in the eyes that age had left undimmed what act in all my life justified the belief i should be false to honour my danger here was made quite plain and captain king would have had me steer a course for france where i had found a welcome and a harbour but to consent i must have been false to my lords of arundel and pembroke who were sureties to the king for my return life is still sweet to me despite my threescore years and more but honour is sweeter still  and then because life was sweet he bluntly asked his cousin what is the kings intent by me  nay now said stukeley who shall know what passes in the kings mind from the signs i judge your case to be none so desperate you have good friends in plenty among whom although the poorest count myself the first anon when you are rested well to london by easy stages baiting at the houses of your friends and enlisting their good offices on your behalf  ralegh took counsel on the matter with captain king a bluff tawnybearded seaman who was devoted to him body and soul  sir lewis proposes it eh quoth the hardy seaman and sir lewis is viceadmiral of devon he is not by chance bidden to escort you to london  the captain clearly had escaped the spell of stukeleys affability sir walter was indignant he had never held his kinsman in great esteem and had never been on the best of terms with him in the past nevertheless he was very far from suspecting him of what king implied to convince him that he did sir lewis an injustice ralegh put the blunt question to his kinsman in kings presence  nay said sir lewis i am not yet bidden to escort you but as viceadmiral of devon i may at any moment be so bidden it were wiser i hold not to await such an order though even if it come he made haste to add you may still count upon my friendship i am your kinsman first and viceadmiral after  with a smile that irradiated his handsome virile countenance sir walter held out his hand to clasp his cousins in token of appreciation captain king expressed no opinion save what might be conveyed in a grunt and a shrug  guided now unreservedly by his cousins counsel sir walter set out with him upon that journey to london captain king went with them as well as sir walters bodyservant cotterell and a frenchman named manourie who had made his first appearance in the plymouth household on the previous day stukeley explained the fellow as a gifted man of medicine whom he had sent for to cure him of a trivial but inconvenient ailment by which he was afflicted  journeying by slow stages as sir lewis had directed they came at last to brentford sir walter had he followed his own bent would have journeyed more slowly still for in a measure as he neared london apprehensions of what might await him there grew ever darker he spoke of them to king and the blunt captain said nothing to dispel them  you are being led like a sheep to the shambles he declared and you go like a sheep you should have landed in france where you have friends even now it is not too late a ship could be procured  and my honour could be sunk at sea sir walter harshly concluded in reproof of such counsel  but at the inn at brentford he was sought out by a visitor who brought him the like advice in rather different terms this was de chesne the secretary of the french envoy le clerc cordially welcomed by ralegh the frenchman expressed his deep concern to see sir walter under arrest  you conclude too hastily laughed sir walter  monsieur i do not conclude i speak of what i am inform  misinformed sir i am not a prisonerat least not yet he added with a sigh i travel of my own free will to london with my good friend and kinsman stukeley to lay the account of my voyage before the king  of your own free will you travel of your own frets will and you are not a prisoner ha there was bitter mockery in de chesnes short laugh cest bien drole and he explained milord the duke o buckingham he has write in his masters name to the ambassador gondomar that you are taken and held at the disposal of the king of spain gondomar is to inform him whether king philip wish that you be sent to spain to essay the justice of his catholic majesty or that you suffer here meanwhile your quarters are being made ready in the tower yet you tell me you are not prisoner you go of your own free will to london sir walter do not be deceive if you reach london you are lost  now here was news to shatter sir walters last illusion yet desperately he clung to the fragments of it the envoys secretary must be at fault  tis yourself are at fault sir walter in that you trust those about you the frenchman insisted  sir walter stared at him frowning dye mean stukeley quoth he halfindignant already at the mere suggestion  sir lewis he is your kinsman de chesne shrugged you should know your family better than i but who is this manourie who accompanies you where is he come from what you know of him  sir walter confessed that he knew nothing  but i know much he is a fellow of evil reputation a spy who does not scruple to sell his own people and i know that letters of commission from the privy council for your arrest were give to him in london ten days ago whether those letters were to himself or he was just the messenger to another imports nothing the fact is everything the warrant against you exists and it is in the hands of one or another of those that accompany you i say no more as i have tol you you should know your own family but of this be sure they mean that you go to the tower and so to your death and now sir walter if i show you the disease i also bring the remedy i am command by my master to offer you a french barque which is in the thames and a safe conduct to the governor of calais in france you will find safety and honour as your worth deserve  up sprang sir walter from his chair and flung off the cloak of thought in which he had been mantled  impossible he said impossible there is my plighted word to return and there are my lords of arundel and pembroke who are sureties for me i cannot leave them to suffer by my default  they will not suffer at all de chesne assured him he was very well informed king james has yielded to spain partly because he fears partly because he will have a spanish marriage for prince charles and will do nothing to trouble his good relations with king philip but after all you have friends whom his majesty also fears if you escape you would resolve all his perplexities i do not believe that any obstacle will be offer to your escapeelse why they permit you to travel thus without any guard and to retain your sword  half distracted as he was by what he had learnt yet sir walter clung stoutly and obstinately to what he believed to be the only course for a man of honour and so he dismissed de chesne with messages of gratitude but refusal to his master and sent for captain king together they considered all that the secretary had stated and king agreed with de chesnes implied opinion that it was sir lewis himself who held the warrant  they sent for him at once and ralegh straightly taxed him with it sir lewis as straightly admitted it and when king thereupon charged him with deceit he showed no anger but only the profoundest grief he sank into a chair and took his head in his hands  what could i do what could i do he cried the warrant came in the very moment we were setting out at first i thought of telling you and then i bethought me that to do so would be but to trouble your mind without being able to offer you help  sir walter understood what was implied did you not say he asked that you were my kinsman first and viceadmiral of devon after  ayand so i am though i must lose my office of viceadmiral which has cost me six hundred pounds if i suffer you to escape id never hesitate if it were not for manourie who watches me as closely as he watches you and would baulk us at the last and that is why i have held my peace on the score of this warrant what can it help that i should trouble you with the matter until at the same time i can offer you some way out  the frenchman has a throat and throats can be slit said the downright king  so they can and men can be hanged for slitting them returned sir lewis and thereafter resumed and elaborated his first argument using now such forceful logic and obvious sincerity that sir walter was convinced he was no less convinced too of the peril in which he stood he plied those wits of his which had rarely failed him in an extremity manourie was the difficulty but in his time he had known many of these agents who without sentimental interest and purely for the sake of gold were ready to play such parts and never yet had he known one who was not to be corrupted so that evening he desired manouries company in the room above stairs that had been set apart for sir walters use facing him across the table at which both were seated sir walter thrust his clenched fist upon the board and suddenly opening it dazzled the frenchmans beady eyes with the jewel sparkling in his palm  tell me manourie are you paid as much as that to betray me  manourie paled a little under his tan he was a swarthy sharpfeatured fellow slight and wiry he looked into sir walters grimly smiling eyes then again at the white diamond from which the candlelight was striking every colour of the rainbow he made a shrewd estimate of its price and shook his black head he had quite recovered from the shock of sir walters question  not half as much he confessed with impudence  then you might find it more remunerative to serve me said the knight this jewel is to be earned  the agents eyes flickered he passed his tongue over his lips as how quoth he  briefly thus i have but learnt of the trammel in which i am taken i must have time to concert my measures of escape and time is almost at an end you are skilled in drugs so my kinsman tells me can you so drug me as to deceive physicians that i am in extremis  manourie considered awhile  i i think i could he answered presently  and keep faith with me in this at the price of say two such stones  the venal knave gasped in amazement this was not generosity it was prodigality he recovered again and swore himself sir walters  about it then sir walter rolled the gem across the board into the clutch of the spy which pounced to meet it keep that in earnest the other will follow when we have cozened them  next morning sir walter could not resume the journey when cotterell went to dress him he found his master taken with vomits and reeling like a drunkard the valet ran to fetch sir lewis and when they returned together they found sir walter on all fours gnawing the rushes on the floor his face livid and horribly distorted his brow glistening with sweat  stukeley in alarm ordered cotterell to get his master back to bed and to foment him which was done but on the next day there was no improvement and on the third things were in far more serious case the skin of his brow and arms and breast was inflamed and covered with horrible purple blotchesthe result of an otherwise harmless ointment with which the french empiric had supplied him  when stukeley beheld him thus disfigured and lying apparently inert and but halfconscious upon his bed he backed away in terror the viceadmiral had seen aforetime the horrible manifestations of the plague and could not be mistaken here he fled from the infected air of his kinsmans chamber and summoned what physicians were available to pronounce and prescribe the physicians camethree in numberbut manifested no eagerness to approach the patient closely the mere sight of him was enough to lead them to the decision that he was afflicted with the plague in a singularly virulent form  presently one of them plucked up courage so far as to feel the pulse of the apparently delirious patient its feebleness confirmed his diagnosis moreover the hand he held was cold and turgid he was not to know that sir walter had tightly wrapped about his upper arm the ribbon from his poniard and so he was entirely deceived  the physicians withdrew and delivered their verdict whereupon sir lewis at once sent word of it to the privy council  that afternoon the faithful captain king sorely afflicted by the news came to visit his master and was introduced to sir walters chamber by manourie who was in attendance upon him to the seamans amazement he found sir walter sitting up in bed surveying in a handmirror a face that was horrible beyond description with the complacent smile of one who takes satisfaction in his appearance yet there was no fevered madness in the smiling eyes they were alive with intelligence amounting indeed to craft  ah king was the glad welcome the prophet david did make himself a fool and suffered spittle to fall upon his beard to escape from the hands of his enemies and there was brutus ay and others as memorable who have descended to such artifice  though he laughed it is clear that he was seeking to excuse an unworthiness of which he was conscious  artifice quoth king aghast is this artifice  aya hedge against my enemies who will be afraid to approach me  king sat himself down by his masters bed a better hedge against your enemies sir walter would have been the strip of sea twixt here and france would to heaven you had done as i advised ere you set foot in this ungrateful land  the omission may be repaired said sir walter  before the imminence of his peril as now disclosed to him sir walter had been reconsidering de chesnes assurance touching my lords of arundel and pembroke and he had come to concludethe more readily perhaps because it was as he would have itthat de chesne was right that to break faith with them were no such great matter after all nor one for which they would be called upon to suffer and so now when it was all but too late he yielded to the insistence of captain king and consented to save himself by flight to france king was to go about the business of procuring a ship without loss of time yet there was no need of desperate haste as was shown when presently orders came to brentford for the disposal of the prisoner the king who was at salisbury desired that sir walter should be conveyed to his own house in london stukeley reported this to him proclaiming it a sign of royal favour sir walter was not deceived he knew the reason to be fear lest he should infect the tower with the plague by which he was reported stricken  so the journey was resumed and sir walter was brought to london and safely bestowed in his own house but ever in the care of his loving friend and kinsman manouries part being fulfilled and the aim accomplished sir walter completed the promised payment by bestowing upon him the second diamonda form of eminently portable currency with which the knight was well supplied on the morrow manourie was gone dismissed as a consequence of the part he had played  it was stukeley who told sir walter thisa very well informed and injured stukeley who asked to know what he had done to forfeit the knights confidence that behind his back sir walter secretly concerted means of escape had his cousin ceased to trust him  sir walter wondered looking into that lean crafty face he considered kings unquenchable mistrust of the man bethought him of his kinsmans general neediness remembered past events that shed light upon his ways and nature and began now at last to have a sense of the mans hypocrisy and doubledealing yet he reasoned in regard to him precisely as he had reasoned in regard to manourie the fellow was acquisitive and therefore corruptible if indeed he was so base that he had been bought to betray sir walter then he could be bought again to betray those who had so bought him  nay nay said sir walter easily it is not lack of trust in you my good friend but you are the holder of an office and knowing as i do the upright honesty of your character i feared to embarrass you with things whose very knowledge must give you the parlous choice of being false to that office or false to me  stukeley broke forth into imprecations he was he vowed the most accursed and miserable of men that such a task as this should have fallen to his lot and he was a poor man too he would have his cousin remember it was unthinkable that he should use the knowledge he had gained to attempt to frustrate sir walters plans of escape to france and this notwithstanding that if sir walter escaped it is certain he would lose his office of viceadmiral and the six hundred pounds he had paid for it  as to that you shall be at no loss sir walter assured him i could not suffer it i pledge you my honour lewis that you shall have a thousand pounds from my wife on the day that i am safely landed in france or holland meanwhile in earnest of what is to come here is a toy of value for you and he presented sir lewis with a jewel of price a great ruby encrusted in diamonds  thus reassured that he would be immune from pecuniary loss sir lewis was ready to throw himself wholeheartedly into sir walters plans and to render him all possible assistance true this assistance was a costly matter there was this person to be bought and that one there were expenses here and expenses there incurred by sir lewis on his kinsmans behalf and there were odd presents too which stukeley seemed to expect and which sir walter could not deny him he had no illusions now that king had been right that here he was dealing with a rogue who would exact the uttermost farthing for his services but he was gratified at the shrewdness with which he had taken his cousins measure and did not grudge the bribes by which he was to escape the scaffold  de chesne came again to the house in london to renew his masters offer of a ship to carry sir walter overseas and such other assistance as sir walter might require but by now the knights arrangements were complete his servant cotterell had come to inform him that his own boatswain now in london was the owner of a ketch at present lying at tilbury admirably suited for the enterprise and entirely at sir walters disposal it had been decided then with the agreement of captain king that they should avail themselves of this and accordingly cotterell was bidden desire the boatswain to have the craft made ready for sea at once in view of this and anxious to avoid unnecessarily compromising the french envoy sir walter gratefully declined the latters offer  and so we come at last to that july evening appointed for the flight ralegh who having for some time discarded the use of manouries ointment had practically recovered his normal appearance covering his long white hair under a spanish hat and muffling the half of his face in the folds of a cloak came to wapping stairsthat illomened place of execution of pirates and searoversaccompanied by cotterell who carried the knights cloakbag and by sir lewis and sir lewiss son out of solicitude for their dear friend and kinsman the stukeleys could not part from him until he was safely launched upon his voyage at the head of the stairs they were met by captain king at the foot of them a boat was waiting as concerted the boatswain at the tiller  king greeted them with an air of obvious relief  you feared perhaps we should not come said stukeley with a sneer at the captains avowed mistrust of him yet now i trust youll do me the justice to admit that i have shown myself an honest man  the uncompromising king looked at him and frowned misliking the words  i hope that youll continue so he answered stiffly  they went down the slippery steps to the boat and then the shore glided slowly past them as they pushed off into the stream of the ebbing tide  a moment later king whose suspicious eyes kept a sharp lookout observed another boat put off some two hundred yards higher up the river at first he saw it breast the stream as if proceeding towards london bridge then abruptly swing about and follow them instantly he drew the attention of sir walter to that pursuing wherry  whats this quoth sir walter harshly are we betrayed  the watermen taking fright at the words hung now upon their oars  put back sir walter bade them ill not betray my friends to no purpose put back and let us home again  nay now said stukeley gravely himself watching the wherry we are more than a match for them in oars even if their purpose be such as you suspectfor which suspicion when all is said there is no ground on then he addressed himself to the watermen whipping out a pistol and growing truculent in mien and voice to your oars row you dogs or ill pistol you where you sit  the men bent their backs forthwith and the boat swept on but sir walter was still full of apprehensions still questioning the wisdom of keeping to their downstream course if they were being followed  but are we followed cried the impatient sir lewis sdeath cousin is not the river a highway for all the world to use and must every wherry that chances to go our way be in pursuit of us if you are to halt at every shadow faith youll never accomplish anything i vow i am unfortunate in having a friend whom i would save so full of doubts and fears  sir walter gave him reason and even king came to conclude that he had suspected him unjustly whilst the rowers under stukeleys suasion now threw themselves heartily into their task and onward sped the boat through the deepening night taking but little account of that other wherry that hung ever in their wake in this wise they came at length to greenwich on the last of the ebb but here finding the water beginning to grow against them and wearied by the exertion into which stukeleys enthusiasm had flogged them the watermen paused again declaring that they could not reach gravesend before morning  followed a brief discussion at the end of which sir walter bade them put him ashore at purfleet  and thats the soundest counsel quoth the boatswain for at purfleet we can get horses on to tilbury  stukeley was of the same opinion but not so the more practical captain king  tis useless he declared to them at this hour how shall you get horses to go by land  and now sir walter looking over his shoulder saw the other wherry bearing down upon them through the faintly opalescent mists of dawn a hail came to them across the water  oh sdeath we are betrayed cried ralegh bitterly and stukeley swore more fiercely still sir walter turned to him put ashore he said shortly and let us home  ay perhaps twere best for tonight theres an end to the enterprise and if i am taken in your company now what shall be said to me for this active assistance in your escape his voice was gloomy his face drawn and white  could you not plead that you had but pretended to go with me to seize on my private papers suggested the ingenious mind of ralegh  i could but shall i be believed shall i his loom was deepening to despair  ralegh was stricken almost with remorse on his cousins account his generous heart was now more concerned with the harm to his friends than with his own doom he desired to make amends to stukeley but had no means save such as lay in the power of that currency he used having naught else to give he must give that he plunged his hand into an inner pocket and brought forth a handful of jewels which he thrust upon his kinsman  courage he urged him up now and we may yet win out and home so that all will be well with you at least and you shall not suffer for your friendship to me  stukeley embraced him then protesting his love and desire to serve him  they came to land at last just below greenwich bridge and almost at the same moment the other wherry grounded immediately above them men sprang from her with the obvious intent of cutting off their retreat  too late said ralegh and sighed entirely without passion now that the dice had fallen and showed that the game was lost you must act on my suggestion to explain your presence lewis  indeed there is no other course sir lewis agreed and you are in the same case captain king you must confess that you joined with me but to betray sir walter ill bear you out thus each supporting the other  ill roast in hell before i brand myself a traitor roared the captain furiously and were you an honest man sir lewis yould understand my meaning  so so said stukeley in a quiet wicked voice and it was observed that his son and one or two of the watermen had taken their stand beside him as if in readiness for action why then since you will have it so captain i arrest you in the kings name on a charge of abetting treason  the captain fell back a step stricken a moment by sheer amazement then he groped for a pistol to do at last what he realized he should have done long since instantly he was overpowered it was only then that sir walter understood the thing that had happened and with understanding came fury the old adventurer flung back his cloak and snatched at his rapier to put it through the vitals of his dear friend and kinsman but he was too late hands seized upon him and he found himself held by the men from the wherry confronted by a mr william herbert whom he knew for stukeleys cousin and he heard mr herbert formally asking him for the surrender of his sword  instantly he governed himself repressed his fury he looked coldly at his kinsman whose face showed white and evil in the growing light of the early summer dawn sir lewis was all he said these actions will not turn out to your credit  he had no illusion left his understanding was now a very full one his dear friend and kinsman had played him false throughout intending first to drain him of his resources before finally flinging the empty husk to the executioner manourie had been in the plot he had run with the hare and hunted with the hounds and sir walters own servant cotterell had done no less amongst them they had cozened the great cozenerto use stukeleys own cynical expression even so it was only on his trial that sir walter plumbed the full depth of stukeleys baseness for it was only then he learnt that his kinsman had been armed by a warrant of immunity to assist his projects of escape so that he might the more effectively incriminate and betray him and sir walter discovered also that the ship in which he had landed and other matters were to provide additional judas fees to this acquisitive betrayer  if to escape his enemies sir walter had had recourse to artifices unworthy the great hero that he was now that all hope was lost he conducted himself with a dignity and cheerfulness beyond equal so calm and selfpossessed and masterly was his defence from the charge of piracy preferred at the request of spain and so shrewd in its inflaming appeal to public opinion that his judges were constrained to abandon that line of prosecution and could discover no way of giving his head to king james save by falling back upon the thirteenyear old sentence of death against him of this they now ordered execution  never a man who loved his life as dearly as sir walter loved it met death as blithely he dressed himself for the scaffold with that elegance and richness which all his life he had observed he wore a ruff band and black velvet wrought nightgown over a doublet of haircoloured satin a black wrought waistcoat black cut taffety breeches and ashcoloured silk stockings under his plumed hat he covered his white locks with a wrought nightcap this last he bestowed on his way to the scaffold upon a baldheaded old man who had come to take a last look of him with the observation that he was more in need of it than himself when he had removed it it was observed that his hair was not curled as usual this was a matter that had fretted his barber peter in the prison of the gatehouse at westminster that morning but sir walter had put him off with a laugh and a jest  let them comb it that shall have it he had said of his own head  having taken his leave of the friends who had flocked about him with the observation that he had a long journey before him he called for the axe and when presented to him ran his fingers along the edge and smiled  sharp medicine quoth he but a sound cure for all diseases  when presently the executioner bade him turn his head to the east  it is no great matter which way a mans head stands so that his heart lies right he said  thus passed one of englands greatest heroes indeed one of the very makers of this england and than his death there is no more shameful blot upon the shameful reign of that pusillanimous james unclean of body and of soul who sacrificed him to the king of spain  a spectator of his death who suffered for his wordsas men must ever suffer for the regardless utterance of truthdeclared that england had not such another head to cut off  as for stukeley the acquisitiveness which had made a judas of him was destined by a poetic justice ever desired but rarely forthcoming for knaves soon to be his ruin he was caught diminishing the gold coin of the realm by the operation known today as clipping and with him was taken his creature manourie who to save himself turned chief witness against stukeley sir lewis was sentenced to death but saved himself by purchasing his pardon at the cost of every illgotten shilling he possessed and he lived thereafter as bankrupt of means as he was of honour  yet before all this happened sir lewis had for his part in sir walter raleghs death come to be an object of execration throughout the land and to be commonly known as sir judas at whitehall he suffered rebuffs and insults that found a climax in the words addressed to him by the lord admiral to whom he went to give an account of his office  base fellow darest thou who art the contempt and scorn of men offer thyself in my presence  for a man of honour there was but one course sir judas was not a man of honour he carried his grievance to the king james leered at him  what wouldst thou have me do wouldst thou have me hang him on my soul if i should hang all that speak ill of thee all the trees of the country would not suffice so great is the number      viii his insolence of buckingham  george villiers courtship of ann of austria    he was insolence incarnate  since the day when a mere country lad his singular good looks had attracted the attention of king jamesnotoriously partial to goodlooking ladsand had earned him the office of cupbearer to his majesty the career of george villiers is to be read in a series of acts of violent and everincreasing arrogance expressing the vanity and levity inherent in his nature scarcely was he established in the royal favour than he distinguished himself by striking an offending gentleman in the very presence of his sovereignan act of such gross disrespect to royalty that his hand would have paid forfeit as by law demanded had not the maudlin king deemed him too lovely a fellow to be so cruelly maimed  over the mind and will of king charles his ascendancy became even greater than it had been over that of king james and it were easy to show that the acts of george villiers life supplied the main planks of that scaffold in whitehall whereupon charles stuart came to lose his head charles was indeed a martyr a martyr chiefly to the reckless insolent irresponsible vanity of this villiers who from a simple country squire with nothing but personal beauty to recommend him had risen to be as duke of buckingham the first gentleman in england  the heady wine of power had gone to his brain and so addled it that as john chamberlain tells us there was presently a touch of craziness in himof the variety no doubt known to modern psychologists as megalomania he lost the sense of proportion and was without respect for anybody or anything the commons of england and the immensely dignified court of spainduring that disgraceful pseudoromantic adventure at madridwere alike the butts of this parvenus unmeasured arrogance but the crowning insolence of his career was that tragicomedy the second act of which was played on a june evening in an amiens garden on the banks of the river somme  three weeks agoon the 14th may 1625 to be precisebuckingham had arrived in paris as ambassador extraordinary charged with the task of conducting to england the king of frances sister henrietta maria who three days earlier had been married by proxy to king charles  the occasion enabled buckingham to fling the reins on to the neck of his mad vanity to indulge to the very fullest his crazy passion for ostentation and magnificence because the court of france was proverbially renowned for splendour and luxury buckingham felt it due to himself to extinguish its brilliance by his own on his first coming to the louvre he literally blazed he wore a suit of white satin velvet with a short cloak in the spanish fashion the whole powdered over with diamonds to the value of some ten thousand pounds an enormous diamond clasped the herons plume in his hat diamonds flashed in the hilt of his sword diamonds studded his very spurs which were of beaten gold the highest orders of england spain and france flamed on his breast on the occasion of his second visit he wore a suit of purple satin of intent so lightly sewn with pearls that as he moved he shook them off like raindrops and left them to lie where they fell as largesse for pages and the lesser fry of the court  his equipages and retinue were of a kind to match his personal effulgence his coaches were lined with velvet and covered with cloth of gold and some seven hundred people made up his train there were musicians watermen grooms of the chamber thirty chief yeomen a score of cooks as many grooms a dozen pages two dozen footmen six outriders and twenty gentlemen each with his own attendants all arrayed as became the satellites of a star of such great magnitude  buckingham succeeded in his ambition paris that hitherto had set the fashion to the world stared mouthagape dazzled by the splendour of this superb and scintillating ambassador  another by betraying consciousness of the figure that he cut might have made himself ridiculous but buckinghams insolent assurance was proof against that peril supremely selfsatisfied he was conscious only that what he did could not be better done and he ruffled it with an air of easy insouciance as if in all this costly display there was nothing that was not normal he treated with princes and even with the gloomy louis xiii as with equals and becoming more and more intoxicated with his very obvious success he condescended to observe approvingly the fresh beauty of the young queen  anne of austria then in her twentyfourth year was said to be one of the most beautiful women in europe she was of a good height and carriage slight and very gracefully built of a ravishing fairness of skin and hair whilst a look of wistfulness had come to invest with an indefinable tenderness her splendid eyes her childless marriage to the young king of france which had endured now for ten years had hardly been successful gloomy taciturn easily moved to suspicion and difficult to convince of error louis xiii held his wife aloof throwing up between himself and her a wall of coldness almost of dislike  there is a storyand tallemant des raux gives credit to itthat in the early days of her reign as queen of france richelieu had fallen deeply in love with her and that she with the mischief of an irresponsible young girl had encouraged him merely to betray him to a ridicule which his proud spirit had never been able to forgive be that or another the reason the fact that richelieu hated her and subjected her to his vindictive persecution is beyond dispute and it was he who by a hundred suggestions poisoned against her the kings mind and thus kept ever open the gulf between the two  the eyes of that neglected young wife dilated a little and admiration kindled in them when they rested upon the dazzling figure of my lord of buckingham he must have seemed to her a figure of romance a prince out of a fairytale  that betraying glance he caught and it inflamed at once his monstrous arrogance to the scalps already adorning the belt of his vanity he would add that of the love of a beautiful young queen perhaps he was thrilled in his madness by the thought of the peril that would spice such an adventure into that adventure he plunged forthwith he wooed her during the eight days that he abode in paris flagrantly openly contemptuous of courtiers and of the very king himself at the louvre at the hotel de chevreuse at the luxembourg where the queenmother held her court at the hotel de guise and elsewhere he was ever at the queens side  richelieu whose hard pride and selflove had been wounded by the dukes cavalier behaviour who despised the fellow for an upstart and may even have resented that so shallow a man should have been sent to treat with a statesman of his own caliberfor other business beside the marriage had brought buckingham to parissuggested to the king that the dukes manner in approaching the queen lacked a proper deference and the queens manner of receiving him a proper circumspection therefore the kings long face became longer his gloomy eyes gloomier as he looked on far however from acting as a deterrent the royal scowl was mere incense to the vanity of buckingham a spur to goad him on to greater daring  on the 2nd of june a splendid company of some four thousand french nobles and ladies besides buckingham and his retinue quitted paris to accompany henrietta maria now queen of england on the first stage of her journey to her new home the king was not of the party he had gone with richelieu to fontainebieau leaving it to the queen and the queenmother to accompany his sister  buckingham missed no chance upon that journey of pressing his attentions upon anne of austria duty dictated that his place should be beside the carriage of henrietta maria but duty did not apply to his insolence of buckingham so indifferent of whom he might slight or offend and then the devil took a hand in the game  at amiens the queenmother fell ill so that the court was compelled to halt there for a few days to give her majesty the repose she required whilst amiens was thus honoured by the presence of three queens at one and the same time within its walls the duc de chaulnes gave an entertainment in the citadel buckingham attended this and in the dance that followed the banquet it was buckingham who led out the queen  thereafter the royal party had returned to the bishops palace where it was lodged and a small company went out to take the evening cool in the bishops fragrant gardens on the somme buckingham ever at the queens side anne of austria was attended by her mistress of the household the beautiful witty marie de rohan duchess of chevreuse and by her equerry monsieur de putange madame de chevreuse had for cavalier that handsome coxcomb lord holland who was one of buckinghams creatures between whom and herself a certain transient tenderness had sprung up m de putange was accompanied by madame de vernet with whom at the time he was over head and ears in love elsewhere about the spacious gardens other courtiers sauntered  now either madame de chevreuse and m de putange were too deeply engrossed in their respective companions or else the state of their own hearts and the tepid languorous eventide disposed them complacently towards the affair of gallantry upon which their mistress almost seemed to wish to be embarked they forgot it would seem that she was a queen and remembered sympathetically that she was a woman and that she had for companion the most splendid cavalier in all the world thus they committed the unpardonable fault of lagging behind and allowing her to pass out of their sight round the bend of an avenue by the water  no sooner did buckingham realize that he was alone with the queen that the friendly dusk and a screen of trees secured them from observation than piling audacity up on audacity he determined to accomplish here and now the conquest of this lovely lady who had used him so graciously and received his advances with such manifest pleasure  how soft the night how exquisite he sighed  indeed she agreed and how still but for the gentle murmur of the river  the river he cried on a new note that is no gentle murmur the river laughs maliciously mocking the river is evil  evil quoth she he had checked in his step and they stood now side by side  evil he repeated evil and cruel it goes to swell the sea that soon shall divide me from you and it mocks me rejoicing wickedly in the pain that will presently be mine  it took her aback she laughed a little breathlessly to hide her discomposure and scarce knew how to answer him scarce knew whether she took pleasure or offense in his daring encroachment upon that royal aloofness in which she dwelt and in which her spanish rearing had taught her she must ever dwell   oh but monsieur lambassadeur you will be with us again perhaps before so very long  his answer came in a swift throbbing question his lips so near her face that she could feel his breath hot upon her cheek  do you wish it madame do you wish it i implore you of your pity say but that you wish it and i will come though i tear down half a world to reach you  she recoiled in wright and displeasure before a wooing so impetuous and violently outspoken though the displeasure was perhaps but a passing emotion the result of early training yet she contrived to answer him with the proper icy dignity due to her position as a princess of spain now queen of france  monsieur you forget yourself the queen of france does not listen to such words you are mad i think  yes i am mad he flung back mad with loveso mad that i have forgot that you are a queen and i an ambassador under the ambassador there is a man under the queen a womanour real selves not the titles with which fate seeks to dissemble our true natures and with the whole strength of my true nature do i love you so potently so overwhelmingly that i will not believe you sensible of no response  thus torrentially he delivered himself and swept her a little off her feet she was a woman as he said a queen it is true but also a neglected coldlyused wife and no one had ever addressed her in anything approaching this manner no one had ever so much as suggested that her existence could matter greatly that in her womans nature there was the magic power of awakening passion and devotion he was so splendidly magnificent so masterful and unrivalled and he came thus to lay his being as it were in homage at her feet it touched her a little who knew so little of the real man it cost her an effort to repulse him and the effort was not very convincing  hush monsieur for pitys sake you must not talk so to me it  it hurts  o fatal word she meant that it was her dignity as queen he wounded for she clung to that as to the anchor of salvation but he in his egregious vanity must of cours e misunderstand  hurts he cried and the rapture in his accents should have warned her because you resist it because you fight against the commands of your true self anne he seized her and crushed her to him anne  wild terror gripped her at that almost brutal contact and anger too her dignity surging up in violent outraged rebellion a scream loud and piercing broke from her and rang through the still garden it brought him to his senses it was as if he had been lifted up into the air and then suddenly allowed to fall  he sprang away from her an incoherent exclamation on his lips and when an instant later monsieur de putange came running up in alarm his hand upon his sword those two stood with the width of the avenue between them buckingham erect and defiant the queen breathing hard and trembling a hand upon her heaving breast as if to repress its tumult  madame madame had been putanges cry as he sprang forward in alarm and selfreproach  he stood now almost between them looking from one to the other in bewilderment neither spoke  you cried out madame m de putange reminded her and buckingham may well have wondered whether presently he would be receiving m de putanges sword in his vitals he must have known that his life now hung upon her answer  i called you that was all said the queen in a voice that she strove to render calm i confess that i was startled to find myself alone with m lambassadeur do not let it occur again m de putange  the equerry bowed in silence his itching fingers fell away from his swordhilt and he breathed more freely he had no illusions as to what must have happened but he was relieved there were to be no complications the others now coming up with them the party thereafter kept together until presently buckingham and lord holland took their leave  on the morrow the last stage of the escorting journey was accomplished a little way beyond amiens the court took its leave of henrietta maria entrusting her now to buckingham and his followers who were to convey her safely to charles  it was a very contrite and downcast buckingham who came now to anne of austria as she sat in her coach with the princesse de conti for only companion  madame he said i am come to take my leave  fare you well monsieur lambassadeur she said and her voice was warm and gentle as if to show him that she bore no malice  i am come to ask your pardon madame he said in a low voice  oh monsieurno more i beg you she looked down her hands were trembling her cheeks going red and white by turns  he put his head behind the curtains of the coach so that none might see him from outside and looking at him now she beheld tears in his eyes  do not misunderstand me madame i ask your pardon only for having discomposed you startled you as for what i said it were idle to ask pardon since i could no more help saying it than i can help drawing breath i obeyed an instinct stronger than the will to live i gave expression to something that dominates my whole being and will ever dominate it as long as i have life adieu madame at need you know where a servant who will gladly die for you is to be found he kissed the hem of her robe dashed the back of his hand across his eyes and was gone before she could say a word in answer  she sat pale and very thoughtful and the princesse de conti watching her furtively observed that her eyes were moist  i will answer for the queens virtue she stated afterwards but i cannot speak so positively for the hardness of her heart since without doubt the dukes tears affected her spirits  but it was not yet the end as buckingham was nearing calais he was met by a courier from whitehall with instructions for him regarding the negotiations he had been empowered to carry out with france in the matter of an alliance against spainnegotiations which had not thriven with louis and richelieu possibly because the ambassador was illchosen the instructions came too late to be of use but in time to serve as a pretext for buckinghams return to amiens there he sought an audience of the queenmother and delivered himself to her of a futile message for the king this chimerical businessas madame de motteville shrewdly calls itbeing accomplished he came to the real matter which had prompted him to use that pretext for his return and sought audience of anne of austria  it was early morning and the queen was not yet risen but the lev√©es at the court of france were precisely what the word implies and they were held by royalty whilst still abed it was not therefore amazing that he should have been admitted to her presence she was alone save for her ladyinwaiting madame de lannoi who was we are told aged prudent and virtuous conceive therefore the outraged feelings of this lady upon seeing the english duke precipitate himself wildly into the room and on his knees at the royal bedside seize the coverlet and bear it to his lips  whilst the young queen looked confused and agitated madame de lannoi became a pillar of icy dignity  m le duc says she it is not customary in france to kneel when speaking to the queen  i care nothing for the customs of france madame he answered rudely i am not a frenchman  that is too obvious monsieur snapped the elderly prudent and virtuous countess nevertheless whilst in france perhaps monsieur will perceive the convenience of conforming to french customs let me call for a chair for monsieur le duc  i do not want a chair madame  the countess cast her eyes to heaven as if to say i suppose one cannot expect anything else in a foreigner and let him kneel as he insisted placing herself however protectingly at the queens pillow  nevertheless entirely unabashed heeding madame de lannois presence no more than if she had been part of the rooms furniture the duke delivered himself freely of what was in his mind he had been obliged to return to amiens on a matter of state it was unthinkable that he should be so near to her majesty and not hasten to cast himself at her feet and whilst gladdening the eyes of his body with the sight of her matchless perfection the image of which was ever before the eyes of his soul allow himself the only felicity life now held for himthat of protesting himself her utter slave this and much more of the kind did he pour out what time the queen embarrassed and annoyed beyond utterance could only stare at him in silence  apart from the matchless impudence of it it was also of a rashness beyond pardon unless madame de lannoi were the most circumspect of women here was a fine tale for court gossips and for the kings ears a tale that must hopelessly compromise the queen for that buckingham in his selfsufficiency and arrogance appears to have cared nothing one suspects that it would have pleased his vanity to have his name linked with the queens by the lips of scandal  she found her tongue at last  monsieur le duc she said in her confusion it was not necessary it was not worth while to have asked audience of me for this you have leave to go  he looked up in doubt and saw only confusion attributed it perhaps to the presence of that third party to which himself he had been so indifferent he kissed the coverlet again stumbled to his feet and reached the door thence he sent her a flaming glance of his bold eyes and hand on heart  adieu madame said he in tragic tones and so departed  madame de lannoi was discreet and related at the time nothing of what had passed at that interview but that the interview itself had taken place under such conditions was enough to set the tongue of gossip wagging an echo of it reached the king together with the story of that other business in the garden and he was glad to know that the duke of buckingham was back in london richelieu to vent his own malice against the queen sought to feed the kings suspicions  why did she cry out sire he will have asked what did m de buckingham do to make her cry out  i dont know but whatever it was she was no party to it since she did cry out  richelieu did not pursue the matter just then but neither did he abandon it he had his agents in london and elsewhere and he desired of them a close report upon the duke of buckinghams movements and the fullest particulars of his private life  meanwhile buckingham had left behind him in france two faithful agents of his own with instructions to keep his memory green with the queen for he intended to return upon one pretext or another before very long and complete the conquest those agents of his were lord holland and the artist balthazar gerbier it is to be presumed that they served the dukes interests well and it is no less to be presumed from that which followed that they found her majesty willing enough to hear news of that amazingly romantic fellow who had flashed across the path of her grey life touching it for a moment with his own flaming radiance in her loneliness she came to think of him with tenderness and pity in which pity for herself and her dull lot was also blent he was away overseas she might never see him again therefore there could be little harm in indulging the romantic tenderness he had inspired  so one day many months after his departure she begged gerbieras la rochefoucauld tells usto journey to london and bear the duke a trifling memento of hera set of diamond studs that lovetokenfor it amounted to no lessgerbier conveyed to england and delivered to the duke  buckinghams head was so completely turned by the event and his desire to see anne of austria again became thereupon so overmastering that he at once communicated to france that he was coming over as the ambassador of the king of england to treat of certain masters connected with spain but richelieu had heard from the french ambassador in london that portraits of the queen of france were excessively abundant at york house the dukes residence and he had considered it his duty to inform the king louis was angry but not with the queen to have believed her guilty of any indiscretion would have hurt his gloomy pride too deeply all that he believed was that this was merely an expression of buckinghams fanfaronading thrasonical disposition a form of vain empty boasting peculiar to megalomaniacs  as a consequence the king of england was informed that the duke of buckingham for reasons well known to himself would not be agreeable as charless ambassador to his most christian majesty upon learning this the vainglorious buckingham was loud in proclaiming the reason well known to himself and in protesting that he would go to france to see the queen with the french kings consent or without it this was duly reported to richelieu and by richelieu to king louis but his most christian majesty merely sneered accounted it more empty boasting on the part of the parvenu and dismissed it from his mind  richelieu found this attitude singularly exasperating in a king who was temperamentally suspicious it so piqued and annoyed him that when considered in addition to his undying rancour against anne of austria it is easily believed he spared no pains to obtain something in the nature of a proof that the queen was not as innocent as louis insisted upon believing  now it happened that one of his london agents informed him among other matters connected with the dukes private life that he had a bitter and secret enemy in the countess of carlisle between whom and himself there had been a passage of some tenderness too abruptly ended by the duke richelieu acting upon this information contrived to enter into correspondence with lady carlisle and in the course of this correspondence he managed her so craftilysays la rochefoucauldthat very soon she was whilst hardly realizing it his eminences most valuable spy near buckingham richelieu informed her that he was mainly concerned with information that would throw light upon the real relations of buckingharn and the queen of france and he persuaded her that nothing was too insignificant to be communicated her resentment of the treatment she had received from buckingham a resentment the more bitter for being stifledsince for her reputations sake she dared not have given it expressionmade her a very ready instrument in richelieus hands and there was no scrap of gossip she did not carefully gather up and dispatch to him but all was naught until one day at last she was able to tell him something that set his pulses beating more quickly than their habit  she had it upon the best authority that a set of diamond studs constantly worn of late by the duke was a lovetoken from the queen of france sent over to buckingham by a messenger of her own here indeed was news here was a weapon by which the queen might be destroyed richelieu considered if he could but obtain possession of the studs the rest would be easy there would be an endand such an endto the kings obstinate indolent faith in his wifes indifference to that boastful flamboyant english upstart richelieu held his peace for the time being and wrote to the countess  some little time thereafter there was a sumptuous ball given at york house graced by the presence of king charles and his young french queen lady carlisle was present and in the course of the evening buckingham danced with her she was a very beautiful accomplished and readywitted woman and tonight his grace found her charms so alluring that he was almost disposed to blame himself for having perhaps treated her too lightly yet she seemed at pains to show him that it was his to take up again the affair at the point at which it had been dropped she was gay arch provoking and irresistible so irresistible that presently yielding to the lure of her the duke slipped away from his guests with the lady on his arm and they found themselves at the foot of the garden in the shadow of the watergate that inigo jones had just completed for him my lady languished at his side permitted him to encircle her with a protecting arm and for a moment lay heavily against him he caught her violently to him and now her ladyship hitherto so yielding with true feminine contrariness set herself to resist him a scuffle ensued between them she broke from him at last and sped swift as a doe across the lawn towards the lights of the great house his grace in pursuit between vexation and amusement  but he did not overtake her and it was with a sense of having been fooled that he rejoined his guests his questing eyes could discern her nowhere presently he made inquiries to be told that she had desired her carriage to be called and had left york house immediately upon coming in from the garden  he concluded that she was gone off in a pet it was very odd it was in fact most flagrantly contradictory that she should have taken offense at that which she had so obviously invited but then she always had been a perverse and provoking jade with that reflection he put her from his mind  but anon when his guests had departed and the lights in the great house were extinguished buckingham thought of the incident again cogitating it he sat in his room his fingers combing his fine pointed auburn beard at last with a shrug and a halflaugh he rose to undress for bed and then a cry escaped him and brought in his valet from an adjoining room the riband of diamond studs was gone  reckless and indifferent as he was a sense of evil took him in the moment of his discovery of that loss so that he stood there pale staring and moist of brow it was no ordinary theft there were upon his person a dozen ornaments of greater value any one of which could have been more easily detached this was the work of some french agent he had made no secret of whence those studs had come to him  there his thoughts checked on a sudden as in a flash of revelation he saw the meaning of lady carlisles oddly contradictory behaviour the jade had fooled him it was she who had stolen the riband he sat down again his head in his hands and swiftly link by link he pieced together a complete chain  almost as swiftly he decided upon the course of action which he must adopt so as to protect the queen of frances honour he was virtually the ruler of england master in these islands of an almost boundless power that power he would exert to the full this very night to thwart those enemies of his own and of the queens who worked so subtly in concert many would be wronged much harm would be done the liberties of some thousands of freeborn englishmen would be trampled underfoot what did it matter it was necessary that his grace of buckingham should cover up an indiscretion  set ink and paper yonder he bade his gaping valet then go call m gerbier rouse lacy and thom and send them to me at once and leave word that i shall require a score of couriers to be in the saddle and ready to set out in half an hour  bewildered the valet went off upon his errand the duke sat down to write and next morning english merchants learnt that the ports of england were closed by the kings express commanddelivered by his minister the duke of buckinghamthat measures were being takenwere already taken in all southern portsso that no vessel of any kind should leave the island until the kings further pleasure were made known startled the people wondered was this enactment the forerunner of war had they known the truth they might have been more startled still though in a different manner as swiftly as couriers could traveland certainly well ahead of any messenger seeking escape overseasdid this blockade spread until the gates of england were tight locked against the outgoing of those diamond studs whirls meant the honour of the queen of france  and meanwhile a diamondcutter was replacing the purloined stones by others matching them so closely that no man should be able to say which were the originals and which the copies buckingham and gerbier between them guided the work soon it was accomplished and a vessel slipped down the thames allowed to pass by those who kept close watch to enforce the royal decree and made sail for calais which was beginning to manifest surprise at this entire cessation of traffic from england from that vessel landed gerbier and rode straight to paris carrying the queen of france the duplicate studs which were to replace those which she had sent to buckingham  twentyfour hours later the ports of england were unsealed and commerce was free and unhampered once more but it was twentyfour hours too late for richelieu and his agent the countess of carlisle his eminence deplored a fine chance lost through the excessive power that was wielded in england by the parvenu  yet that is not quite the end of the story buckinghams inflamed and reckless mind would stop at nothing now to achieve the object of his desiresgo to france and see the queen since the country was closed to him he would force a way into it the red way of war blood should flow ruin and misery desolate the land but in the end he would go to paris to negotiate a peace and that should be his opportunity other reasons there may have been but none so dominant none that could not have been removed by negotiation the pretexted casus belli was the matter of the protestants of la rochelle who were in rebellion against their king  to their aid sailed buckingham with an english expedition disaster and defeat awaited it its shattered remnant crept back in disgrace to england and the duke found himself more detested by the people than he had been alreadywhich is saying much he went off to seek comfort at the hands of the two persons who really loved himhis doting king and his splendid wife  but the defeat had neither lessened his resolve nor chastened his insolence he prepared a second expedition in the very teeth of a longsuffering nations hostility indifferent to the mutinies and mutterings about him what signified to him the will of a nation he desired to win to the woman whom he loved and to accomplish that he nothing recked that he should set europe in a blaze nothing recked what blood should be poured out what treasure dissipated  hatred of him by now was so widespread and vocal that his friends fearing that soon it would pass from words to deeds urged him to take precautions advised the wearing of a shirt of mail for greater safety  but he laughed sneeringly ever arrogant and scornful  it needs not there are no roman spirits left was his contemptuous answer  he was mistaken one morning after breakfast as he was leaving the house in the high street portsmouth where he lodged whilst superintending the final preparations for that unpopular expedition john felton a selfappointed instrument of national vengeance drove a knife to the hilt into the dukes breast  may the lord have mercy on your soul was the pious exclamation with which the slayer struck home and in all the circumstances there seems to have been occasion for the prayer       ix the path of exile  the fall of lord clarendon    tightwrapped in his cloak against the icy whips of the black winters night a portly gentleman well advanced in years picked his way carefully down the wet slippery steps of the jetty by the light of a lanthorn whose rays gleamed lividly on crushed brown seaweed and trailing green sea slime leaning heavily upon the arm which a sailor held out to his assistance he stepped into the waiting boat that rose and fell on the heaving black waters a boathook scraped against the stones and the frail craft was pushed off  the oars dipped and the boat slipped away through the darkness steering a course for the two great poop lanterns that were swinging rhythmically high up against the black background of the night the elderly gentleman huddled now in the sternsheets looked behind himto look his last upon the england he had loved and served and ruled the lanthorn shedding its wheel of yellow light upon the jetty steps was all of it that he could now see  he sighed and settled down again to face the poop lights dancing there above the invisible hull of the ship that was to carry edward hyde earl of clarendon lately lord chancellor of england into exile as a dying man looks down the foreshortened vista of his active life so may edward hydewhose career had reached a finality but one degree removed from the finality of deathhave reviewed in that moment those thirty years of sincere endeavour and high achievement since he had been a law student in the temple when charles i was king  that king he had served faithfully so faithfully that when the desperate fortunes of the royalist party made it necessary to place the prince of wales beyond the reach of cromwell it was in sir edward hydes care that the boy was sent upon his travels the present was not to be hydes first experience of exile he had known it and of a bitter sort in those impecunious days when the second charles whose steps he guided was a needy homeless outcast a man less staunch and loyal might have thrown over so profitless a service he had talents that would have commanded a price in the roundhead market yet staunchly adhering to the stuart fortunes labouring ceaselessly and shrewdly in the stuart interest employing his great ability and statecraft he achieved at long length the restoration of the stuarts to the throne of england and for all those loyal selfdenying labours in exile on the stuart behalf all the reward he had at the time was that james stuart duke of york debauched his daughter  nor did hydes labours cease when he had made possible the restoration it was hyde who when that restoration was accomplished took in hand and carried out the difficult task of welding together the old and the new conditions of political affairs and it was hyde who was the scapegoat when things did not run the course that englishmen desired as the head of the administration he was held responsible even for those acts which he had strongly but vainly reprobated in council it was hyde who was blamed when charles sold dunkirk to the french and spent the money in harlotry it was hyde who was blamed because the queen was childless  the reason for this last lay in the fact that the wrong done to hydes daughter anne had now been righted by marriage with the duke of york now the duke of york was the heirapparent and the people ever ready to attach most credit to that which is most incredible and fantastic believed that to ensure the succession of his own grandchildren hyde had deliberately provided charles with a barren wife  when the dutch sailing up the thames had burnt the ships of war at chatham and londoners heard the thunder of enemy guns hyde was openly denounced as a traitor by a people stricken with terror and seeking a victim in the blind unreasoning way of public feeling they broke his windows ravaged his garden and erected a gibbet before the gates of his superb mansion on the north side of piccadilly  edward hyde earl of clarendon and lord chancellor of england commanded the love of his intimates but did not possess those qualities of cheap glitter that make for popularity with the masses nor did he court popularity elsewhere because he was austere in his morals grave and sober in his conduct he was hated by those who made up the debauched court of his prince because he was deeply religious in his principles the puritans mistrusted him for a bigot because he was autocratic in his policy he was detested by the commons the day of autocracy being done  yet might he have weathered the general hostility had charles been half as loyal to him as he had ever been loyal to charles for a time it is true the king stood his friend and might so have continued to the end had not the women become mixed up in the business as evelyn the diarist puts it this great mans fall was the work of the buffoones and ladys of pleasure  it really is a very tangled storythis inner history of the fall of clarendon with which the schoolbooks are not concerned in a sense it is also the story of the kings marriage and of catherine of braganza his unfortunate little ugly queen who must have suffered as much as any woman wedded to a sultan in any country where the seraglio is not a natural and proper institution  if clarendon could not be said to have brought about the marriage at least he had given it his suffrages when proposed by portugal which was anxious to establish an alliance with england as some protection against the predatory designs of spain he had been influenced by the dowry offeredfive hundred thousand pounds in money tangier which would give england a commanding position on the mediterranean and the island of bombay without yet foreseeing that the possession of bombay and the freedom to trade in the east indieswhich portugal had hitherto kept jealously to herselfwere to enable england to build up her great indian empire yet the commercial advantages alone were obvious enough to make the match desirable  catherine of braganza sailed for england and on the lath of may 1662 charles attended by a splendid following went to meet his bride at portsmouth he was himself a very personable man tallhe stood a full six feet highlean and elegantly vigorous the ugliness of his drawn harshfeatured face was mitigated by the glory of full lowridded dark eyes and his smile could be irresistibly captivating he was as graceful in manner as in person felicitous of speech and of an indolent good temper that found expression in a charming urbanity  good temper and urbanity alike suffered rudely when he beheld the wife they brought him catherine who was in her twentyfifth year was of an absurdly low stature so long in the body and short in the legs that dressed as she was in an outlandish fullskirted farthingale she had the appearance of being on her knees when she stood before him her complexion was sallow and though her eyes like his own were fine they were not fine enough to redeem the dull plainness of her face her black hair was grotesquely dressed with a long foretop and two great ribbon bows standing out one on each side of her head like a pair of miniature wings  it is little wonder that the merry monarch the fastidious voluptuary with his nice discernment in women should have checked in his long stride and halted a moment in consternation  lord was his wry comment to etheredge who was beside him theyve brought me a bat not a woman  but if she lacked beauty she was well cowered and charles was in desperate need of money  i suppose he told clarendon anon i must swallow this black draught to get the jam that goes with it  the chancellors grave eyes considered him almost sternly what time he coldly recited the advantages of this marriage if he did riot presume to rebuke the ribaldry of his master neither would he condescend to smile at it he was too honest ever to be a sycophant  catherine was immediately attendedin the words of grammontby six frights who called themselves maidsofhonour and a governess who was a monster with this retinue she repaired to hampton court where the honeymoon was spent and where for a brief season the poor womanentirely enamoured of the graceful longlegged rake she had marriedlived in a fools paradise  disillusion was to follow soon enough she might be by he grace of her dowry queen of england but she was soon to discover that to king charles she was no more than a wife de jure with wives de facto charles would people his seraglio as fancy moved him and the present wife defacto the mistress of his heart the first lady of his harem was that beautiful termagant barbara villiers wife of the accommodating roger palmer earl of castlemaine  there was no lackthere never is in such casesof those who out of concern and love for the happily deluded wife lifted the veil for her and made her aware of the facts of his majestys association with my lady castlemainean association dating back to the time when he was still a homeless wanderer the knowledge would appear to have troubled the poor soul profoundly but the climax of her distress was reached when on her coming to whitehall she found at the head of the list of ladiesinwaiting assigned to her the name of my lady castlemaine the forlorn little womans pride rose up before this outrage she struck out that offending name and gave orders that the favourite was not to be admitted to her presence  but she reckoned without charles for all his urbane goodtempered debonair ways there was an ugly cynical streak in his nature manifested now in the manner in which he dealt with this situation himself he led his boldly handsome favourite by the hand into his wifes presence before the whole court assembled and himself presented her to catherine what time that court dissolute and profligate as it was looked on in amazement at so outrageous a slight to the dignity of a queen  what followed may well have exceeded all expectations catherine stiffened as if the blow dealt her had been physical gradually her face paled until it was grey and drawn tears of outraged pride and mortification flooded her eyes and then as if something snapped within her brain under this stress of bitter emotion blood gushed from her nostrils and she sank back in a swoon into the arms of her portuguese ladies  confusion followed and under cover of it charles and his light of love withdrew realizing that if he lingered not all his easy skill in handling delicate situations could avail him to save his royal dignity  naturally the experiment was not to be repeated but since it was his wish that the countess of castlemaine should be established as one of the queens ladiesor rather since it was her ladyships wish and since charles was as wax in her ladyships handsit became necessary to have the queen instructed in what was in her husbands view fitting for this task he selected clarendon but the chancellor who had so long and loyally played mentor to charless telemachus sought now to guide him in matters moral as he had hitherto guided him in matters political  clarendon declined the office of mediator and even expostulated with charles upon the unseemliness of the course upon which his majesty was bent  surely sire it is for her majesty to say who shall and who shall not be the ladies of her bedchamber and i nothing marvel at her decision in this instance  yet i tell you my lord that it is a decision that shall be revoked  by whom sire the chancellor asked him gravely  by her majesty of course  under coercion of which you ask me to be the instrument said clarendon in the tutorly manner he had used with the king from the latters boyhood yourself sire at a time when your own wishes did not warp your judgment have condemned the very thing that now you are urging yourself sire hotly blamed your cousin king louis for thrusting mademoiselle de valliere upon his queen you will not have forgotten the things you said then of king louis  charles remembered those unflattering criticisms which he was now invited to apply to his own case he bit his lip admitting himself in check  but anonno doubt in obedience to the overbearing suasion of my lady castlemainehe returned to the attack and sent the chancellor his orders in a letter demanding unquestioning obedience  use your best endeavours wrote charles to facilitate what i am sure my honour is so much concerned in and whosoever i find to be my lady castlemaines enemy in this matter i do promise upon my word to be his enemy so long as i live  my lord clarendon had few illusions on the score of mankind he knew his world from froth to dregshaving studied it under a variety of conditions yet that letter from his king was a bitter draught all that charles possessed and was he owed to clarendon yet in such a contest as this charles did not hesitate to pen that bitter threatening line whosoever i find to be my lady castlemaines enemy in this matter i do promise upon my word to be his enemy so long as i live  all that clarendon had done in the past was to count for nothing unless he also did the unworthy thing that charles now demanded all that he had accomplished in the service of his king was to be swept into oblivion by the breath of a spiteful wanton  clarendon swallowed the draught and sought the queen upon that odious embassy with whose ends he was so entirely out of sympathy he used arguments whose hollowness was not more obvious to the queen than to himself  that industrious and entertaining chronicler of trifles mr pepys tells us scandalized in his diary that on the following day the talk of the court was all upon a midnight scene between the royal couple in the privacy of their own apartments so stormy that the sounds of it were plainly to be heard in the neighbouring chambers  you conceive the poor little woman smarting under the insult of charless proposal by the mouth of clarendon assailing her royal husband and fiercely upbraiding him with his lack not merely of affection but even of the respect that was her absolute due and charles his purpose set urged to it by the handsome termagant whom he dared not refuse stirred out of his indolent goodnature turning upon her storming back and finally threatening her with the greater disgrace of seeing herself pack ed home to portugal unless she would submit to the lesser disgrace he thrust upon her here  whether by these or by other arguments he made his will prevail prevail it did catherine of braganza swallowed her pride and submitted and a very complete submission it was lady castlemaine was not only installed as a lady of the bedchamber but very soon we find the queen treating her with a friendliness that provoked comment and amazement  the favourites triumph was complete and marked by an increasing insolence most marked in her demeanour towards the chancellor of whose views on the subject as expressed to the king she was aware consequently she hated him with all the spiteful bitterness that is inseparable from the nature of such women and she hated him the more because wrapped in his cold contempt he moved in utter unconcern of her hostility in this hatred she certainly did not lack for allies members of that licentious court whose hostility towards the austere chancellor was begotten of his own scorn of them among them they worked to pull him down  the attempt to undermine his influence with the king proving vainfor charles was as well aware of its inspiration as of the chancellors value to himthat crew of rakes went laboriously and insidiously to work upon the public mind which is to say the public ignorancemost fruitful soil for scandal against the great who shall say how far my lady and the court were responsible for the lampoon affixed one day to my lord clarendons gatepost                      three sights to be seen              dunkirk tangier and a barren queen  her ladyship might well have considered the unpopularity of the chancellor as the crown of her triumph had this triumph been as stable as she could have wished but charles being what he was it follows that her ladyship had frequent if transient anxious jealousies to mar the perfection of her existence to remind her how insecure is the tenure of positions such as hers ever at the mercy of the very caprice to existence  and then at long length there came a day of horrid dread for her a day when she found herself bereft of her influence with her royal lover when pleadings and railings failed alike to sway him in part she owed it to an indiscretion of her own but in far greater measure to a child of sixteen of a goldenheaded fresh youthful loveliness and a nature that still found pleasure in dolls and kindred childish things yet of a quick and lively wit and a clear intelligent mind untroubled either by the assiduity of the royal attentions or the fact that she was become the toast of the day  this was miss frances stewart the daughter of lord blantyre newly come to court as a ladyinwaiting to her majesty how profound an impression her beauty made upon the admittedly impressionable old pepys you may study in his diary he had a glimpse of her one day riding in the park with the king and a troop of ladies among whom my lady castlemaine looking as he tells us mighty out of humour there was a moment when miss stewart came very near to becoming queen of england and although she never reached that eminence yet her effigy not only found its way into the coinage but abides there to this day more perdurable than that of any actual queen in the figure of britannia for which she was the model  charles wooed her openly it was never his way to study appearances in these matters he was so assiduous that it became customary in that winter of 1666 for those seeking the king at whitehall to inquire whether he were above or belowbelow meaning miss stewarts apartments on the groundfloor of the palace in which apartments his majesty was a constant visitor and since where the king goes the court follows and where the king smiles there the court fawns it resulted that this child now found herself queering it over a court that flocked to her apartments gallants and ladies came there to flirt and to gossip to gamble and to pay homage  about a great table in her splendid salon a company of rustling iridescent fops in satin and heavy periwigs and of ladies with curled headdresses and bare shoulders played at basset one night in january conversation rippled breaking here and there into laughter white jewelled hands reached out for cards or for a share of the heaps of gold that swept this way and that with the varying fortunes of the game  my lady castlemaine seated between etheredge and rochester played in silence with lips tightset and brooding eyes she had lost it is true some l1500 that night yet a prodigal gamester and one who came easily by money she had been known to lose ten times that sum and yet preserve her smile the source of her illhumour was not the game she played recklessly her attention wandering those handsome brooding eyes of hers were intent upon watching what went on at the other end of the long room there at a smaller table sat miss stewart half a dozen gallants hovering near her engaged upon a game of cards of a vastly different sort miss stewart did not gamble the only purpose she could find for cards was to build castles and here she was building one with the assistance of her gallants and under the superintendence of his grace of buckingham who was as skilled in this as in other equally unstable forms of architecture  apart over by the fire in a great chair of gilt leather lounged the king languidly observing this smaller party a faint indolent smile on his swarthy saturnine countenance absently with one hand he stroked a little spaniel that was curled in his lap a black boy in a gorgeous plumed turban and a long crimson surcoat arabesqued in goldthere were three or four such attendants about the roomproffered him a cup of posses on a golden salver  the king rose thrust aside the little blackamoor and with his spaniel under his arm sauntered across to miss stewarts table soon he found himself alone with herthe others having removed themselves on his approach as jackals fall back before the coming of the lion the last to go and with signs of obvious reluctance was his grace of richmond a delicatelybuilt uncomely but very glittering gentleman  charles faced her across the table the tall house of cards standing between them  miss invited his majestys admiration for my lord of buckinghams architecture pouf his majesty blew and the edifice rustled down to a mere heap of cards again  symbol of kingly power said miss pertly you demolish better than you build sire  oddsfish if you challenge me it were easy to prove you wrong quoth he  pray do the cards are here  cards pooh card castles are well enough for buckingham but such is not the castle ill build you if you command me  i command the kings majesty mon dieu but it would be treason surely  not greater treason than to have enslaved me his fine eyes were oddly ardent shall i build you this castle child  miss looked at him and looked away her eyelids fluttered distractingly she fetched a sigh  the castle that your majesty would build for any but your queen must prove a prison  she rose and looking across the room she met the handsome scowling eyes of the neglected favourite my lady castlemaine looks as if she feared that fortune were not favouring her she was so artless that charles could not be sure there was a double meaning to her speech shall we go see how she is faring she added with a disregard for etiquette whose artlessness he also doubted  he yielded of course that was his way with beauty especially with beauty not yet reduced into possession but the characteristic urbanity with which he sauntered beside her across the room was no more than a mask upon his chagrin it was always thus that pretty frances stewart used him she always knew how to elude him and always with that cursed air of artlessness uttered seemingly simple sentences that clung to his mind to tantalize him  the castle your majesty would build for any but your queen must prove a prison what had she meant by that must he take her to queen before she would allow him to build a castle for her  it was an insistent haunting thought wracking his mind he knew there was a party hostile to the duke of york and clarendon which fearing the succession of the former and so of the grandchildren of the latter as a result of catherine of braganzas childlessness strongly favoured the kings divorce  it was a singular irony that my lady castlemaine should be largely responsible for the existence of that party in her hatred for clarendon and her blind search for weapons that would slay the chancellor she had if not actually invented at least helped to give currency to the silly slander that clarendon had deliberately chosen for charles a barren queen so as to ensure the ultimate succession of his own daughters children but she had never thought to see that slander recoil upon her as it now did she had never thought that a party would come to rise up in consequence that would urge divorce upon the king at the very moment when he was consumed by passion for the unattainable artlessly artful frances stewart  it was buckingham greatly daring who slyly made himself that partys mouthpiece the suggestion startled charles voicing as perhaps it did the temptation by which he was secretly assailed he looked at buckingham frowning  i verily believe you are the wickedest dog in england  the impudent gallant made a leg for a subject sire i believe i am  charleswith whom the amusing word seems ever to have been more compelling than the seriouslaughed his soft mellow laugh then he sighed and the frown of thought returned  it would be a wicked thing to make a poor lady miserable only because she is my wife and has no children by me which is no fault of hers  he was a thoroughly bad husband but his indolent goodnature shrank from purchasing his desires at the price of so much ignominy to the queen before that could come to pass it would be necessary to give the screw of temptation another turn or two and it was miss stewart herself whoin all innocencesupplied what was required in that direction driven to bay by the importunities of charles she announced at last that it was her intention to retire from court so as to preserve herself from the temptations by which she was beset and to determine the uneasiness which through no fault of her own her presence was occasioning the queen and she announced further that so desperate had she been rendered that she would marry any gentleman of fifteen hundred pounds a year who would have her in honour  you behold charles reduced to a state of panic he sought to bribe her with offers of any settlements she chose to name or any title she coveted offering her these things at the nations expense as freely and lightly as the jewels he had tossed into her lap or the collar of pearls worth sixteen hundred pounds he had put about her neck the offers were ineffectual and charles driven almost to distraction by such invulnerable virtue might now have yielded to the insidious whispers of divorce and remarriage had not my lady castlemaine taken a hand in the game  her ladyship dwelling already as a consequence of that royal infatuation for miss stewart in the cold rarefied atmosphere of a neglect that amounted almost to disgrace may have considered with bitterness how her attempt to exploit her hatred of the chancellor had recoiled upon herself  in the blackest hour of her despair when hope seemed almost dead she made a discoveryor rather the kings page the ineffable chiffinch lord keeper of the back stairs and grandeunuch of the royal seraglio who was her ladyships friend made it and communicated it to her there had been one ardent respondent in the duke of richmond to that proclamation of miss stewarts that she would marry any gentleman of fifteen hundred pounds a year long enamoured of her his grace saw here his opportunity and he seized it consequently he was now in constant attendance upon her but very secretly since he feared the kings displeasure  my lady castlemaine having discovered this and being well served in the matter by chiffinch spied her opportunity it came one cold night towards the end of february of that year 1667 charles going below at a late hour to visit miss stewart when he judged that she would be alone was informed by her maid that miss was not receiving a headache compelling her to keep her room  his majesty returned above in a very illhumour to find himself confronted in his own apartments by my lady castlemaine chiffinch had introduced her by the backstairs entrance charles stiffened at sight of her  i hope i may be allowed to pay my homage says she on a note of irony although the angelic stewart has forbid you to see me at my own house i come to condole with you upon the affliction and grief into which the newfashioned chastity of the inhuman stewart has reduced your majesty  you are pleased to be amused maam says charles frostily  i will not she returned him make use of reproaches which would disgrace myself still less will i endeavour to excuse frailties in myself which nothing can justify since your constancy for me deprives me of all defence her ladyship you see had a considerable gift of sarcasm  in that case may i ask you why you have come  to open your eyes because i cannot bear that you should be made the jest of your own court  madam  ah you didnt know of course that you are being laughed at for the gross manner in which you are being imposed upon by the stewarts affectations any more than you know that whilst you are denied admittance to her apartments under the presence of some indisposition the duke of richmond is with her now  that is false he was beginning very indignantly  i do not desire you to take my word for it if you will follow me you will no longer be the dupe of a false prude who makes you act so ridiculous a part  she took him still halfresisting by the hand and in silence led him despite his reluctance back by the way he had so lately come outside her rivals door she left him but she paused at the end of the gallery to make sure that he had entered  within he found himself confronted by several of miss stewarts chambermaids who respectfully barred his way one of them informing him scarcely above a whisper that her mistress had been very ill since his majesty left but that being gone to bed she was god be thanked in a very fine sleep  that i must see said the king and since one of the women placed herself before the door of the inner room his majesty unceremoniously took her by the shoulders and put her aside  he thrust open the door and stepped without further ceremony into the welllighted bedroom miss stewart occupied the handsome canopied bed but far from being as he had been told in a very fine sleep she was sitting up and far from presenting an ailing appearance she looked radiantly well and very lovely in her diaphanous sleeping toilet with golden ringlets in distracting disarray nor was she alone by her pillow sat one who if at first to be presumed her physician proved upon scrutiny to be the duke of richmond  the kings swarthy face turned a variety of colours his languid eyes lost all trace of languor those who knew his nature might have expected that he would now deliver himself with that sneering sarcasm that indolent cynicism which he used upon occasion but he was too deeply stirred for acting his selfcontrol deserted him entirely exactly what he said has not been preserved for us all that we are told is that he signified his resentment in such terms as he had never before used and that his grace almost petrified by the kings most royal rage uttered never a word in answer the windows of the room overlooked the thames the kings eyes strayed towards them richmond was slight of build charles vigorous and athletic his grace took the door betimes lest the window should occur to his majesty and so he left the lady alone with the outraged monarch  thereafter charles did not have it all quite his own way miss stewart faced him in an indignation nothing less than his own and she was very far from attempting any such justification of herself or her conduct as he may have expected  will your majesty be more precise as to the grounds of your complaint she invited him challengingly  that checked his wildness it brought him up with a round turn his jaw fell and he stared at her lost now for words of this she took the fullest advantage  if i am not allowed to receive visits from a man of the duke of richmonds rank who comes with honourable intentions then i am a slave in a free country i know of no engagement that should prevent me from disposing of my hand as i think fit but if this is not permitted me in your majestys dominions i do not believe there is any power on earth can prevent me going back to france and throwing myself into a convent there to enjoy the peace denied me at this court  with that she melted into tears and his discomfiture was complete on his knees he begged her forgiveness for the injury he had done her but miss was not in a forgiving humour  if your majesty would graciously consent to leave me now in peace said she you would avoid offending by a longer visit those who accompanied or conducted you to my apartments  she had drawn a bow at a venture but shrewdly and the shaft went home charles rose red in the face swearing he would never speak to her again he stalked out  later however he considered if he felt bitterly aggrieved he must also have realized that he had no just grounds for this and that in his conduct in miss stewarts room he had been entirely ridiculous she was rightly resolved against being lightly worn by any man if anything the reflection must have fanned his passion it was impossible he thought that she should love that knockkneed fellow richmond who had no graces either of body or of mind and if she suffered the mans suit it must be as she had all but said so that she might be delivered from the persecution to which his majesty had submitted her the thought of her marrying richmond or indeed anybody was unbearable to charles and it may have stifled his last scruple in the matter of the divorce  his first measure next morning was to banish richmond from the court but richmond had not stayed for the order to quit the kings messenger found him gone already  then charles took counsel in the matter with the chancellor clarendons habitual gravity was increased to sternness he spoke to the kingtaking the fullest advantage of the tutelary position in which for the last twentyfive years he had stood to himmuch as he had spoken when charles had proposed to make barbara palmer a lady of the queens bedchamber saving that he was now even more uncompromising the king was not pleased with him but just as he had had his way despite the chancellor in that other matter so he would have his way despite him now this time however the chancellor took no risks he feared too much the consequences for charles and he determined to spare no effort to avoid a scandal and to save the already deeplyinjured queen so he went secretly to work to outwit the king he made himself the protector of those lovers the duke of richmond and miss stewart with the result that one dark night a week or two later the lady stole away from the palace of whitehall and made her way to the bear tavern at the bridgefoot westminster where richmond awaited her with a coach and so by the secret favour of the lord chancellor they stole away to kent and matrimony  that was checkmate indeed to charles who swore all manner of things in his mortification but it was not until some six weeks later that he learnt by whose agency the thing had been accomplished he learnt it not a doubt from my lady castlemaine  the estrangement between her ladyship and the king which dated back to the time of his desperate courtship of miss stewart was at last made up and once again we see her ladyship triumphant and firmly established in the amorous kings affections she had cause to be grateful to the chancellor for this but her vindictive nature remembered only the earlier injury still unavenged here at last was her chance to pay off that score clarendon beset by enemies on every hand yet trusting in the king whom he had served so well stood his ground unintimidated and unmovedan oak that had weathered mightier storms than this he did not dream that he was in the power of an evil woman and that woman used her power when all else failed she told the king of clarendons part in the flight of miss stewart and lest the king should be disposed to pardon the chancellor out of consideration for his motives represented him as a selfseeker and charged him with having acted thus so as to make sure of keeping his daughters children by the duke of york in the succession  that was the end charles withdrew his protection threw clarendon to the wolves he sent the duke of albemarle to him with a command that he should surrender his seals of office the proud old man refused to yield his seals to any but the king himself he may have hoped that the memory of all that lay between them would rise up once more when they were face to face so he came in person to whitehall to make surrender he walked deliberately firmly and with head erect through the hostile throng of courtiersespecially the buffoones and ladys of pleasure as evelyn says  of his departure thence his disgrace now consummated pepys has left us a vivid picture  when he went from the king on monday morning my lady castlemaine was in bed though about twelve oclock and ran out in her smock into her aviary looking into whitehall gardens and thither her woman brought her her nightgown and she stood blessing herself at the old mans going away and several of the gallants of whitehallof which there were many staying to see the chancellors returndid talk to her in her birdcage among others blandford telling her she was the bird of passage  clarendon lingered melancholy and disillusioned at his fine house in piccadilly until impeached by parliament he remembered straffords fate and set out to tread once more and for the remainder of his days the path of exile  time avenged him two of his granddaughtersmary and annereigned successively as queens in england      x the tragedy of herrenhausen  count philip k√∂nigsmark and the princess sophia dorothea    he was accounted something of a scamp throughout europe and particularly in england where he had been associated with his brother in the killing of mr thynne but the seventeenth century did not look for excessively nice scruples in a soldier of fortune and so it condoned the lack of virtue in count philip christof k√∂nigsmark for the sake of his personal beauty his elegance his ready wit and his magnificent address the court of hanover made him warmly welcome counting itself the richer for his presence whilst he on his side was retained there by the colonelcy in the electoral guard to which he had been appointed and by his deep and illstarred affection for the princess sophia dorothea the wife of the electoral prince who later was to reign in england as king george i  his acquaintance with her dated back to childhood for they had been playmates at her fathers ducal court of zell where k√∂nigsmark had been brought up with adolescence he had gone out into the world to seek the broader education which it offered to men of quality and spirit he had fought bulls in madrid and the infidel overseas he had wooed adventure wherever it was to be met until romance hung about him like an aura thus sophia met him again a dazzling personality whose effulgence shone the more brightly against the dull background of that gross hanoverian court an accomplished graceful selfreliant man of the world in whom she scarcely recognized her sometime playmate  the change he found in her was no less marked though of a different kind the sweet child he had knownshe had been married in 1682 at the age of sixteenhad come in her ten years of wedded life to the fulfilment of the handsome promise of her maidenhood but her beauty was spiritualized by a certain wistfulness that had not been there before that should not have been there now had all been well the sprightliness inherent in her had not abated but it had assumed a certain warp of bitterness humour which is of the heart had given place in her to wit which is of the mind and this wit was barbed and a little reckless of how or where it offended  k√∂nigsmark observed these changes that the years had wrought and knew enough of her story to account for them he knew of her thwarted love for her cousin the duke of wolfenbuttel thwarted for the sake of dynastic ambition to the end that by marrying her to the electoral prince george the whole of the duchy of luneberg might be united thus for political reasons she had been thrust into a union that was mutually loveless for prince george had as little affection to bring to it as herself yet for a prince the door to compensations is ever open prince georges taste as is notorious was ever for ugly women and this taste he indulged so freely openly and grossly that the coldness towards him with which sophia had entered the alliance was eventually converted into disgust and contempt  thus matters stood between that illmatched couple contempt on her side cold dislike on his a dislike that was fully shared by his father the elector ernest augustus and encouraged in the latter by the countess von platen  madame von platen the wife of the electors chief minister of state waswith the connivance of her despicable husband who saw therein the means to his own advancementthe acknowledged mistress of ernest augustus she was a fleshly gauche vain and illfavoured woman malevolence sat in the creases of her painted face and peered from her mean eyes yet such as she was the elector ernest loved her his sons taste for ugly women would appear to have been hereditary  between the countess and sophia there was a deadly feud the princess had mortally offended her fatherinlaws favourite not only had she never troubled to dissemble the loathing which that detestable woman inspired in her but she had actually given it such free and stinging expression as had provoked against madame von platen the derision of the court a derision so illconcealed that echoes of it had reached its object and made her aware of the source from whence it sprang  it was into this atmosphere of hostility that the advent of the elegant romantic k√∂nigsmark took place he found the stage set for comedy of a grim and bitter kind which he was himself by his recklessness to convert into tragedy  it began by the countess von platens falling in love with him it was some time before he suspected it though heaven knows he did not lack for selfesteem perhaps it was this very selfesteem that blinded him here to the appalling truth yet in the end understanding came to him when the precise significance of the fond leer of that painted harridans repellent coquetry was borne in upon him he felt the skin of his body creep and roughen but he dissembled craftily he was a venal scamp after all and in the court of hanover he saw opportunities to employ his gifts and his knowledge of the great world in such a way as to win to eminence he saw that the electors favourite could be of use to him and it is not your adventurers way to look too closely into the nature of the ladder by which he has the chance to climb  skilfully craftily then he played the enamoured countess so long as her fondness for him might be useful her hostility detrimental but once the colonelcy of the electoral guards was firmly in his grasp and an intimate friendship had ripened between himself and prince charlesthe electors younger sonsufficiently to ensure his future he plucked off the mask and allied himself with sophia in her hostility towards madame von platen he did worse some little time thereafter whilst on a visit to the court of poland he made one night in his cups a droll story of the amorous persecution which he had suffered at madame von platens hands  it was a tale that set the profligate company in a roar but there was one present who afterwards sent a report of it to the countess and you conceive the nature of the emotions it aroused in her her rage was the greater for being stifled it was obviously impossible for her to appeal to her lover the elector to avenge her from the elector above all others must the matter be kept concealed but not on that account would she forgo the vengeance due she would present a reckoning in full ere all was done and bitterly should the presumptuous young adventurer who had flouted her be made to pay  the opportunity was very soon to be afforded her it arose more or less directly out of an act in which she indulged her spite against sophia this lay in throwing melusina schulemberg into the arms of the electoral prince melusina who was years afterwards to be created duchess of kendal had not yet attained to that completeness of lank bony hideousness that was later to distinguish her in england but even in youth she could boast of little attraction prince george however was easily attracted a dull undignified libertine addicted to overeating heavy drinking and low conversation he found in melusina von schulemberg an ideal mate her installation as ma√Ætresse entitre took place publicly at a ball given by prince george at herrenhausen a ball at which the princess sophia was present  accustomed inured as she was to the coarse profligacy of her dullard husband and indifferent to his philandering as her contempt of him now left her yet in the affront thus publicly offered her she felt that the limit of endurance had been reached next day it was found that she had disappeared from herrenhausen she had fled to her fathers court at zell  but her father received her coldly lectured her upon the freedom and levity of her manners which he condemned as unbecoming the dignity of her rank recommended her to use in future greater prudence and a proper wifely submission and the homily delivered packed her back to her husband at herrenhausen  georges reception of her on her return was bitterly hostile she had been guilty of a more than usual of an unpardonable want of respect for him she must learn what was due to her station and to her husband he would thank her to instruct herself in these matters against his return from berlin whither he was about to journey and he warned her that he would suffer no more tantrums of that kind  thus he delivered himself with cold hate in his white flabby frogface and in the very poise of his squat ungainly figure  thereafter he departed for berlin bearing hate of her with him and leaving hate and despair behind  it was then in this despair that sophia looked about her for a true friend to lend her the aid she so urgently required to rescue her from her intolerable souldestroying fate and at her elbow against this dreadful need destiny had placed her sometime playmate her most devoted friendas she accounted him and as indeed he wasthe elegant reckless k√∂nigsmark with his beautiful face his golden mane and his unfathomable blue eyes  walking with him one summer day between clipped hedges in the formal gardens of herrenhausenthat palace as squat and ungraceful as those who had built and who inhabited itshe opened her heart to him very fully allowed him in her overwhelming need of sympathy to see things which for very shame she had hitherto veiled from all other eyes she kept nothing back she dwelt upon her unhappiness with her boorish husband told him of slights and indignities innumerable whose pain she had hitherto so bravely dissembled confessed even that he had beaten her upon occasion  k√∂nigsmark went red and white by turns with the violent surge of his emotions and the deep sapphire eyes blazed with wrath when she came at last to the culminating horror of blows endured  it is enough madame he cried i swear to you as heaven hears me that he shall be punished  punished she echoed checking in her stride and looked at him with a smile of sad incredulity it is not his punishment i seek my friend but my own salvation  the one can be accomplished with the other he answered hotly and struck the cutsteel hilt of his sword you shall be rid of this lout as soon as ever i can come to him i go after him to berlin tonight  the colour all faded from her cheeks her sensitive lips fell apart as she looked at him aghast  why what would you do what do you mean she asked him  i will send him the length of my sword and so make a widow of you madame  she shook her head princes do not fight she said on a note of contempt  i shall so shame him that he will have no alternativeunless indeed he is shameless i will choose my occasion shrewdly put an affront on him one evening in his cups when drink shall have made him valiant enough to commit himself to a meeting if even that will not answer and he still shields himself behind his rankwhy there are other ways to serve him he was thinking perhaps of mr thynne  the heat of so much reckless romantic fury on her behalf warmed the poor lady who had so long been chilled for want of sympathy and starved of love impulsively she caught his hand in hers  my friend my friend she cried on a note that quivered and broke you are madwonderfully beautifully mad but mad what would become of you if you did this  he swept the consideration aside by a contemptuous almost angry gesture does that matter i am concerned with what is to become of you i was born for your service my princess and the service being rendered he shrugged and smiled threw out his hands and let them fall again to his sides in an eloquent gesture he was the complete courtier the knighterrant the romantic preuxchevalier all in one  she drew closer to him took the blue lapels of his military coat in her white hands and looked pathetically up into his beautiful face if ever she wanted to kiss a man she surely wanted to kiss k√∂nigsmark in that moment but as she might have kissed a loving brother in token of her deep gratitude for his devotion to her who had known so little true devotion  if you knew she said what balsam this proof of your friendship has poured upon the wounds of my soul you would understand my utter lack of words in which to thank you you dumbfound me my friend i can find no expression for my gratitude  i ask no gratitude quoth he i am all gratitude myself that you should have come to me in the hour of your need i but ask your leave to serve you in my own way  she shook her head she saw his blue eyes grow troubled  he was about to speak to protest but she hurried on serve me if you willgod knows i need the service of a loyal friendbut serve me as i shall myself decideno other way  but what alternative service can exist he asked almost impatiently  i have it in mind to escape from this horrible placeto quit hanover never to return  but to go whither  does it matter anywhere away from this hateful court and this hateful life anywhere since my father will not let me find shelter at zell as i had hoped had it not been for the thought of my children i should have fled long ago for the sake of those two little ones i have suffered patiently through all these years but the limit of endurance has been reached and passed take me away k√∂nigsmark she was clutching his lapels again if you would really serve me help me to escape  his hands descended upon hers and held them prisoned against his breast a flush crept into his fair cheeks there was a sudden kindling of the eyes that looked down into her own piteous ones these sensitive romantic natures are quickly stirred to passion ever ready to yield to the adventure of it  my princess he said you may count upon your k√∂nigsmark while he has life disengaging her hands from his lapels but still holding them he bowed low over them so low that his heavy golden mane tumbled forward on either side of his handsome head to form a screen under cover of which he pressed his lips upon her fingers  she let him have his will with her hands it was little enough reward for so much devotion  i thank you again she breathed and now i must thinki must consider where i can count upon finding refuge  that cooled his ardour a little his own high romantic notion was no doubt to fling her there and then upon the withers of his horse and so ride out into the wide world to carve a kingdom for her with his sword her sober words dispelled the dream revealed to him that it was not quite intended he should hereafter be her custodian and there for the moment the matter was suspended  both had behaved quite recklessly each should have remembered that an electoral princess is not wise to grant a protracted interview accompanied by lapelholding handholding and handkissings within sight of the windows of a palace and as it happened behind one of those windows lurked the countess von platen watching them jealously and without any disposition to construe the meeting innocently was she not the deadly enemy of both had not the princess whetted satire upon her and had not k√∂nigsmark scorned the love she proffered him and then unpardonably published it in a ribald story to excite the mirth of profligates  that evening the countess purposefully sought her lover the elector  your son is away in prussia quoth she who guards his honour in his absence  georges honour quoth the elector bulging eyes staring at the countess he did not laugh as might have been expected at the notion of guarding something whose existence was not easily discerned he had no sense of humour as his appearance suggested he was a short fat man with a face shaped like a pearnarrow in the brow and heavy in the jowl what the devil do you mean he asked  i mean that this foreign adventurer k√∂nigsmark and sophia grow too intimate  sophia thick eyebrows were raised until they almost met the line of his ponderous peruke his face broke into malevolent creases expressive of contempt  that whitefaced ninny bah her very virtue was matter for his scorn  it is these whitefaced ninnies can be most sly replied the countess out of her worldly wisdom listen a moment now and she related with interest rather than discount you may be sure what she had witnessed that afternoon  the malevolence deepened in his face he had never loved sophia and he felt none the kinder towards her for her recent trip to zell then too being a libertine and the father of a libertine it logically followed that unchastity in his womenfolk was in his eyes the unpardonable sin  he heaved himself out of his deep chair how far has this gone he demanded  prudence restrained the countess from any overstatement that might afterwards be disproved besides there was not the need if she could trust her senses patience and vigilance would presently afford her all the evidence required to damn the pair she said as much and promised the elector that she would exercise herself the latter quality in his sons service again the elector did not find it grotesque that his mistress should appoint herself the guardian of his sons honour  the countess went about that congenial task with zealthough georges honour was the least thing that concerned her what concerned her was the dishonour of sophia and the ruin of k√∂nigsmark so she watched assiduously and set others too to watch for her and to report and almost daily now she had for the elector a tale of whisperings and handpressings and secret stolen meetings between the guilty twain the elector enraged and would have taken action but that the guileful countess curbed him all this was not enough an accusation that could not be substantiated would ruin all chance of punishing the offenders might recoil indeed upon the accusers by bringing the duke of zell to his daughters aid so they must wait yet awhile until they held more absolute proof of this intrigue  and then at last one day the countess sped in haste to the elector with word that k√∂nigsmark and the princess had shut themselves up together in the garden pavilion let him come at once and he should so discover them for himself and thus at last be able to take action the countess was flushed with triumph be that meeting never so innocentand madame von platen could not being what she was and having seen what she had seen conceive it innocentit was in an electoral princess an unforgivable indiscretion to take the most charitable view which none would dream of taking so the elector fiercely red in the face hurried off to the pavilion with madame von platen following he came too late despite the diligence of his spy  sophia had been there but her interview with the count had been a brief one she had to tell him that at last she was resolved in all particulars she would seek a refuge at the court of her cousin the duke of wolfenbuttel who she was surefor the sake of what once had lain between themwould not now refuse to shelter and protect her of k√∂nigsmark she desired that he should act as her escort to her cousins court  k√∂nigsmark was ready eager in hanover he would leave nothing that he regretted at wolfenbuttelyy having served sophia faithfully his evergrowing romantic passion for her might find expression she would make all dispositions and advise him when she was ready to set out but they must use caution for they were being spied upon madame von platens overeagerness had in part betrayed her it was indeed their consciousness of espionage which had led to this dangerous meeting in the seclusion of the pavilion and which urged him to linger after sophia had left him they were not to be seen to emerge together  the young dane sat alone on the windowseat his chin in his hands his eyes dreamy a faint smile on his shapely lips when ernest augustus burst furiously in the countess von platen lingering just beyond the threshold the electors face was apoplectically purple from rage and haste his breath came in wheezing gasps his bulging eyes swept round the chamber and fastened finally glaring upon the startled k√∂nigsmark  where is the princess he blurted out  the count espied madame von platen in the back ground and had the scent of mischief very strong but he preserved an air of innocent mystification he rose and answered with courteous ease  your highness is seeking her shall i ascertain for you  at a loss ernest augustus stared a moment then flung a glance over his shoulder at the countess  i was told that her highness was here he said  plainly said k√∂nigsmark with perfect calm you have been misinformed and his quiet glance and gesture invited the elector to look round for himself  how long have you been here yourself feeling at a disadvantage the elector avoided the direct question that was in his mind  half an hour at least  and in that time you have not seen the princess  seen the princess k√∂nigsmarks brows were knit perplexedly i scarcely understand your highness  the elector moved a step and trod on a soft substance he looked down then stooped and rose again holding in his hand a womans glove  whats this quoth he whose glove is this  if k√∂nigsmarks heart missed a beatas well it may have donehe did not betray it outwardly he smiled indeed he almost laughed  your highness is amusing himself at my expense by asking me questions that only a seer could answer  the elector was still considering him with his ponderously suspicious glance when quick steps approached a servingmaid one of sophias women appeared in the doorway of the pavilion  what do you want the elector snapped at her  a glove her highness lately dropped here was the timid answer innocently precipitating the very discovery which the woman had been too hastily dispatched to avert  the elector flung the glove at her and there was a creak of evil laughter from him when she had departed he turned again to k√∂nigsmark  you fence skilfully said he sneering too skilfully for an honest man will you now tell me without any more of this precisely what the princess sophia was doing here with you  k√∂nigsmark drew himself stiffly up looking squarely into the furnace of the electors face  your highness assumes that the princess was here with me and a prince is not to be contradicted even when he insults a lady whose spotless purity is beyond his understanding but your highness can hardly expect me to become in never so slight a degree a party to that insult by vouchsafing any answer to your question  that is your last word sir the elector shook with suppressed anger  your highness cannot think that words are necessary  the bulging eyes grew narrow the heavy nether lip was thrust forth in scorn and menace  you are relieved sir of your duties in the electoral guard and as that is the only tie binding you to hanover we see no reason why your sojourn here should be protracted  k√∂nigsmark bowed stiffly formally it shall end your highness as soon as i can make the necessary arrangements for my departurein a week at most  you are accorded three days sir the elector turned and waddled out leaving k√∂nigsmark to breathe freely again the three days should suffice for the princess also it was very well  the elector too thought that it was very well he had given this troublesome fellow his dismissal averted a scandal and placed his daughterinlaw out of the reach of harm madame von platen was the only one concerned who thought that it was not well at all the consummation being far from that which she had desired she had dreamt of a flaming scandal that should utterly consume her two enemies sophia and k√∂nigsmark instead she saw them both escaping and the fact that she wasas she may have supposedeffectively separating two loving hearts could be no sort of adequate satisfaction for such bitter spite as hers therefore she plied her wicked wits to force an issue more germane to her desires  the course she took was fraught with a certain peril yet confident that at worst she could justify it and little fearing that the worst would happen she boldly went to work she forged next day a brief note in which the princess sophia urgently bade k√∂nigsmark to come to her at ten oclock that night in her own apartments and with threat and bribe induced the waiting woman of the glove to bear that letter  now it so happened that k√∂nigsmark through the kind offices of sophias maidofhonour mademoiselle de knesebeck who was in the secret of their intentions had sent the princess a note that morning briefly stating the urgency of departure and begging her so to arrange that she could leave herrenhausen with him on the morrow he imagined the note now brought him to be in answer to that appeal of his its genuineness he never doubted being unacquainted with sophias writing he was aghast at the rashness which dictated such an assignation yet never hesitated as to keeping it it was not his way to hesitate he trusted to the gods who watch over the destinies of the bold  and meanwhile madame von platen was reproaching her lover with having dealt too softly with the dane  bah said the elector tomorrow he goes his ways and we are rid of him is not that enough  enough if soon as he goes he goes not too late already quoth she  now what will you be hinting he asked her peevishly  ill be more plain i will tell you what i know it is this k√∂nigsmark has an assignation with the princess sophia this very night at ten oclockand where do you suppose in her highnesss own apartments  the elector came to his feet with an oath that is not true he cried it cannot be  then ill say no more quoth jezebel and snapped her thin lips  ah but you shall how do you know this  that i cannot tell you without betraying a confidence let it suffice you that i do know it consider now whether in banishing this profligate you have sufficiently avenged the honour of your son  my god if i thought this were true he choked with rage stood shaking a moment then strode to the door calling  the truth is easily ascertained said madame conceal yourself in the rittersaal and await his coming forth but you had best go attended for it is a very reckless rogue and he has been known aforetime to practice murder  whilst the elector acting upon this advice was getting his men together k√∂nigsmark was wasting precious moments in sophias antechamber whilst mademoiselle de knesebeck apprised her highness of his visit sophia had already retired to bed and the amazing announcement of the counts presence there startled her into a fear of untoward happenings she was overwhelmed too by the rashness of this step of his coming after the events of yesterday if it should be known that he had visited her thus terrible consequences might ensue she rose and with mademoiselle de knesebecks aid made ready to receive him yet for all that she made haste the precious irreclaimable moments sped  she came to him at last mademoiselle de knesebeck following for proprietys sake  what is it she asked him breathlessly what brings you here at such an hour  what brings me quoth he surprised at that reception why your commandsyour letter  my letter what letter  a sense of doom of being trapped suddenly awoke in him he plucked forth the treacherous note and proffered it  why what does this mean she swept a white hand over her eyes and brows as if to brush away some thing that obscured her vision that is not mine i never wrote it how could you dream i should be imprudent as to bid you hither and at such an hour how could you dream it  you are right said he and laughed perhaps to ease her alarm perhaps in sheer bitter mirth it will be no doubt the work of our friend madame von platen i had best begone for the rest my travelling chaise will wait from noon until sunset tomorrow by the markt kirck in hanover and i shall wait within it i shall hope to conduct you safely to wolfenbuttelyy  i will come i will come but go nowoh go  he looked very deeply into her eyesa valedictory glance against the worst befalling him then he took her hand bowed over it and kissed it and so departed  he crossed the outer anteroom descended the short flight of stairs and pushed open the heavy door of the hall of knights he passed through and thrust the door behind him then stood a moment looking round the vast apartment if he was too late to avoid the springs of the baited trap it was here that they should snap upon him yet all was still a single lamp on a table in the middle of the vast chamber shed a feeble flickering light yet sufficient to assure him that no one waited here he sighed relief wrapped his cloak about him and set out swiftly to cross the hall  but even as he passed four shadows detached themselves from the tall stove resolved themselves into armed men and sprang after him  he heard them wheeled about flung off his cloak and disengaged his sword all with the speed of lightning and the address of the man who for ten years had walked amid perils and learned to depend upon his blade that swift action sealed his doom their orders were to take him living or dead and standing in awe of his repute they were not the men to incur risks even as he came on guard a partisan grazed his head and another opened his breast  he went down coughing and gasping blood dabbling his bright golden hair and staining the priceless mechlin at his throat yet his right hand still desperately clutching his useless sword  his assassins stood about him their partisans levelled to strike again and summoned him to yield then beside one of them he suddenly beheld the countess von platen materializing out of the surrounding shadows as it seemed and behind her the squat ungraceful figure of the elector he fought for breath i am slain he gasped and as i am to appear before my maker i swear to you that the princess sophia is innocent spare her at least your highness  innocent said the elector hoarsely then what did you now in her apartments  it was a trap set for us by this foul hag who  the heel of the vindictive harridan ground viciously upon the lips of the dying man and choked his utterance thereafter the halberts finished him off and he was buried there and then in lime under the floor of the hall of knights under the very spot where he had fallen which was long to remain imbrued with his blood  thus miserably perished the glittering k√∂nigsmark a martyr to his own irrepressible romanticism  as for sophia better might it have been for her had she shared his fate that night she was placed under arrest next morning and prince george was summoned back from berlin at once  the evidence may have satisfied him that his honour had not suffered for he was disposed to let the matter drop content that they should remain in the forbidding relations which had existed between them before this happening but sophia was uncompromising in her demand for strict justice  if i am guilty i am unworthy of you she told him if innocent you are unworthy of me  there was no more to be said a consistory court was assembled to divorce them but since with the best intentions there was no faintest evidence of her adultery this court had to be content to pronounce the divorce upon the ground of her desertion  she protested against the iniquity of this but she protested in vain she was carried off into the grim captivity of a castle on the ahlen to drag out in that melancholy duress another thirtytwo years of life  her death took place in november of 1726 and the story runs that on her deathbed she delivered to a person of trust a letter to her sometime husband now king george i of england seven months later as king george was on his way to his beloved hanover that letter was placed in his carriage as it crossed the frontier into germany it contained sophias dying declaration of innocence and her solemn summons to king george to stand by her side before the judgmentseat of heaven within a year and there make answer in her presence for the wrongs he had done her for her blighted life and her miserable death  king georges answer to that summons was immediate the reading of that letter brought on the apoplectic seizure of which he died in his carriage next daythe 9th of june 1727on the road to osnabruck      xi the tyrannicide  charlotte corday and jean paul morat    tyrannicide was the term applied to her deed by adam lux her lover in the sublimest and most spiritual sense of the wordfor he never so much as spoke to her and she never so much as knew of his existence  the sudden spiritual passion which inflamed him when he beheld her in the tumbril on her way to the scaffold is a fitting corollary to her action she in her way and he in his were alike sublime her tranquil martyrdom upon the altar of republicanism and his exultant martyrdom upon the altar of love were alike splendidly futile  it is surely the strangest lovestory enshrined in history it has its pathos yet leaves no regrets behind for there is no mighthavebeen which death had thwarted because she died he loved her because he loved her he died that is all but for the details which i am now to give you  the conventbred marie charlotte corday darmont was the daughter of a landless squire of normandy a member of the ch√©tive noblesse a man of gentle birth whose sadly reduced fortune may have predisposed him against the law of entail or primogeniturethe prime cause of the inequality out of which were sprung so many of the evils that afflicted france like many of his order and condition he was among the earliest converts to republicanismthe pure ideal republicanism demanding constitutional government of the people by the people holding monarchical and aristocratic rule an effete and parasitic anachronism  from m de corday charlotte absorbed the lofty republican doctrines to which anon she was to sacrifice her life and she rejoiced when the hour of awakening sounded and the children of france rose up and snapped the fetters in which they had been trammelled for centuries by an insolent minority of their fellowcountrymen  in the early violence of the revolution she thought she saw a transient phasehorrible but inevitable in the dread convulsion of that awakening soon this would pass and the sane ideal government of her dreams would followmust follow since among the peoples elected representatives was a goodly number of unselfish singleminded men of her fathers class of life men of breeding and education impelled by a lofty altruistic patriotism men who gradually came to form a party presently to be known as the girondins  but the formation of one party argues the formation of at least another and this other in the national assembly was that of the jacobins less pure of motive less restrained in deed a party in which stood preeminent such ruthless uncompromising men as robespierre dantonand marat  where the girondins stood for republicanism the jacobins stood for anarchy war was declared between the two the girondins arraigned marat and robespierre for complicity in the september massacres and thereby precipitated their own fall the triumphant acquittal of marat was the prelude to the ruin of the girondins and the proscription of twentynine deputies followed at once as the first step these fled into the country hoping to raise an army that should yet save france and several of the fugitives made their way to caen thence by pamphlets and oratory they laboured to arouse true republican enthusiasm they were gifted able men eloquent speakers and skilled writers and they might have succeeded but that in paris sat another man no less gifted and with surer knowledge of the temper of the proletariat tirelessly wielding a vitriolic pen skilled in the art of inflaming the passions of the mob  that man was jean paul marat sometime medical practitioner sometime professor of literature a graduate of the scottish university of st andrews author of some scientific and many sociological works inveterate pamphleteer and revolutionary journalist proprietor and editor of lami du peuple and idol of the parisian rabble who had bestowed upon him the name borne by his gazette so that he was known as the peoples friend  such was the foe of the girondins and of the pure altruistic utopian republicanism for which they stood and whilst he lived and laboured their own endeavours to influence the people were all in vain from his vile lodging in the rue de lecole de m√©decine in paris he span with his clever wicked pen a web that paralysed their high endeavours and threatened finally to choke them  he was not alone of course he was one of the dread triumvirate in which danton and robespierre were his associates but to the girondins he appeared by far the most formidable and ruthless and implacable of the three whilst to charlotte cordaythe friend and associate now of the proscribed girondins who had sought refuge in caenhe loomed so vast and terrible as to eclipse his associates entirely to her young mind inflamed with enthusiasm for the religion of liberty as preached by the girondins marat was a loathly dangerous heresiarch threatening to corrupt that sublime new faith with false anarchical doctrine and to replace the tyranny that had been overthrown by a tyranny more odious still  she witnessed in caen the failure of the girondin attempt to raise an army with which to deliver paris from the foul clutches of the jacobins an anguished spectator of this failure she saw in it a sign that liberty was being strangled at its birth on the lips of her friends the girondins she caught again the name of marat the murderer of liberty and brooding she reached a conclusion embodied in a phrase of a letter which she wrote about that time  as long as marat lives there will never be any safety for the friends of law and humanity  from that negative conclusion to its positive logical equivalent it was but a step that step she took she may have considered awhile the proposition thus presented to her or resolve may have come to her with realization she understood that a great sacrifice was necessary that who undertook to rid france of that unclean monster must go prepared for selfimmolation she counted the cost calmly and soberlyfor calm and sober was now her every act  she made her packages and set out one morning by the paris coach from caen leaving a note for her father in which she had written  i am going to england because i do not believe that it will be possible for a long time to live happily and tranquilly in france on leaving i post this letter to you when you receive it i shall no longer be here heaven denied us the happiness of living together as it has denied us other happinesses may it show itself more clement to our country goodby dear father embrace my sister for me and do not forget me  that was all the fiction that she was going to england was intended to save him pain for she had so laid her plans that her identity should remain undisclosed she would seek marat in the very hall of the convention and publicly slay him in his seat thus paris should behold nemesis overtaking the false republican in the very assembly which he corrupted and anon should adduce a moral from the spectacle of the monsters death for herself she counted upon instant destruction at the hands of the furious spectators thus thinking to die unidentified she trusted that her father hearing as all france must hear the great tidings that marat was dead would never connect her with the instrument of fate shattered by the fury of the mob  you realize then how great and how terrible was the purpose of this maid of twentyfive who so demurely took her seat in the paris diligence on that july morning of the year 2 of the republic1793 old style she was becomingly dressed in brown cloth a lace fichu folded across her welldeveloped breast a conical hat above her light brown hair she was of a good height and finely proportioned and her carriage as full of dignity as of grace her skin was of such white loveliness that a contemporary compares it with the lily like athene she was grayeyed and like athene noblefeatured the oval of her face squaring a little at the chin in which there was a cleft calm was her habit calm her slowmoving eyes calm and deliberate her movements and calm the mind reflected in all this  and as the heavy diligence trundles out of caen and takes the open country and the paris road not even the thought of the errand upon which she goes of her deathdealing and deathreceiving mission can shake that normal calm here is no wild exaltation no hysterical obedience to hotlyconceived impulse here is purpose as cold as it is lofty to liberate france and pay with her life for the privilege of doing so  that lover of hers whom we are presently to see has compared her ineptly with joan of arc that other maid of france but joan moved with pomp in a gorgeous pageantry amid acclamations sustained by the heady wine of combat and of enthusiasm openly indulged towards a goal of triumph charlotte travelled quietly in the stuffy diligence with the quiet conviction that her days were numbered  so normal did she appear to her travelling companions that one among them with an eye for beauty pestered her with amorous attentions and actually proposed marriage to her before the coach had rolled over the bridge of neuilly into paris two days later  she repaired to the providence inn in the rue des vieux augustine where she engaged a room on the first floor and then she set out in quest of the deputy duperret she had a letter of introduction to him from the girondin barbaroux with whom she had been on friendly terms at caen duperret was to assist her to obtain an interview with the minister of the interior she had undertaken to see the latter on the subject of certain papers relating to the affairs of a nun of caen an old convent friend of her own and she was in haste to discharge this errand so as to be free for the great task upon which she was come  from inquiries that she made she learnt at once that marat was ill and confined to his house this rendered necessary a change of plans and the relinquishing of her project of affording him a spectacular death in the crowded hall of the convention  the next day which was friday she devoted to furthering the business of her friend the nun on saturday morning she rose early and by six oclock she was walking in the cool gardens of the palais royal considering with that almost unnatural calm of hers the ways and means of accomplishing her purpose in the unexpected conditions that she found  towards eight oclock when paris was awakening to the business of the day and taking down its shutters she entered a cutlers shop in the palais royal and bought for two francs a stout kitchen knife in a shagreen case she then returned to her hotel to breakfast and afterwards dressed in her brown travellinggown and conical hat she went forth again and hailing a hackney carnage drove to marats house in the rue de lecole de m√©decine  but admittance to that squalid dwelling was denied her the citizen marat was ill she was told and could receive no visitors it was simonne everard the triumvirs mistresslater to be known as the widow maratwho barred her ingress with this message  checked she drove back to the providence inn and wrote a letter to the triumvir  paris 13th july year 2 of the republic  citizeni have arrived from caen your love for your country leads me to assume that you will be anxious to hear of the unfortunate events which are taking place in that part of the republic i shall therefore call upon you towards one oclock have the kindness to receive me and accord me a moments audience i shall put you in the way of rendering a great service to france  marie corday   having dispatched that letter to marat she sat until late afternoon waiting vainly for an answer despairing at last of receiving any she wrote a second note more peremptory in tone  i wrote to you this morning marat have you received my letter may i hope for a moments audience if you have received my letter i hope you will not refuse me considering the importance of the matter it should suffice for you that i am very unfortunate to give me the right to your protection  having changed into a graystriped dimity gownyou observe this further manifestation of a calm so complete that it admits of no departure from the ordinary habits of lifeshe goes forth to deliver in person this second letter the knife concealed in the folds of the muslin fichu crossed high upon her breast  in a mean brickpaved illlighted and almost unfurnished room of that house in the rue de lecole de m√©decine the peoples friend is seated in a bath it is no instinct of cleanliness he is obeying for in all france there is no man more filthy in his person and his habits than this triumvir his bath is medicated the horrible loathsome disease that corrodes his flesh demands these long immersions to quiet the gnawing pains which distract his active restless mind in these baths he can benumb the torment of the body with which he is encumbered  for marat is an intellect and nothing moreleastways nothing more that matters what else there is to him of trunk and limbs and organs he has neglected until it has all fallen into decay his very lack of personal cleanliness the squalor in which he lives the insufficient sleep which he allows himself his habit of careless feeding at irregular intervals all have their source in his contempt for the physical part of him this talented man of varied attainments accomplished linguist skilled physician able naturalist and profound psychologist lives in his intellect alone impatient of all physical interruptions if he consents to these immersions if he spends whole days seated in this medicated bath it is solely because it quenches or cools the fires that are devouring him and thus permits him to bend his mind to the work that is his life but his longsuffering body is avenging upon the mind the neglect to which it has been submitted the morbid condition of the former is being communicated to the latter whence results that disconcerting admixture of cold cynical cruelty and exalted sensibility which marked his nature in the closing years of his life  in his bath then sat the peoples friend on that july evening immersed to the hips his head swathed in a filthy turban his emaciated body cased in a sleeveless waistcoat he is fifty years of age dying of consumption and other things so that did charlotte but know it there is no need to murder him disease and death have marked him for their own and grow impatient  a board covering the bath served him for writingtable an empty wooden box at his side bore an inkstand some pens sheets of paper and two or three copies of lami do peuple there was no sound in the room but the scratch and splutter of his quill he was writing diligently revising and editing a proof of the forthcoming issue of his paper  a noise of voices raised in the outer room invaded the quiet in which he was at work and gradually penetrated his absorption until it disturbed and irritated him he moved restlessly in his bath listened a moment then with intent to make an end of the interruption he raised a hoarse croaking voice to inquire what might be taking place  the door opened and simonne his mistress and household drudge entered the room she was fully twenty years younger than himself and under the slattern appearance which life in that house had imposed upon her there were vestiges of a certain comeliness  there is a young woman here from caen who demands insistently to see you upon a matter of national importance  the dull eyes kindle at the mention of caen interest quickens in that leadenhued countenance was it not in caen that those old foes of his the girondins were stirring up rebellion  she says simonne continued that she wrote a letter to you this morning and she brings you a second note herself i have told her that you will not receive anyone and  give me the note he snapped setting down his pen he thrust out an unclean paw to snatch the folded sheet from simonnes hand he spread it and read his bloodless lips compressed his eyes narrowing to slits  let her in he commanded sharply and simonne obeyed him without more ado she admitted charlotte and left them alone togetherthe avenger and her victim for a moment each regarded the other marat beheld a handsome young woman elegantly attired but these things had no interest for the peoples friend what to him was woman and the lure of beauty charlotte beheld a feeble man of a repulsive hideousness and was full satisfied for in this outward loathsomeness she imagined a confirmation of the vileness of the mind she was come to blot out  then marat spoke so you are from caen child he said and what is doing in caen that makes you so anxious to see me  she approached him  rebellion is stirring there citizen marat  rebellion ha it was a sound between a laugh and a croak tell me what deputies are sheltered in caen come child their names he took up and dipped his quill and drew a sheet of paper towards him  she approached still nearer she came to stand close beside him erect and calm she recited the names of her friends the girondins whilst hunched there in his bath his pen scratched briskly  so many for the guillotine he snarled when it was done  but whilst he was writing she had drawn the knife from her fichu and as he uttered those words of doom to others his own doom descended upon him in a lightning stroke straight driven by that strong young arm the long stout blade was buried to its black hilt in his breast  he looked at her with eyes in which there was a faint surprise as he sank back then he raised his voice for the last time  help ch√©re amie help he cried and was for ever silent  the hand still grasping the pen trailed on the ground beside the bath at the end of his long emaciated arm his body sank sideways in the same direction the head lolling nervelessly upon his right shoulder whilst from the great rent in his breast the blood gushed forth embruing the water of his bath trickling to the brickpaved floor bespatteringsymbolically almosta copy of lami du peuple the journal to which he had devoted so much of his uneasy life  in answer to that cry of his came now simonne in haste a glance sufficed to reveal to her the horrible event and like a tigress she sprang upon the unresisting slayer seizing her by the head and calling loudly the while for assistance came instantly from the anteroom jeanne the old cook the fortress of the house and laurent basse a folder of marats paper and now charlotte found herself confronted by four maddened vociferous beings at whose hands she may well have expected to receive the death for which she was prepared  laurent indeed snatched up a chair and felled her by a blow of it across her head he would no doubt have proceeded in his fury to have battered her to death but for the arrival of gens darmes and the police commissioner of the district who took her in their protecting charge  the soul of paris was convulsed by the tragedy when it became known all night terror and confusion were abroad all night the revolutionary rabble in angry grief surged about and kept watch upon the house wherein the peoples friend lay dead  that night and for two days and nights thereafter charlotte corday lay in the prison of the abbaye supporting with fortitude the indignities that for a woman were almost inseparable from revolutionary incarceration she preserved throughout her imperturbable calm based now upon a state of mind content in the contemplation of accomplished purpose duty done she had saved france she believed saved liberty by slaying the man who would have strangled it in that illusion she was content her own life was a small price to pay for the splendid achievement  some of her time of waiting she spent in writing letters to her friends in which tranquilly and sanely she dwelt upon what she had done expounding fully the motives that had impelled her dwelling upon the details of the execution and of all that had followed among the letters written by her during those days of the preparation of peace as she calls that period dating in such terms a long epistle to barbarouxwas one to the committee of public safety in which she begs that a miniaturepainter may be sent to her to paint her portrait so that she may leave this token of remembrance to her friends it is only in this as the end approaches that we see in her conduct any thought for her own self any suggestion that she is anything more than a instrument in the hands of fate  on the 15th at eight oclock in the morning her trial began before the revolutionary tribunal a murmur ran through the hall as she appeared in her gown of greystriped dimity composed and calmalways calm  the trial opened with the examination of witnesses into that of the cutler who had sold her the knife she broke impatiently  these details are a waste of time it is i who killed marat  the audience gasped and rumbled ominously montane turned to examine her  what was the object of your visit to paris he asks  to kill marat  what motives induced you to this horrible deed  his many crimes  of what crimes do you accuse him  that he instigated the massacre of september that he kept alive the fires of civil war so that he might be elected dictator that he sought to infringe upon the sovereignty of the people by causing the arrest and imprisonment of the deputies to the convention on may 31st  what proof have you of this  the future will afford the proof marat hid his designs behind a mask of patriotism  montane shifted the ground of his interrogatory  who were your accomplices in this atrocious act  i have none  montane shook his head you cannot convince anyone that a person of your age and sex could have conceived such a crime unless instigated by some person or persons whom you are unwilling to name  charlotte almost smiled that shows but a poor knowledge of the human heart it is easier to carry out such a project upon the strength of ones own hatred than upon that of others and then raising her voice she proclaimed i killed one man to save a hundred thousand i killed a villain to save innocents i killed a savage wildbeast to give repose to france i was a republican before the revolution i never lacked for energy  what more was there to say her guilt was completely established her fearless selfobssession was not to be ruffled yet fouquiertinville the dread prosecutor made the attempt beholding her so virginal and fair and brave feeling perhaps that the tribunal had not had the best of it he sought with a handful of revolutionary filth to restore the balance he rose slowly his ferrety eyes upon her  how many children have you had he rasped sardonic his tone a slur an insult  faintly her cheeks crimsoned but her voice was composed disdainful as she answered coldly  have i not stated that i am not married  a leer a dry laugh a shrug from tinville to complete the impression he sought to convey and he sat down again  it was the turn of chauveau de la garde the advocate instructed to defend her but what defence was possible and chauveau had been intimidated he had received a note from the jury ordering him to remain silent another from the president bidding him declare her mad  yet chauveau took a middle course his brief speech is admirable it satisfied his selfrespect without derogating from his client it uttered the whole truth  the prisoner he said confesses with calm the horrible crime she has committed she confesses with calm its premeditation she confesses its most dreadful details in short she confesses everything and does not seek to justify herself that citizens of the jury is her whole defence this imperturbable calm this utter abnegation of self which displays no remorse even in the very presence of death are contrary to nature they can only be explained by the excitement of political fanaticism which armed her hand it is for you citizens of the jury to judge what weight that moral consideration should have in the scales of justice  the jury voted her guilty and tinville rose to demand the full sentence of the law  it was the end she was removed to the conciergerie the antechamber of the guillotine a constitutional priest was sent to her but she dismissed him with thanks not requiring his ministrations she preferred the painter hauer who had received the revolutionary tribunals permission to paint her portrait in accordance with her request and during the sitting which lasted half an hour she conversed with him quietly on ordinary topics the tranquillity of her spirit unruffled by any fear of the death that was so swiftly approaching  the door opened and sanson the public executioner came in he carried the red smock worn by those convicted of assassination she showed no dismay no more indeed than a faint surprise that the time spent with hauer should have gone so quickly she begged for a few moments in which to write a note and the request being granted acquitted herself briskly of that task then announcing herself ready she removed her cap that sanson might cut her luxuriant hair yet first taking his scissors she herself cut off a lock and gave it to hauer for remembrance when sanson would have bound her hands she begged that she might be allowed to wear gloves as her wrists were bruised and cut by the cord with which she had been pinioned in marats house he answered that she might do so if she wished but that it was unnecessary as he could bind her without causing pain  to be sure she said those others had not your experience and she proffered her bare wrists to his cord without further demur if this toilet of death is performed by rude hands she commented at least it leads to immortality  she mounted the tumbril awaiting in the prison yard and disdaining the chair offered her by sanson remained standing to show herself dauntless to the mob and brave its rage and fierce was that rage indeed so densely thronged were the streets that the tumbril proceeded at a crawl and the people surging about the cart screamed death and insult at the doomed woman it took two hours to reach the place de la r√©volution and meanwhile a terrific summer thunderstorm had broken over paris and a torrential rain had descended upon the densely packed streets charlottes garments were soaked through and through so that her red smock becoming glued now to her body and fitting her like a skin threw into relief its sculptural beauty whilst a reflection of the vivid crimson of the garment faintly tinged her cheeks and thus heightened her appearance of complete composure  and it is now in the rue st honor√© that at long last we reach the opening of our tragic lovestory  a tall slim fair young man named adam luxsent to paris by the city of mayence as deputy extraordinary to the national conventionwas standing there in the howling press of spectators he was an accomplished learned young gentleman doctor at once of philosophy and of medicine although in the latter capacity he had never practiced owing to an extreme sensibility of nature which rendered anatomical work repugnant to him he was a man of a rather exalted imagination unhappily marriedthe not uncommon fate of such delicate temperamentsand now living apart from his wife he had heard as all paris had heard every detail of the affair and of the trial and he waited there curious to see this woman with whose deed he was secretly in sympathy  the tumbril slowly approached the groans and execrations swelled up around him and at last he beheld herbeautiful serene full of life a still smile upon her lips for a long moment he gazed upon her standing as if stricken into stone then heedless of those about him he bared his head and thus silently saluted and paid homage to her she did not see him he had not thought that she would he saluted her as the devout salute the unresponsive image of a saint the tumbril crawled on he turned his head and followed her with his eyes for awhile then driving his elbows into the ribs of those about him he clove himself a passage through the throng and so followed bareheaded now with fixed gaze a man entranced  he was at the foot of the scaffold when her head fell to the last he had seen that noble countenance preserve its immutable calm and in the hush that followed the sibilant fall of the great knife his voice suddenly rang out  she is greater than brutus was his cry and he added addressing those who stared at him in stupefaction it were beautiful to have died with her  he was suffered to depart unmolested chiefly perhaps because at that moment the attention of the crowd was upon the executioners attendant who in holding up charlottes truncated head slapped the cheek with his hand the story runs that the dead face reddened under the blow scientists of the day disputed over this some arguing from it a proof that consciousness does not at once depart the brain upon decapitation  that night while paris slept its walls were secretly placarded with copies of a eulogy of charlotte corday the martyr of republicanism the deliverer of france in which occurs the comparison with joan of arc that other great heroine of france this was the work of adam lux he made no secret of it the vision of her had so wrought upon the imagination of this susceptible dreamer had fired his spirit with such enthusiasm that he was utterly reckless in yielding to his emotions in expressing the phrenetic immaterial love with which in her last moments of life she had inspired him  two days after her execution he issued a long manifesto in which he urged the purity of her motive as the fullest justification of her act placed her on the level of brutus and cato and passionately demanded for her the honour and veneration of posterity it is in this manifesto that he applies euphemistically to her deed the term tyrannicide that document he boldly signed with his own name realizing that he would pay for that temerity with his life  he was arrested on the 24th of julyexactly a week from the day on which he had seen her die he had powerful friends and they exerted themselves to obtain for him a promise of pardon and release if he would publicly retract what he had written but he laughed the proposal to scorn ardently resolved to follow into death the woman who had aroused the hopeless immaterial love that made his present torment  still his friends strove for him his trial was put off a doctor named wetekind was found to testify that adam lux was mad that the sight of charlotte corday had turned his head he wrote a paper on this plea recommending that clemency be shown to the young doctor on the score of his affliction and that he should be sent to a hospital or to america adam lux was angry when he heard of this and protested indignantly against the allegations of dr wetekind he wrote to the journal de la montagne which published his declaration on the 26th of september to the effect that he was not mad enough to desire to live and that his anxiety to meet death halfway was a crowning proof of his sanity  he languished on in the prison of la force until the 10th of october when at last he was brought to trial he stood it joyously in a mood of exultation at his approaching deliverance he assured the court that he did not fear the guillotine and that all ignominy had been removed from such a death by the pure blood of charlotte  they sentenced him to death and he thanked them for the boon  forgive me sublime charlotte he exclaimed if i should find it impossible to exhibit at the last the courage and gentleness that were yours i glory in your superiority for it is right that the adored should be above the adorer  yet his courage did not fail him far from it indeed if hers had been a mood of gentle calm his was one of ecstatic exaltation at five oclock that same afternoon he stepped from the tumbril under the gaunt shadow of the guillotine he turned to the people his eyes bright a flush on his cheeks  at last i am to have the happiness of dying for charlotte he told them and mounted the scaffold with the eager step of the bridegroom on his way to the nuptial altar
