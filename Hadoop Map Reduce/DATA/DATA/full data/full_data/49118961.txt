     a letter  from a member of the house of commons in ireland to  a member of the house of commons in england  concerning the  sacramental test  written in the year 1708   note  in the foreword to the reprint of this tract in the miscellanies of 1711 swift remarks i have been assured that the suspicion which the supposed author lay under for writing this letter absolutely ruined him with the late ministry the late ministry was the whig ministry of which godolphin was the premier to this ministry the repeal of the test act was a matter of much concern to test the effect of such a repeal it was determined to try it in ireland first there the presbyterians had distinguished themselves by their loyalty to william and the protestant succession these therefore offered a good excuse for the introduction of such a measure particularly when in 1708 an invasion was rumoured they were the first to send in loyal addresses to the queen swift likened this method to that of a discreet physician who first gives a new medicine to a dog before he prescribes it to a human creature further the speaker of the irish house had come over to england to agitate for the repeal on this matter swift wrote to archbishop king under date april 15th the letter was first published by mr john forster in his life of swift p 246 as follows some days ago my lord somers entered with me into discourse about the test clause and desired my opinion upon it which i gave him truly though with all the gentleness i could because as i am inclined and obliged to value the friendship he professes for me so he is a person whose favour i would engage in the affairs of the first fruits if it became me to give ill names to ill things and persons i should be at a loss to find bad enough for the villainy and baseness of a certain lawyer of ireland speaker brodrick afterwards lord midleton who is in a station the least of all others excusable for such proceedings and yet has been going about most industriously to all his acquaintance of both houses towards the end of the session to show the necessity of taking off the test clause in ireland by an act here wherein you may be sure he had his brothers assistance if such a project should be resumed next session and i in england unless your grace send me your absolute commands to the contrary which i should be sorry to receive i could hardly forbear publishing some paper in opposition to it or leaving one behind me if there should be occasion in august of the same year the agitation for the repeal was renewed and in december swift published his letter on the sacramental test writing as if from dublin and as a member of the irish house of commons when he writes to king in the following month he makes a mild attempt to convince the archbishop that the pamphlet was not of his authorship the author has gone out of his way to reflect on me as a person likely to write for repealing the test which i am sure is very unfair treatment this is all i am likely to get by the company i keep i am used like a sober man with a drunken face have the scandal of the vice without the satisfaction but king was not deceived in his reply to swift he simply remarks you need not be concerned i will engage you will lose nothing by that paper swift however lost more than the archbishop thought for that paper led to his severance from the whigs and in after life to much contumely cast on his character for being a political renegade because he was not whig enough because he would not forsake his church for his party critics and biographers have thought fit to make little of him and to compare him to his discredit with contemporaries whose intellects he held in the palm of his hand and to whom he might have stood as a moral exemplar  swift refers to this tract in his memoirs relating to the change in the queens ministry as followsit was everybodys opinion that the earl of wharton would endeavour when he went to ireland to take off the test as a step to have it taken off here upon which i drew up and printed a pamphlet by way of a letter from a member of parliament here shewing the danger to the church by such an intent although i took all care to be private yet the lieutenants chaplain and some others guessed me to be the author and told his excellency their suspicions whereupon i saw him no more until i went to ireland  the tract is one of the most favourable specimens of swifts controversial method and trenchant satire the style is excellentforcible and pithy while the arguments are like most of swifts arguments aptly to the point with yet a potentiality of application which fits them for the most general statement of the principles under discussion scott considers the pamphlet as having materially contributed to the loss of the bill for repeal of the test act during the earl of pembrokes viceroyalty in the same year swift wrote a letter to a member of parliament in ireland on choosing a new speaker there this short tract bears also on the question of the test but it is not included in this volume since it was intended as an electioneering pamphlet  i have been unable to obtain access to a copy of the first edition of the letter on the sacramental test the text here given is that of the miscellanies of 1711 collated with that given in the miscellanies 1728 and with those printed by faulkner hawkesworth and scott  ts    a letter concerning the   sacramental test  advertisement1  footnote 1 this advertisement is taken from miscellanies in prose and verse printed for john morphew 1711 on page 314 of that volume it forms a foreword to a letter concerning the sacramental test it is omitted from the reprint in the miscellanies of 1728 the page which swift says he has taken leave to omit cannot be identified probably this was another of swifts manoeuvres for concealing the identity of the author the advertisement of george faulkner to his edition of swifts works vol iv 1735 is as follows  in the second volume of doctor swifts and mr popes miscellanies i found the following treatise which had been printed in london with some other of the deans works many years before but at first came out by itself in the year 1708 as the date shews and it was at a juncture when the dissenters were endeavouring to repeal the sacramental test as by common fame and some pamphlets published to the same purpose they seem to be now again attempting with great hope of success i have therefore taken the liberty to make an extract out of that discourse omitting only some passages which relate to certain persons and are of no consequence to the argument but the authors weight of reasoning seems at present to have more weight than it had in those times when the discourse first appeared  the author in this letter personates a member of parliament here dublin to a member of parliament in england  the speaker mentioned in this letter was allen broderick afterwards chancellor and lord middleton and the prelate was dr lyndsay afterwards lord primate ts   the following letter is supposed by some judicious persons to be of the same author and if their conjectures be right it will be of no disadvantage to him to have it revived considering the time when it was writ the persons then at the helm and the designs in agitation against which this paper so boldly appeared i have been assured that the suspicion which the supposed author lay under for writing this letter absolutely ruined him with the late ministry i have taken leave to omit about a page which was purely personal and of no use to the subject   dublin dec 4 1708  sir  i received your letter wherein you tell me of the strange representations made of us on your side of the water the instance you are pleased to mention is that of the presbyterian missionary who according to your phrase hath been lately persecuted at drogheda for his religion but it is easy to observe how mighty industrious some people have been for three or four years past to hand about stories of the hardships the merits the number and the power of the presbyterians in ireland to raise formidable ideas of the dangers of popery there and to transmit all for england improved by great additions and with special care to have them inserted with comments in those infamous weekly papers that infest your coffeehouses so when the clause enacting a sacramental test was put in execution it was given out in england that half the justices of peace through this kingdom had laid down their commissions whereas upon examination the whole number was found to amount only to a dozen or thirteen and those generally of the lowest rate in fortune and understanding and some of them superannuated so when the earl of pembroke was in ireland and the parliament sitting a formal story was very gravely carried to his excellency by some zealous members of a priest newly arrived from abroad to the northwest parts of ireland who had publicly preached to his people to fall amurdering the protestants which though invented to serve an end they were then upon and are still driving at it was presently handed over and printed with shrewd remarks by your worthy scribblers in like manner the account of that person who was lately expelled our university for reflecting on the memory of king william what a dust it raised and how foully it was related is fresh enough in memory2 neither would people be convinced till the university was at the pains of publishing a latin paper to justify themselves and to mention no more this story of the persecution at drogheda how it hath been spread and aggravated what consequences have been drawn from it and what reproaches fixed on those who have least deserved them we are already informed now if the end of all this proceeding were a secret and mystery i should not undertake to give it an interpretation but sufficient care hath been taken to give it sufficient explanation3 first by addresses artificially if not illegally procured to shew the miserable state of the dissenters in ireland by reason of the sacramental test and to desire the queens intercession that it might be repealed then it is manifest that our speaker when he was last year in england solicited in person several members of both houses to have it repealed by an act there though it be a matter purely national that cannot possibly interfere with the trade and interest of england and though he himself appeared formerly the most zealous of all men against the injustice of binding a nation by laws to which they do not consent and lastly those weekly libellers whenever they get a tale by the end relating to ireland without ever troubling their thoughts about the truth always end it with an application against the sacramental test and the absolute necessity there is of repealing it in both kingdoms i know it may be reckoned a weakness to say anything of such trifles as are below a serious mans notice much less would i disparage the understanding of any party to think they would choose the vilest and most ignorant among mankind to employ them for assertors of a cause i shall only say that the scandalous liberty those wretches take would hardly be allowed if it were not mingled with opinions that some men would be glad to advance besides how insipid soever those papers are they seem to be levelled to the understandings of a great number they are grown a necessary part in coffeehouse furniture and some time or other may happen to be read by customers of all ranks for curiosity and amusement because they lie always in the way one of these authors the fellow that was pilloried i have forgot his name4 is indeed so grave sententious dogmatical a rogue that there is no enduring him the observator5 is much the brisker of the two and i think farther gone of late in lies and impudence than his presbyterian brother the reason why i mention him is to have an occasion of letting you know that you have not dealt so gallantly with us as we did with you in a parallel case last year a paper was brought here from england called a dialogue between the archbishop of canterbury and mr higgins which we ordered to be burnt by the common hangman as it well deserved though we have no more to do with his grace of canterbury6 than you have with the archbishop of dublin7 nor can you love and reverence your prelate more than we do ours whom you tamely suffer to be abused openly and by name by that paltry rascal of an observator and lately upon an affair wherein he had no concern i mean the business of the missionary at drogheda wherein our excellent primate was engaged and did nothing but according to law and discretion but because the lord archbishop of dublin hath been upon several occasions of late years misrepresented in england i would willingly set you right in his character for his great sufferings and eminent services he was by the late king promoted to the see of derry about the same time he wrote a book to justify the revolution wherein was an account of king jamess proceedings in ireland and the late archbishop tillotson recommended it to the king as the most serviceable treatise that could have been published at such a juncture8 and as his grace set out upon those principles he has proceeded so ever since as a loyal subject to the queen entirely for the succession in the protestant line and for ever excluding the pretender and though a firm friend to the church yet with indulgence toward dissenters as appears from his conduct at derry where he was settled for many years among the most virulent of the sect yet upon his removal to dublin they parted from him with tears in their eyes and universal acknowledgments of his wisdom and goodness for the rest it must be owned he does not busy himself by entering deep into any party but rather spends his time in acts of hospitality and charity in building of churches repairing his palace in introducing and preferring the worthiest persons he can find without other regards in short in the practice of all virtues that can become a public or private life this and more if possible is due to so excellent a person who may be justly reckoned among the greatest and most learned prelates of his age however his character may be defiled by such mean and dirty hands as those of the observator or such as employ him9

ts  footnote 8  dr king was twice imprisoned in the castle of dublin after the landing of king james in ireland in 1699 and narrowly escaped assassination the title of the work alluded to is the state of the protestants in ireland under the late king jamess government in which their carriage towards him is justified and the absolute necessity of their endeavouring to be freed from his government and of submitting to their present majesties is demonstrated s  footnote 9  the portion of this paragraph beginning with the reason why i mention him to the end such as employ him is omitted by faulkner ts  i now come to answer the other part of your letter and shall give you my opinion freely about repealing the sacramental test only whereas you desire my thoughts as a friend and not as i am a member of parliament i must assure you they are exactly the same in both capacities  i must begin by telling you we are generally surprised at your wonderful kindness to us on this occasion it being so very industrious to teach us to see our interest in a point where we are so unable to see it ourselves this hath given us some suspicion and though in my own particular i am hugely bent to believe that whenever you concern yourselves in our affairs it is certainly for our good yet i have the misfortune to be something singular in this belief and therefore i never attempt to justify it but content myself to possess my own opinion in private for fear of encountering men of more wit or words than i have to spare  we at this distance who see nothing of the spring of actions are forced by mere conjecture to assign two reasons for your desiring us to repeal the sacramental test one is because you are said to imagine it will be one step towards the like good work in england the other more immediate that it will open a way for rewarding several persons who have well deserved upon a great occasion but who are now unqualified through that impediment  i do not frequently quote poets especially english but i remember there is in some of mr cowleys love verses a strain that i thought extraordinary at fifteen and have often since imagined it to be spoken by ireland    forbid it heaven my life should be   weighd with her least conveniency  in short whatever advantage you propose to yourselves by repealing the sacramental test speak it out plainly tis the best argument you can use for we value your interest much more than our own if your little finger be sore and you think a poultice made of our vitals will give it any ease speak the word and it shall be done the interest of our whole kingdom is at any time ready to strike to that of your poorest fishing towns it is hard you will not accept our services unless we believe at the same time that you are only consulting our profit and giving us marks of your love if there be a fire at some distance and i immediately blow up my house before there be occasion because you are a man of quality and apprehend some danger to a corner of your stable yet why should you require me to attend next morning at your levee with my humble thanks for the favour you have done me  if we might be allowed to judge for ourselves we had abundance of benefit by the sacramental test and foresee a number of mischiefs would be the consequence of repealing it and we conceive the objections made against it by the dissenters are of no manner of force they tell us of their merits in the late war in ireland and how cheerfully they engaged for the safety of the nation that had they thought they had been fighting only other peoples quarrels perhaps it might have cooled their zeal and that for the future they shall sit down quietly and let us do our work ourselves nay that it is necessary they should do so since they cannot take up arms under the penalty of high treason  now supposing them to have done their duty as i believe they did and not to trouble them about the fly on the wheel i thought liberty property and religion had been the three subjects of the quarrel and have not all those been amply secured to them had they not at that time a mental reservation for power and employments and must these two articles be added henceforward in our national quarrels it is grown a mighty conceit among some men to melt down the phrase of a church established by law into that of the religion of the magistrate of which appellation it is easier to find the reason than the sense if by the magistrate they mean the prince the expression includes a falsehood for when king james was prince10 the established church was the same it is now if by the same word they mean the legislature we desire no more be that as it will we of this kingdom believe the church of ireland to be the national church and the only one established by law and are willing by the same law to give a toleration to dissenters but if once we repeal our sacramental test and grant a toleration or suspend the execution of the penal laws i do not see how we can be said to have any established church remaining or rather why there will not be as many established churches as there are sects of dissenters no say they yours will still be the national church because your bishops and clergy are maintained by the public but that i suppose will be of no long duration and it would be very unjust it should because to speak in tindals phrase11 it is not reasonable that revenues should be annexed to one opinion more than another when all are equally lawful and tis the same authors maxim that no freeborn subject ought to pay for maintaining speculations he does not believe but why should any man upon account of opinions he cannot help be deprived of the opportunity of serving his queen and country their zeal is commendable and when employments go a begging for want of hands they shall be sure to have the refusal only upon condition they will not pretend to them upon maxims which equally include atheists turks jews infidels and heretics or which is still more dangerous even papists themselves the former you allow the other you deny because these last own a foreign power and therefore must be shut out but there is no great weight in this for their religion can suit with free states with limited or absolute monarchies as well as a better and the popes power in france is but a shadow so that upon this foot there need be no great danger to the constitution by admitting papists to employments i will help you to enough of them who shall be ready to allow the pope as little power here as you please and the bare opinion of his being vicar of christ is but a speculative point for which no man it seems ought to be deprived of the capacity of serving his country  footnote 10 the words from the expression to was prince are omitted by faulkner in his edition ts  footnote 11 see vol iii p 9 note ts  but if you please i will tell you the great objection we have against repealing this same sacramental test it is that we are verily persuaded the consequence will be an entire alteration of religion among us in a no great compass of years and pray observe how we reason here in ireland upon this matter  we observe the scots in our northern parts to be a brave industrious people extremely devoted to their religion and full of an undisturbed affection towards each other numbers of that noble nation invited by the fertilities of the soil are glad to exchange their barren hills of loquabar by a voyage of three hours for our fruitful vales of down and antrim so productive of that grain which at little trouble and less expense finds diet and lodging for themselves and their cattle12 these people by their extreme parsimony wonderful dexterity in dealing and firm adherence to one another soon grow into wealth from the smallest beginnings never are rooted out where they once fix and increase daily by new supplies besides when they are the superior number in any tract of ground they are not over patient of mixture but such whom they cannot assimilate soon find it their interest to remove i have done all in my power on some land of my own to preserve two or three english fellows in their neighbourhood but found it impossible though one of them thought he had sufficiently made his court by turning presbyterian add to all this that they bring along with them from scotland a most formidable notion of our church which they look upon at least three degrees worse than popery and it is natural it should be so since they come over full fraught with that spirit which taught them to abolish episcopacy at home  footnote 12 from this passage perhaps johnson derived the famous definition of oats in his dictionary as the food of horses in england and of men in scotland s  then we proceed farther and observe that the gentlemen of employments here make a very considerable number in the house of commons and have no other merit but that of doing their duty in their several stations therefore when the test is repealed it will be highly reasonable they should give place to those who have much greater services to plead the commissions of the revenue are soon disposed of and the collectors and other officers throughout this kingdom are generally appointed by the commissioners which give them a mighty influence in every country as much may be said of the great officers in the law and when this door is open to let dissenters into the commissions of the peace to make them high sheriffs mayors of corporations and officers of the army and militia i do not see how it can be otherwise considering their industry and our supineness but that they may in a very few years grow to a majority in the house of commons and consequently make themselves the national religion and have a fair pretence to demand the revenues of the church for their teachers i know it will be objected that if all this should happen as i describe yet the presbyterian religion could never be made the national by act of parliament because our bishops are so great a number in the house of lords and without a majority there the church could not be abolished but i have two very good expedients for that which i shall leave you to guess and i dare swear our speaker here has often thought on especially having endeavoured at one of them so lately that this design is not so foreign from some peoples thoughts i must let you know that an honest bellwether13 of our house you have him now in england i wish you could keep him there had the impudence some years ago in parliament time to shake my lord bishop of kilaloe14 by his lawn sleeve and tell him in a threatening manner that he hoped to live to see the day when there should not be one of his order in the kingdom  footnote 13 supposed to be mr broderick f  footnote 14 dr lindsay afterwards lord primate s  these last lines perhaps you think a digression therefore to return i have told you the consequences we fully reckon upon from repealing the sacramental test which although the greatest number of such as are for doing it are actually in no manner of pain about it and many of them care not threepence whether there be any church or no yet because they pretend to argue from conscience as well as policy and interest i thought it proper to understand and answer them accordingly  now sir in answer to your question whether if an attempt should be made here for repealing the sacramental test it would be likely to succeed the number of professed dissenters in this parliament was as i remember something under a dozen and i cannot call to mind above thirty others who were expected to fall in with them this is certain that the presbyterian party having with great industry mustered up their forces did endeavour one day upon occasion of a hint in my lord pembrokes speech to introduce a debate about repealing the test clause when there appeared at least four to one odds against them and the ablest of those who were reckoned the most staunch and thoroughpaced whigs upon all other occasions fell off with an abhorrence at the first mention of this  i must desire you to take notice that the terms of whig and tory do not properly express the different interests in our parliament i remember when i was last in england i told the king that the highest tories we had with us would make tolerable whigs there this was certainly right and still in the general continues so unless you have since admitted new characteristics which did not come within our definition15 whoever bears a true veneration for the glorious memory of king william as our great deliverer from popery and slavery whoever is firmly loyal to our present queen with an utter abhorrence and detestation of the pretender whoever approves the succession to the crown in the house of hanover and is for preserving the doctrine and discipline of the church of england with an indulgence for scrupulous consciences such a man we think acts upon right principles and may be justly allowed a whig and i believe there are not six members in our house of commons who may not fairly come under this description so that the parties among us are made up on one side of moderate whigs and on the other of presbyterians and their abettors by which last i mean such who can equally go to a church or conventicle or such who are indifferent to all religion in general or lastly such who affect to bear a personal rancour toward the clergy these last are a set of men not of our own growth their principles at least have been imported of late years yet this whole party put together will not i am confident amount to above fifty men in parliament which can hardly be worked up into a majority of three hundred  footnote 15 the passage beginning with i remember when i was last in england and ending with within our definition is omitted by faulkner ts  as to the house of lords the difficulty there is conceived at least as great as in ours so many of our temporal peers live in england that the bishops are generally pretty near a par of the house and we reckon they will be all to a man against repealing the test and yet their lordships are generally thought as good whigs upon our principles as any in the kingdom there are indeed a few lay lords who appear to have no great devotion for episcopacy and perhaps one or two more with whom certain powerful motives might be used for removing any difficulty whatsoever but these are in no sort of a number to carry any point against the conjunction of the rest and the whole bench of bishops  besides the whole body of our clergy is utterly against repealing the test though they are entirely devoted to her majesty and hardly one in a hundred who are not very good whigs in our acceptation of the word and i must let you know that we of ireland are not yet come up to other folks refinements for we generally love and esteem our clergy and think they deserve it nay we are apt to lay some weight upon their opinion and would not willingly disoblige them at least unless it were upon some greater point of interest than this and their judgment in the present affair is the more to be regarded because they are the last persons who will be affected by it this makes us think them impartial and that their concern is only for religion and the interest of the kingdom because the act which repeals the test will only qualify a layman for an employment but not a presbyterian or anabaptist preacher for a churchliving now i must take leave to inform you that several members of our house and myself among the rest knowing some time ago what was upon the anvil went to all the clergy we knew of any distinction and desired their judgment of the matter wherein we found a most wonderful agreement there being but one divine that we could hear of in the whole kingdom who appeared of a contrary sentiment wherein he afterwards stood alone in the convocation very little to his credit though as he hoped very much to his interest  i will now consider a little the arguments offered to shew the advantages or rather the necessity of repealing the test in ireland we are told the popish interest is here so formidable that all hands should be joined to keep it under that the only names of distinction among us ought to be those of protestant and papist and that this expedient is the only means to unite all protestants upon one common bottom all which is nothing but misrepresentation and mistake  if we were under any real fear of the papists in this kingdom it would be hard to think us so stupid not to be equally apprehensive with others since we are likely to be the greatest and more immediate sufferers but on the contrary we look upon them to be altogether as inconsiderable as the women and children their lands are almost entirely taken from them and they are rendered incapable of purchasing any more and for the little that remains provision is made by the late act against popery that it will daily crumble away to prevent which some of the most considerable among them are already turned protestants and so in all probability will many more then the popish priests are all registered and without permission which i hope will not be granted they can have no successors so that the protestant clergy will find it perhaps no difficult matter to bring great numbers over to the church and in the meantime the common people without leaders without discipline or natural courage being little better than hewers of wood and drawers of water are out of all capacity of doing any mischief if they were ever so well inclined neither are they at all likely to join in any considerable numbers with an invader having found so ill success when they were much more numerous and powerful when they had a prince of their own religion to head them had been trained for some years under a popish deputy and received such mighty aids from the french king  as to that argument used for repealing the test that it will unite all protestants against the common enemy i wonder by what figure those gentlemen speak who are pleased to advance it suppose in order to increase the friendship between you and me a law should pass that i must have half your estate do you think that would much advance the union between us or suppose i share my fortune equally between my own children and a stranger whom i take into my protection will that be a method to unite them tis an odd way of uniting parties to deprive a majority of part of their ancient right by conferring it on a faction who had never any right at all and therefore cannot be said to suffer any loss or injury if it be refused them neither is it very clear how far some people may stretch the term of common enemy how many are there of those that call themselves protestants who look upon our worship to be idolatrous as well as that of the papists and with great charity put prelacy and popery together as terms convertible  and therefore there is one small doubt i would be willingly satisfied in before i agree to the repealing of the test that is whether these same protestants when they have by their dexterity made themselves the national religion and disposed the church revenues among their pastors or themselves will be so kind to allow us dissenters i do not say a share in employments but a bare toleration by law the reason of my doubt is because i have been so very idle as to read above fifty pamphlets written by as many presbyterian divines loudly disclaiming this idol toleration some of them calling it i know not how properly a rag of popery and all agreeing it was to establish iniquity by law now i would be glad to know when and where their successors have renounced this doctrine and before what witnesses because methinks i should be loth to see my poor titular bishop in partibus seized on by mistake in the dark for a jesuit or be forced myself to keep my chaplain disguised like my butler and steal to prayers in a back room as my grandfatherl6 used in those times when the church of england was malignant  footnote 16 this is thomas swift vicar of goodrich in herefordshire much distinguished by his courage as well as his loyalty to king charles the first and the sufferings he underwent for that prince more than any person of his condition in england see the fragment of autobiography printed by scott and forster in their lives of swift ts  but this is ripping up old quarrels long forgot popery is now the common enemy against which we must all unite i have been tired in history with the perpetual folly of those states who call in foreigners to assist them against a common enemy but the mischief was those allies would never be brought to allow that the common enemy was quite subdued and they had reason for it proved at last that one part of the common enemy was those who called them in and so the allies became at length the masters  tis agreed among naturalists that a lion is a larger a stronger and more dangerous enemy than a cat yet if a man were to have his choice either a lion at his foot bound fast with three or four chains his teeth drawn out and his claws pared to the quick or an angry cat in full liberty at his throat he would take no long time to determine  i have been sometimes admiring the wonderful significancy of that word persecution and what various interpretations it hath acquired even within my memory when i was a boy i often heard the presbyterians complain that they were not permitted to serve god in their own way they said they did not repine at our employments but thought that all men who live peaceably ought to have liberty of conscience and leave to assemble that impediment being removed at the revolution they soon learned to swallow the sacramental test and began to take very large steps wherein all that offered to oppose them were called men of a persecuting spirit during the time the bill against occasional conformity was on foot persecution was every day rung in our ears and now at last the sacramental test itself has the same name where then is this matter likely to end when the obtaining of one request is only used as a step to demand another a lover is ever complaining of cruelty while anything is denied him and when the lady ceases to be cruel she is from the next moment at his mercy so persecution it seems is everything that will not leave it in mens power to persecute others  there is one argument offered against a sacramental test by a sort of men who are content to be styled of the church of england who perhaps attend its service in the morning and go with their wives to a conventicle in the afternoon confessing they hear very good doctrine in both these men are much offended that so holy an institution as that of the lords supper should be made subservient to such mercenary purposes as the getting of an employment now it seems the law concluding all men to be members of that church where they receive the sacrament and supposing all men to live like christians especially those who are to have employments did imagine they received the sacrament in course about four times a year and therefore only desired it might appear by certificate to the public that such who took an office were members of the church established by doing their ordinary duty however lest we should offend them we have often desired they would deal candidly with us for if the matter stuck only there we would propose it in parliament that every man who takes an employment should instead of receiving the sacrament be obliged to swear that he is a member of the church of ireland by law established with episcopacy and so forth and as they do now in scotland to be true to the kirk but when we drive them thus far they always retire to the main body of the argument urge the hardship that men should be deprived the liberty of serving their queen and country on account of their conscience and in short have recourse to the common style of their half brethren now whether this be a sincere way of arguing i will appeal to any other judgment but theirs  there is another topic of clamour somewhat parallel to the foregoing it seems by the test clause the military officers are obliged to receive the sacrament as well as the civil and it is a matter of some patience to hear the dissenters declaiming upon this occasion they cry they are disarmed they are used like papists when an enemy appears at home or from abroad they must sit still and see their throats cut or be hanged for high treason if they offer to defend themselves miserable condition woful dilemma it is happy for us all that the pretender was not apprized of this passive presbyterian principle else he would have infallibly landed in our northern parts and found them all sat down in their formalities as the gauls did the roman senators ready to die with honour in their callings sometimes to appease their indignation we venture to give them hopes that in such a case the government will perhaps connive and hardly be so severe to hang them for defending it against the letter of the law to which they readily answer that they will not lie at our mercy but let us fight our battles ourselves sometimes we offer to get an act by which upon all popish insurrections at home or popish invasion from abroad the government shall be empowered to grant commissions to all protestants whatsoever without that persecuting circumstance of obliging them to say their prayers when they receive the sacrament but they abhor all thoughts of occasional commissions they will not do our drudgery and we reap the benefit it is not worth their while to fight pro aris et focis and they had rather lose their estates liberties religion and lives than the pleasure of governing  but to bring this discourse toward a conclusion if the dissenters will be satisfied with such a toleration by law as hath been granted them in england i believe the majority of both houses will fall readily in with it farther it will be hard to persuade this house of commons and perhaps much harder the next for to say the truth we make a mighty difference here between suffering thistles to grow among us and wearing them for posies we are fully convinced in our consciences that we shall always tolerate them but not quite so fully that they will always tolerate us when it comes to their turn and we are the majority and we are in possession  he who argues in defence of a law in force not antiquated or obsolete but lately enacted is certainly on the safer side and may be allowed to point out the dangers he conceives to foresee in the abrogation of it  for if the consequences of repealing this clause should at some time or other enable the presbyterians to work themselves up into the national church instead of uniting protestants it would sow eternal divisions among them first their own sects which now lie dormant would be soon at cuffs again with each other about power and preferment and the dissenting episcopals perhaps discontented to such a degree as upon some fair unhappy occasion would be able to shake the firmest loyalty which none can deny theirs to be  neither is it very difficult to conjecture from some late proceedings at what a rate this faction is likely to drive wherever it gets the whip and the seat they have already set up courts of spiritual judicature in open contempt of the laws they send missionaries everywhere without being invited in order to convert the church of england folks to christianity they are as vigilant as i know who to attend persons on their deathbeds and for purposes much alike and what practices such principles as these with many other that might be invidious to mention may spawn when they are laid out to the sun you may determine at leisure  lastly whether we are so entirely sure of their loyalty upon the present foot of government as you may imagine their detractors make a question which however does i think by no means affect the body of dissenters but the instance produced is of some among their leading teachers in the north who having refused the abjuration oath yet continue their preaching and have abundance of followers the particulars are out of my head but the fact is notorious enough and i believe has been published i think it a pity it has not been remedied  thus i have fairly given you sir my own opinion as well as that of a great majority in both houses here relating to this weighty affair upon which i am confident you may securely reckon i will leave you to make what use of it you please  i am with great respect sir  yours c                                   the presbyterians plea of merit   note  the reference casually made by swift in his letter on the sacramental test to his grandfather and the malignant church probably points to one of the causes for his persistent dislike towards the protestant dissenters his attitude displays a profound disgust both for their teaching and their conduct and he found very early occasion to ridicule them as may be seen in his description of jack martin and peter in a tale of a tub see vol i of this edition in spite however of this attitude swift seems to have remained silent on the question of the repeal of the test act for a period of more than twenty years he had published his letter from a member of the house of commons in ireland in 1708 but it was not until 1731 that he again took up his pen against dissent  in that year and in the two subsequent ones the presbyterians fought very strenuously for a mitigation of the laws against them and the literature which has been handed down to us of that fight is by no means insignificant the tracts which we know to be of swifts authorship are the presbyterians plea of merit

suggests life of jonathan swift 1824 p401 that probably more occasional tracts were written by the dean on the subject of the test than have yet been recovered the curious student may satisfy himself on this matter by reading the above pamphlets neither monck mason dr barrett nor scott himself cared to take upon themselves to decide whether any of them were by swift nor have any of the deans modern biographers thrown any light on the subject a point to note in this consideration is the fact that faulkner in his collected edition of swifts works did not include any of these and as he himself published many of them he would certainly have known something of their authorship  swifts agitation against the repeal of the test was so successful that the irish house of commons found itself in a majority for the test in addition to the prose tracts swift wrote a stinging poem on the words brother protestants and fellow christians an expression familiarly used by the advocates for the repeal of the test act this poem brought him into personal conflict with one serjeant bettesworth who openly swore before many hundreds of people that upon the first opportunity by the help of ruffians he would murder or maim the dean of st patricks the lines to which the serjeant took exception were    thus at the bar the booby bettesworth   though halfacrown oerpays his sweats worth   who knows in law nor text nor margent   calls singleton his brother serjeant  the affair ended in the further ridicule of bettesworth who complained in the irish house of commons that the lampoon had cost him £1200 a year a full account of swifts interview with bettesworth is given by swift in a letter to the duke of dorset dated january 17331734 and the grub street journal for august 9th 1734 tells how the inhabitants of the city of dublin came to swifts aid perhaps bettesworth finally found consolation in the thought satirically suggested by dr william dunkin that after all it might be worth the loss of money to be transmitted to posterity in dr swifts works    for had he not pointed me out i had slept till   een doomsday a poor insignificant reptile   half lawyer half actor pert dull and

demigoddized by madrigal namby1  footnote 1 namby was the nickname for ambrose philips  scott and all swifts editors and biographers state that the presbyterians plea of merit was first published in 1731 what authority they have for this statement i have not been able to discover my own research has so far failed to find a copy of it with the date 1731 on the titlepage the edition upon which the present text is based is that printed by faulkner in 1733 of the titlepage of which a facsimile is here given this i believe to be the first edition scott following nichols states that in the first edition of the plea the ode to humphry french esq appeared and that in the second edition this ode was omitted to make room for the narrative of the several attempts made for the repeal of the test act now in the british museum there are two undated editions of the plea which bear out this statement but these as the titlepages inform us are london reprints of dublin editions since however no one has recorded dated dublin editions corresponding exactly to these london reprints the evidence of the reprints counts for very little monck mason a very accurate authority usually says distinctly the plea was printed in 1731 and a second edition issued in 1733 but one gathers from his note that the only edition in his possession was that of 1733 and this has neither the ode nor the narrative the last page consisting of an advertisement of the collected editions of swifts works which faulkner was then preparing the first of the london reprints bears no indication of any particular edition the second has the words second edition on the titlepage in his note to this reprint of the narrative and in his life of swift scott refers to a dublin periodical called the correspondent in which the narrative was first published as being printed in 1731 the only edition of this periodical of which i have either seen or heard is the copy in the british museum and that copy distinctly states printed by james hoey in skinnerrow 1733 if therefore this be the first edition of the correspondent the narrative must be ascribed to the year 1733 and the second edition of the plea to the end of the same or the beginning of the following year i conclude therefore first that the first edition of the plea is that dated dublin 1733 second that the undated london reprint with the ode is of the same year and lastly that the undated second london reprint with the narrative is probably of the year 1734 examining scotts text of this tract one is forced to the conclusion that he could not have seen the dublin edition of 1733 whereas its almost exact similarity to the london reprint suggests that he used that for purposes of the present text all three editions have been collated with one another and with those given by faulkner hawkesworth and scott  ts    the   presbyterians plea   of   merit   in order to take off the   test   impartially examined    illustration    dublin    printed and fold by george faulkner in   essexstreet opposite to the bridge 1733   we have been told in the common newspapers that all attempts are to be made this session by the presbyterians and their abettors for taking off the test as a kind of preparatory step to make it go down smoother in england for if once their light would so shine the papists delighted with the blaze would all come in and dance about it this i take to be a prudent method like that of a discreet physician who first gives a new medicine to a dog before he prescribes it to a human creature1  footnote 1 see note prefixed to the letter on the sacramental test ts  the presbyterians have ever since the revolution directed their learned casuists to employ their pens on this subject by shewing the merits and pretensions upon which they claim this justice as founded upon the services they did toward the restoration of king charles the second and at the revolution under the prince of orange which pleas i take to be the most singular in their kind that ever were offered in the face of the sun against the most glaring light of truth and against a continuation of public facts known to all europe for twenty years together i shall therefore impartially examine the merits and conduct of the presbyterians upon those two great events and the pretensions to favour which they challenge upon them  soon after the reformation of the church in england under edward the sixth upon queen marys succeeding to the crown who restored popery many protestants fled out of england to escape the persecution raised against the church as her brother had left it established some of these exiles went to geneva which city had received the doctrine of calvin and rejected the government of bishops with many other refinements these english exiles readily embraced the geneva system and having added farther improvements of their own upon queen marys death returned to england where they preached up their own opinions inveighing bitterly against episcopacy and all rites and ceremonies however innocent and ancient in the church building upon this foundation to run as far as possible from popery even in the most minute and indifferent circumstances this faction under the name of puritan became very turbulent during the whole reign of queen elizabeth and were always discouraged by that wise queen as well as by her two successors however their numbers as well as their insolence and perverseness so far increased that soon after the death of king james the first many instances of their petulancy and scurrility are to be seen in their pamphlets written for some years after which was a trade they began in the days of queen elizabeth particularly with great rancour against the bishops the habits and the ceremonies such were that scurrilous libel under the title of martin marprelate2 and several others and although the earl of clarendon3 tells us that until the year 1640 as i remember the kingdom was in a state of perfect peace and happiness without the least appearance of thought or design toward making any alterations in religion or government yet i have found by often rummaging for old books in little britain and ducklane a great number of pamphlets printed from the year 15304 to 1640 full of as bold and impious railing expressions against the lawful power of the crown and the order of bishops as ever were uttered during the rebellion or the whole subsequent tyranny of that fanatic anarchy however i find it manifest that puritanism did not erect itself into a new separate species of religion till some time after the rebellion began for in the latter times of king james the first and the former part of his son there were several puritan bishops and many puritan private clergymen while people went as their inclinations led them to hear preachers of each party in the parish churches for the puritan clergy had received episcopal orders as well as the rest but soon after the rebellion broke out the term puritan gradually dropped and that of presbyterian succeeded which sect was in two or three years established in all its forms by what they called an ordinance of the lords and commons without consulting the king who was then at war against his rebels and from this period the church continued under persecution till monarchy was restored in the year 1660  footnote 2 according to mr edward arber the writers of these famous tracts were the rev john penny and job throckmorton esq he calls these two writers the most eminent prose satirists of the elizabethan age for a full account of these tracts and the controversy see mr arbers introductory sketch to the martin marprelate controversy 15881590 1879 english scholars library the aim of the marprelate writers is thus stated by the able author of that sketch to ridicule and affront a proud hierarchy the bishops endowed with large legal means of doing mischief and not wanting in will to exercise these powers to the full the spell of the unnatural civil power which had been enjoyed by the papal prelates in this country remained with their protestant successors until this controversy broke it so that from this time onwards the bishops set about to forge a new spell the divine right of their temporal position and power which hallucination was dissolved by the long parliament from which time a bishop has usually been considered no more than a man preface pp 1112 ts  footnote 3 edward hyde earl of clarendon 16081674 the author of the history of the great rebellion ts  footnote 4 the original edition has 1630 ts  in a year or two after we began to hear of a new party risen and growing in the parliament as well as the army under the name of independent it spread indeed somewhat more in the latter but not equal with the presbyterians either in weight or number till the very time5 that the king was murdered  footnote 5 faulkner prints until some time before the king was murderedts  when the king who was then a prisoner in the isle of wight had made his last concessions for a peace to the commissioners of the parliament who attended him there upon their return to london they reported his majestys answer to the house whereupon a number of moderate members who as ludlow6 says had secured their own terms with his majesty managed with so much art as to obtain a majority in a thin house for passing a vote that the kings concessions were a ground for future settlement but the great officers of the army joining with the discontented members came to a resolution of excluding all those who had consented to that vote which they executed in a military way ireton told fairfax the general7 a rigid presbyterian of this resolution who thereupon issued his orders for drawing out the army the next morning and placing guards in westminsterhall the court of requests and the lobby who in obedience to the general in conjunction with those members who opposed the vote would let no member enter the house except those of their own party upon which the question for bringing the king to justice was immediately put and carried without opposition that i can find then an order was made for his trial the time and place appointed the judges named of whom fairfax himself was one although by the advice or threats of his wife he declined sitting among them however by fresh orders under his own hand which i have seen in print he appointed guards to attend the judges at the trial and to keep the city in quiet as he did likewise to prevent any opposition from the people upon the day of execution  footnote 6 edmund ludlow 16201693 lieutenantgeneral of the parliamentary army he was one of the judges of king charless trial and who signed the deathwarrant he died at vevay in switzerland where he had fled on finding that charless judges were not included in the act of indemnity his memoirs were printed at vevay in 169816993 vols 8vo it is to these swift refers ts  footnote 7 ireton and fairfax were two famous generals of the parliamentary army serving with cromwell ts  from what i have already deduced it appears manifest that the differences between those two sects presbyterian and independent did not then amount to half so much as what there is between a whig and tory at present among us the design of utterly extirpating monarchy and episcopacy was equally the same in both evidently the consequence of the very same principles upon which the presbyterians alone began continued and would have ended in the same events if towards the conclusion they had not been bearded by that new party with whom they could not agree about dividing the spoil however they held a good share of civil and military employments during the whole time of the usurpation whose names and actions and preferments are frequent in the accounts of those times for i make no doubt that all the prudent presbyterians complied in proper seasons falling in with the stream and thereby got that share in employments which many of them held to the restoration and perhaps too many of them after in the same manner we find our wisest tories in both kingdoms upon the change of hands and measures at the queens death have endeavoured for several years by due compliances to recover the time they had lost by a temporary obstinacy wherein they have well succeeded according to their degrees of merit of whose names i could here make honourable mention if i did not fear it might offend their modesty  as to what is alleged that some of the presbyterians declared openly against the kings murder i allow it to be true but from what motives no other can possibly be assigned than perfect spite rage and envy to find themselves wormed out of all power by a new infant spawn of independents sprung from their own bowels it is true the differences in religious tenets between them are very few and trifling the chief quarrel as far as i remember relating to congregational and national assemblies but wherever interest or power thinks fit to interfere it little imports what principles the opposite parties think fit to charge upon each other for we see at this day that the tories are more hated by the whole set of zealous whigs than the very papists themselves and in effect as much unqualified for the smallest office although both these parties assert themselves to be of the same religion in all its branches of doctrine and discipline and profess the same loyalty to the same protestant king and his heirs  if the reader would know what became of this independent party upon whom all the mischief is charged by their presbyterian brethren he may please to observe that during the whole usurpation they contended by degrees with their parent sect and as i have already said shared in employments and gradually after the restoration mingled with the mass of presbyterians lying ever since undistinguished in the herd of dissenters  the presbyterian merit is of as little weight when they allege themselves instrumental towards the kings restoration the kingdom grew tired with those ridiculous models of government first by a house of lords and commons without a king then without bishops afterwards by a rump8 and lords temporal then by a rump alone next by a single person for life in conjunction with a council by agitators by majorgenerals by a new kind of representatives from the three kingdoms by the keepers of the liberties of england with other schemes that have slipped out of my memory cromwell was dead his son richard a weak ignorant wretch who gave up his monarchy much in the same manner with the two usurping kings of brentford9 the people harassed with taxes and other oppressions the kings party then called the cavaliers began to recover their spirits the few nobility scattered through the kingdom who lived in a most retired manner observing the confusion of things could no longer endure to be ridden by bakers cobblers brewers and the like at the head of armies and plundering everywhere like french dragoons the rump assembly grew despicable to those who had raised them the city of london exhausted by almost twenty years contributing to their own ruin declared against them the rump after many deaths and resurrections was in the most contemptuous manner kicked out and burned in effigy the excluded members were let in a free parliament called in as legal a manner as the times would allow and the king restored  footnote 8 this name was given to that part of the house of commons which remained after the moderate men had been expelled by militaryforce s  footnote 9 in the rehearsal  the second claim of presbyterian merit is founded upon their services against the dangerous designs of king james the second while that prince was using all his endeavours to introduce popery which he openly professed upon his coming to the crown to this they add their eminent services at the revolution under the prince of orange  now the quantum of presbyterian merit during the four years reign of that weak bigoted and illadvised prince as well as at the time of the revolution will easily be computed by a recourse to a great number of histories pamphlets and public papers printed in those times and some afterwards beside the verbal testimonies of many persons yet alive who are old enough to have known and observed the dissenters conduct in that critical period  it is agreed that upon king charles the seconds death soon after his successor had publicly owned himself a roman catholic he began with his first caresses to the church party from whom having received very cold discouraging answers he applied to the presbyterian leaders and teachers being advised by the priests and popish courtiers that the safest method toward introducing his own religion would be by taking off the sacramental test and giving a full liberty of conscience to all religions i suppose that professed christianity it seems that the presbyterians in the latter years of king charles the second upon account of certain plots allowed by bishop burnet to be genuine had been for a short time forbid to hold their conventicles whereupon these charitable christians out of perfect resentment against the church received the gracious offers of king james with the strongest professions of loyalty and highest acknowledgments for his favour i have seen several of their addresses full of thanks and praises with bitter insinuations of what they had suffered putting themselves and the papists upon the same foot as fellowsufferers for conscience and with the style of our brethren the roman catholics about this time began the project of closeting which has since been practised many times with more art and success where the principal gentlemen of the kingdom were privately catechised by his majesty to know whether if a new parliament were called they would agree to pass an act for repealing the sacramental test and establishing a general liberty of conscience but he received so little encouragement that despairing of success he had recourse to his dispensing power which the judges had determined to be part of his prerogative by colour of this determination he preferred several presbyterians and many papists to civil and military employments while the king was thus busied it is well known that monsieur fagel the dutch envoy in london delivered the opinion of the prince and princess of orange concerning the repeal of the test whereof the king had sent an account to their highnesses to know how far they approved of it the substance of their answer as reported by fagel was this that their highnesses thought very well of a liberty of conscience but by no means of giving employments to any other persons than those who were of the national church this opinion was confirmed by several reasons i cannot be more particular not having the paper by me although it hath been printed in many accounts of those times and thus much every moderate churchman would perhaps submit to but to trust any part of the civil power in the hands of those whose interest inclination conscience and former practices have been wholly turned to introduce a different system of religion and government hath very few examples in any christian state nor any at all in holland the great patroness of universal toleration  upon the first intelligence king james received of an intended invasion by the prince of orange among great numbers of papists to increase his troops he gave commissions to several presbyterians some of whom had been officers under the rump and particularly he placed one richards a noted presbyterian at the head of a regiment who had been governor of wexford in cromwells time and is often mentioned by ludlow in his memoirs this regiment was raised in england against the prince of orange the colonel made his son a captain whom i knew and who was as zealous a presbyterian as his father however at the time of the princes landing the father easily foreseeing how things would go went over like many others to the prince who continued him in his regiment but coming over a year or two after to assist in raising the siege of derry he behaved himself so like either a coward or a traitor that his regiment was taken from him  i will now consider the conduct of the church party during the whole reign of that unfortunate king they were so unanimous against promising to pass an act for repealing the test and establishing a general liberty of conscience that the king durst not trust a parliament but encouraged by the professions of loyalty given him by his presbyterian friends went on with his dispensing power  the church clergy at that time are allowed to have written the best collection of tracts against popery that ever appeared in england which are to this day in the highest esteem but upon the strictest enquiry i could never hear of above one or two papers published by the presbyterians at that time upon the same subject seven great prelates he of canterbury among the rest were sent to the tower for presenting a petition wherein they desired to be excused in not obeying an illegal command from the king the bishop of london dr compton10 was summoned to answer before the commissioners for ecclesiastical affairs for not suspending dr sharp11 afterwards archbishop of york by the kings command if the presbyterians expressed the same zeal upon any occasion the instances of it are not as i can find left upon record or transmitted by tradition the proceedings against magdalen college in oxford for refusing to comply with the kings mandate for admitting a professed papist upon their foundation are a standing proof of the courage and firmness in religion shewn by that learned society to the ruin of their fortunes the presbyterians know very well that i could produce many more instances of the same kind but these are enough in so short a paper as i intend at present  footnote 10 henry compton 16321713 educated at oxford was created bishop of london in 1675 during the revolution of 1688 he conveyed the princess anne from london to nottingham after he crowned her queen of england he was the author of a few works of little importance such as the treatise on the holy communion ts  footnote 11 john sharp 16441714 was educated at cambridge and created archbishop of york in 1691 he gave great offence to james ii by his preaching against roman catholicism this is the same archbishop sharp who prevented swifts appointment to a bishopric by urging that the author of a tale of a tub was not a proper person to hold such an office see note prefixed to a tale of a tub vol i p xcvi of this edition of swifts works ts  it is indeed very true that after king william was settled on the english throne the presbyterians began to appear and offer their credentials and demand favour and the new king having been originally bred a calvinist was desirous enough to make them easy if that would do it by a legal toleration although in his heart he never bore much affection to that sect nor designed to favour them farther than it stood with the present scheme of politics as i have long since been assured by the greatest men of whig principles at that time in england  it is likewise true nor will it be denied that when the king was possessed of the english crown and the remainder of the quarrel was left to be decided in this kingdom the presbyterians wisely chose to join with the protestant army rather than with that of king james their old friend whose affairs were then in a manner desperate they were wise enough to know that this kingdom divided against itself could never prevail against the united power of england they fought pro aris et focis for their estates and religion which latter will never suffer so much by the church of england as by that of rome where they are counted heretics as well as we and consequently they have no other game to play but what merit they can build upon having joined with a protestant army under a king they acknowledged to defend their own liberties and properties against a popish enemy under an abdicated king is i confess to me absolutely inconceivable and i believe will equally be so for ever to any reasonable man  when these sectaries were several years ago making the same attempt for abolishing the test many groundless reports were industriously and seasonably spread of an invasion threatened by the pretender on the north of ireland at which time the presbyterians in their pamphlets argued in a menacing manner that if the pretender should invade those parts of the kingdom where the numbers and estates of dissenters chiefly lay they would sit still and let us fight our own battles12 since they were to reap no advantage whichever side should be victors if this were the course they intended to take in such a case i should desire to know how they could contrive safely to stand neuters otherwise than by a compact with the pretender and his army to support their neutrality and protect them against the forces of the crown this is a necessary supposition because they must otherwise have inevitably been a prey to both however by this frank declaration they sufficiently shewed their goodwill and confirmed the common charge laid at their door that a scottish or northern presbyterian hates our episcopal established church more than popery itself and the reason for this hatred is natural enough because it is the church alone that stands in the way between them and power which popery doth not  footnote 12 see the poem reprinted by monck mason history of st patricks p 388 note entitled    the grunters request   to take off the test  in which the poet advises his lauds to faight yer ain battel ts  upon this occasion i am in some doubt whether the political spreaders of those chimerical invasions made a judicious choice in fixing the northern parts of ireland for that romantic enterprize nor can i well understand the wisdom of the presbyterians in countenancing and confirming those reports because it seems to cast a most infamous reflection upon the loyalty and religious principles of their whole body for if there had been any truth in the matter the consequence must have been allowed that the pretender counted upon more assistance from his fathers friends the presbyterians by choosing to land in those very parts where their number wealth and power most prevailed rather than among those of his own religion and therefore in charity to this sect i rather incline to believe that those reports of an invasion were formed and spread by the race of small politicians in order to do a seasonable job  as to popery in general which for a thousand years past hath been introducing and multiplying corruptions both in doctrine and discipline i look upon it to be the most absurd system of christianity professed by any nation but i cannot apprehend this kingdom to be in much danger from it the estates of papists are very few crumbling into small parcels and daily diminishing their common people are sunk in poverty ignorance and cowardice and of as little consequence as women and children their nobility and gentry are at least onehalf ruined banished or converted they all soundly feel the smart of what they suffered in the last irish war some of them are already retired into foreign countries others as i am told intend to follow them and the rest i believe to a man who still possess any lands are absolutely determined never to hazard them again for the sake of establishing their superstition if it hath been thought fit as some observe to abate of the laws rigour against popery in this kingdom i am confident it was done for very wise reasons considering the situation of affairs abroad at different times and the interest of the protestant religion in general and as i do not find the least fault in this proceeding so i do not conceive why a sunk discarded party who neither expect nor desire anything more than a quiet life should under the names of highflyers jacobites and many other vile appellations be charged so often in print and at common tables with endeavouring to introduce popery and the pretender while the papists abhor them above all other men on account of severities against their priests in her late majestys reign when the now disbanded reprobate party was in power this i was convinced of some years ago by a long journey into the southern parts where i had the curiosity to send for many priests of the parishes i passed through and to my great satisfaction found them everywhere abounding in professions of loyalty to the late king george for which they gave me the reasons abovementioned at the same time complaining bitterly of the hardships they suffered under the queens last ministry  i return from this digression to the modest demands of the presbyterians for a repeal of the sacramental test as a reward for their merits at the restoration and the revolution which merits i have fairly represented as well as my memory will allow me if i have committed any mistakes they must be of little moment the facts and principal circumstances are what i have obtained and digested from reading the histories of those times written by each party and many thousands have done the same as well as i who i am sure have in their minds drawn the same conclusions  this is the faction and these the men who are now resuming their applications and giving in their bills of merit to both kingdoms upon two points which of all others they have the least pretensions to offer i have collected the facts with all possible impartiality from the current histories of those times and have shewn although very briefly the gradual proceedings of those sectaries under the denomination of puritans presbyterians and independents for about the space of an hundred and eighty years from the beginning of queen elizabeth to this present time but notwithstanding all that can be said these very schismatics for such they are in temporals as well as spirituals are now again expecting soliciting and demanding not without insinuating threats according to their custom that the parliament should fix them upon an equal foot with the church established i would fain know to what branch of the legislature they can have the forehead to apply not to my lords the bishops who must have often read how the predecessors of this very faction acting upon the same principles drove the whole bench out of the house who were then and hitherto continue one of the three estates not to the temporal peers the second of the three estates who must have heard that immediately after those rebellious fanatics had murdered their king they voted a house of lords to be useless and dangerous and would let them sit no longer otherwise than when elected as commoners not to the house of commons who must have heard that in those fanatic times the presbyterian and independent commanders in the army by military power expelled all the moderate men out of the house and left a rump to govern the nation lastly not to the crown which those very saints destined to rule the earth trampled under their feet and then in cold blood murdered the blessed wearer  but the session now approaching and a clan of dissenting teachers being come up to town from their northern headquarters accompanied by many of their elders and agents and supported by a general contribution to solicit their establishment with a capacity of holding all military as well as civil employments i think it high time that this paper should see the light however i cannot conclude without freely confessing that if the presbyterians should obtain their ends i could not be sorry to find them mistaken in the point which they have most at heart by the repeal of the test i mean the benefit of employments for after all what assurance can a scottish northern dissenter born on irish ground have that he shall be treated with as much favour as a true scot born beyond the tweed  i am ready enough to believe that all i have said will avail but little i have the common excuse of other men when i think myself bound by all religious and civil ties to discharge my conscience and to warn my countrymen upon this important occasion it is true the advocates for this scheme promise a new world after this blessed work shall be completed that all animosities and faction must immediately drop that the only distinction in this kingdom will then be of papist and protestant for as to whig and tory high church and low church jacobite and hanoverian court and country party english and irish interests dissenters and conformists new light and old light anabaptist and independent quaker and muggletonian they will all meet and jumble together into a perfect harmony at the sessions and assizes on the bench and in the revenues and upon the whole in all civil and military trust not excepting the great councils of the nation for it is wisely argued thus that a kingdom being no more than a larger knot of friends met together it is against the rules of good manners to shut any person out of the company except the papists who profess themselves of another club  i am at a loss to know what arts the presbyterian sect intends to use in convincing the world of their loyalty to kingly government which long before the prevalence or even the birth of their independent rivals as soon as the kings forces were overcome declared their principles to be against monarchy as well as episcopacy and the house of lords even till the king was restored at which event although they were forced to submit to the present power yet i have not heard that they did ever to this day renounce any one principle by which their predecessors then acted yet this they have been challenged to do or at least to shew that others have done it for them by a certain doctor13 who as i am told has much employed his pen in the like disputes i own they will be ready enough to insinuate themselves into any government but if they mean to be honest and upright they will and must endeavour by all means which they shall think lawful to introduce and establish their own scheme of religion as nearest approaching to the word of god by casting out all superstitious ceremonies ecclesiastical titles habits distinctions and superiorities as rags of popery in order to a thorough reformation and as in charity bound to promote the salvation of their countrymen wishing with st paul that the whole kingdom were as they are but what assurance will they please to give that when their sect shall become the national established worship they will treat us dissenters as we have treated them was this their course of proceeding during the dominion of the saints were not all the remainders of the episcopal church in those days especially the clergy under a persecution for above a dozen years equal to that of the primitive christians under heathen emperors that this proceeding was suitable to their principles is known enough for many of their preachers then writ books expressly against allowing any liberty of conscience in a religion different from their own producing many arguments to prove that opinion and among the rest one frequently insisted on that allowing such a liberty would be to establish iniquity by a law many of these writings are yet to be seen14 and i hear have been quoted by the doctor above mentioned  footnote 13 dr tisdal in a tract entitled the case of the sacramental test stated and argued tisdal died 4th june 1736 ts  footnote 14 see many hundred quotations to prove this in the treatise called scotch presbyterian eloquence note in faulkners edition 1738  as to their great objection of prostituting that holy institution the blessed sacrament by way of a test before admittance into any employment i ask whether they would not be content to receive it after their own manner for the office of a judge for that of a commissioner in the revenue for a regiment of horse or to be a lord justice i believe they would scruple it as little as a long grace before and after dinner which they can say without bending a knee for as i have been told their manner of taking bread and wine in their conventicles is performed with little more solemnity than at their common meals and therefore since they look upon our practice in receiving the elements to be idolatrous they neither can nor ought in conscience to allow us that liberty otherwise than by connivance and a bare toleration like what is permitted to the papists but lest we should offend them i am ready to change this test for another although i am afraid that sanctified reason is by no means the point where the difficulty pinches and only offered by pretended churchmen as if they could be content with our believing that the impiety and profanation of making the sacrament a test were the only objection i therefore propose that before the present law be repealed another may be enacted that no man shall receive any employment before he swears himself to be a true member of the church of ireland in doctrine and discipline c and that he will never frequent or communicate with any other form of worship it shall likewise be further enacted that whoever offends c shall be fined five hundred pounds imprisoned for a year and a day and rendered incapable of all public trust for ever otherwise i do insist that those pious indulgent external professors of our national religion shall either give up that fallacious hypocritical reason for taking off the test or freely confess that they desire to have a gate wide open for every sect without any test at all except that of swearing loyalty to the king which however considering their principles with regard to monarchy yet unrenounced might if they would please to look deep enough into their own hearts prove a more bitter test than any other that the law hath yet invented  for from the first time that these sectaries appeared in the world it hath been always found by their whole proceeding that they professed an utter hatred to kingly government i can recollect at present three civil establishments where calvinists and some other reformers who rejected episcopacy possess the supreme power and these are all republics i mean holland geneva and the reformed swiss cantons i do not say this in diminution or disgrace to commonwealths wherein i confess i have much altered many opinions under which i was educated having been led by some observation long experience and a thorough detestation for the corruptions of mankind insomuch that i am now justly liable to the censure of hobbes who complains that the youth of england imbibe ill opinions from reading the histories of ancient greece and rome those renowned scenes of liberty and every virtue  but as to monarchs who must be supposed well to study and understand their own interest they will best consider whether those people who in all their actions preachings and writings have openly declared themselves against regal power are to be safely placed in an equal degree of favour and trust with those who have been always found the true and only friends to the english establishment from which consideration i could have added one more article to my new test if i had thought it worth my time  i have been assured by some persons who were present that several of these dissenting teachers upon their first arrival hither to solicit the repeal of the test were pleased to express their gratitude by publicly drinking the healths of certain eminent patrons whom they pretend to have found among us if this be true and that the test must be delivered up by the very commanders appointed to defend it the affair is already in effect at an end what secret reasons those patrons may have given for such a return of brotherly love i shall not inquire for o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel                                   a narrative  of the several attempts which the dissenters of  ireland have made for a repeal of the  sacramental test   note  this tract occupies nos iii and iv of a periodical paper called the correspondent originally printed at dublin by james hoey in skinnerrow 1733 the text here given is that of the original correspondent that given by scott and nichols is evidently taken from the london reprint it will be seen that the matter as it was originally printed contains much more than was afterwards reprinted i have indicated in footnotes where scotts omissions occur the title of the periodical runs the correspondent no iii no iv humbly inscribed to the conforming nobility and gentry of ireland nos i and ii dealt with old and new light presbyterians but these are not by swift in nicholss edition this pamphlet appears in the second volume of the supplement to dr swifts works 1779 p 307 see note to the previous pamphlet where the question of the date of the first publication of this tract is discussed it may be as monck mason suggests history of st patricks p 389 note h that a separate and second edition of this narrative was likewise printed of the same size as the presbyterians plea and bound up occasionally with that pamphlet but such an edition i have never seen the only reprint of the time examined is that by a dodd of temple bar affixed to the second london edition of the presbyterians plea of merit and the date of which may be put down to 1734  ts    a narrative of the several attempts   which the dissenters   of ireland have made for   a repeal of the sacramental   test   my intention is in this and some following correspondents to vindicate the test act from the insolent aspersions which are thrown upon it and to answer objections which are raised against it particularly by an anonymous author in a paper entitled the nature and consequence of the sacramental test considered c printed anno 1731 upon the opening of the last session of parliament and now republished  as a proper introduction to this i must take leave to put the conformists in mind of what upon recollection they may very well remember and which in some measure they have been formerly apprised of and that is in1 a narrative of the several attempts which the dissenters of ireland have made for a repeal of the sacramental test  when the oath of supremacy was repealed which had been the churchs great security since the second of queen elizabeth against both papists and presbyterians who equally refused it i presume it is no secret now to tell the reader that the repeal of that oath opened a sluice and let in such a current of dissenters into some of our corporations as bore down all before them  footnote 1 from the beginning of this paragraph to the word in is omitted in the editions issued by scott and nichols the words a narrative sacramental test are used by scott as part of the subtitle of the tract but he adds the date 1731 this is a mistake since the correspondent appeared in 1733 and if it did appear in the second edition of the plea that edition was published either in the same or in the following year ts  although the sacramental test had been for a considerable time in force in england yet that law did not reach ireland where the church was more oppressed by dissenters and where her most sanguine friends were glad to compound to preserve what legal security she had left rather than to attempt any new or even to recover what she had lost and in truth they had no reason to expect it at a time when the dissenters had the interest to have a motion made and debated in parliament that there might be a temporary repeal of all the penal laws against them and when they were so flushed with the conquest they had made in some corporations as to reject all overtures of a toleration and to that end had employed mr boyse2 to write against it with the utmost contempt calling it a stone instead of bread a serpent instead of a fish  footnote 2 in his note scott calls him samuel boyse but he is distinctly mentioned further on in the tract as jo boyse the rev joseph boyse was a native of leeds who had settled in dublin in 1683 as jointpastor with dr daniel williams he died in poverty in 1728 and in the same year his works were published in two folio volumes his son samuel boyse the poet died in 1749 ts  when the church was in this situation the clause of the sacramental test was happily sent over from england tacked to the popery bill which alarmed the whole body of the dissenters to that degree that their managers began to ply with the greatest artifice and industry to prevent its passing into a law but to the honour of that parliament be it spoken the whole body of both lords and commons some few excepted passed the clause with great readiness and defended it afterwards with as great resolution  the immediate consequence of this law was the recovery of several corporations which the conformists had given to the dissenters and the preservation of others to which the enterprising people had made very bold and quick approaches  it was hoped that this signal defeat would have discouraged the dissenters from any further attempts against a law which had so unanimously passed both houses but the contrary soon appeared for upon meeting of the parliament held by the earl of pembroke3 they quickly reassumed their wonted courage and confidence and made no doubt but they should either procure an absolute repeal thereof or get it so far relaxed as that they might be admitted to offices of military trust to this they apprehended themselves encouraged by a paragraph in his excellencys speech to both houses which they applied to themselves which was that the queen would be glad of any expedient for strengthening the interests of her protestant subjects of ireland  footnote 3 it will be remembered that the earls viceroyalty commenced april 7th 1707 it was in his train that swift came to england in that yearts  the advocates for the dissenters immediately took hold of this handle and in order to prepare the way for this expedient insisted boldly upon their merit and loyalty charged the church with persecution and extolled their signal behaviour in the late revolution to that degree as if by their signal prowess they had saved the nation  but all this was only to prepare the way for the grand engine which was forming to beat down this law and that was their expedient addresses  the first of this kind was from a provincial synod of the northern dissenters beginning with high encomiums upon themselves and as high demands from the public for their untainted loyalty in all turns of government which they said was the natural consequence of their known principles expressions which had they been applied to them by their adversaries must have been understood as spoken ironically and indeed to have been the greatest sarcasm imaginable upon them especially when we consider the insolent treatment given to her majesty in the very same address for immediately after they pass this compliment upon themselves they tell her majesty they deeply regret the sacramental test and frankly declared that neither the gentlemen nor people of their persuasion could they must mean would serve her whatever exigencies might arise unless that law was repealed  the managers for the kirk following this precedent endeavoured to obtain addresses to the same purpose from the corporations and though they proved unsuccessful in most they procured them from several of our most considerable conforming corporations and that too at a critical juncture when numbers of scotch presbyterians who had deserved well in the affair of the union and could not be rewarded in england where the test act was in force stood ready to overrun our preferments as soon as the test should be repealed in ireland  but after all when it came to a decisive trial in the house of commons the dissenters were defeated  when the managers found the house of commons could not be brought into that scheme of an expedient to be offered by them their refinement upon this was to move for an address that the house would accept of an expedient from her majesty but this also was rejected for by this project the managers would have led the queen into this dilemma either to disoblige the whole body of the dissenters by refusing to name the expedient or else to give up the conformists to the insults and encroachments of the dissenters by the repeal of that law which was declared by the house of lords to be the great security of the established church and of the english interest of ireland  the next attempt they made against the test was during the government of lord wharton4  footnote 4 wharton was appointed lord lieutenant on november 25th 1708 this wharton is the thomas lord wharton against whom swift wrote one of his bitterest and most personal attacks he was the eldest son of philip lord wharton and was created a marquis by george i he died april 12th 1715 the ballad of lillibullero is attributed to him ts  the dissenters seemed more resolute now than ever to have the test repealed especially when his excellency had declared from the throne that they were neither to be persecuted nor molested for they who had all along called the test act a persecution might reasonably conclude that grievance would be removed when they were told by the chief governor that they were not to be even molested but to their great confusion they were soon undeceived when they found upon trial that the house of commons would not bear the least motion towards it  their movements to repeal the test act being stopped this way the managers were obliged to take several other ways to come at it and at the time that some pretended to soothe others seemed to threaten even the legislature with a view as must be presumed that those whom they could not cajole might be frightened into it5  footnote 5 scott omits the words from with a view to the end of the paragraph ts  there happened about the time when the project of the expedient was on foot an excellent occasion to express their resentments against this law and that was when great numbers of them refused the oath of allegiance and to oppose the pretender insisting upon a repeal of the test act as the condition of their arming in defence of their queen and country  the government was not reduced to such straits as to submit to that condition and the test stood firm in spite of both the dissenters and the pretender until the latter was driven from our coasts and then one would have thought the hopes of the former would have vanished with him  but it proved quite contrary for those sons of the earth rebounding with fresh vigour from their falls recovered new strength and spirit from every defeat and the next attempt was bolder considering the circumstances they were in than any they had made before  the case was this the house of lords of ireland had accused them to the queen of several illegal practices which highly concerned the safety of our constitution both in church and state the particulars of which charge were summed up in a representation from the lords to this effect  that they the dissenters had opposed and persecuted the conformists in those parts where their power prevailed had invaded their congregations propagated their schism in places where it had not the least footing formerly that they were protected from a legal prosecution by a noli prosequi in the case of drogheda  that they refused to take conforming apprentices and confined trade among themselves exclusive of the conformists  that in their illegal assemblies they had prosecuted and censured their people for being married according to law  that they have thrown public and scandalous reflections upon the episcopal order and upon our laws particularly the sacramental test and had misapplied the royal bounty of £1200 per annum in propagating their schism and undermining the church and had exercised an illegal jurisdiction in their presbyteries and synods c  to this representation of the lords the dissenters remonstrate in an address to the queen or rather an appeal to their own people in which although it is evident they were conscious of those crimes whereof they stood accused as appears by the evasions they make to this high charge yet even under these circumstances such was their modesty they pressed for a repeal of the test act by the modest appellation of a grievance and odious mark of infamy c of which more hereafter there is one particular in another address which i cannot omit the house of lords in their representation had accused one dissenting teacher in particular well known to mr boyse the charge was in these words  nor has the legislature itself escaped the censure of a bold author of theirs who has published in print that the sacramental test is only an engine to advance a state faction and to debase religion to serve base and unworthy purposes  to this mr boyse answers in an address to the queen in the year 1712 subscribed only by himself and five more dissenting teachers in these words  as to this part of their lordships complaint we beg leave to lay before your majesty the words of that author which are these  nor can we altogether excuse those who turn the holy eucharist into an engine to advance a state faction and endeavour to confine the communion table of our lord by their arbitrary enclosures to a party religion is thereby debased to serve mean and unworthy purposes we humbly conceive that the author in that passage makes no mention of the legislature at all c and we cannot omit on this occasion to regret it as the great unhappiness of this kingdom that dissenters should now be disabled from concurring in the defence of it in any future exigency and danger and should have the same infamy put upon them with the irish papists  we therefore humbly hope that your majesty shall consider how little real grounds there are for those complaints made by their lordships  what a mixture of impudence and prevarication is this that one dissenting teacher accused to his prince of having censured the legislature should presume backed only by five more of the same quality and profession to transcribe the guilty paragraph and to secure his meaning from all possibility of being mistaken annex another to it wherein they rail at that very law for which he in so audacious a manner censured the queen and parliament and at the same time should expect to be acquitted by her majesty because he had not mentioned the word legislature tis true the word legislature is not expressed in that paragraph but let mr boyse6 say what other power but the legislature could in this sense turn the holy eucharist into an engine to advance a state faction or confine offices of trust or the communion table of our lord by their arbitrary enclosures to a party it is plain he can from his principles intend no others but the legislators of the sacramental test though at the same time i freely own that this is a vile description of them for neither have they by this law made the sacramental test an engine to advance but rather to depress a state faction nor have they made any arbitrary enclosures of the communion table of our lord since as many as please may receive the sacrament with us in our churches and those who will not may freely as before receive it in their separate congregations nor in the last place is religion hereby debased to serve mean and unworthy purposes nor is it any more than all lawgivers do by enjoining an oath of allegiance and making that a religious test for an oath is an act of religious worship as well as the eucharist  footnote 6 scott remarks that mr boyse is here and in other places spoken of as alive which was the case i presume when the tract first appeared in the correspondent the tract however was printed in the periodical in 1733 and boyse died in 1728 it may be that when swift first wrote the narrative mr boyse was alive in that case its date must be put down to an earlier year than either 1733 or even 1731 or it may be that the style of so referring to boyse was used for an argumentative effect to appeal to any reader who was in sympathy with boyses opinions ts  upon the whole is not this an instance of prodigious boldness in mr boyse backed with only five dissenting teachers thus to recriminate upon the irish house of lords as they were pleased to call them in the title of their printed address and almost to insist with her majesty upon the repeal of a law which she had stamped with her royal authority but a few years before  the7 next instance of the resolution of the dissenters against this law was the attempt made during the government of the duke of shrewsbury8  footnote 7 from this paragraph to the end is taken from the correspondent no iv the text as given by scott is considerably altered from that which appeared in the periodical ts  footnote 8 from september 1713 until the queens death in 1714 ts  this attack was by the whole compacted body of their teachers and elders with a formidable engine called a representation of grievances in which after they had reviled the test act with the same odious appellations and insisted upon the same insolent arguments for the repeal thereof which they had formerly urged to the queen they expressed themselves to his grace in these words  we beg leave to say that those persons must be inexcusable and chargeable with all the bad consequences that may follow who in such a kingdom as this disable disgrace and divide protestants a thing that ought not to be done at any time or in any place much less than in this c  is it possible to conceive any thing more provoking than this humble supplication of these remonstrators does not this sound like a demand of the repeal of the test at the peril of those who dare refuse it is it not an application with a hat in one hand and a sword in the other and that too in the style of a king of ulster to a king of connaught repeal the test or if you dont  but to proceed in this narrative notwithstanding the defeat of the dissenters in england in their late attempt against the test their brethren in ireland are so far from being discouraged that they seem now to conceive greater hopes of having it repealed here than ever9 what grounds they have for these hopes was a secret to us and i presume to themselves however private whispers begin now to grow into general rumours and their managers proceed with great art and assiduity from feeling of pulses to telling of noses  footnote 9 from this word to the end of this paragraph is omitted by scottts  in order to prepare necessaries and furnish topics for this attempt there was a paper printed upon the opening of last session and now republished entitled the nature and consequences of the sacramental test considered with reasons humbly offered for the repeal thereof10  footnote 10 this pamphlet was reprinted in london in 1732 see note prefixed to the presbyterians plea of merit ts  it is not my intention to follow this author through all the mazes and windings of his reasoning upon this subject which in truth seem such incoherent shreds that it is impossible to tie them together and therefore what i purpose is to answer such objections to the test as are advanced either by this author or any other which have any appearance of reason or plausibility  i know it is not prudent to despise an adversary nor fair to prepossess readers before i show this bold and insolent writer in his proper figure and dress and therefore however i may take him to be a feeble advocate for the repeal of the test in point of reasoning yet i freely allow him to be a most resolute champion in point of courage who has with such intrepidity attacked not only the first enactors of this law but all such who shall continue it by giving their negatives to a repeal i will in this correspondent only transcribe a few quotations from this author to shew the gallantry of this aggressor  page the 19th11 he says the truth is the imposition of the test and continuing it in such a state of the kingdom appears at first sight so great an absurdity in politics as can never be accounted for  footnote 11 page 23 in edition london 1732 ts  who are these absurd politicians who first passed and secondly continue the sacramental test in all the preceding attempts of the dissenters to repeal it are they not the majority of both houses of parliament12  footnote 12 omitted by scott in his edition 1824 ts  but to strengthen his reflections page 2613 he gives the whole legislature to understand that continuing the test does not become the wisdom and justice of the legislature under the pretence of its being for the advantage of the state when it is really prejudicial to it and further tells us it infringes on the indisputable rights of the dissenters  footnote 13 pp 3233 in london reprint scott places passages here in quotation marks the original in the correspondent has no such marks nor are the passages quoted verbatim from the pamphlet referred tots  page the 57th14 he says the gentlemen of the house of commons who framed the bill to prevent the farther growth of popery instead of approving the test clause which was inserted publicly declared their dislike to it and their resolution to take the first opportunity of repealing it though at that time they unwillingly passed it rather than lose a bill they were so fond of this resolution has not been as yet fulfilled for what reasons our worthy patriots themselves know best  footnote 14 p 71 in london reprint ts  i should be glad this author would inform us who and how many of those members joined in this resolution to repeal the test or where that resolution is to be found which he mentions twice in the same paragraph surely not in the books of the house of commons  if not suppose some few gentlemen in the house of commons and to be sure very few they were who publicly declared their dislike to it or entered into any resolution this i think he should have explained and not insinuated so gross a reflection on a great majority of the house of commons who first passed this law and have ever since opposed all attempts to repeal it these are the gentleman whom in sarcasm and irony he is pleased to call the worthy that is the unworthy patriots themselves  but to mention no more he concludes his notable piece with these remarkable words pages 626315  footnote 15 p 79 of london reprint ts  thus it appears with regard to the protestant succession which has now happily taken place how reasonable it is to repeal the sacramental test and that granting that favour to the dissenters which by the way cannot be granted but by parliament can be disagreeable to none who have a just sense of the many blessings we enjoy by the protestant succession in his majestys royal family  i will not trouble the reader with any more quotations to the same purpose out of this libel for so i must now call it but take leave to make some general observations on those paragraphs i have mentioned  footnote this paragraph is omitted by scott ts  i conceive it will be readily allowed that in all applications either from any body of men or from any particular subject to the legislature or any branch thereof we are to take the highest encomiums as purely complimental if there be the least insinuation of disrespect or reflection therein in such cases i say you are to take the compliments in the lowest sense but all the reflections in the highest sense the expressions can bear inasmuch as the first may be presumed matter of form the latter must be matter of resentment  footnote this paragraph is much curtailed by scott who combines it with the next paragraph of the present text ts  now if we apply this observation to what this bold adventurer has said with respect to the legislators of the sacramental test does he not directly and plainly charge them with injustice imprudence gross absurdity and jacobitism let the most prejudiced reader that is not predetermined against conviction say whether this libeller of the parliament has not drawn up a high charge against the makers and continuers of this law  it is readily allowed that this has been the old style of these champions who have attacked the test as in the instances before mentioned with this difference that he descends lower in his charge and has been more particular than any of his brethren  footnote this paragraph is omitted by scott ts  notwithstanding my resentment which to be sure he does not value i would be sorry he should bring upon himself the resentment of those he has been so free with and i cannot help advising him to take all possible care and use all effectual means to conjure the printer corrector and publisher of this libel to secrecy that however the author may be suspected he may not be discovered upon the whole is not this author justly to be reputed a defamer till he produces instances wherein the conforming nobility and gentry of ireland have shown their disaffection to the succession of the illustrious house of hanover  did they ever refuse the oath of abjuration or support any conforming nonjuring teachers in their congregations did ever any conforming gentlemen or common people refuse to be arrayed when the militia was raised upon the invasion of the pretender did any of them ever shew the least reluctance or make any exception against their officers whether they were dissenters or churchmen  it may be said that from these insinuations i would have it understood that the dissenters encouraged some of their teachers who refused the oath of abjuration and that even in the article of danger when the pretender made his attempt in scotland our northern presbyterians shewed great reluctance in taking arms upon the array of militia  i freely own it is my intention and i must affirm both facts to be true however they have the assurance to deny it  what can be more notorious than the protection countenance and support which was continued to riddall mcbride and mccrackan16 who absolutely refused the oath of abjuration and yet were continued to teach in their congregations after they returned from scotland when a prosecution was directed and a council in criminal causes was sent down to the county of antrim to prosecute them  footnote 16 riddall mcbride and mccrackan were three presbyterian clergymen who refused to take the oath of abjuring the pretender of riddall and mccrackan little is known but john mcbride 16511718 according to the writer in the dictionary of national biography was born in ulster and graduated at glasgow he was a strong advocate of the hanoverian succession but avoided the oath of abjuration in 1703 by retiring to glasgow he returned to belfast in 1713 and died there his humorous excuse for nonabjuration is recorded by the writer of the article in the dictionary and is worth repeating once upon a time there was a bearn that coud not be persuaded to bann the deel because he did not know but he might soon come into his clutches ts  with respect to the parliament did ever any house of commons shew greater alacrity in raising money and equipping ships in defence of the king than the last house did upon the expected invasion of the pretender and did ever any parliament give money with greater unanimity for the support of the crown than the present has done whatever the wants of their private families might be and must a very great majority of those persons be branded with the infamous aspersion of disaffection to the illustrious house of hanover should they refuse to give their voices for the repeal of the test  i am fully persuaded that this author and his fellowlabourers do not believe one word of this heavy charge but their present circumstances are such that they must run all hazards  in many places their congregations are subdivided and have chosen an old and new light teacher and consequently those stipends must support two which were enjoyed by one before17  footnote 17 this paragraph is omitted by scott ts  a great number of the nonconforming gentlemen daily leave them though they have not made any convert to their persuasion among the conforming gentlemen of fortune many who were nonconformists themselves and many men whose parents were elders or rigid nonconformists are now constant communicants and justices of peace in their several counties insomuch that it is highly probable should the test continue twenty years longer there would not be a gentleman left to solicit a repeal  i shall hereafter take occasion to shew how inconsiderable they are for their numbers and fortunes who can be served or obliged by this repeal which number is daily lessening  the dissenting teachers are sufficiently aware that the general conformity of the gentlemen will be followed by the conformity of numbers of the people and should it not be so that they will be but poorly supported by them that by the continuance of the test their craft will be in danger to be set at nought and in all probability will end in a general conformity of the presbyterians to the established church  so that they have the strongest reasons in the world to press for the repeal of the test but those reasons must have equal force for the continuance of it with all that wish the peace of the church and state and would not have us torn in pieces with endless and causeless divisions  there is one short passage more i had like to have omitted which our author leaves as a sting in the tail of his libel his words are these page 59th18  footnote 18 p 74 in london reprint ts  the truth is no one party of a religious denomination in britain or ireland were so united as they the dissenters indeed no one but they in an inviolable attachment to the protestant succession to detect the folly of this assertion i subjoin the following letter from a person of known integrity and inviolably attached to the protestant succession as any dissenter in the kingdom i mean mr warreng of warrengstown then a member of parliament and commissioner of array in the county of down upon the expected invasion of the pretender  this letter was writ in a short time after the array of the militia for the truth of which i refer to mr warreng himself  sir  that i may fulfil your desire by giving you an account how the dissenters in my neighbourhood behaved themselves when we were threatened with an invasion of the pretender be pleased to know that upon an alarm given of his being landed near derry none were more zealous and ready in setting watch and keeping guard than they to prevent such disorders as might happen at that time by illdesigning persons passing through and disturbing the peace of the country  but when the government thought fit to have the kingdom arrayed and sent commissioners into these parts some time after it appeared that the dissenters had by that time been otherwise instructed for several who were so forward before behaved themselves after a very different manner some refusing and others with reluctancy appearing upon the array to be enlisted and serve in the militia  this behaviour surprised me so much that i took occasion to discourse several of them over whom i thought i had as much influence as any other person and found them upon the common argument of having their hands tied up by a late act of parliament c whereupon i took some pains to shew the act to them and wherein they were mistaken i further pressed their concurrence with us in procuring the common peace and security of our country and though they seemed convinced by what i said yet i was given to understand their behaviour was according to the sentiments of some persons whom they thought themselves obliged to observe or be directed by c                                   quaeries  wrote by  dr j swift in the year 1732  relating to the sacramental test      very proper to be read at this time by every member of the     established church   note  the text of this tract is based on that of the original broadside collated with those given by faulkner and scott in 1733 was also published a broadside with the title queries upon the demand of the presbyterians to have the sacramental test repealed at this session of parliament these queries seem to be based on those by swift though they are not quite the same  ts    quaeries wrote by dr j swift   in the year 1732   query  whether hatred and violence between parties in a state be not more inflamed by different views of interest than by the greater or lesser differences between them either in religion or government  whether it be any part of the question at this time which of the two religions is worse popery or fanaticism or not rather which of the two having both the same good will is in the hopefullest condition to ruin the church  whether the sectaries whenever they come to prevail will not ruin the church as infallibly and effectually as the papists  whether the prevailing sectaries could allow liberty of conscience to dissenters without belying all their former practice and almost all their former writings  whether many hundred thousand scotch presbyterians are not full as virulent against the episcopal church as they are against the papists or as they would have us think the papists are against them  whether the dutch who are most distinguished for allowing liberty of conscience do ever admit any persons who profess a different scheme of worship from their own into civil employments although they may be forced by the nature of their government to receive mercenary troops of all religions  whether the dissenters ever pretended until of late years to desire more than a bare toleration  whether if it be true what a sorry pamphleteer asserts who lately writ for repealing the test that the dissenters in this kingdom are equally numerous with the churchmen it would not be a necessary point of prudence by all proper and lawful means to prevent their further increase  the great argument given by those whom they call low church men to justify the large tolerations allowed to dissenters hath been that by such indulgencies the rancour of those sectaries would gradually wear off many of them would come over to us and their parties in a little time crumble to nothing   query  if what the above pamphleteer asserts that the sectaries are in equal numbers with conformists it doth not clearly follow that those repeated tolerations have operated directly contrary to what those low church politicians pretended to foresee and expect  whether any clergyman however dignified or distinguished if he think his own profession most agreeable to holy scriptures and the primitive church can really wish in his heart that all sectaries should be upon an equal foot with the churchmen in the point of civil power and employments  whether episcopacy which is held by the church to be a divine and apostolic institution be not a fundamental point of religion particularly in that essential one of conferring holy orders  whether by necessary consequences the several expedients among the sectaries to constitute their teachers are not absolutely null and void  whether the sectaries will ever agree to accept ordination only from bishops  whether the bishops and clergy will be content to give up episcopacy as a point indifferent without which the church can well subsist  whether that great tenderness towards sectaries which now so much prevails be chiefly owing to the fears of popery or to that spirit of atheism deism scepticism and universal immorality which all good men so much lament  granting popery to have many more errors in religion than any one branch of the sectaries let us examine the actions of both as they have each affected the peace of these kingdoms with allowance for the short time which the sectaries had to act in who are in a manner but of yesterday the papists in the time of king james ii used all endeavours to establish their superstition wherein they failed by the united power of english church protestants with the prince of oranges assistance but it cannot be asserted that these bigotted papists had the least design to depose or murder their king much less to abolish kingly government nor was it their interest or inclination to attempt either  on the other side the puritans who had almost from the beginning of queen elizabeths reign been a perpetual thorn in the churchs side joining with the scotch enthusiasts in the time of king charles the first were the principal cause of the irish rebellion and massacre by distressing that prince and making it impossible for him to send over timely succours and after that pious prince had satisfied his parliament in every single point to be complained of the same sectaries by poisoning the minds and affections of the people with the most false and wicked representations of their king were able in the compass of a few years to embroil the three nations in a bloody rebellion at the expense of many thousand lives to turn the kingly power into anarchy or murder their prince in the face of the world and in their own style to destroy the church root and branch  the account therefore stands thus the papists aimed at one pernicious act which was to destroy the protestant religion wherein by gods mercy and the assistance of our glorious king william they absolutely failed the sectaries attempted the three most infernal actions that could possibly enter into the hearts of men forsaken by god which were the murder of a most pious king the destruction of our monarchy and the extirpation of the church and succeeded in them all  upon which i put the following queries whether any of those sectaries have ever yet in a solemn public manner renounced any one of those principles upon which their predecessors then acted  whether considering the cruel persecutions of the episcopal church during the course of that horrid rebellion and the consequences of it until the happy restoration is it not manifest that the persecuting spirit lieth so equally divided between the papists and the sectaries that a feather would turn the balance on either side  and therefore lastly whether any person of common understanding who professeth himself a member of the church established although perhaps with little inward regard to any religion which is too often the case if he loveth the peace and welfare of his country can after cool thinking rejoice to see a power placed again in the hands of so restless so ambitious and so merciless a faction to act over all the same parts a second time  whether the candour of that expression so frequent of late in sermons and pamphlets of the strength and number of the papists in ireland can be justified for as to their number however great it is always magnified in proportion to the zeal or politics of the speaker and writer but it is a gross imposition upon common reason to terrify us with their strength for popery under the circumstances it lieth in this kingdom although it be offensive and inconvenient enough from the consequences it hath to increase the rapine sloth and ignorance as well as poverty of the natives is not properly dangerous in that sense as some would have us take it because it is universally hated by every party of a different religious profession it is the contempt of the wise the best topic for clamours of designing men but the real terror only of fools the landed popish interest in england far exceedeth that among us even in proportion to the wealth and extent of each kingdom the little that remaineth here is daily dropping into protestant hands by purchase or descent and that affected complaint of counterfeit converts will fall with the cause of it in half a generation unless it be raised or kept alive as a continual fund of merit and eloquence the papists are wholly disarmed they have neither courage leaders money or inclinations to rebel they want every advantage which they formerly possessed to follow that trade and wherein even with those advantages they always miscarried they appear very easy and satisfied under that connivance which they enjoyed during the whole last reign nor ever scrupled to reproach another party under which they pretend to have suffered so much severity  upon these considerations i must confess to have suspended much of my pity towards the great dreaders of popery many of whom appear to be hale strong active young men who as i am told eat drink and sleep heartily and are very cheerful as they have exceeding good reason upon all other subjects however i cannot too much commend the generous concern which our neighbours and others who come from the same neighbourhood are so kind to express for us upon this account although the former be further removed from the dangers of popery by twenty leagues of salt water but this i fear is a digression  when an artificial report was raised here many years ago of an intended invasion by the pretender which blew over after it had done its office the dissenters argued in their talk and in their pamphlets after this manner applying themselves to those of the church gentlemen if the pretender had landed as the law now standeth we durst not assist you and therefore unless you take off the test whenever you shall happen to be invaded in earnest if we are desired to take up arms in your defence our answer shall be pray gentlemen fight your own battles1 we will lie by quietly conquer your enemies by yourselves if you can we will not do your drudgery this way of reasoning i have heard from several of their chiefs and abettors in an hundred conversations and have read it in twenty pamphlets and i am confident it will be offered again if the project should fail to take off the test  footnote 1 see note p 40 referring to the poem    the grunters request   to take off the test ts  upon which piece of oratory and reasoning i form the following query whether in case of an invasion from the pretender which is not quite so probable as from the grand signior the dissenters can with prudence and safety offer the same plea except they shall have made a previous stipulation with the invaders and whether the full freedom of their religion and trade their lives properties wives and children are not and have not always been reckoned sufficient motives for repelling invasions especially in our sectaries who call themselves the truest protestants by virtue of their pretended or real fierceness against popery  whether omitting or neglecting to celebrate the day of the martyrdom of the blessed king charles the first enjoined by act of parliament can be justly reckoned a particular and distinguishing mark of good affection to the present government  whether in those churches where the said day is observed it will fully answer the intent of the said act if the preacher shall commend excuse palliate or extenuate the murder of that royal martyr and lay the guilt of that horrid rebellion with all its consequences the following usurpations the entire destruction of the church the cruel and continual persecutions of those who could be discovered to profess its doctrines with the ensuing babel of fanaticism to the account of that blessed king who by granting the petition of right and passing every bill that could be asked for the security of the subject had by the confession even of those wicked men before the war began left them nothing more to demand  whether such a preacher as i have named whereof there have been more than one not many years past even in the presence of viceroys who takes that course as a means for promotion may not be thought to step a little out of the common road in a monarchy where the descendants of that most blessed martyr have reigned to this day  i ground the reason of making these queries on the title of the act to which i refer the reader                                   the advantages  proposed by repealing the sacramental  test  impartially considered  by the rev dr swift dean of st patricks  dublin printed london reprinted for j roberts at the oxford arms in warwick lane 1732 price sixpence   note  the text here given is that of the london reprint of the original edition which has been collated with that given by faulkner vol iv 1735 in 1790 the tract was reprinted by j walters and it is evidently from this reprint that scott obtained his text for the two agree in almost every particular  ts    the advantages proposed by repealing   the sacramental   test impartially   considered  whoever writes impartially upon this subject must do it not only as a mere secular man but as one who is altogether indifferent to any particular system of christianity and i think in whatever country that religion predominates there is one certain form of worship and ceremony which is looked upon as the established and consequently only the priests of that particular form are maintained at the public charge and all civil employments are bestowed among those who comply at least outwardly with the same establishment  this method is strictly observed even by our neighbours the dutch who are confessed to allow the fullest liberty to conscience of any christian state and yet are never known to admit any persons into religious or civil offices who do not conform to the legal worship as to their military men they are indeed not so scrupulous being by the nature of their government under a necessity of hiring foreign troops of whatever religious denomination upon every great emergency and maintaining no small number in time of peace  this caution therefore of making one established faith seems to be universal and founded upon the strongest reasons the mistaken or affected zeal of obstinacy and enthusiasm having produced such a number of horrible destructive events throughout all christendom for whoever begins to think the national worship is wrong in any important article of practice or belief will if he be serious naturally have a zeal to make as many proselytes as he can and a nation may possibly have an hundred different sects with their leaders every one of which hath an equal right to plead they must obey god rather than man must cry aloud and spare not must lift up their voice like a trumpet  this was the very case of england during the fanatic times and against all this there seems to be no defence but that of supporting one established form of doctrine and discipline leaving the rest to a bare liberty of conscience but without any maintenance or encouragement from the public  wherever this national religion grows so corrupt or is thought to do so by a very great majority of learned1 people joined to the governing party whether prince or senate or both it ought to be changed provided the work might be done without blood or tumults2 yet whenever such a change shall be made some other establishment must succeed although for the worse allowing all deviations that would break the union to be only tolerated in this sense those who affirm that every law which is contrary to the law of god is void in itself seem to be mistaken for many laws in popish kingdoms and states many more among the turks and perhaps not a few in other countries are directly against the divine laws and yet god knows are very far from being void in the executive parts  footnote 1 scott has landed ts  footnote 2 scott has confusion ts  thus for instance if the three estates of parliament in england whereof the lords spiritual3 are one should agree and obtain the royal assent to abolish episcopacy together with the liturgy and the whole frame of the english church as burthensome dangerous and contrary to holy scripture and that presbytery anabaptism quakerism independency4 or any other subdivided sect among us should be established in its place without question all peaceable subjects ought passively to submit and the predominant sect must become the religion established the public maintaining no other teachers nor admitting any persons of a different religious profession into civil offices at least if their intention be to preserve the nation in peace  footnote 3 scott inserts here the words who represent the church ts  footnote 4 scott inserts here muggletonianism brownism familism ts  supposing then that the present system of religion were abolished and presbytery which stands much the fairest with its synods and classes and all its forms and ceremonies essential or circumstantial were erected into the national worship their teachers and no others could have any legal claim to be supported at the public charge whether by stipends or tithes and only the rest of the same faith to be capable of civil employments  if there be any true reasoning in what i have laid down it should seem that the project now in agitation for repealing the test act and yet leaving the name of an establishment to the present national church is altogether inconsistent and may admit of consequences which those who are the most indifferent to any religion at all are possibly not aware of  i presume whenever the test shall be repealed which obliges all men who enter into office under the crown to receive the sacrament according to the rites of the church of ireland the way to employments will immediately be left open to all dissenters except papists whose consciences can suffer them to take the common oaths in such cases prescribed after which they are qualified to fill any lay station in this kingdom from that of chief governor to an exciseman  thus of the three judges on each bench the first may be a presbyterian the second a freewill baptist and the third a churchman the lord chancellor may be an independent the revenues may be managed by seven commissioners of as many different sects and the like of all other employments not to mention the strong probability that the lawfulness of taking oaths may be revealed to the quakers who then will stand upon as good a foot for preferment as any other loyal subject it is easy5 to imagine under such a motley administration of affairs what a clashing there will be of interests and inclinations what puttings and haulings backwards and forwards what a zeal and bias in each religionist to advance his own tribe and depress the others for i suppose nothing will be readier granted than that how indifferent soever most men are in faith and morals yet whether out of artifice natural complexion or love of contradiction none are more obstinate in maintaining their own opinions and worrying all who differ from them than those who publicly shew the least sense either of religion or common honesty  footnote 5 scott has obvious ts  as to the latter bishop burnet tells us that the presbyterians in the fanatic times professed themselves to be above morality which as we find in some of their writings was numbered among the beggarly elements and accordingly at this day no scruples of conscience with regard to conformity are in any trade or calling inconsistent with the greatest fraud oppression perjury or any other vice  this brings to my memory a passage in montaigne of a common prostitute who in the storming of a town when a soldier came up to her chamber and offered violence to her chastity rather chose to venture her neck by leaping out of the window than suffer a rape yet still continued her trade of lewdness whilst she had any customers left6  footnote 6 the passage referred to by swift is to be found in the first chapter of the second book of florios translation of montaignes essaysof the inconstancie of our actions ts  i confess that in my private judgment an unlimited permission of all sects whatsoever except papists to enjoy employments would be less pernicious to the public than a fair struggle between two contenders because in the former case such a jumble of principles might possibly have the effect of contrary poisons mingled together which a strong constitution might perhaps be able for some time to survive  but however i shall take the other and more probable supposition that this battle for employments is to be fought only between the presbyterians and those of the church yet established i shall not enter into the merits of either side by examining which of the two is the better spiritual economy or which is most suited to the civil constitution but the question turns upon this point when the presbyterians shall have got their share of employments which must be one full half or else they cannot look upon themselves as fairly dealt with i ask whether they ought not by their own principles and by the strictest rules of conscience to use the utmost of their skill power and influence in order to reduce the whole kingdom to an uniformity in religion both as to doctrine and discipline most agreeable to the word of god wherein if they can succeed without blood as under the present disposition of things it is very possible they may it is to be hoped they will at last be satisfied only i would warn them of a few difficulties the first is for compromising that important controversy about the old light and the new7 which otherwise may after this establishment split them as wide as papist and protestant whig and tory or churchmen and dissenters and consequently the work will be to begin again for in religious quarrels it is of little moment how few or small the differences are especially when the dispute is only about power thus the jealous presbyterians of the north are more alienated from the established clergy than from the romish priests taxing the former with idolatrous worship as disguised papists ceremonymongers and many other terms of arts and this for a very powerful reason because the clergy stand in their way which the popish priests do not thus i am assured that the quarrel between old and new light men is managed with more rage and rancour than any other dispute of the highest importance and this because it serves to lessen or increase their several congregations from whom they receive their contributions  footnote 7 see the correspondent nos 1 and 2 1733 and note prefixed to present reprint of narrative of several attempts for the repeal of the sacramental test ts  another difficulty which may embarrass the presbyterians after their establishment will be how to adjust their claim of the kirks independency on the civil power with the constitution of this monarchy a point so delicate that it hath often filled the heads of great patriots with dangerous notions of the churchclergy without the least ground of suspicion  as to the presbyterians allowing liberty of conscience to those of episcopal principles when their own kirk is predominant their writers are so universally agreed in the negative as well as their practice during olivers reign that i believe no reasonable churchman who must then be a dissenter will expect it  i shall here take notice that in the division of employments among the presbyterians after this approaching repeal of the test act supposing them in proper time to have an equal share i compute the odds will be three or four to one on their side in any further scheme they may have towards making their religion national for i reckon all those gentlemen sent over from england whatever religion they profess or have been educated in to be of that party since it is no mark of prudence for any persons to oppose the current of a nation where they are in some sort only sojourners unless they have it in direction  if there be any maxim in politics not to be controlled it must be the following that those whose private interest is united with the interest of their country supposing them to be of equal understanding with the rest of their neighbours will heartily wish that the nation should thrive out of these are indubitably excepted all persons who are sent from another kingdom to be employed in places of profit or power because they can possibly bear no affection to the place where they sojourn even for life their sole business being to advance themselves by following the advice of their principals i except likewise those persons who are taken into offices although natives of the land because they are greater gainers while they keep their offices than they could possibly be by mending the miserable condition of their country  i except thirdly all hopers who by balancing accounts with themselves turn the scale on the same side because the strong expectation of a good certain salary will outweigh the loss by bad rents received out of lands in moneyless times  if my lords the bishops who i hear are now employed in a scheme for regulating the conduct and maintenance of the inferior clergy shall in their wisdom and piety and love of the church consent to this repeal of the test i have not the least doubt that the whole reverend body will cheerfully submit to their spiritual fathers of whose paternal tenderness for their welfare they have already found so many amazing instances  i am not therefore under the least concern about the clergy on this account they will for some time be no great sufferers by this repeal because i cannot recollect among all our sects any one that gives latitude enough to take the oaths required at an institution to a churchliving and until that bar shall be removed the present episcopal clergy are safe for two years although it may be thought somewhat unequal that in the northern parts where there may be three dissenters to one churchman the whole revenue should be engrossed by one who hath so small a part of the cure  it is true indeed that this disadvantage which the dissenters at present lie under of a disability to receive churchpreferments will be easily remedied by the repeal of the test for the dissenting teachers are under no incapacity of accepting civil and military employments wherein they agree perfectly with the popish clergy among whom great cardinals and prelates have been commanders of armies chief ministers knights of many orders ambassadors secretaries of state and in most high offices under the crown although they assert the indelible character which no sectaries among us did ever assume but that many both presbyterians and independents commanders as well as private soldiers were professed preachers in the time of their dominion is allowed by all cromwell himself was a preacher and hath left us one of his sermons in print8 so was col howard sir george downing9 and several others whose names are on record i can therefore see no reason why a painful presbyterian teacher as soon as the test shall be repealed may not be privileged to hold along with his spiritual office and stipend a commission in the army or the civil list in commendam for as i take it the church of england is the only body of christians which in effect disqualifies those who are employed to preach its doctrine from sharing in the civil power further than as senators which however was an institution10 begun in times of popery many hundred years before the reformation and woven with the very institution of this limited monarchy  footnote 8 scott inserts here the words exactly in the same style and manner with those of our modern presbyterian teachers ts  footnote 9 sir george downing 16231684 born in england completed his education at harvard mass usa in 1650 we hear of him as scoutmaster general of cromwells army in scotland he wrote many of the letters in mercurius politicus distinguished himself principally as cromwells ambassador in france and holland through thomas howard however he obtained an opportunity while legate in holland for the rump parliament for ingratiating himself in charles iis favour this howard was brother to the earl of suffolk as a consequence of this favour downing was made a baronet at the restoration and although a man of undoubted ability his character has come down to us by no means free from taint many of his despatches are quoted by clarendon in that writers great history downing also wrote a reply to the remarks of the deputies of the statesgeneral upon sir g downings memorial 1665 and discourses vindicating his royal master from a libel 1672 ts  footnote 10 scott has instead of which however was an institution the words yet this was a privilege ts  there is indeed another method by which the stipends of dissenting teachers may be raised and the farmer much relieved if it should be thought proper to reward a people so deserving and so loyal by their principles every bishop upon the vacancy of a churchliving can sequester the profits for the use of the next incumbent upon a lapse of half a year the donation falls to the archbishop and after a full year to the crown during pleasure therefore it would be no hardship for any clergyman alive if in those parts of ireland where the number of sectaries much exceed that of the conformists the profits when sequestered might be applied to the support of the dissenting teacher who hath so many souls to take care of whereby the poor tenants would be much relieved in these hard times and in a better condition to pay their rents  but there is another difficulty in this matter against which a remedy doth not so readily occur for supposing the test act repealed and the dissenters in consequence fully qualified for all secular employments the question may still be put whether those of ireland will be often the persons on whom they shall be bestowed because it is imagined there may be another seminary11 in view more numerous and more needy as well as more meriting and more easily contented with such low offices as some nearer neighbours hardly think it worth stirring from their chimneysides to obtain and i am told it is the common practice of those who are skilled in the management of bees that when they see a foreign swarm at some distance approaching with an intention to plunder their hives these artists have a trick to divert them into some neighbouring apiary there to make what havoc they please this i should not have hinted if i had not known it already to have gotten ground in many suspecting heads for it is the peculiar talent of this nation to see dangers afar off to all which i can only say that our native presbyterians must by pains and industry raise such a fund of merit as will answer to a birth six degrees more to the north if they cannot arrive at this perfection as several of the established church have compassed by indefatigable pains i do not well see how their affairs will much mend by repealing the test for to be qualified by law for12 an employment and yet to be disqualified in fact as it will much increase the mortification so it will withdraw the pity of many among their wellwishers and utterly deprive them of that merit they have so long made of being a loyal true protestant people persecuted only for religion  footnote 11 scotland  footnote 12 scott has to accept ts  if this happen to be their case they must wait maturity of time till they can by prudent gentle steps make their faith become the religion established in the nation after which i do not in the least doubt their taking the most effectual methods to secure their power against those who must then be dissenters in their turn whereof if we may form a future opinion from present times and the disposition of dissenters who love to make a thorough reformation the number and qualities will be very inconsiderable  thus i have with the utmost sincerity after long thinking given my judgment upon this arduous affair but with the utmost deference and submission to public wisdom and power                                   reasons humbly offered to the  parliament of ireland for  repealing the sacramental  test c   note  in the 4to edition of swifts works 1755 is given the following note  the author having before examined the presbyterians plea of merit with respect to their own principles and practices has in this tract put them in the balance against papists  in a reprint of this tract in the second volume of political tracts 2 vols 8vo 1738 london is the following advertisementneither scott faulkner nor hawkesworth give this probably it appeared in the first edition but as i have not been able to come across this i am not certain  in the years 1732 and 1733 an attempt was made for repealing the test act in ireland introductory of a like attempt in england the various arguments for it were answered in every shape but no way more effectually than by examining what pretence the presbyterians had to share in all the privileges of government either from their own principles and behaviour or compared with those of other sectaries under the former head they were fully silenced by our author in the presbyterians plea of merit impartially examined they are now put in the balance with papists whom though they have sometimes styled their brethren in adversity yet when placed in competition they will hate as brethren likewise but let them here dispute the preference and then put in their claim to be part of the establishment the arguments pretended to be urged by the roman catholics in this tract says monck mason consist partly of true statements and partly of ironical allusions which are combined together into such a trellis work as to render it almost unassailable  the text here given is that from the 4to edition 1755 of swifts works collated with that in the second volume of political tracts above referred to  ts    reasons   humbly offered to the parliament of ireland   for repealing the   sacramental test c   in favour of   the catholics   otherwise called roman catholics   and by their illwishers papists    drawn partly from arguments as they are   catholics and partly from arguments   common to them with their brethren the   dissenters    written in the year 1733   it is well known that the first conquerors of this kingdom were english catholics subjects to english catholic kings from whom by their valour and success they obtained large portions of land given them as a reward for their many victories over the irish to which merit our brethren the dissenters of any denomination whatsoever have not the least pretensions  it is confessed that the posterity of those first victorious catholics were often forced to rise in their own defence against new colonies from england who treated them like mere native irish with innumerable oppressions depriving them of their lands and driving them by force of arms into the most desolate parts of the kingdom till in the next generation the children of these tyrants were used in the same manner by new english adventurers which practice continued for many centuries but it is agreed on all hands that no insurrections were ever made except after great oppressions by fresh invaders whereas all the rebellions of puritans presbyterians independents and other sectaries constantly began before any provocations were given except that they were not suffered to change the government in church and state and seize both into their own hands which however at last they did with the murder of their king and of many thousands of his best subjects  the catholics were always defenders of monarchy as constituted in these kingdoms whereas our brethren the dissenters were always republicans both in principle and practice it is well known that all the catholics of these kingdoms both priests and laity are true whigs in the best and most proper sense of the word bearing as well in their hearts as in their outward profession an entire loyalty to the royal house of hanover in the person and posterity of george ii against the pretender and all his adherents to which they think themselves bound in gratitude as well as conscience by the lenity wherewith they have been treated since the death of queen anne so different from what they suffered in the four last years of that princess during the administration of that wicked minister the earl of oxford  the catholics of this kingdom humbly hope that they have at least as fair a title as any of their brother dissenters to the appelation of protestants they have always protested against the selling dethroning or murdering their kings against the usurpations and avarice of the court of rome against deism atheism socinianism quakerism muggletonianism fanaticism brownism as well as against all jews turks infidels and heretics whereas the title of protestants assumed by the whole herd of dissenters except ourselves dependeth entirely upon their protesting against archbishops bishops deans and chapters with their revenues and the whole hierarchy which are the very expressions used in the solemn league and covenant1 where the word popery is only mentioned ad invidiam because the catholics agree with the episcopal church in those fundamentals  footnote 1   a solemn league and covenant entered into between the scots and english fanatics in the rebellion against king charles i 1643 by which they solemnly engaged among other things to endeavour the extirpation of prelacy that is church government by archbishops bishops deans archdeacons and all other episcopal officers depending on that hierarchy h  although the catholics cannot deny that in the great rebellion against king charles i more soldiers of their religion were in the parliament army than in his majestys troops and that many jesuits and friars went about in the disguise of presbyterian and independent ministers to preach up rebellion as the best historians of those times inform us yet the bulk of catholics in both kingdoms preserved their loyalty entire  the catholics have some reason to think it a little hard when their enemies will not please to distinguish between the rebellious riot committed by that brutal ruffian sir phelim oneal2 with his tumultuous crew of rabble and the forces raised afterwards by the catholic lords and gentlemen of the english pale in defence of the king after the english rebellion began it is well known that his majestys affairs were in great distraction some time before by an invasion of the covenanting scottish kirk rebels and by the base terms the king was forced to accept that they might be kept in quiet at a juncture when he was every hour threatened at home by that fanatic party which soon after set all in a flame and if the catholic army in ireland fought for their king against the forces sent over by the parliament then in actual rebellion against him what person of loyal principles can be so partial to deny that they did their duty by joining with the marquis of ormonde and other commanders who bore their commissions from the king for which great numbers of them lost their lives and forfeited their estates a great part of the latter being now possessed by many descendants from those very men who had drawn their swords in the service of that rebellious parliament which cut off his head and destroyed monarchy and what is more amazing although the same persons when the irish were entirely subdued continued in power under the rump were chief confidants and faithful subjects to cromwell yet being wise enough to foresee a restoration they seized the forts and castles here out of the hands of their old brethren in rebellion for the service of the king just saving the tide and putting in a stock of merit sufficient not only to preserve the lands which the catholics lost by their loyalty but likewise to preserve their civil and military employments or be higher advanced  footnote 2 sir phelim oneill 16041683 one of the most picturesque characters of irish history for his share in the rebellion of 1641 he was expelled from the irish house of commons the rebellion was an attempt to assist charles as against the parliament and oneill forged a commission purporting to come from the king authorizing the irish to rise in his favour the scottish settlers in ulster on whom oneill relied for aid disappointed him and he thereupon set to work to reduce all their towns the famous siege of drogheda was one of the many incidents of his campaign he joined forces with his kinsman owen roe oneill but a jealous difference on his part urged sir phelim to support ormonde in 1640 in that generals endeavours for a peace sir phelim however was not included in the benefit of the articles of kilkenny and a price was placed on his head he was betrayed by philip roe mchugh oneill brought to dublin and executed as a traitor ts  those insurrections wherewith the catholics are charged from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the great english rebellion were occasioned by many oppressions they lay under they had no intention to introduce a new religion but to enjoy the liberty of preserving the old the very same which their ancestors professed from the time that christianity was first introduced into this island which was by catholics but whether mingled with corruptions as some pretend doth not belong to the question they had no design to change the government they never attempted to fight against to imprison to betray to sell to bring to a trial or to murder their king the schismatics acted by a spirit directly contrary they united in a solemn league and covenant to alter the whole system of spiritual government established in all christian nations and of apostolic institution concluding the tragedy with the murder of the king in cold blood and upon mature deliberation at the same time changing the monarchy into a commonwealth  the catholics of ireland in the great rebellion lost their estates for fighting in defence of their king the schismatics who cut off the fathers head forced the son to fly for his life and overturned the whole ancient frame of government religious and civil obtained grants of those very estates which the catholics lost in defence of the ancient constitution many of which estates are at this day possessed by the posterity of those schismatics and thus they gained by their rebellion what the catholics lost by their loyalty3  footnote 3 this paragraph is omitted in edition of 1743 but it is printed in that of 1755 ts  we allow the catholics to be brethren of the dissenters some people indeed which we cannot allow would have them to be our children because we both dissent from the church established and both agree in abolishing this persecuting sacramental test by which negative discouragement we are both rendered incapable of civil and military employments however we cannot but wonder at the bold familiarity of these schismatics in calling the members of the national church their brethren and fellow protestants it is true that all these sects except the catholics are brethren to each other in faction ignorance iniquity perverseness pride and if we except the quakers in rebellion but how the churchmen can be styled their fellow protestants we cannot comprehend because when the whole babel of sectaries joined against the church the king and the nobility for twenty years in a match at football where the proverb expressly tells us that all are fellows while the three kingdoms were tossed to and fro the churches and cities and royal palaces shattered to pieces by their balls their buffets and their kicks the victors would allow no more fellows at football but murdered sequestered plundered deprived banished to the plantations or enslaved all their opposers who had lost the game  it is said the world is governed by opinion and politicians assure us that all power is founded thereupon wherefore as all human creatures are fond to distraction of their own opinions and so much the more as those opinions are absurd ridiculous or of little moment it must follow that they are equally fond of power but no opinions are maintained with so much obstinacy as those in religion especially by such zealots who never bore the least regard to religion conscience honour justice truth mercy or common morality farther than in outward appearance under the mask of hypocrisy to promote their diabolical designs and therefore bishop burnet one of their oracles tells us honestly that the saints of those fanatic times pronounced themselves above morality which they reckoned among beggarly elements but the meaning of those two last words thus applied we confess to be above our understanding  among those kingdoms and states which first embraced the reformation england appears to have received it in the most regular way where it was introduced in a peaceable manner by the supreme power of a king4 and the three estates in parliament to which as the highest legislative authority all subjects are bound passively to submit neither was there much blood shed on so great a change of religion but a considerable number of lords and other persons of quality through the kingdom still continued in their old faith and were notwithstanding their difference in religion employed in offices civil as well as military more or less in every reign until the test act in the time of king charles ii however from the time of the reformation the number of catholics gradually and considerably lessened so that in the reign of king charles i england became in a great degree a protestant kingdom without taking the sectaries into the number the legality whereof with respect to human laws the catholics never disputed but the puritans and other schismatics without the least pretence to any such authority by an open rebellion destroyed that legal reformation as we observed before murdered their king and changed the monarchy into a republic it is therefore not to be wondered at if the catholics in such a babel of religions chose to adhere to their own faith left to them by their ancestors rather than seek for a better among a rabble of hypocritical rebellious deluding knaves or deluded enthusiasts  footnote 4 henry viii h  we repeat once more that if a national religion be changed by the supreme legislative power we cannot dispute the human legality of such a change but we humbly conceive that if any considerable party of men which differs from an establishment either old or new can deserve liberty of conscience it ought to consist of those who for want of conviction or of a right understanding the merits of each cause conceive themselves bound in conscience to adhere to the religion of their ancestors because they are of all others least likely to be authors of innovations either in church or state  on tother side if the reformation of religion be founded upon rebellion against the king without whose consent by the nature of our constitution no law can pass if this reformation be introduced by only one of the three estates i mean the commons and not by one half even of those commons and this by the assistance of a rebellious army again if this reformation were carried on by the exclusion of nobles both lay and spiritual who constitute the two other parts of the three estates by the murder of their king and by abolishing the whole system of government the catholics cannot see why the successors of those schismatics who are universally accused by all parties except themselves and a few infamous abettors for still retaining the same principles in religion and government under which their predecessors acted should pretend to a better share of civil or military trust profit and power than the catholics who during all that period of twenty years were continually persecuted with utmost severity merely on account of their loyalty and constant adherence to kingly power  we now come to those arguments for repealing the sacramental test which equally affect the catholics and their brethren the dissenters  first we agree with our fellow dissenters that persecution merely for conscience sake is against the genius of the gospel5 and so likewise is any law for depriving men of their natural and civil rights which they claim as men we are also ready enough to allow that the smallest negative discouragements for uniformitys sake are so many persecutions because it cannot be denied that the scratch of a pin is in some degree a real wound as much as a stab through the heart in like manner an incapacity by law for any man to be made a judge a colonel or justice of the peace merely on a point of conscience is a negative discouragement and consequently a real persecution for in this case the author of the pamphlet quoted in the margin6 puts a very pertinent and powerful question that if god be the sole lord of the conscience why should the rights of conscience be subject to human jurisdiction now to apply this to the catholics the belief of transubstantiation is a matter purely of religion and conscience which doth not affect the political interest of society as such therefore why should the rights of conscience whereof god is the sole lord be subject to human jurisdiction and why should god be deprived of this right over a catholics conscience any more than over that of any other dissenter  footnote 5 vid reasons for the repeal of the sacramental test note in edit 1738  footnote 6 idem  and whereas another author among our brethren the dissenters hath very justly complained that by this persecuting test act great numbers of true protestants have been forced to leave the kingdom and fly to the plantations rather than stay here branded with an incapacity for civil and military employments we do affirm that the catholics can bring many more instances of the same kind some thousands of their religion have been forced by the sacramental test to retire into other countries rather than live here under the incapacity of wearing swords sitting in parliament and getting that share of power and profit which belongs to them as fellow christians whereof they are deprived merely upon account of conscience which would not allow them to take the sacrament after the manner prescribed in the liturgy hence it clearly follows in the words of the same author7 that if we catholics are uncapable of employments we are punished for our dissent that is for our conscience which wholly turns upon political considerations  footnote 7 see reasons against the test note in edit 1738  the catholics are willing to acknowledge the kings supremacy whenever their brethren the dissenters shall please to shew them the example  further the catholics whenever their religion shall come to be the national established faith are willing to undergo the same test offered by the author already quoted his words are these to end this debate by putting it upon a foot which i hope will appear to every impartial person a fair and equitable one we catholics propose with submission to the proper judges that effectual security be taken against persecution by obliging all who are admitted into places of power and trust whatever their religious profession be in the most solemn manner to disclaim persecuting principles it is hoped the public will take notice of these words whatever their religious profession be which plainly include the catholics and for which we return thanks to our dissenting brethren  and whereas it is objected by those of the established church that if the schismatics and fanatics were once put into a capacity of possessing civil and military employments they would never be at ease till they had raised their own way of worship into the national religion through all his majestys dominions equal with the true orthodox scottish kirk which when they had once brought to pass they would no more allow liberty of conscience to episcopal dissenters than they did in the time of the great english rebellion and in the succeeding fanatic anarchy till the king was restored there is another very learned schismatical pamphleteer8 who in answer to a malignant libel called the presbyterians plea of merit c clearly wipes off this aspersion by assuring all episcopal protestants of the present church upon his own word and to his own knowledge that our brethren the dissenters will never offer at such an attempt in like manner the catholics when legally required will openly declare upon their words and honours that as soon as their negative discouragements and their persecution shall be removed by repealing the sacramental test they will leave it entirely to the merits of the cause whether the kingdom shall think fit to make their faith the established religion or not  footnote 8 vindication of the protestant dissenters this pamphlet has been mentioned in the note prefixed to the presbyterians plea of merit it was written as a reply to that tract and to the narrativets  and again whereas our presbyterian brethren in many of their pamphlets take much offence that the great rebellion in england the murder of the king with the entire change of religion and government are perpetually objected against them both in and out of season by our common enemy the present conformists we do declare in the defence of our said brethren that the reproach aforesaid is an old wornout threadbare cant which they always disdained to answer and i very well remember that having once told a certain conformist how much i wondered to hear him and his tribe dwelling perpetually on so beaten a subject he was pleased to divert the discourse with a foolish story which i cannot forbear telling to his disgrace he said there was a clergyman in yorkshire who for fifteen years together preached every sunday against drunkenness whereat the parishioners being much offended complained to the archbishop who having sent for the clergyman and severely reprimanded him the minister had no better an answer than by confessing the fact adding that all the parish were drunkards that he desired to reclaim them from one vice before he would begin upon another and since they still continued to be as great drunkards as before he resolved to go on except his grace would please to forbid him  we are very sensible how heavy an accusation lieth upon the catholics of ireland that some years before king charles ii was restored when theirs and the kings forces were entirely reduced and the kingdom declared by the rump to be settled after all his majestys generals were forced to fly to france or other countries the heads of the said catholics who remained here in an enslaved condition joined to send an invitation to the duke of lorrain engaging upon his appearing here with his forces to deliver up the whole island to his power and declare him their sovereign which after the restoration was proved against them by dean boyle since primate who produced the very original instrument at the board the catholics freely acknowledge the fact to be true and at the same time appeal to all the world whether a wiser a better a more honourable or a more justifiable project could have been thought of they were then reduced to slavery and beggary by the english rebels many thousands of them murdered the rest deprived of their estates and driven to live on a small pittance in the wilds of connaught at a time when either the rump or cromwell absolutely governed the three kingdoms and the question will turn upon this whether the catholics deprived of all their possessions governed with a rod of iron and in utter despair of ever seeing the monarchy restored for the preservation of which they had suffered so much were to be blamed for calling in a foreign prince of their own religion who had a considerable army to support them rather than submit to so infamous an usurper as cromwell or such a bloody and ignominious conventicle as the rump and i have often heard not only our friends the dissenters but even our common enemy the conformists who are conversant in the history of those times freely confess that considering the miserable situation the irish were then in they could not have thought of a braver or more virtuous attempt by which they might have been instruments of restoring the lawful monarch at least to the recovery of england and scotland from those betrayers and sellers and murderers of his royal father  to conclude whereas the last quoted author complains very heavily and frequently of a brand that lies upon them it is a great mistake for the first original brand hath been long taken off only we confess the scar will probably remain and be visible for ever to those who know the principles by which they acted and until those principles shall be openly renounced else it must continue to all generations like the mark set upon cain which some authors say descended to all his posterity or like the roman nose and austrian lip or like the long bag of flesh hanging down from the gills of the people in piedmont but as for any brands fixed on schismatics for several years past they have been all made with cold iron like thieves who by the benefit of the clergy are condemned to be only burned in the hand but escape the pain and the mark by being in fee with the jailor which advantage the schismatical teachers will never want who as we are assured and of which there is a very fresh instance have the souls and bodies and purses of the people a hundred times more at their mercy than the catholic priests could ever pretend to  therefore upon the whole the catholics do humbly petition without the least insinuation of threatening that upon this favourable juncture their incapacity for civil and military employments may be wholly taken off for the very same reasons besides others more cogent that are now offered by their brethren the dissenters  and your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray c9  dublin nov 1733  footnote 9 in this controversy the author was again victorious for the test was not repealed h                                   some few thoughts  concerning the repeal of the test1   footnote 1 the text is that of the quarto edition 1765 of swifts works ts  those of either side who have written upon this subject of the test in making or answering objections seem to fail by not pressing sufficiently the chief point upon which the controversy turns the arguments used by those who write for the church are very good in their kind but will have little force under the present corruptions of mankind because the authors treat this subject tanquam in republicâ platonis et non in fæce romuli  it must be confessed that considering how few employments of any consequence fall to the share of those english who are born in this kingdom and those few very dearly purchased at the expense of conscience liberty and all regard for the public good they are not worth contending for and if nothing but profit were in the case it would hardly cost me one sigh when i should see those few scraps thrown among every species of fanatics to scuffle for among themselves  and this will infallibly be the case after repealing the test  for every subdivision of sect will with equal justice pretend to have a share and as it is usual with sharers will never think they have enough while any pretender is left unprovided i shall not except the quakers because when the passage is once let open for all sects to partake in public emoluments it is very probable the lawfulness of taking oaths and wearing carnal weapons2 may be revealed to the brotherhood which thought i confess was first put into my head by one of the shrewdest quakers in this kingdom3  footnote 2  the quakers were more likely to admit this relaxation of their peculiar tenets as upon their first appearance as a sect they did not by any means profess the principle of nonresistance which they afterwards adopted s  footnote 3 the quaker hinted at by dr swift was mr george rooke a linendraper in a letter to mr pope aug 30 1716 dr swift says there is a young ingenious quaker in this town who writes verses to his mistress not very correct but in a strain purely what a poetical quaker should do commending her look and habit c it gave me a hint that a set of quaker pastorals might succeed if our friend gay would fancy it and i think it a fruitful subject pray hear what he saysaccordingly gay wrote the espousal a sober eclogue between two of the people called quakers s                                  ten reasons for repealing  the test act1  footnote 1 this tract is from a rare broadside copy it appears to be written by the dean and the arguments correspond with those he uses elsewhere  so says scott but monck mason considers this tract no more the work of swift than several others he mentions see note prefixed to the presbyterians plea of merit ts   i  because the presbyterians are people of such great interest in this kingdom that there are not above ten of their persuasion in the house of commons and but one in the house of lords though they are not obliged to take the sacrament in the established church to qualify them to be members of either house  2 because those of the established church of this kingdom are so disaffected to the king that not one of them worth mentioning except the late duke of ormond2 has been concerned in the rebellion and that our parliament though there be so few presbyterians has upon all occasions proved its loyalty to king george and has readily agreed to and enacted what might support his government  footnote 2 james butler duke of ormond 16101688 was lieutenantgeneral of the army of ireland during the rebellion of 1641 after his defeat of general preston in 1643 he was appointed lordlieutenant of ireland but retired to france on the fall of the stuart dynasty the execution of charles caused ormond to land again in ireland for the purpose of rousing that country in favour of the royal cause but he forsook it on the landing of cromwell at the restoration he came over with charles and was raised for his services to the dukedom he was however deprived of his lordlieutenancy for his friendship for the exiled clarendon he had a narrow escape for his life from the plots of colonel blood whom he forgave at the request of the king in 1682 he was rewarded by being promoted to an english dukedom ts  3 because very few of the presbyterians have lost an employment worth £20 per annum for not qualifying themselves according to the test act nor will they accept of a militia commission though they do of one in the army  4 because if they are not in the militia and other places of trust the pretender and his adherents will destroy us when he has no one to support him but the king of spain when king george is at a good understanding with sweden prussia and denmark and when he has made the best alliances in christendom when the emperor king of great britain the french king the king of sardinia are all in the quadruple alliance against the spaniard his upstart cardinal3 and the pretender when bloody plots against great britain and france are blown up when the spanish fleet is quite dispersed when the french army is overrunning spain and when the rebels in scotland are cut off  footnote 3 cardinal julius alberoni 16641752 born at parma obtained the favour when a humble parish priest of the duke of vendôme by informing that general of the whereabouts of some corn which the country folk had hidden he followed the duke to spain and was successful in bringing about the marriage between the princess of parma and philip v for this service he was made prime minister of spain a cardinal and archbishop of valencia he entered heartily into philips designs for recovering spains lost territory and showed even more boldness than his royal master in their execution his reduction of sardinia precipitated the alliance between england france holland and afterwards austria spain with alberoni as its guiding spirit supported the jacobite cause to harass england and conquered sicily but at messina the spanish fleet was destroyed by the english and in the north of spain the forces of philip were repulsed by the french in the end spain gave way and alberoni was dismissed to retire to rome and to be safely lodged in the jesuits college there on his release he returned to his native town but died at rome ts  5 the test clause should be repealed because it is a defence against the reformation the presbyterians long since promised the churches of england and ireland viz we noblemen barons knights gentlemen citizens burgesses ministers of the gospel commons of all sorts in the kingdoms of scotland england and ireland c4 each one of us for himself with our hands lifted up to the most high god do swear first that we shall sincerely really and constantly through the grace of god endeavour in our several places and callings the preservation of the reformed religion in the church of scotland in doctrine worship discipline and government secondly that we shall in like manner without respect of persons endeavour the extirpation of popery prelacy that is churchgovernment by archbishops their chancellors and commissaries deans deacons and chapters archdeacons and all other ecclesiastical officers depending on that hierarchy  footnote 4 vide confession of faith pp 304 305  6 because the presbyterian churchgovernment may be independent of the state the lord jesus is king and head of his church5 hath therein appointed a government in the hands of churchofficers distinct from the civil magistrate as magistrates may lawfully call a synod of ministers to consult and advise with about matters of religion so if magistrates be open enemies to the church the ministers of christ of themselves by virtue of their office or they with other fit persons upon delegation from their churches may meet together in such assemblies6  footnote 5 confession of faith p 87  footnote 6 ibid pp 88 89  7 because they have not the free use of their religion when they disdain a toleration  8 because they have so much charity for episcopacy as to account it iniquitous the address of the general assembly to the duke of queensbury in the late reign says that to tolerate the episcopal clergy in scotland would be to establish iniquity by a law  9 because repealing the test clause will probably disoblige ten of his majestys good subjects for one it can oblige  10 because if the test clause be repealed the presbyterians may with the better grace get into employments and the easier worm out those of the established church                                   sermons   the following form of prayer which dr swift constantly used in the pulpit before his sermon is copied from his own handwriting  almighty and most merciful god forgive us all our sins give us grace heartily to repent them and to lead new lives graft in our hearts a true love and veneration for thy holy name and word make thy pastors burning and shining lights able to convince gainsayers and to save others and themselves bless this congregation here met together in thy name grant them to hear and receive thy holy word to the salvation of their own souls lastly we desire to return thee praise and thanksgiving for all thy mercies bestowed upon us but chiefly for the fountain of them all jesus christ our lord in whose name and words we further call upon thee saying our father c   note  these twelve sermons are what have been handed down to us of a bundle of thirtyfive which swift some years before his death gave to dr sheridan swift had no great opinion of them himself if we may judge from what he said to his friend when he offered him the bundle you may have them if you please they may be of use to you they never were of any to me there is not much in any of them of that quality which characterizes the average sermon for the artifices of rhetoric which are usually employed to move hearers swift had no small contempt he aimed to convince the mind by plain statements of commonsense views he had no faith in a conviction brought about under the stress of emotional excitement his sermons exactly answer to the advice he gave a young clergymanfirst tell the people what is their duty and then convince them that it is so in the note to his reprint of these sermons sir walter scott has very admirably summed up their qualities  the sermons of swift says scott have none of that thunder which appals or that resistless and winning softness which melts the hearts of an audience he can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love of terror or of devotion his reasoning however powerful and indeed unanswerable convinces the understanding but is never addressed to the heart and indeed from his instructions to a young clergyman he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an english sermon occasionally too swifts misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption with such unamiable feelings towards his hearers the preacher might indeed command their respect but could never excite their sympathy it may be feared that his sermons were less popular from another cause imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor swift spared not the vices of rich or poor and disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion he rushes at once to the point of moral depravity and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof bordering upon reproach in short he tears the bandages from their wounds like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary but rough and untamed severity but alas the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities that can profit by this harsh medicine there is a principle of opposition in our nature which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner and swift was probably sensible that his discourses owing to these various causes did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher because they reflect back to him those of the audience  but although the sermons of swift are deficient in eloquence and were lightly esteemed by their author they must not be undervalued by the modern reader they exhibit in an eminent degree that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries in no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject the reasoning is not only irresistible but managed in a mode so simple and clear that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity upon all subjects of morality the preacher maintains the character of a rigid and inflexible monitor neither admitting apology for that which is wrong nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right a stern stoicism of doctrine that may fail in finding many converts but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it in treating the doctrinal points of belief as in his sermon upon the trinity swift systematically refuses to quit the high and preeminent ground which the defender of christianity is entitled to occupy or to submit to the test of human reason mysteries which are placed by their very nature far beyond our finite capacities swift considered that in religion as in profane science there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature and he censures those divines who in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines of which god had declared the fact concealing from man the manner he contended that he who upon the whole receives the christian religion as of divine inspiration must be contented to depend upon gods truth and his holy word and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension above all swift points out with his usual forcible precision the mischievous tendency of those investigations which while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the christian religion shake and endanger the whole fabric destroy the settled faith of thousands pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant  in 1744 faulkner printed three sermons as a single volume these were on mutual subjection on conscience and on the trinity the other sermons appeared in the various editions issued by nichols and others the text here given is that of the volume of 1744 of hawkesworth and scott  ts     on mutual subjection   i peter v 5  yea all of you be subject one to another   the apostle having in many parts of this epistle given directions to christians concerning the duty of subjection or obedience to superiors in the several instances of the subject to his prince the child to his parent the servant to his master the wife to her husband and the younger to the elder doth here in the words of my text sum up the whole by advancing a point of doctrine which at first may appear a little extraordinary yea all of you saith he be subject one to another for it should seem that two persons cannot properly be said to be subject to each other and that subjection is only due from inferiors to those above them yet st paul hath several passages to the same purpose for he exhorts the romans in honour to prefer one another1 and the philippians that in lowliness of mind they should each esteem other better than themselves2 and the ephesians that they should submit themselves one to another in the fear of the lord3 here we find these two great apostles recommending to all christians this duty of mutual subjection for we may observe by st peter that having mentioned the several relations which men bear to each other as governor and subject master and servant and the rest which i have already repeated he maketh no exception but sums up the whole with commanding all to be subject one to another from whence we may conclude that this subjection due from all men to all men is something more than the compliment of course when our betters are pleased to tell us they are our humble servants but understand us to be their slaves  footnote 1 rom xii 10  footnote 2 philip ii 3  footnote 3 ephes v 21  i know very well that some of those who explain this text apply it to humility to the duties of charity to private exhortations and to bearing with each others infirmities and it is probable the apostle may have had a regard to all these but however many learned men agree that there is something more understood and so the words in their plain natural meaning must import as you will observe yourselves if you read them with the beginning of the verse which is thus likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another so that upon the whole there must be some kind of subjection due from every man to every man which cannot be made void by any power preeminence or authority whatsoever now what sort of subjection this is and how it ought to be paid shall be the subject of my present discourse  as god hath contrived all the works of nature to be useful and in some manner a support to each other by which the whole frame of the world under his providence is preserved and kept up so among mankind our particular stations are appointed to each of us by god almighty wherein we are obliged to act as far as our power reacheth toward the good of the whole community and he who doth not perform that part assigned him toward advancing the benefit of the whole in proportion to his opportunities and abilities is not only a useless but a very mischievous member of the public because he taketh his share of the profit and yet leaves his share of the burden to be borne by others which is the true principal cause of most miseries and misfortunes in life for a wise man who doth not assist with his counsels a great man with his protection a rich man with his bounty and charity and a poor man with his labour are perfect nuisances in a commonwealth neither is any condition of life more honourable in the sight of god than another otherwise he would be a respecter of persons which he assureth us he is not for he hath proposed the same salvation to all men and hath only placed them in different ways or stations to work it out princes are born with no more advantages of strength or wisdom than other men and by an unhappy education are usually more defective in both than thousands of their subjects they depend for every necessary of life upon the meanest of their people besides obedience and subjection were never enjoined by god to humour the passions lusts and vanities of those who demand them from us but we are commanded to obey our governors because disobedience would breed seditions in the state thus servants are directed to obey their masters children their parents and wives their husbands not from any respect of persons in god but because otherwise there would be nothing but confusion in private families this matter will be clearly explained by considering the comparison which st paul maketh between the church of christ and the body of man for the same resemblance will hold not only to families and kingdoms but to the whole corporation of mankind the eye saith he4 cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of thee nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it the case is directly the same among mankind the prince cannot say to the merchant i have no need of thee nor the merchant to the labourer i have no need of thee nay much more those members c for the poor are generally more necessary members of the commonwealth than the rich which clearly shews that god never intented such possessions for the sake and service of those to whom he lends them but because he hath assigned every man his particular station to be useful in life and this for the reason given by the apostle that there should be no schism in the body5  footnote 4 1 corin xii 21 23 26  footnote 5 1 corin xii 25  from hence may partly be gathered the nature of that subjection which we all owe to one another god almighty hath been pleased to put us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion of each others assistance there is none so low as not to be in a capacity of assisting the highest nor so high as not to want the assistance of the lowest  it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one human creature is more worthy than another in the sight of god farther than according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and that power wealth and the like outward advantages are so far from being the marks of gods approving or preferring those on whom they are bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them to be almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankind with relation himself you will observe that in all the relations between man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the one cannot subsist without the other thus no man can be a prince without subjects nor a master without servants nor a father without children and this both explains and confirms the doctrine of the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be a mutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection for instance the subject must only obey his prince because god commands it human laws require it and the safety of the public maketh it necessary for the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority and submit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward whether they rule according to our liking or no on the other side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes are subject to those laws which their people have chosen they are bound to protect their subjects in liberty property and religion to receive their petitions and redress their grievances so that the best prince is in the opinion of wisemen only the greatest servant of the nation not only a servant to the public in general but in some sort to every man in it in the like manner a servant owes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master from whom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection and maintenance and gentle treatment nay even the poor beggar hath a just demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraud injustice and oppression if he doth not afford relief according to his abilities  but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessary than in the common conversations of life for without it there could be no society among men if the learned would not sometimes submit to the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the froward the old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing but everlasting variance in the world this our saviour himself confirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of a servant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorable words ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more ought ye to wash one anothers feet under which expression of washing the feet is included all that subjection assistance love and duty which every good christian ought to pay his brother in whatever station god hath placed him for the greatest prince and the meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as our saviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash  and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one another may seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and may therefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upon their greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than what most men practise upon other occasions for if our neighbour who is our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we place him above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselves and this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually called good manners now the duty required by the apostle is only that we should enlarge our minds and that what we thus practice in the common course of life we should imitate in all our actions and proceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man is our neighbour and since we are so ready in the point of civility to yield to others in our own houses where only we have any title to govern  having thus shewn you what sort of subjection it is which all men owe one to another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall now draw some observations from what hath been said  and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselves to the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride for if god hath pleased to entrust me with a talent not for my own sake but for the service of others and at the same time hath left me full of wants and necessities which others must supply i can then have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or to despise my brother because he hath not the same talents which were lent to me his being may probably be as useful to the public as mine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sort preferable to him  secondly it is very manifest from what hath been said that no man ought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honour power and the like as his property but merely as a trust which god hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of his brethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trust although the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot because the trust was conferred only by god who hath not left it to any power on earth to decide infallibly whether a man maketh a good use of his talents or no or to punish him where he fails and therefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter into his own hands and will most certainly reward or punish us in proportion to our good or ill performance in it now although the advantages which one man possesseth more than another may in some sense be called his property with respect to other men yet with respect to god they are as i said only a trust which will plainly appear from hence if a man doth not use those advantages to the good of the public or the benefit of his neighbour it is certain he doth not deserve them and consequently that god never intended them for a blessing to him and on the other side whoever doth employ his talents as he ought will find by his own experience that they were chiefly lent him for the service of others for to the service of others he will certainly employ them  thirdly if we could all be brought to practise this duty of subjecting ourselves to each other it would very much contribute to the general happiness of mankind for this would root out envy and malice from the heart of man because you cannot envy your neighbours strength if he maketh use of it to defend your life or carry your burden you cannot envy his wisdom if he gives you good counsel nor his riches if he supplieth you in your wants nor his greatness if he employs it to your protection the miseries of life are not properly owing to the unequal distribution of things but god almighty the great king of heaven is treated like the kings of the earth who although perhaps intending well themselves have often most abominable ministers and stewards and those generally the vilest to whom they entrust the most talents but here is the difference that the princes of this world see by other mens eyes but god sees all things and therefore whenever he permits his blessings to be dealt among those who are unworthy we may certainly conclude that he intends them only as a punishment to an evil world as well as to the owners it were well if those would consider this whose riches serve them only as a spur to avarice or as an instrument to their lusts whose wisdom is only of this world to put false colours upon things to call good evil and evil good against the conviction of their own consciences and lastly who employ their power and favour in acts of oppression or injustice in misrepresenting persons and things or in countenancing the wicked to the ruin of the innocent  fourthly the practice of this duty of being subject to one another would make us rest contented in the several stations of life wherein god hath thought fit to place us because it would in the best and easiest manner bring us back as it were to that early state of the gospel when christians had all things in common for if the poor found the rich disposed to supply their wants if the ignorant found the wise ready to instruct and direct them or if the weak might always find protection from the mighty they could none of them with the least pretence of justice lament their own condition  from all that hath been hitherto said it appears that great abilities of any sort when they are employed as god directs do but make the owners of them greater and more painful servants to their neighbour and the public however we are by no means to conclude from hence that they are not really blessings when they are in the hands of good men for first what can be a greater honour than to be chosen one of the stewards and dispensers of gods bounty to mankind what is there that can give a generous spirit more pleasure and complacency of mind than to consider that he is an instrument of doing much good that great numbers owe to him under god their subsistence their safety their health and the good conduct of their lives the wickedest man upon earth taketh a pleasure in doing good to those he loveth and therefore surely a good christian who obeys our saviours command of loving all men cannot but take delight in doing good even to his enemies god who giveth all things to all men can receive nothing from any and those among men who do the most good and receive the fewest returns do most resemble their creator for which reason st paul delivereth it as a saying of our saviour that it is more blessed to give than to receive by this rule what must become of those things which the world valueth as the greatest blessings riches power and the like when our saviour plainly determines that the best way to make them blessings is to part with them therefore although the advantages which one man hath over another may be called blessings yet they are by no means so in the sense the world usually understands thus for example great riches are no blessing in themselves because the poor man with the common necessaries of life enjoys more health and hath fewer cares without them how then do they become blessings no otherwise than by being employed in feeding the hungry clothing the naked rewarding worthy men and in short doing acts of charity and generosity thus likewise power is no blessing in itself because private men bear less envy and trouble and anguish without it but when it is employed to protect the innocent to relieve the oppressed and to punish the oppressor then it becomes a great blessing and so lastly even great wisdom is in the opinion of solomon not a blessing in itself for in much wisdom is much sorrow and men of common understandings if they serve god and mind their callings make fewer mistakes in the conduct of life than those who have better heads and yet wisdom is a mighty blessing when it is applied to good purposes to instruct the ignorant to be a faithful counsellor either in public or private to be a director to youth and to many other ends needless here to mention  to conclude god sent us into the world to obey his commands by doing as much good as our abilities will reach and as little evil as our many infirmities will permit some he hath only trusted with one talent some with five and some with ten no man is without his talent and he that is faithful or negligent in a little shall be rewarded or punished as well as he that hath been so in a great deal  consider what hath been said and the lord give you a right understanding in all things to whom with the son and the holy ghost be all honour and glory now and for ever     on the testimony of conscience   2 corinthians i 12 part of it  for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience   there is no word more frequently in the mouths of men than that of conscience and the meaning of it is in some measure generally understood however because it is likewise a word extremely abused by many people who apply other meanings to it which god almighty never intended i shall explain it to you in the clearest manner i am able the word conscience properly signifies that knowledge which a man hath within himself of his own thoughts and actions and because if a man judgeth fairly of his own actions by comparing them with the law of god his mind will either approve or condemn him according as he hath done good or evil therefore this knowledge or conscience may properly be called both an accuser and a judge so that whenever our conscience accuseth us we are certainly guilty but we are not always innocent when it doth not accuse us for very often through the hardness of our hearts or the fondness and favour we bear to ourselves or through ignorance or neglect we do not suffer our conscience to take any cognizance of several sins we commit there is another office likewise belonging to conscience which is that of being our director and guide and the wrong use of this hath been the occasion of more evils under the sun than almost all other causes put together for as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge we have of what we are thinking and doing so it can guide us no farther than that knowledge reacheth and therefore god hath placed conscience in us to be our director only in those actions which scripture and reason plainly tell us to be good or evil but in cases too difficult or doubtful for us to comprehend or determine there conscience is not concerned because it cannot advise in what it doth not understand nor decide where it is itself in doubt but by gods great mercy those difficult points are never of absolute necessity to our salvation there is likewise another evil that men often say a thing is against their conscience when really it is not for instance ask any of those who differ from the worship established why they do not come to church they will say they dislike the ceremonies the prayers the habits and the like and therefore it goes against their conscience but they are mistaken their teacher hath put those words into their mouths for a mans conscience can go no higher than his knowledge and therefore until he has thoroughly examined by scripture and the practice of the ancient church whether those points are blameable or no his conscience cannot possibly direct him to condemn them hence have likewise arisen those mistakes about what is usually called liberty of conscience which properly speaking is no more than a liberty of knowing our own thoughts which liberty no one can take from us but those words have obtained quite different meanings liberty of conscience is nowadays not only understood to be the liberty of believing what men please but also of endeavouring to propagate the belief as much as they can and to overthrow the faith which the laws have already established to be rewarded by the public for those wicked endeavours and this is the liberty of conscience which the fanatics are now openly in the face of the world endeavouring at with their utmost application at the same time it cannot but be observed that those very persons who under pretence of a public spirit and tenderness towards their christian brethren are so zealous for such a liberty of conscience as this are of all others the least tender to those who differ from them in the smallest point relating to government and i wish i could not say that the majesty of the living god may be offended with more security than the memory of a dead prince but the wisdom of the world at present seems to agree with that of the heathen emperor who said if the gods were offended it was their own concern and they were able to vindicate themselves1  footnote 1 the saying of tiberius as given by tacitus annals bk i c lxxiii deorum offensa diis curæ ts  but although conscience hath been abused to those wicked purposes which i have already related yet a due regard to the directions it plainly giveth us as well as to its accusations reproaches and advices would be of the greatest use to mankind both for their present welfare and future happiness  therefore my discourse at this time shall be directed to prove to you that there is no solid firm foundation for virtue but on a conscience which is guided by religion  in order to this i shall first shew you the weakness and uncertainty of two false principles which many people set up in the place of conscience for a guide to their actions  the first of these principles is what the world usually calls moral honesty there are some people who appear very indifferent as to religion and yet have the repute of being just and fair in their dealings and these are generally known by the character of good moral men but now if you look into the grounds and the motives of such a mans actions you shall find them to be no other than his own ease and interest for example you trust a moral man with your money in the way of trade you trust another with the defence of your cause at law and perhaps they both deal justly with you why not from any regard they have for justice but because their fortune depends upon their credit and a stain of open public dishonesty must be to their disadvantage but let it consist with such a mans interest and safety to wrong you and then it will be impossible you can have any hold upon him because there is nothing left to give him a check or put in the balance against his profit for if he hath nothing to govern himself by but the opinion of the world as long as he can conceal his injustice from the world he thinks he is safe  besides it is found by experience that those men who set up for morality without regard to religion are generally but virtuous in part they will be just in their dealings between man and man but if they find themselves disposed to pride lust intemperance or avarice they do not think their morality concerned to check them in any of these vices because it is the great rule of such men that they may lawfully follow the dictates of nature wherever their safety health and fortune are not injured so that upon the whole there is hardly one vice which a mere moral man may not upon some occasions allow himself to practise  the other false principle which some men set up in the place of conscience to be their director in life is what those who pretend to it call honour  this word is often made the sanction of an oath it is reckoned a great commendation to be a man of strict honour and it is commonly understood that a man of honour can never be guilty of a base action this is usually the style of military men of persons with titles and of others who pretend to birth and quality it is true indeed that in ancient times it was universally understood that honour was the reward of virtue but if such honour as is nowadays going will not permit a man to do a base action it must be allowed there are very few such things as base actions in nature no man of honour as that word is usually understood did ever pretend that his honour obliged him to be chaste or temperate to pay his creditors to be useful to his country to do good to mankind to endeavour to be wise or learned to regard his word his promise or his oath or if he hath any of these virtues they were never learned in the catechism of honour which contains but two precepts the punctual payment of debts contracted at play and the right understanding the several degrees of an affront in order to revenge it by the death of an adversary  but suppose this principle of honour which some men so much boast of did really produce more virtues than it ever pretended to yet since the very being of that honour dependeth upon the breath the opinion or the fancy of the people the virtues derived from it could be of no long or certain duration for example suppose a man from a principle of honour should resolve to be just or chaste or temperate and yet the censuring world should take a humour of refusing him those characters he would then think the obligation at an end or on the other side if he thought he could gain honour by the falsest and vilest action which is a case that very often happens he would then make no scruple to perform it and god knows it would be an unhappy state to have the religion the liberty or the property of a people lodged in such hands which however hath been too often the case  what i have said upon this principle of honour may perhaps be thought of small concernment to most of you who are my hearers however a caution was not altogether unnecessary since there is nothing by which not only the vulgar but the honest tradesman hath been so much deceived as this infamous pretence to honour in too many of their betters  having thus shewn you the weakness and uncertainty of those principles which some men set up in the place of conscience to direct them in their actions i shall now endeavour to prove to you that there is no solid firm foundation of virtue but in a conscience directed by the principles of religion  there is no way of judging how far we may depend upon the actions of men otherwise than by knowing the motives and grounds and causes of them and if the motives of our actions be not resolved and determined into the law of god they will be precarious and uncertain and liable to perpetual changes i will shew you what i mean by an example suppose a man thinks it his duty to obey his parents because reason tells him so because he is obliged by gratitude and because the laws of his country command him to do so but if he stops here his parents can have no lasting security for an occasion may happen wherein it may be extremely his interest to be disobedient and where the laws of the land can lay no hold upon him therefore before such a man can safely be trusted he must proceed farther and consider that his reason is the gift of god that god commanded him to be obedient to the laws and did moreover in a particular manner enjoin him to be dutiful to his parents after which if he lays due weight upon those considerations he will probably continue in his duty to the end of his life because no earthly interest can ever come in competition to balance the danger of offending his creator or the happiness of pleasing him and of all this his conscience will certainly inform him if he hath any regard to religion  secondly fear and hope are the two greatest natural motives of all mens actions but neither of these passions will ever put us in the way of virtue unless they be directed by conscience for although virtuous men do sometimes accidentally make their way to preferment yet the world is so corrupted that no man can reasonably hope to be rewarded in it merely upon account of his virtue and consequently the fear of punishment in this life will preserve men from very few vices since some of the blackest and basest do often prove the surest steps to favour such as ingratitude hypocrisy treachery malice subornation atheism and many more which human laws do little concern themselves about but when conscience placeth before us the hopes of everlasting happiness and the fears of everlasting misery as the reward and punishment of our good or evil actions our reason can find no way to avoid the force of such an argument otherwise than by running into infidelity  lastly conscience will direct us to love god and to put our whole trust and confidence in him our love of god will inspire us with a detestation for sin as what is of all things most contrary to his divine nature and if we have an entire confidence in him that will enable us to subdue and despise all the allurements of the world  it may here be objected if conscience be so sure a director to us christians in the conduct of our lives how comes it to pass that the ancient heathens who had no other lights but those of nature and reason should so far exceed us in all manner of virtue as plainly appears by many examples they have left on record  to which it may be answered first those heathens were extremely strict and exact in the education of their children whereas among us this care is so much laid aside that the more god hath blessed any man with estate or quality just so much the less in proportion is the care he taketh in the education of his children and particularly of that child which is to inherit his fortune of which the effects are visible enough among the great ones of the world again those heathens did in a particular manner instil the principle into their children of loving their country which is so far otherwise nowadays that of the several parties among us there is none of them that seems to have so much as heard whether there be such a virtue in the world as plainly appears by their practices and especially when they are placed in those stations where they can only have opportunity of shewing it lastly the most considerable among the heathens did generally believe rewards and punishments in a life to come which is the great principle for conscience to work upon whereas too many of those who would be thought the most considerable among us do both by their practices and their discourses plainly affirm that they believe nothing at all of the matter  wherefore since it hath manifestly appeared that a religious conscience is the only true solid foundation upon which virtue can be built give me leave before i conclude to let you see how necessary such a conscience is to conduct us in every station and condition of our lives  that a religious conscience is necessary in any station is confessed even by those who tell us that all religion was invented by cunning men in order to keep the world in awe for if religion by the confession of its adversaries be necessary towards the wellgoverning of mankind then every wise man in power will be sure not only to choose out for every station under him such persons as are most likely to be kept in awe by religion but likewise to carry some appearance of it himself or else he is a very weak politician and accordingly in any country where great persons affect to be open despisers of religion their counsels will be found at last to be fully as destructive to the state as to the church  it was the advice of jethro to his soninlaw moses to provide able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and to place such over the people and moses who was as wise a statesman at least as any in this age thought fit to follow that advice great abilities without the fear of god are most dangerous instruments when they are trusted with power the laws of man have thought fit that those who are called to any office of trust should be bound by an oath to the faithful discharge of it but an oath is an appeal to god and therefore can have no influence except upon those who believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that seek him and a punisher of those who disobey him and therefore we see the laws themselves are forced to have recourse to conscience in these cases because their penalties cannot reach the arts of cunning men who can find ways to be guilty of a thousand injustices without being discovered or at least without being punished and the reason why we find so many frauds abuses and corruptions where any trust is conferred can be no other than that there is so little conscience and religion left in the world or at least that men in their choice of instruments have private ends in view which are very different from the service of the public besides it is certain that men who profess to have no religion are full as zealous to bring over proselytes as any papist or fanatic can be and therefore if those who are in station high enough to be of influence or example to others if those i say openly profess a contempt or disbelief of religion they will be sure to make all their dependents of their own principles and what security can the public expect from such persons whenever their interests or their lusts come into competition with their duty it is very possible for a man who hath the appearance of religion and is a great pretender to conscience to be wicked and a hypocrite but it is impossible for a man who openly declares against religion to give any reasonable security that he will not be false and cruel and corrupt whenever a temptation offers which he values more than he does the power wherewith he was trusted and if such a man doth not betray his cause and his master it is only because the temptation was not properly offered or the profit was too small or the danger was too great and hence it is that we find so little truth or justice among us because there are so very few who either in the service of the public or in common dealings with each other do ever look farther than their own advantage and how to guard themselves against the laws of the country which a man may do by favour by secrecy or by cunning although he breaks almost every law of god  therefore to conclude it plainly appears that unless men are guided by the advice and judgment of a conscience founded on religion they can give no security that they will be either good subjects faithful servants of the public or honest in their mutual dealings since there is no other tie through which the pride or lust or avarice or ambition of mankind will not certainly break one time or other  consider what has been said c     on the trinity   i epist gen of john v 7  for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one   this day being set apart to acknowledge our belief in the eternal trinity i thought it might be proper to employ my present discourse entirely upon that subject and i hope to handle it in such a manner that the most ignorant among you may return home better informed of your duty in this great point than probably you are at present  it must be confessed that by the weakness and indiscretion of busy or at best of wellmeaning people as well as by the malice of those who are enemies to all revealed religion and are not content to possess their own infidelity in silence without communicating it to the disturbance of mankind i say by these means it must be confessed that the doctrine of the trinity hath suffered very much and made christianity suffer along with it for these two things must be granted first that men of wicked lives would be very glad there were no truth in christianity at all and secondly if they can pick out any one single article in the christian religion which appears not agreeable to their own corrupted reason or to the arguments of those bad people who follow the trade of seducing others they presently conclude that the truth of the whole gospel must sink along with that one article which is just as wise as if a man should say because he dislikes one law of his country he will therefore observe no law at all and yet that one law may be very reasonable in itself although he does not allow it or does not know the reason of the lawgivers  thus it hath happened with the great doctrine of the trinity which word is indeed not in the scripture but was a term of art invented in the earlier times to express the doctrine by a single word for the sake of brevity and convenience the doctrine then as delivered in holy scripture although not exactly in the same words is very short and amounts only to this that the father the son and the holy ghost are each of them god and yet there is but one god for as to the word person when we say there are three persons and as to those other explanations in the athanasian creed this day read to you whether compiled by athanasius or no they were taken up three hundred years after christ to expound this doctrine and i will tell you upon what occasion about that time there sprang up a heresy of a people called arians from one arius the leader of them these denied our saviour to be god although they allowed all the rest of the gospel wherein they were more sincere than their followers among us thus the christian world was divided into two parts until at length by the zeal and courage of st athanasius the arians were condemned in a general council and a creed formed upon the true faith as st athanasius hath settled it this creed is now read at certain times in our churches which although it is useful for edification to those who understand it yet since it containeth some nice and philosophical points which few people can comprehend the bulk of mankind is obliged to believe no more than the scripture doctrine as i have delivered it because that creed was intended only as an answer to the arians in their own way who were very subtle disputers  but this heresy having revived in the world about a hundred years ago and continued ever since not out of a zeal to truth but to give a loose to wickedness by throwing off all religion several divines in order to answer the cavils of those adversaries to truth and morality began to find out farther explanations of this doctrine of the trinity by rules of philosophy which have multiplied controversies to such a degree as to beget scruples that have perplexed the minds of many sober christians who otherwise could never have entertained them  i must therefore be bold to affirm that the method taken by many of those learned men to defend the doctrine of the trinity hath been founded upon a mistake  it must be allowed that every man is bound to follow the rules and directions of that measure of reason which god hath given him and indeed he cannot do otherwise if he will be sincere or act like a man for instance if i should be commanded by an angel from heaven to believe it is midnight at noonday yet i could not believe him so if i were directly told in scripture that three are one and one is three i could not conceive or believe it in the natural common sense of that expression but must suppose that something dark or mystical was meant which it pleased god to conceal from me and from all the world thus in the text there are three that bear record c am i capable of knowing and defining what union and what distinction there may be in the divine nature which possibly may be hid from the angels themselves again i see it plainly declared in scripture that there is but one god and yet i find our saviour claiming the prerogative of god in knowing mens thoughts in saying he and his father are one and before abraham was i am i read that the disciples worshipped him that thomas said to him my lord and my god and st john chap 1st in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i read likewise that the holy ghost bestowed the gift of tongues and the power of working miracles which if rightly considered is as great a miracle as any that a number of illiterate men should of a sudden be qualified to speak all the languages then known in the world such as could be done by the inspiration of god done from these several texts it is plain that god commands us to believe that there is an union and there is a distinction but what that union or what that distinction is all mankind are equally ignorant and must continue so at least till the day of judgment without some new revelation  but because i cannot conceive the nature of this union and distinction in the divine nature am i therefore to reject them as absurd and impossible as i would if any one told me that three men are one and one man is three we are told that a man and his wife are one flesh this i can comprehend the meaning of yet literally taken it is a thing impossible but the apostle tell us we see but in part and we know but in part and yet we would comprehend all the secret ways and workings of god  therefore i shall again repeat the doctrine of the trinity as it is positively affirmed in scripture that god is there expressed in three different names as father as son and as holy ghost that each of these is god and that there is but one god but this union and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind  this is enough for any good christian to believe on this great article without ever inquiring any farther and this can be contrary to no mans reason although the knowledge of it is hid from him  but there is another difficulty of great importance among those who quarrel with the doctrine of the trinity as well as with several other articles of christianity which is that our religion abounds in mysteries and these they are so bold as to revile as cant imposture and priestcraft it is impossible for us to determine for what reasons god thought fit to communicate some things to us in part and leave some part a mystery but so it is in fact and so the holy scripture tells us in several places for instance the resurrection and change of our bodies are called mysteries by st paul and our saviours incarnation is another the kingdom of god is called a mystery by our saviour to be only known to his disciples so is faith and the word of god by st paul i omit many others so that to declare against all mysteries without distinction or exception is to declare against the whole tenor of the new testament  there are two conditions that may bring a mystery under suspicion first when it is not taught and commanded in holy writ or secondly when the mystery turns to the advantage of those who preach it to others now as to the first it can never be said that we preach mysteries without warrant from holy scripture although i confess this of the trinity may have sometimes been explained by human invention which might perhaps better have been spared as to the second it will not be possible to charge the protestant priesthood with proposing any temporal advantage to themselves by broaching or multiplying or preaching of mysteries does this mystery of the trinity for instance and the descent of the holy ghost bring the least profit or power to the preachers no it is as great a mystery to themselves as it is to the meanest of their hearers and may be rather a cause of humiliation by putting their understanding in that point upon a level with the most ignorant of their flock it is true indeed the roman church hath very much enriched herself by trading in mysteries for which they have not the least authority from scripture and were fitted only to advance their own temporal wealth and grandeur such as transubstantiation the worshipping of images indulgences for sins purgatory and masses for the dead with many more but it is the perpetual talent of those who have illwill to our church or a contempt for all religion taken up by the wickedness of their lives to charge us with the errors and corruptions of popery which all protestants have thrown off near two hundred years whereas those mysteries held by us have no prospect of power pomp or wealth but have been ever maintained by the universal body of true believers from the days of the apostles and will be so to the resurrection neither will the gates of hell prevail against them  it may be thought perhaps a strange thing that god should require us to believe mysteries while the reason or manner of what we are to believe is above our comprehension and wholly concealed from us neither doth it appear at first sight that the believing or not believing them doth concern either the glory of god or contribute to the goodness or wickedness of our lives but this is a great and dangerous mistake we see what a mighty weight is laid upon faith both in the old and new testament in the former we read how the faith of abraham is praised who could believe that god would raise from him a great nation at the very time that he was commanded to sacrifice his only son and despaired of any other issue and this was to him a great mystery our saviour is perpetually preaching faith to his disciples or reproaching them with the want of it and st paul produceth numerous examples of the wonders done by faith and all this is highly reasonable for faith is an entire dependence upon the truth the power the justice and the mercy of god which dependence will certainly incline us to obey him in all things so that the great excellency of faith consists in the consequence it hath upon our actions as if we depend upon the truth and wisdom of a man we shall certainly be more disposed to follow his advice therefore let no man think that he can lead as good a moral life without faith as with it for this reason because he who hath no faith cannot by the strength of his own reason or endeavours so easily resist temptations as the other who depends upon gods assistance in the overcoming his frailties and is sure to be rewarded for ever in heaven for his victory over them faith says the apostle is the evidence of things not seen he means that faith is a virtue by which anything commanded us by god to believe appears evident and certain to us although we do not see nor can conceive it because by faith we entirely depend upon the truth and power of god  it is an old and true distinction that things may be above our reason without being contrary to it of this kind are the power the nature and the universal presence of god with innumerable other points how little do those who quarrel with mysteries know of the commonest actions of nature the growth of an animal of a plant or of the smallest seed is a mystery to the wisest among men if an ignorant person were told that a loadstone would draw iron at a distance he might say it was a thing contrary to his reason and could not believe before he saw it with his eyes  the manner whereby the soul and body are united and how they are distinguished is wholly unaccountable to us we see but one part and yet we know we consist of two and this is a mystery we cannot comprehend any more than that of the trinity  from what hath been said it is manifest that god did never command us to believe nor his ministers to preach any doctrine which is contrary to the reason he hath pleased to endow us with but for his own wise ends has thought fit to conceal from us the nature of the thing he commands thereby to try our faith and obedience and increase our dependence upon him  it is highly probable that if god should please to reveal unto us this great mystery of the trinity or some other mysteries in our holy religion we should not be able to understand them unless he would at the same time think fit to bestow on us some new powers or faculties of the mind which we want at present and are reserved till the day of resurrection to life eternal for now as the apostle says we see through a glass darkly but then face to face  thus we see the matter is brought to this issue we must either believe what god directly commands us in holy scripture or we must wholly reject the scripture and the christian religion which we pretend to profess but this i hope is too desperate a step for any of us to make  i have already observed that those who preach up the belief of the trinity or of any other mystery cannot propose any temporal advantage to themselves by so doing but this is not the case of those who oppose these doctrines do they lead better moral lives than a good christian are they more just in their dealings more chaste or temperate or charitable nothing at all of this but on the contrary their intent is to overthrow all religion that they may gratify their vices without any reproach from the world or their own conscience and are zealous to bring over as many others as they can to their own opinions because it is some kind of imaginary comfort to have a multitude on their side  there is no miracle mentioned in holy writ which if it were strictly examined is not as much contrary to common reason and as much a mystery as this doctrine of the trinity and therefore we may with equal justice deny the truth of them all for instance it is against the laws of nature that a human body should be able to walk upon the water as st peter is recorded to have done or that a dead carcass should be raised from the grave after three days when it began to be corrupted which those who understand anatomy will pronounce to be impossible by the common rules of nature and reason yet these miracles and many others are positively affirmed in the gospel and these we must believe or give up our holy religion to atheists and infidels  i shall now make a few inferences and observations upon what has been said  first it would be well if people would not lay so much weight on their own reason in matters of religion as to think everything impossible and absurd which they cannot conceive how often do we contradict the right rules of reason in the whole course of our lives reason itself is true and just but the reason of every particular man is weak and wavering perpetually swayed and turned by his interests his passions and his vices let any man but consider when he hath a controversy with another although his cause be ever so unjust although the world be against him how blinded he is by the love of himself to believe that right is wrong and wrong is right when it maketh for his own advantage where is then the right use of his reason which he so much boasts of and which he would blasphemously set up to control the commands of the almighty  secondly when men are tempted to deny the mysteries of religion let them examine and search into their own hearts whether they have not some favourite sin which is of their party in this dispute and which is equally contrary to other commands of god in the gospel for why do men love darkness rather than light the scripture tells us because their deeds are evil and there can be no other reason assigned therefore when men are curious and inquisitive to discover some weak sides in christianity and inclined to favour everything that is offered to its disadvantage it is plain they wish it were not true and those wishes can proceed from nothing but an evil conscience because if there be truth in our religion their condition must be miserable  and therefore thirdly men should consider that raising difficulties concerning the mysteries in religion cannot make them more wise learned or virtuous better neighbours or friends or more serviceable to their country but whatever they pretend will destroy their inward peace of mind by perpetual doubts and fears arising in their breasts and god forbid we should ever see the times so bad when dangerous opinions in religion will be a means to get favour and preferment although even in such a case it would be an ill traffic to gain the world and lose our own souls so that upon the whole it will be impossible to find any real use toward a virtuous or happy life by denying the mysteries of the gospel  fourthly those strong unbelievers who expect that all mysteries should be squared and fitted to their own reason might have somewhat to say for themselves if they could satisfy the general reason of mankind in their opinions but herein they are miserably defective absurd and ridiculous they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel they can believe that the world was made by chance that god doth not concern himself with things below will neither punish vice nor reward virtue that religion was invented by cunning men to keep the world in awe with many other opinions equally false and detestable against the common light of nature as well as reason against the universal sentiments of all civilized nations and offensive to the ears even of a sober heathen  lastly since the world abounds with pestilent books particularly against this doctrine of the trinity it is fit to inform you that the authors of them proceed wholly upon a mistake they would shew how impossible it is that three can be one and one can be three whereas the scripture saith no such thing at least in that manner they would make it but only that there is some kind of unity and distinction in the divine nature which mankind cannot possibly comprehend thus the whole doctrine is short and plain and in itself incapable of any controversy since god himself hath pronounced the fact but wholly concealed the manner and therefore many divines who thought fit to answer those wicked books have been mistaken too by answering fools in their folly and endeavouring to explain a mystery which god intended to keep secret from us and as i would exhort all men to avoid reading those wicked books written against this doctrine as dangerous and pernicious so i think they may omit the answers as unnecessary this i confess will probably affect but few or none among the generality of our congregations who do not much trouble themselves with books at least of this kind however many who do not read themselves are seduced by others that do and thus become unbelievers upon trust and at secondhand and this is too frequent a case for which reason i have endeavoured to put this doctrine upon a short and sure foot levelled to the meanest understanding by which we may as the apostle directs be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh us a reason of the hope that is in us with meekness and fear  and thus i have done with my subject which probably i should not have chosen if i had not been invited to it by the occasion of this season appointed on purpose to celebrate the mysteries of the trinity and the descent of the holy ghost wherein we pray to be kept stedfast in this faith and what this faith is i have shewn you in the plainest manner i could for upon the whole it is no more than this god commandeth us by our dependence upon his truth and his holy word to believe a fact that we do not understand and this is no more than what we do every day in the works of nature upon the credit of men of learning without faith we can do no works acceptable to god for if they proceed from any other principle they will not advance our salvation and this faith as i have explained it we may acquire without giving up our senses or contradicting our reason may god of his infinite mercy inspire us with true faith in every article and mystery of our holy religion so as to dispose us to do what is pleasing in his sight and this we pray through jesus christ to whom with the father and the holy ghost the mysterious incomprehensible one god be all honour and glory now and for evermore amen     on brotherly love1  footnote 1 notwithstanding the text and title of this sermon and the many excellent observations which it contains in illustration of both there are several passages in it which the dissenters of the time would hardly consider as propitiatory towards the continuance of brotherly love there are also various allusions to the parties which raged at the time and some which appear to have been written in defence of the preachers character then severely arraigned by the irish whigs and held in abhorrence by the people of dublin by whom he was afterwards idolized s   heb xiii i  let brotherly love continue   in the early times of the gospel the christians were very much distinguished from all other bodies of men by the great and constant love they bore to each other which although it was done in obedience to the frequent injunctions of our saviour and his apostles yet i confess there seemeth to have been likewise a natural reason that very much promoted it for the christians then were few and scattered living under persecution by the heathens round about them in whose hands was all the civil and military power and there is nothing so apt to unite the minds and hearts of men or to beget love and tenderness as a general distress the first dissensions between christians took their beginning from the errors and heresies that arose among them many of those heresies sometimes extinguished and sometimes reviving or succeeded by others remain to this day and having been made instruments to the pride avarice or ambition of illdesigning men by extinguishing brotherly love have been the cause of infinite calamities as well as corruptions of faith and manners in the christian world  the last legacy of christ was peace and mutual love but then he foretold that he came to send a sword upon the earth the primitive christians accepted the legacy and their successors down to the present age have been largely fulfilling his prophecy but whatever the practice of mankind hath been or still continues there is no duty more incumbent upon those who profess the gospel than that of brotherly love which whoever could restore in any degree among men would be an instrument of more good to human society than ever was or will be done by all the statesmen and politicians in the world  it is upon this subject of brotherly love that i intend to discourse at present and the method i observe shall be as follows  i first i will inquire into the causes of this great want of brotherly love among us  ii secondly i will lay open the sad effects and consequences which our animosities and mutual hatred have produced  iii lastly i will use some motives and exhortations that may persuade you to embrace brotherly love and continue in it   i first i shall enquire into the causes of this great want of brotherly love among us  this nation of ours hath for an hundred years past been infested by two enemies the papists and fanatics who each in their turns filled it with blood and slaughter and for a time destroyed both the church and government the memory of these events hath put all true protestants equally upon their guard against both these adversaries who by consequence do equally hate us the fanatics revile us as too nearly approaching to popery and the papists condemn us as bordering too much on fanaticism the papists god be praised are by the wisdom of our laws put out of all visible possibility of hurting us besides their religion is so generally abhorred that they have no advocates or abettors among protestants to assist them but the fanatics are to be considered in another light they have had of late years the power the luck or the cunning to divide us among ourselves they have endeavoured to represent all those who have been so bold as to oppose their errors and designs under the character of persons disaffected to the government and they have so far succeeded that nowadays if a clergyman happens to preach with any zeal and vehemence against the sin and danger of schism there will not want too many in his congregation ready enough to censure him as hot and highflying an inflamer of mens minds an enemy to moderation and disloyal to his prince this hath produced a formed and settled division between those who profess the same doctrine and discipline while they who call themselves moderate are forced to widen their bottom by sacrificing their principles and their brethren to the encroachments and insolence of dissenters who are therefore answerable as a principal cause of all that hatred and animosity now reigning among us  another cause of the great want of brotherly love is the weakness and folly of too many among you of the lower sort who are made the tools and instruments of your betters to work their designs wherein you have no concern your numbers make you of use and cunning men take the advantage by putting words into your mouths which you do not understand then they fix good or ill characters to those words as it best serves their purposes and thus you are taught to love or hate you know not what or why you often suspect your best friends and nearest neighbours even your teacher himself without any reason if your leaders once taught you to call him by a name which they tell you signifieth some very bad thing  a third cause of our great want of brotherly love seemeth to be that this duty is not so often insisted on from the pulpit as it ought to be in such times as these on the contrary it is to be doubted whether doctrines are not sometimes delivered by an ungoverned zeal a desire to be distinguished or a view of interest which produce quite different effects when upon occasions set apart to return thanks to god for some public blessing the time is employed in stirring up one part of the congregation against the other by representations of things and persons which god in his mercy forgive those who are guilty of  the last cause i shall mention of the want of brotherly love is that unhappy disposition towards politics among the trading people which has been industriously instilled into them in former times the middle and lower sorts of mankind seldom gained or lost by the factions of the kingdom and therefore were little concerned in them further than as matter of talk and amusement but now the meanest dealer will expect to turn the penny by the merits of his party he can represent his neighbour as a man of dangerous principles can bring a railing accusation against him perhaps a criminal one and so rob him of his livelihood and find his own account by that much more than if he had disparaged his neighbours goods or defamed him as a cheat for so it happens that instead of enquiring into the skill or honesty of those kind of people the manner is now to enquire into their party and to reject or encourage them accordingly which proceeding hath made our people in general such able politicians that all the artifice flattery dissimulation diligence and dexterity in undermining each other which the satirical wit of men hath charged upon courts together with all the rage and violence cruelty and injustice which have been ever imputed to public assemblies are with us so polite are we grown to be seen among our meanest traders and artificers in the greatest perfection all which as it may be matter of some humiliation to the wise and mighty of this world so the effects thereof may perhaps in time prove very different from what i hope in charity were ever foreseen or intended  ii i will therefore now in the second place lay open some of the sad effects and consequences which our animosities and mutual hatred have produced  and the first ill consequence is that our want of brotherly love hath almost driven out all sense of religion from among us which cannot well be otherwise for since our saviour laid so much weight upon his disciples loving one another that he gave it among his last instructions and since the primitive christians are allowed to have chiefly propagated the faith by their strict observance of that instruction it must follow that in proportion as brotherly love declineth christianity will do so too the little religion there is in the world hath been observed to reside chiefly among the middle and lower sorts of people who are neither tempted to pride nor luxury by great riches nor to desperate courses by extreme poverty and truly i upon that account have thought it a happiness that those who are under my immediate care are generally of that condition but where party hath once made entrance with all its consequences of hatred envy partiality and virulence religion cannot long keep its hold in any state or degree of life whatsoever for if the great men of the world have been censured in all ages for mingling too little religion with their politics what a havoc of principles must they needs make in unlearned and irregular heads of which indeed the effects are already too visible and melancholy all over the kingdom  another ill consequence from our want of brotherly love is that it increaseth the insolence of the fanatics and this partly ariseth from a mistaken meaning of the word moderation a word which hath been much abused and bandied about for several years past there are too many people indifferent enough to all religion there are many others who dislike the clergy and would have them live in poverty and dependence both these sorts are much commended by the fanatics for moderate men ready to put an end to our divisions and to make a general union among protestants many ignorant wellmeaning people are deceived by these appearances strengthened with great pretences to loyalty and these occasions the fanatics lay hold on to revile the doctrine and discipline of the church and even insult and oppress the clergy wherever their numbers or favourers will bear them out insomuch that one wilful refractory fanatic hath been able to disturb a whole parish for many years together but the most moderate and favoured divines dare not own that the word moderation with respect to the dissenters can be at all applied to their religion but is purely personal or prudential no good man repineth at the liberty of conscience they enjoy and perhaps a very moderate divine may think better of their loyalty than others do or to speak after the manner of men may think it necessary that all protestants should be united against the common enemy or out of discretion or other reasons best known to himself be tender of mentioning them at all but still the errors of the dissenters are all fixed and determined and must upon demand be acknowledged by all the divines of our church whether they be called in party phrase high or low moderate or violent and further i believe it would be hard to find many moderate divines who if their opinion were asked whether dissenters should be trusted with power could according to their consciences answer in the affirmative from whence it is plain that all the stir which the fanatics have made with this word moderation was only meant to increase our divisions and widen them so far as to make room for themselves to get in between and this is the only scheme they ever had except that of destroying root and branch for the uniting of protestants they so much talk of  i shall mention but one ill consequence more which attends our want of brotherly love that it hath put an end to all hospitality and friendship all good correspondence and commerce between mankind there are indeed such things as leagues and confederacies among those of the same party but surely god never intended that men should be so limited in the choice of their friends however so it is in town and country in every parish and street the pastor is divided from his flock the father from his son and the house often divided against itself mens very natures are soured and their passions inflamed when they meet in party clubs and spend their time in nothing else but railing at the opposite side thus every man alive among us is encompassed with a million of enemies of his own country among which his oldest acquaintance and friends and kindred themselves are often of the number neither can people of different parties mix together without constraint suspicion or jealousy watching every word they speak for fear of giving offence or else falling into rudeness and reproaches and so leaving themselves open to the malice and corruption of informers who were never more numerous or expert in their trade and as a further addition to this evil those very few who by the goodness and generosity of their nature do in their own hearts despise this narrow principle of confining their friendship and esteem their charity and good offices to those of their own party yet dare not discover their good inclinations for fear of losing their favour and interest and others again whom god had formed with mild and gentle dispositions think it necessary to put a force upon their own tempers by acting a noisy violent malicious part as a means to be distinguished thus hath party got the better of the very genius and constitution of our people so that whoever reads the character of the english in former ages will hardly believe their present posterity to be of the same nation or climate  iii i shall now in the last place make use of some motives and exhortations that may persuade you to embrace brotherly love and continue in it let me apply myself to you of the lower sort and desire you will consider when any of you make use of fair and enticing words to draw in customers whether you do it for their sakes or your own and then for whose sakes do you think it is that your leaders are so industrious to put into your heads all that party rage and virulence is it not to make you the tools and instruments by which they work out their own designs has this spirit of faction been useful to any of you in your worldly concerns except to those who have traded in whispering backbiting or informing and wanted skill or honesty to thrive by fairer methods it is no business of yours to inquire who is at the head of armies or of councils unless you had power and skill to choose neither of which is ever likely to be your case and therefore to fill your heads with fears and hatred of persons and things of which it is impossible you can ever make a right judgment or to set you at variance with your neighbour because his thoughts are not the same as yours is not only in a very gross manner to cheat you of your time and quiet but likewise to endanger your souls  secondly in order to restore brotherly love let me earnestly exhort you to stand firm in your religion i mean the true religion hitherto established among us without varying in the least either to popery on the one side or to fanaticism on the other and in a particular manner beware of that word moderation and believe it that your neighbour is not immediately a villain a papist and a traitor because the fanatics and their adherents will not allow him to be a moderate man  nay it is very probable that your teacher himself may be a loyal pious and able divine without the least grain of moderation as the word is too frequently understood therefore to set you right in this matter i will lay before you the character of a truly moderate man and then i will give you the description of such a one as falsely pretendeth to that title  a man truly moderate is steady in the doctrine and discipline of the church but with a due christian charity to all who dissent from it out of a principle of conscience the freedom of which he thinketh ought to be fully allowed as long as it is not abused but never trusted with power he is ready to defend with his life and fortune the protestant succession and the protestant established faith against all invaders whatsoever he is for giving the crown its just prerogative and the people their just liberties he hateth no man for differing from him in political opinions nor doth he think it a maxim infallible that virtue should always attend upon favour and vice upon disgrace these are some few lineaments in the character of a truly moderate man let us now compare it with the description of one who usually passeth under that title  a moderate man in the new meaning of the word is one to whom all religion is indifferent who although he denominates himself of the church regardeth it no more than a conventicle he perpetually raileth at the body of the clergy with exceptions only to a very few who he hopeth and probably upon false grounds are as ready to betray their rights and properties as himself he thinketh the power of the people can never be too great nor that of the prince too little and yet this very notion he publisheth as his best argument to prove him a most loyal subject every opinion in government that differeth in the least from his tendeth directly to popery slavery and rebellion whoever lieth under the frown of power can in his judgment neither have common sense common honesty nor religion lastly his devotion consisteth in drinking gibbets confusion and damnation1 in profanely idolizing the memory of one dead prince2 and ungratefully trampling upon the ashes of another3  footnote 1 the subject of these political toasts was the theme of much discussion in ireland s  footnote 2 king william  footnote 3 queen anne  by these marks you will easily distinguish a truly moderate man from those who are commonly but very falsely so called and while persons thus qualified are so numerous and so noisy so full of zeal and industry to gain proselytes and spread their opinions among the people it cannot be wondered at that there should be so little brotherly love left among us  lastly it would probably contribute to restore some degree of brotherly love if we would but consider that the matter of those disputes which inflame us to this degree doth not in its own nature at all concern the generality of mankind indeed as to those who have been great gainers or losers by the changes of the world the case is different and to preach moderation to the first and patience to the last would perhaps be to little purpose but what is that to the bulk of the people who are not properly concerned in the quarrel although evil instruments have drawn them into it for if the reasonable men on both sides were to confer opinions they would find neither religion loyalty nor interest are at all affected in this dispute not religion because the members of the church on both sides profess to agree in every article not loyalty to our prince which is pretended to by one party as much as the other and therefore can be no subject for debate not interest for trade and industry lie open to all and what is further concerns only those who have expectations from the public so that the body of the people if they knew their own good might yet live amicably together and leave their betters to quarrel among themselves who might also probably soon come to a better temper if they were less seconded and supported by the poor deluded multitude  i have now done with my text which i confess to have treated in a manner more suited to the present times than to the nature of the subject in general that i have not been more particular in explaining the several parts and properties of this great duty of brotherly love the apostle to the thessalonians will plead my excusetouching brotherly love saith he ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another4 so that nothing remains to add but our prayers to god that he would please to restore and continue this duty of brotherly love or charity among us the very bond of peace and of all virtues  footnote 4 1 thess iv 9  nov 29 1717      the difficulty of knowing onesself1  footnote 1 prefixed to the issue in volume ten miscellanies 1745 is the following  advertisement  the manuscript title page of the following sermon being lost and no memorandum writ upon it as there were upon the others when and where it was preached made the editor doubtful whether he should print it as the deans or not but its being found amongst the same papers and the hand though writ somewhat better bearing a great similitude to the deans made him willing to lay it before the public that they might judge whether the style and manner also does not render it still more probable to be his ts   2 kings viii part of the 13th verse  and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing   we have a very singular instance of the deceitfulness of the heart represented to us in the person of hazael who was sent to the prophet elisha to enquire of the lord concerning his master the king of syrias recovery for the man of god having told him that the king might recover from the disorder he was then labouring under begun to set and fasten his countenance upon him of a sudden and to break out into the most violent expressions of sorrow and a deep concern for it whereupon when hazael full of shame and confusion asked why weepeth my lord he answered because i know all the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strongholds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child thus much did the man of god say and know of him by a light darted into his mind from heaven but hazael not knowing himself so well as the other did was startled and amazed at the relation and would not believe it possible that a man of his temper could ever run out into such enormous instances of cruelty and inhumanity what says he is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing  and yet for all this it is highly probable that he was then that man he could not imagine himself to be for we find him on the very next day after his return in a very treacherous and disloyal manner murdering his own master and usurping his kingdom which was but a prologue to the sad tragedy which he afterwards acted upon the people of israel  and now the case is but very little better with most men than it was with hazael however it comes to pass they are wonderfully unacquainted with their own temper and disposition and know very little of what passes within them for of so many proud ambitious revengeful envying and illnatured persons that are in the world where is there one of them who although he has all the symptoms of the vice appearing upon every occasion can look with such an impartial eye upon himself as to believe that the imputation thrown upon him is not altogether groundless and unfair who if he were told by men of a discerning spirit and a strong conjecture of all the evil and absurd things which that false heart of his would at one time or other betray him into would not believe as little and wonder as much as hazael did before him thus for instance tell an angry person that he is weak and impotent and of no consistency of mind tell him that such or such a little accident which he may then despise and think much below a passion shall hereafter make him say and do several absurd indiscreet and misbecoming things he may perhaps own that he has a spirit of resentment within him that will not let him be imposed on but he fondly imagines that he can lay a becoming restraint upon it when he pleases although tis ever running away with him into some indecency or other  therefore to bring the words of my text to our present occasion i shall endeavour in a further prosecution of them to evince the great necessity of a nice and curious inspection into the several recesses of the heart being the surest and the shortest method that a wicked man can take to reform himself for let us but stop the fountain and the streams will spend and waste themselves away in a very little time but if we go about like children to raise a bank and to stop the current not taking notice all the while of the spring which continually feeds it when the next flood of temptation rises and breaks in upon it then we shall find that we have begun at the wrong end of our duty and that we are very little more the better for it than if we had sat still and made no advances at all  but in order to a clearer explanation of the point i shall speak to these following particulars  first by endeavouring to prove from particular instances that man is generally the most ignorant creature in the world of himself  secondly by inquiring into the grounds and reasons of his ignorance  thirdly and lastly by proposing several advantages that do most assuredly attend a due improvement in the knowledge of ourselves   first then to prove that man is generally the most ignorant creature in the world of himself  to pursue the heart of man through all the instances of life in all its several windings and turnings and under that infinite variety of shapes and appearances which it puts on would be a difficult and almost impossible undertaking so that i shall confine myself to such as have a nearer reference to the present occasion and do upon a closer view shew themselves through the whole business of repentance for we all know what it is to repent but whether he repents him truly of his sins or not who can know it  now the great duty of repentance is chiefly made up of these two parts a hearty sorrow for the follies and miscarriages of the time past and a full purpose and resolution of amendment for the time to come and now to shew the falseness of the heart in both these parts of repentance and  first as to a hearty sorrow for the sins and miscarriages of the time past is there a more usual thing than for a man to impose upon himself by putting on a grave and demure countenance by casting a severe look into his past conduct and making some few pious and devout reflections upon it and then to believe that he has repented to an excellent purpose without ever letting it step forth into practice and shew itself in a holy conversation nay some persons do carry the deceit a little higher who if they can but bring themselves to weep for their sins they are then full of an illgrounded confidence and security never considering that all this may prove to be no more than the very garb and outward dress of a contrite heart which another heart as hard as the nether millstone may as well put on for tears and sighs however in some persons they may be decent and commendable expressions of a godly sorrow are neither necessary nor infallible signs of a true and unfeigned repentance not necessary because sometimes and in some persons the inward grief and anguish of the mind may be too big to be expressed by so little a thing as a tear and then it turneth its edge inward upon the mind and like those wounds of the body which bleed inwardly generally proves the most fatal and dangerous to the whole body of sin not infallible because a very small portion of sorrow may make some tender dispositions melt and break out into tears or a man may perhaps weep at parting with his sins as he would bid the last farewell to an old friend  but there is still a more pleasant cheat in this affair that when we find a deadness and a strange kind of unaptness and indisposition to all impressions of religion and that we cannot be as truly sorry for our sins as we should be we then pretend to be sorry that we are not more sorry for them which is not more absurd and irrational than that a man should pretend to be very angry at a thing because he did not know how to be angry at all  but after all what is wanting in this part of repentance we expect to make up in the next and to that purpose we put on a resolution of amendment which we take to be as firm as a house built upon a rock so that let the floods arise and the winds blow and the streams beat vehemently upon it nothing shall shake it into ruin or disorder we doubt not upon the strength of this resolve to stand fast and unmoved amid the storm of a temptation and do firmly believe at the time we make it that nothing in the world will ever be able to make us commit those sins over again which we have so firmly resolved against  thus many a time have we come to the sacrament of the lords supper with a full purpose of amendment and with as full a persuasion of putting that same purpose into practice and yet have we not all as often broke that good purpose and falsified that same persuasion by starting aside like a broken bow into those very sins which we then so solemnly and so confidently declared against  whereas had but any other person entered with us into a vow so solemn that he had taken the holy sacrament upon it i believe had he but once deceived us by breaking in upon the vow we should hardly ever after be prevailed upon to trust that man again though we still continue to trust our own fears against reason and against experience  this indeed is a dangerous deceit enough and will of course betray all those wellmeaning persons into sin and folly who are apt to take religion for a much easier thing than it is but this is not the only mistake we are apt to run into we do not only think sometimes that we can do more than we can do but sometimes that we are incapable of doing less an error of another kind indeed but not less dangerous arising from a diffidence and false humility for how much a wicked man can do in the business of religion if he would but do his best is very often more than he can tell  thus nothing is more common than to see a wicked man running headlong into sin and folly against his reason against his religion and against his god tell him that what he is going to do will be an infinite disparagement to his understanding which at another time he sets no small value upon tell him that it will blacken his reputation which he had rather die for than lose tell him that the pleasure of sin is short and transient and leaves a vexatious kind of sting behind it which will very hardly be drawn forth tell him that this is one of those things for which god will most surely bring him to judgment which he pretends to believe with a full assurance and persuasion and yet for all this he shuts his eyes against all conviction and rusheth into the sin like a horse into battle as if he had nothing left to do but like a silly child to wink hard and to think to escape a certain and infinite mischief only by endeavouring not to see it  and now to shew that the heart has given in a false report of the temptation we may learn from this that the same weak man would resist and master the same powerful temptation upon considerations of infinitely less value than those which religion offers nay such vile considerations that the grace of god cannot without blasphemy be supposed to add any manner of force and efficacy to them thus for instance it would be a hard matter to dress up a sin in such soft and tempting circumstances that a truly covetous man would not resist for a considerable sum of money when neither the hopes of heaven nor the fears of hell could make an impression upon him before but can anything be a surer indication of the deceitfulness of the heart than thus to shew more courage resolution and activity in an ill cause than it does in a good one and to exert itself to better purpose when it is to serve its own pride or lust or revenge or any other passion than when it is to serve god upon motives of the gospel and upon all the arguments that have ever been made use of to bring men over to religion and a good life and thus having shewn that man is wonderfully apt to deceive and impose upon himself in passing through the several stages of that great duty repentance i proceed now in the  second place to inquire into the grounds and reasons of this ignorance and to shew whence it comes to pass that man the only creature in the world that can reflect and look into himself should know so little of what passes within him and be so very much unacquainted even with the standing dispositions and complexion of his own heart the prime reason of it is because we so very seldom converse with ourselves and take so little notice of what passes within us for a man can no more know his own heart than he can know his own face any other way than by reflection he may as well tell over every feature of the smaller portions of his face without the help of a lookingglass as he can tell all the inward bents and tendencies of his soul those standing features and lineaments of the inward man and know all the various changes that this is liable to from custom from passion and from opinion without a very frequent use of looking within himself  for our passions and inclinations are not always upon the wing and always moving toward their respective objects but retire now and then into the more dark and hidden recesses of the heart where they lie concealed for a while until a fresh occasion calls them forth again so that not every transient oblique glance upon the mind can bring a man into a thorough knowledge of all its strength and weaknesses for a man may sometimes turn the eye of the mind inward upon itself as he may behold his natural face in a glass and go away and straight forget what manner of man he was but a man must rather sit down and unravel every action of the past day into all its circumstances and particularities and observe how every little thing moved and affected him and what manner of impression it made upon his heart this done with that frequency and carefulness which the importance of the duty does require would in a short time bring him into a nearer and more intimate acquaintance with himself  but when men instead of this do pass away months and years in a perfect slumber of the mind without once awaking it it is no wonder they should be so very ignorant of themselves and know very little more of what passes within them than the very beasts which perish but here it may not be amiss to inquire into the reasons why most men have so little conversation with themselves  and first  because this reflection is a work and labour of the mind and cannot be performed without some pain and difficulty for before a man can reflect upon himself and look into his heart with a steady eye he must contract his sight and collect all his scattering and roving thoughts into some order and compass that he may be able to take a clear and distinct view of them he must retire from the world for a while and be unattentive to all impressions of sense and how hard and painful a thing must it needs be to a man of passion and infirmity amid such a crowd of objects that are continually striking upon the sense and soliciting the affections not to be moved and interrupted by one or other of them but  secondly another reason why we so seldom converse with ourselves is because the business of the world takes up all our time and leaveth us no portion of it to spend upon this great work and labour of the mind thus twelve or fourteen years pass away before we can well discern good from evil and of the rest so much goes away in sleep so much in the proper business of our calling that we have none to lay out upon the more serious and religious employments every mans life is an imperfect sort of a circle which he repeats and runs over every day he has a set of thoughts desires and inclinations which return upon him in their proper time and order and will very hardly be laid aside to make room for anything new and uncommon so that call upon him when you please to set about the study of his own heart and you are sure to find him preengaged either he has some business to do or some diversion to take some acquaintance that he must visit or some company that he must entertain or some cross accident has put him out of humour and unfitted him for such a grave employment and thus it cometh to pass that a man can never find leisure to look into himself because he does not set apart some portion of the day for that very purpose but foolishly defers it from one day to another till his glass is almost run out and he is called to give a miserable account of himself in the other world but  thirdly another reason why a man does not more frequently converse with himself is because such conversation with his own heart may discover some vice or some infirmity lurking within him which he is very unwilling to believe himself guilty of for can there be a more ungrateful thing to a man than to find that upon a nearer view he is not that person he took himself to be that he had neither the courage nor the honesty nor the piety nor the humility that he dreamed he had that a very little pain for instance putteth him out of patience and as little pleasure softens and disarms him into ease and wantonness that he has been at more pains and labour and cost to be revenged of an enemy than to oblige the best friend he has in the world that he cannot bring himself to say his prayers without a great deal of reluctancy and when he does say them the spirit and fervour of devotion evaporate in a very short time and he can scarcely hold out a prayer of ten lines without a number of idle and impertinent if not vain and wicked thoughts coming into his head these are very unwelcome discoveries that a man may make of himself so that tis no wonder that every one who is already flushed with a good opinion of himself should rather study how to run away from it than how to converse with his own heart  but further if a man were both able and willing to retire into his own heart and to set apart some portion of the day for that very purpose yet he is still disabled from passing a fair and impartial judgment upon himself by several difficulties arising partly from prejudice and prepossession partly from the lower appetites and inclinations and  first that the business of prepossession may lead and betray a man into a false judgment of his own heart for we may observe that the first opinion we take up of anything or any person does generally stick close to us the nature of the mind being such that it cannot but desire and consequently endeavour to have some certain principles to go upon something fixed and unmoveable whereon it may rest and support itself and hence it comes to pass that some persons are with so much difficulty brought to think well of a man they have once entertained an ill opinion of and perhaps that too for a very absurd and unwarrantable reason but how much more difficult then must it be for a man who takes up a fond opinion of his own heart long before he has either years or sense enough to understand it either to be persuaded out of it by himself whom he loveth so well or by another whose interest or diversion it may be to make him ashamed of himself then  secondly as to the difficulties arising from the inferior appetites and inclinations let any man look into his own heart and observe in how different a light and under what different complexions any two sins of equal turpitude and malignity do appear to him if he has but a strong inclination to the one and none at all to the other that which he has an inclination to is always drest up in all the false beauty that a fond and busy imagination can give it the other appears naked and deformed and in all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour thus stealing is a vice that few gentlemen are inclined to and they justly think it below the dignity of a man to stoop to so base and low a sin but no principle of honour no workings of the mind and conscience not the still voice of mercy not the dreadful call of judgment nor any considerations whatever can put a stop to that violence and oppression that pride and ambition that revelling and wantonness which we every day meet with in the world nay it is easy to observe very different thoughts in a man of the sin that he is most fond of according to the different ebbs and flows of his inclination to it for as soon as the appetite is alarmed and seizeth upon the heart a little cloud gathereth about the head and spreads a kind of darkness over the face of the soul whereby tis hindered from taking a clear and distinct view of things but no sooner is the appetite tired and satiated but the same cloud passes away like a shadow and a new light springing up in the mind of a sudden the man sees much more both of the folly and of the danger of the sin than he did before  and thus having done with the several reasons why man the only creature in the world that can reflect and look into himself is so very ignorant of what passes within him and so much unacquainted with the standing dispositions and complexions of his own heart i proceed now in the  third and last place to lay down several advantages that do most assuredly attend a due improvement in the knowledge of ourselves and  first one great advantage is that it tends very much to mortify and humble a man into a modest and low opinion of himself for let a man take a nice and curious inspection into all the several regions of the heart and observe every thing irregular and amiss within him for instance how narrow and shortsighted a thing is the understanding upon how little reason do we take up an opinion and upon how much less sometimes do we lay it down again how weak and false ground do we often walk upon with the biggest confidence and assurance and how tremulous and doubtful are we very often where no doubt is to be made again how wild and impertinent how busy and incoherent a thing is the imagination even in the best and wisest men insomuch that every man may be said to be mad but every man does not shew it then as to the passions how noisy how turbulent and how tumultuous are they how easy they are stirred and set agoing how eager and hot in the pursuit and what strange disorder and confusion do they throw a man into so that he can neither think nor speak nor act as he should do while he is under the dominion of any one of them  thus let every man look with a severe and impartial eye into all the distinct regions of the heart and no doubt several deformities and irregularities that he never thought of will open and disclose themselves upon so near a view and rather make the man ashamed of himself than proud  secondly a due improvement in the knowledge of ourselves does certainly secure us from the sly and insinuating assaults of flattery there is not in the world a baser and more hateful thing than flattery it proceeds from so much falseness and insincerity in the man that gives it and often discovers so much weakness and folly in the man that takes it that it is hard to tell which of the two is most to be blamed every man of common sense can demonstrate in speculation and may be fully convinced that all the praises and commendations of the whole world can add no more to the real and intrinsic value of a man than they can add to his stature and yet for all this men of the best sense and piety when they come down to the practice cannot forbear thinking much better of themselves when they have the good fortune to be spoken well of by other persons  but the meaning of this absurd proceeding seems to be no other than this there are few men that have so intimate an acquaintance with their own heart as to know their own real worth and how to set a just rate upon themselves and therefore they do not know but that he who praises them most may be most in the right of it for no doubt if a man were ignorant of the true value of a thing he loved as well as himself he would measure the worth of it according to the esteem of him who bids most for it rather than of him that bids less  therefore the most infallible way to disentangle a man from the snares of flattery is to consult and study his own heart for whoever does that well will hardly be so absurd as to take another mans word before his own sense and experience  thirdly another advantage from this kind of study is this that it teaches a man how to behave himself patiently when he has the ill fortune to be censured and abused by other people for a man who is thoroughly acquainted with his own heart does already know more evil of himself than anybody else can tell him and when any one speaks ill of him he rather thanks god that he can say no worse for could his enemy but look into the dark and hidden recesses of the heart he considers what a number of impure thoughts he might there see brooding and hovering like a dark cloud upon the face of the soul that there he might take a prospect of the fancy and view it acting over the several scenes of pride of ambition of envy of lust and revenge that there he might tell how often a vicious inclination has been restrained for no other reason but just to save the mans credit or interest in the world and how many unbecoming ingredients have entered into the composition of his best actions and now what man in the whole world would be able to bear so severe a test to have every thought and inward motion of the heart laid open and exposed to the views of his enemies but  fourthly and lastly another advantage of this kind is that it makes men less severe upon other peoples faults and less busy and industrious in spreading them for a man employed at home inspecting into his own failings has not leisure to take notice of every little spot and blemish that lies scattered upon others or if he cannot escape the sight of them he always passes the most easy and favourable construction upon them thus for instance does the ill he knows of a man proceed from an unhappy temper and constitution of body he then considers with himself how hard a thing it is not to be borne down with the current of the blood and spirits and accordingly lays some part of the blame upon the weakness of human nature for he has felt the force and rapidity of it within his own breast though perhaps in another instance he remembers how it rages and swells by opposition and though it may be restrained or diverted for a while yet it can hardly ever be totally subdued  or has the man sinned out of custom he then from his own experience traces a habit into the very first rise and imperfect beginnings of it and can tell by how slow and insensible advances it creeps upon the heart how it works itself by degrees into the very frame and texture of it and so passes into a second nature and consequently he has a just sense of the great difficulty for him to learn to do good who has been long accustomed to do evil  or lastly has a false opinion betrayed him into a sin he then calls to mind what wrong apprehensions he has made of some things himself how many opinions that he once made no doubt of he has upon a stricter examination found to be doubtful and uncertain how many more to be unreasonable and absurd he knows further that there are a great many more opinions that he has never yet examined into at all and which however he still believes for no other reason but because he has believed them so long already without a reason thus upon every occasion a man intimately acquainted with himself consults his own heart and makes every mans case to be his own and so puts the most favourable interpretation upon it let every man therefore look into his own heart before he beginneth to abuse the reputation of another and then he will hardly be so absurd as to throw a dart that will so certainly rebound and wound himself and thus through the whole course of his conversation let him keep an eye upon that one great comprehensive rule of christian duty on which hangs not only the law and the prophets but the very life and spirit of the gospel too whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them which rule that we may all duly observe by throwing aside all scandal and detraction all spite and rancour all rudeness and contempt all rage and violence and whatever tends to make conversation and commerce either uneasy or troublesome may the god of peace grant for jesus christ his sake c  consider what has been said c     on false witness   exodus xx 16  thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour   in those great changes that are made in a country by the prevailing of one party over another it is very convenient that the prince and those who are in authority under him should use all just and proper methods for preventing any mischief to the public from seditious men and governors do well when they encourage any good subject to discover as his duty obligeth him whatever plots or conspiracies may be anyway dangerous to the state neither are they to be blamed even when they receive informations from bad men in order to find out the truth when it concerns the public welfare every one indeed is naturally inclined to have an ill opinion of an informer although it is not impossible but an honest man may be called by that name for whoever knoweth anything the telling of which would prevent some great evil to his prince his country or his neighbour is bound in conscience to reveal it but the mischief is that when parties are violently enflamed which seemeth unfortunately to be our case at present there is never wanting a set of evil instruments who either out of mad zeal private hatred or filthy lucre are always ready to offer their service to the prevailing side and become accusers of their brethren without any regard to truth or charity holy david numbers this among the chief of his sufferings false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty1 our saviour and his apostles did likewise undergo the same distress as we read both in the gospels and the acts  footnote 1  psalm xxvii 12  now because the sign of false witnessing is so horrible and dangerous in itself and so odious to god and man and because the bitterness of too many among us is risen to such a height that it is not easy to know where it will stop or how far some weak and wicked minds may be carried by a mistaken zeal a malicious temper or hope of reward to break this great commandment delivered in the text therefore in order to prevent this evil and the consequences of it at least among you who are my hearers i shall  i first shew you several ways by which a man may be called a false witness against his neighbour  ii secondly i shall give you some rules for your conduct and behaviour in order to defend yourselves against the malice and cunning of false accusers  iii and lastly i shall conclude with shewing you very briefly how far it is your duty as good subjects and good neighbours to bear faithful witness when you are lawfully called to it by those in authority or by the sincere advice of your own consciences  i as to the first there are several ways by which a man may be justly called a false witness against his neighbour  first according to the direct meaning of the word when a man accuseth his neighbour without the least ground of truth so we read that jezebel hired two sons of belial to accuse naboth for blaspheming god and the king for which although he was entirely innocent he was stoned to death2 and in our age it is not easy to tell how many men have lost their lives been ruined in their fortunes and put to ignominious punishment by the downright perjury of false witnesses the law itself in such cases being not able to protect the innocent but this is so horrible a crime that it doth not need to be aggravated by words  footnote 2 i kings xxi 813  a second way by which a man becometh a false witness is when he mixeth falsehood and truth together or concealeth some circumstances which if they were told would destroy the falsehoods he uttereth so the two false witnesses who accused our saviour before the chief priests by a very little perverting his words would have made him guilty of a capital crime for so it was among the jews to prophesy any evil against the temple this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days3 whereas the words as our saviour spoke them were to another end and differently expressed for when the jews asked him to shew them a sign he said destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up in such cases as these an innocent man is half confounded and looketh as if he were guilty since he neither can deny his words nor perhaps readily strip them from the malicious additions of a false witness  footnote 3 mat xxvi 6  thirdly a man is a false witness when in accusing his neighbour he endeavoureth to aggravate by his gestures and tone of his voice or when he chargeth a man with words which were only repeated or quoted from somebody else as if any one should tell me that he heard another speak certain dangerous and seditious speeches and i should immediately accuse him for speaking them himself and so drop the only circumstance that made him innocent this was the case of st stephen the false witness said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law4 whereas st stephen said no such words but only repeated some prophecies of jeremiah or malachi which threatened jerusalem with destruction if it did not repent however by the fury of the people this innocent holy person was stoned to death for words he never spoke  footnote 4 acts vi 13  fourthly the blackest kind of false witnesses are those who do the office of the devil by tempting their brethren in order to betray them i cannot call to mind any instances of this kind mentioned in holy scripture but i am afraid this vile practice hath been too much followed in the world when a mans temper hath been so soured by misfortunes and hard usage that perhaps he hath reason enough to complain then one of these seducers under the pretence of friendship will seem to lament his case urge the hardships he hath suffered and endeavour to raise his passions until he hath said something that a malicious informer can pervert or aggravate against him in a court of justice  fifthly whoever beareth witness against his neighbour out of a principle of malice and revenge from any old grudge or hatred to his person such a man is a false witness in the sight of god although what he says be true because the motive or cause is evil not to serve his prince or country but to gratify his own resentments and therefore although a man thus accused may be very justly punished by the law yet this doth by no means acquit the accuser who instead of regarding the public service intended only to glut his private rage and spite  sixthly i number among false witnesses all those who make a trade of being informers in hope of favour or reward and to this end employ their time either by listening in public places to catch up an accidental word or in corrupting mens servants to discover any unwary expression of their master or thrusting themselves into company and then using the most indecent scurrilous language fastening a thousand falsehoods and scandals upon a whole party on purpose to provoke such an answer as they may turn to an accusation and truly this ungodly race is said to be grown so numerous that men of different parties can hardly converse together with any security even the pulpit hath not been free from the misrepresentation of these informers of whom the clergy have not wanted occasions to complain with holy david they daily mistake my words all they imagine is to do me evil nor is it any wonder at all that this trade of informing should be now in a flourishing condition since our case is manifestly thus we are divided into two parties with very little charity or temper toward each other the prevailing side may talk of past things as they please with security and generally do it in the most provoking words they can invent while those who are down are sometimes tempted to speak in favour of a lost cause and therefore without great caution must needs be often caught tripping and thereby furnish plenty of materials for witnesses and informers  lastly those may be well reckoned among false witnesses against their neighbour who bring him into trouble and punishment by such accusations as are of no consequence at all to the public nor can be of any other use but to create vexation such witnesses are those who cannot hear an idle intemperate expression but they must immediately run to the magistrate to inform or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night when they were not able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense will pretend to remember everything the next morning and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren god be thanked the throne of our king5 is too firmly settled to be shaken by the folly and rashness of every sottish companion and i do not in the least doubt that when those in power begin to observe the falsehood the prevarication the aggravating manner the treachery and seducing the malice and revenge the love of lucre and lastly the trifling accusations in too many wicked people they will be as ready to discourage every sort of those whom i have numbered among false witnesses as they will be to countenance honest men who out of a true zeal to their prince and country do in the innocence of their hearts freely discover whatever they may apprehend to be dangerous to either a good christian will think it sufficient to reprove his brother for a rash unguarded word where there is neither danger nor evil example to be apprehended or if he will not amend by reproof avoid his conversation  footnote 5 george i  ii and thus much may serve to shew the several ways whereby a man may be said to be a false witness against his neighbour i might have added one kind more and it is of those who inform against their neighbour out of fear of punishment to themselves which although it be more excusable and hath less of malice than any of the rest cannot however be justified i go on therefore upon the second head to give you some rules for your conduct and behaviour in order to defend yourselves against the malice and cunning of false accusers  it is readily agreed that innocence is the best protection in the world yet that it is not always sufficient without some degree of prudence our saviour himself intimateth to us by instructing his disciples to be wise as serpents as well as innocent as doves but if ever innocence be too weak a defence it is chiefly so in jealous and suspicious times when factions are arrived to an high pitch of animosity and the minds of men instead of being warmed by a true zeal for religion are inflamed only by party fury neither is virtue itself a sufficient security in such times because it is not allowed to be virtue otherwise than as it hath a mixture of party  however although virtue and innocence are no infallible defence against perjury malice and subornation yet they are great supports for enabling us to bear those evils with temper and resignation and it is an unspeakable comfort to a good man under the malignity of evil mercenary tongues that a few years will carry his appeal to an higher tribunal where false witnesses instead of daring to bring accusations before an allseeing judge will call for mountains to cover them as for earthly judges they seldom have it in their power and god knows whether they have it in their will to mingle mercy with justice they are so far from knowing the hearts of the accuser or the accused that they cannot know their own and their understanding is frequently biassed although their intentions be just they are often prejudiced to causes parties and persons through the infirmity of human nature without being sensible themselves that they are so and therefore although god may pardon their errors here he certainly will not ratify their sentences hereafter  however since as we have before observed our saviour prescribeth to us to be not only harmless as doves but wise as serpents give me leave to prescribe to you some rules which the most ignorant person may follow for the conduct of his life with safety in perilous times against false accusers  1st let me advise you to have nothing at all to do with that which is commonly called politics or the government of the world in the nature of which it is certain you are utterly ignorant and when your opinion is wrong although it proceeds from ignorance it shall be an accusation against you besides opinions in government are right or wrong just according to the humour and disposition of the times and unless you have judgment to distinguish you may be punished at one time for what you would be rewarded in another  2dly be ready at all times in your words and actions to shew your loyalty to the king that reigns over you this is the plain manifest doctrine of holy scripture submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme c6 and another apostle telleth us the powers that be are ordained of god kings are the ordinances of man by the permission of god and they are ordained of god by his instrument man the powers that be the present powers which are ordained by god and yet in some sense are the ordinances of man are what you must obey without presuming to examine into rights and titles neither can it be reasonably expected that the powers in being or in possession should suffer their title to be publicly disputed by subjects without severe punishment and to say the truth there is no duty in religion more easy to the generality of mankind than obedience to government i say to the generality of mankind because while their law and property and religion are preserved it is of no great consequence to them by whom they are governed and therefore they are under no temptation to desire a change  footnote 6 i peter ii 13  3dly in order to prevent any charge from the malice of false witnesses be sure to avoid intemperance if it be often so hard for men to govern their tongues when they are in their right senses how can they hope to do it when they are heated with drink in those cases most men regard not what they say and too many not what they swear neither will a mans memory disordered with drunkenness serve to defend himself or satisfy him whether he were guilty or no  4thly avoid as much as possible the conversation of those people who are given to talk of public persons and affairs especially of those whose opinions in such matters are different from yours i never once knew any disputes of this kind managed with tolerable temper but on both sides they only agree as much as possible to provoke the passions of each other indeed with this disadvantage that he who argueth on the side of power may speak securely the utmost his malice can invent while the other lieth every moment at the mercy of an informer and the law in these cases will give no allowance at all for passion inadvertency or the highest provocation  i come now in the last place to shew you how far it is your duty as good subjects and good neighbours to bear faithful witness when you are lawfully called to it by those in authority or by the sincere advice of your own consciences  in what i have hitherto said you easily find that i do not talk of bearing witness in general which is and may be lawful upon a thousand accounts in relation to property and other matters and wherein there are many scandalous corruptions almost peculiar to this country which would require to be handled by themselves but i have confined my discourse only to that branch of bearing false witness whereby the public is injured in the safety or honour of the prince or those in authority under him  in order therefore to be a faithful witness it is first necessary that a man doth not undertake it from the least prospect of any private advantage to himself the smallest mixture of that leaven will sour the whole lump interest will infallibly bias his judgment although he be ever so firmly resolved to say nothing but truth he cannot serve god and mammon but as interest is his chief end he will use the most effectual means to advance it he will aggravate circumstances to make his testimony valuable he will be sorry if the person he accuseth should be able to clear himself in short he is labouring a point which he thinks necessary to his own good and it would be a disappointment to him that his neighbour should prove innocent  5thly every good subject is obliged to bear witness against his neighbour for any action or words the telling of which would be of advantage to the public and the concealment dangerous or of ill example of this nature are all plots and conspiracies against the peace of a nation all disgraceful words against a prince such as clearly discover a disloyal and rebellious heart but where our prince and country can possibly receive no damage or disgrace where no scandal or ill example is given and our neighbour it may be provoked by us happeneth privately to drop a rash or indiscreet word which in strictness of law might bring him under trouble perhaps to his utter undoing there we are obliged we ought to proceed no further than warning and reproof  in describing to you the several kinds of false witnesses i have made it less necessary to dwell much longer upon this head because a faithful witness like everything else is known by his contrary therefore it would be only a repetition of what i have already said to tell you that the strictest truth is required in a witness that he should be wholly free from malice against the person he accuses that he should not aggravate the smallest circumstance against the criminal nor conceal the smallest in his favour and to crown all though i have hinted it before that the only cause or motive of his undertaking an office so subject to censure and so difficult to perform should be the safety and service of his prince and country  under these conditions and limitations but not otherwise there is no manner of doubt but a good man may lawfully and justly become a witness in behalf of the public and may perform that office in its own nature not very desirable with honour and integrity for the command in the text is positive as well as negative that is to say as we are directed not to bear false witness against our neighbour so we are to bear true next to the word of god and the advice of teachers every mans conscience strictly examined will be his best director in this weighty point and to that i shall leave him  it might perhaps be thought proper to have added something by way of advice to those who are unhappily engaged in this abominable trade and sin of bearing false witness but i am far from believing or supposing any of that destructive tribe are now my hearers i look upon them as a sort of people that seldom frequent these holy places where they can hardly pick up any materials to serve their turn unless they think it worth their while to misrepresent or pervert the words of the preacher and whoever is that way disposed i doubt cannot be in a very good condition to edify and reform himself by what he heareth god in his mercy preserve us from all the guilt of this grievous sin forbidden in my text and from the snares of those who are guilty of it  i shall conclude with one or two precepts given by moses from god to the children of israel in the xxiiid of exod 1 2  thou shalt not raise a false report put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness  thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil neither shalt them speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment  now to god the father c     on the wisdom of this world1  footnote 1 the title of this sermon as given in contents of swifts works vol viii pt i 4to 1765 is a sermon upon the excellence of christianity in opposition to heathen philosophy ts   i cor iii 19  the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god   it is remarkable that about the time of our saviours coming into the world all kinds of learning flourished to a very great degree insomuch that nothing is more frequent in the mouths of many men even such who pretend to read and to know than an extravagant praise and opinion of the wisdom and virtue of the gentile sages of those days and likewise of those ancient philosophers who went before them whose doctrines are left upon record either by themselves or other writers as far as this may be taken for granted it may be said that the providence of god brought this about for several very wise ends and purposes for it is certain that these philosophers had been a long time before searching out where to fix the true happiness of man and not being able to agree upon any certainty about it they could not possibly but conclude if they judged impartially that all their enquiries were in the end but vain and fruitless the consequence of which must be not only an acknowledgment of the weakness of all human wisdom but likewise an open passage hereby made for the letting in those beams of light which the glorious sunshine of the gospel then brought into the world by revealing those hidden truths which they had so long before been labouring to discover and fixing the general happiness of mankind beyond all controversy and dispute and therefore the providence of god wisely suffered men of deep genius and learning then to arise who should search into the truth of the gospel now made known and canvass its doctrines with all the subtilty and knowledge they were masters of and in the end freely acknowledge that to be the true wisdom only which cometh from above james iii 15 16 17  however to make a further enquiry into the truth of this observation i doubt not but there is reason to think that a great many of those encomiums given to ancient philosophers are taken upon trust and by a sort of men who are not very likely to be at the pains of an enquiry that would employ so much time and thinking for the usual ends why men affect this kind of discourse appear generally to be either out of ostentation that they may pass upon the world for persons of great knowledge and observation or what is worse there are some who highly exalt the wisdom of those gentile sages thereby obliquely to glance at and traduce divine revelation and more especially that of the gospel for the consequence they would have us draw is this that since those ancient philosophers rose to a greater pitch of wisdom and virtue than was ever known among christians and all this purely upon the strength of their own reason and liberty of thinking therefore it must follow that either all revelation is false or what is worse that it has depraved the nature of man and left him worse than it found him  but this high opinion of heathen wisdom is not very ancient in the world nor at all countenanced from primitive times our saviour had but a low esteem of it as appears by his treatment of the pharisees and sadducees who followed the doctrines of plato and epicurus st paul likewise who was well versed in all the grecian literature seems very much to despise their philosophy as we find in his writings cautioning the colossians to beware lest any man spoil them through philosophy and vain deceit and in another place he advises timothy to avoid profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called that is not to introduce into the christian doctrine the janglings of those vain philosophers which they would pass upon the world for science and the reasons he gives are first that those who professed them did err concerning the faith  secondly because the knowledge of them did encrease ungodliness vain babblings being otherways expounded vanities or empty sounds that is tedious disputes about words which the philosophers were always so full of and which were the natural product of disputes and dissensions between several sects  neither had the primitive fathers any great or good opinion of the heathen philosophy as it is manifest from several passages in their writings so that this vein of affecting to raise the reputation of those sages so high is a mode and a vice but of yesterday assumed chiefly as i have said to disparage revealed knowledge and the consequences of it among us  now because this is a prejudice which may prevail with some persons so far as to lessen the influence of the gospel and whereas therefore this is an opinion which men of education are like to be encountered with when they have produced themselves into the world i shall endeavour to shew that their preference of heathen wisdom and virtue before that of the christian is every way unjust and grounded upon ignorance or mistake in order to which i shall consider four things  first i shall produce certain points wherein the wisdom and virtue of all unrevealed philosophy in general fell short and was very imperfect  secondly i shall shew in several instances where some of the most renowned philosophers have been grossly defective in their lessons of morality  thirdly i shall prove the perfection of christian wisdom from the proper characters and marks of it  lastly i shall shew that the great examples of wisdom and virtue among the heathen wise men were produced by personal merit and not influenced by the doctrine of any sect whereas in christianity it is quite the contrary  first i shall produce certain points wherein the wisdom and virtue of all unrevealed philosophy in general fell short and was very imperfect  my design is to persuade men that christian philosophy is in all things preferable to heathen wisdom from which or its professors i shall however have no occasion to detract they were as wise and as good as it was possible for them under such disadvantages and would have probably been infinitely more with such aids as we enjoy but our lessons are certainly much better however our practices may fail short  the first point i shall mention is that universal defect which was in all their schemes that they could not agree about their chief good or wherein to place the happiness of mankind nor had any of them a tolerable answer upon this difficulty to satisfy a reasonable person for to say as the most plausible of them did that happiness consisted in virtue was but vain babbling and a mere sound of words to amuse others and themselves because they were not agreed what this virtue was or wherein it did consist and likewise because several among the best of them taught quite different things placing happiness in health or good fortune in riches or in honour where all were agreed that virtue was not as i shall have occasion to shew when i speak of their particular tenets  the second great defect in the gentile philosophy was that it wanted some suitable reward proportioned to the better part of man his mind as an encouragement for his progress in virtue the difficulties they met with upon the score of this default were great and not to be accounted for bodily goods being only suitable to bodily wants are no rest at all for the mind and if they were yet are they not the proper fruits of wisdom and virtue being equally attainable by the ignorant and wicked now human nature is so constituted that we can never pursue anything heartily but upon hopes of a reward if we run a race it is in expectation of a prize and the greater the prize the faster we run for an incorruptible crown if we understand it and believe it to be such more than a corruptible one but some of the philosophers gave all this quite another turn and pretended to refine so far as to call virtue its own reward and worthy to be followed only for itself whereas if there be anything in this more than the sound of the words it is at least too abstracted to become a universal influencing principle in the world and therefore could not be of general use  it was the want of assigning some happiness proportioned to the soul of man that caused many of them either on the one hand to be sour and morose supercilious and untreatable or on the other to fall into the vulgar pursuits of common men to hunt after greatness and riches to make their court and to serve occasions as plato did to the younger dionysius and aristotle to alexander the great so impossible is it for a man who looks no further than the present world to fix himself long in a contemplation where the present world has no part he has no sure hold no firm footing he can never expect to remove the earth he rests upon while he has no support beside for his feet but wants like archimedes some other place whereon to stand to talk of bearing pain and grief without any sort of present or future hope cannot be purely greatness of spirit there must be a mixture in it of affectation and an alloy of pride or perhaps is wholly counterfeit  it is true there has been all along in the world a notion of rewards and punishments in another life but it seems to have rather served as an entertainment to poets or as a terror of children than a settled principle by which men pretended to govern any of their actions the last celebrated words of socrates a little before his death do not seem to reckon or build much upon any such opinion and cæsar made no scruple to disown it and ridicule it in open senate  thirdly the greatest and wisest of all their philosophers were never able to give any satisfaction to others and themselves in their notions of a deity they were often extremely gross and absurd in their conceptions and those who made the fairest conjectures are such as were generally allowed by the learned to have seen the system of moses if i may so call it who was in great reputation at that time in the heathen world as we find by diodonis justin longinus and other authors for the rest the wisest among them laid aside all notions after a deity as a disquisition vain and fruitless which indeed it was upon unrevealed principles and those who ventured to engage too far fell into incoherence and confusion  fourthly those among them who had the justest conceptions of a divine power and did also admit a providence had no notion at all of entirely relying and depending upon either they trusted in themselves for all things but as for a trust or dependence upon god they would not have understood the phrase it made no part of the profane style  therefore it was that in all issues and events which they could not reconcile to their own sentiments of reason and justice they were quite disconcerted they had no retreat but upon every blow of adverse fortune either affected to be indifferent or grew sullen and severe or else yielded and sunk like other men  having now produced certain points wherein the wisdom and virtue of all unrevealed philosophy fell short and was very imperfect i go on in the second place to shew in several instances where some of the most renowned philosophers have been grossly defective in their lessons of morality  thales the founder of the ionic sect so celebrated for morality being asked how a man might bear illfortune with greatest ease answered by seeing his enemies in a worse condition an answer truly barbarous unworthy of human nature and which included such consequences as must destroy all society from the world  solon lamenting the death of a son one told him you lament in vain therefore said he i lament because it is in vain this was a plain confession how imperfect all his philosophy was and that something was still wanting he owned that all his wisdom and morals were useless and this upon one of the most frequent accidents in life how much better could he have learned to support himself even from david by his entire dependence upon god and that before our saviour had advanced the notions of religion to the height and perfection wherewith he hath instructed his disciples plato himself with all his refinements placed happiness in wisdom health good fortune honour and riches and held that they who enjoyed all these were perfectly happy which opinion was indeed unworthy its owner leaving the wise and the good man wholly at the mercy of uncertain chance and to be miserable without resource  his scholar aristotle fell more grossly into the same notion and plainly affirmed that virtue without the goods of fortune was not sufficient for happiness but that a wise man must be miserable in poverty and sickness nay diogenes himself from whose pride and singularity one would have looked for other notions delivered it as his opinion that a poor old man was the most miserable thing in life  zeno also and his followers fell into many absurdities among which nothing could be greater than that of maintaining all crimes to be equal which instead of making vice hateful rendered it as a thing indifferent and familiar to all men  lastly epicurus had no notion of justice but as it was profitable and his placing happiness in pleasure with all the advantages he could expound it by was liable to very great exception for although he taught that pleasure did consist in virtue yet he did not any way fix or ascertain the boundaries of virtue as he ought to have done by which means he misled his followers into the greatest vices making their names to become odious and scandalous even in the heathen world  i have produced these few instances from a great many others to shew the imperfection of heathen philosophy wherein i have confined myself wholly to their morality and surely we may pronounce upon it in the words of st james that this wisdom descended not from above but was earthly and sensual what if i had produced their absurd notions about god and the soul it would then have completed the character given it by that apostle and appeared to have been devilish too but it is easy to observe from the nature of these few particulars that their defects in morals were purely the flagging and fainting of the mind for want of a support by revelation from god  i proceed therefore in the third place to shew the perfection of christian wisdom from above and i shall endeavour to make it appear from those proper characters and marks of it by the apostle before mentioned in the third chapter and 15th 16th and 17th verses  the words run thus  this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish  for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work  but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy  the wisdom from above is first pure this purity of the mind and spirit is peculiar to the gospel our saviour says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god a mind free from all pollution of lusts shall have a daily vision of god whereof unrevealed religion can form no notion this it is which keeps us unspotted from the world and hereby many have been prevailed upon to live in the practice of all purity holiness and righteousness far beyond the examples of the most celebrated philosophers  it is peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated the christian doctrine teacheth us all those dispositions that make us affable and courteous gentle and kind without any morose leaven of pride or vanity which entered into the composition of most heathen schemes so we are taught to be meek and lowly our saviours last legacy was peace and he commands us to forgive our offending brother unto seventy times seven christian wisdom is full of mercy and good works teaching the height of all moral virtues of which the heathens fall infinitely short plato indeed and it is worth observing has somewhere a dialogue or part of one about forgiving our enemies which was perhaps the highest strain ever reached by man without divine assistance yet how little is that to what our saviour commands us to love them that hate us to bless them that curse us and do good to them that despitefully use us  christian wisdom is without partiality it is not calculated for this or that nation of people but the whole race of mankind not so the philosophical schemes which were narrow and confined adapted to their peculiar towns governments or sects but in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted with him  lastly it is without hypocrisy it appears to be what it really is it is all of a piece by the doctrines of the gospel we are so far from being allowed to publish to the world those virtues we have not that we are commanded to hide even from ourselves those we really have and not to let our right hand know what our left hand does unlike several branches of the heathen wisdom which pretended to teach insensibility and indifference magnanimity and contempt of life while at the same time in other parts it belied its own doctrines  i come now in the last place to shew that the great examples of wisdom and virtue among the grecian sages were produced by personal merit and not influenced by the doctrine of any particular sect whereas in christianity it is quite the contrary  the two virtues most celebrated by ancient moralists were fortitude and temperance as relating to the government of man in his private capacity to which their schemes were generally addressed and confined and the two instances wherein those virtues arrived at the greatest height were socrates and cato but neither those nor any other virtues possessed by these two were at all owing to any lessons or doctrines of a sect for socrates himself was of none at all and although cato was called a stoic it was more from a resemblance of manners in his worst qualities than that he avowed himself one of their disciples the same may be affirmed of many other great men of antiquity from whence i infer that those who were renowned for virtue among them were more obliged to the good natural dispositions of their own minds than to the doctrines of any sect they pretended to follow  on the other side as the examples of fortitude and patience among the primitive christians have been infinitely greater and more numerous so they were altogether the product of their principles and doctrine and were such as the same persons without those aids would never have arrived to of this truth most of the apostles with many thousand martyrs are a cloud of witnesses beyond exception having therefore spoken so largely upon the former heads i shall dwell no longer upon this  and if it should here be objected why does not christianity still produce the same effects it is easy to answer first that although the number of pretended christians be great yet that of true believers in proportion to the other was never so small and it is a true lively faith alone that by the assistance of gods grace can influence our practice  secondly we may answer that christianity itself has very much suffered by being blended up with gentile philosophy the platonic system first taken into religion was thought to have given matter for some early heresies in the church when disputes began to arise the peripatetic forms were introduced by scotus as best fitted for controversy and however this may now have become necessary it was surely the author of a litigious vein which has since occasioned very pernicious consequences stopped the progress of christianity and been a great promoter of vice verifying that sentence given by st james and mentioned before where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work this was the fatal stop to the grecians in their progress both of arts and arms their wise men were divided under several sects and their governments under several commonwealths all in opposition to each other which engaged them in eternal quarrels among themselves while they should have been armed against the common enemy and i wish we had no other examples from the like causes less foreign or ancient than that diogenes said socrates was a madman the disciples of zeno and epicurus nay of plato and aristotle were engaged in fierce disputes about the most insignificant trifles and if this be the present language and practice among us christians no wonder that christianity does not still produce the same effects which it did at first when it was received and embraced in its utmost purity and perfection for such a wisdom as this cannot descend from above but must be earthly sensual devilish full of confusion and every evil work whereas the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy this is the true heavenly wisdom which christianity only can boast of and which the greatest of the heathen wise men could never arrive at  now to god the father c c     doing good   a sermon on the occasion of woods project1  footnote 1 i did very lately as i thought it my duty preach to the people under my inspection upon the subject of mr woods coin and although i never heard that my sermon gave the least offence as i am sure none was intended yet if it were now printed and published i cannot say i would insure it from the hands of the common hangman or my own person from those of a messenger see the drapiers letters no vi  i never said the dean in a jocular conversation preached but twice in my life and then they were not sermons but pamphlets being asked on what subject he replied they were against woods halfpencepilkingtons memoirs vol i p 56  the pieces relating to ireland are those of a public nature in which the dean appears as usual in the best light because they do honour to his heart as well as to his head furnishing some additional proofs that though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country as well natives as foreigners he had their interest sincerely at heart and perfectly understood it his sermon upon doing good though peculiarly adapted to ireland and woods designs upon it contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compassburke  written in the year mdccxxiv   galatians vi 10  as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men   nature directs every one of us and god permits us to consult our own private good before the private good of any other person whatsoever we are indeed commanded to love our neighbour as ourselves but not as well as ourselves the love we have for ourselves is to be the pattern of that love we ought to have towards our neighbour but as the copy doth not equal the original so my neighbour cannot think it hard if i prefer myself who am the original before him who is only the copy thus if any matter equally concern the life the reputation the profit of my neighbour and my own the law of nature which is the law of god obligeth me to take care of myself first and afterwards of him and this i need not be at much pains in persuading you to for the want of selflove with regard to things of this world is not among the faults of mankind but then on the other side if by a small hurt and loss to myself i can procure a great good to my neighbour in that case his interest is to be preferred for example if i can be sure of saving his life without great danger to my own if i can preserve him from being undone without ruining myself or recover his reputation without blasting mine all this i am obliged to do and if i sincerely perform it i do then obey the command of god in loving my neighbour as myself  but beside this love we owe to every man in his particular capacity under the title of our neighbour there is yet a duty of a more large extensive nature incumbent on us which is our love to our neighbour in his public capacity as he is a member of that great body the commonwealth under the same government with ourselves and this is usually called love of the public and is a duty to which we are more strictly obliged than even that of loving ourselves because therein ourselves are also contained as well as all our neighbours in one great body this love of the public or of the commonwealth or love of our country was in ancient times properly known by the name of virtue because it was the greatest of all virtues and was supposed to contain all virtues in it and many great examples of this virtue are left us on record scarcely to be believed or even conceived in such a base corrupted wicked age as this we live in in those times it was common for men to sacrifice their lives for the good of their country although they had neither hope or belief of future rewards whereas in our days very few make the least scruple of sacrificing a whole nation as well as their own souls for a little present gain which often hath been known to end in their own ruin in this world as it certainly must in that to come  have we not seen men for the sake of some petty employment  give up the very natural rights and liberties of their country and of mankind in the ruin of which themselves must at last be involved are not these corruptions gotten among the meanest of our people who for a piece of money will give their votes at a venture for the disposal of their own lives and fortunes without considering whether it be to those who are most likely to betray or defend them but if i were to produce only one instance of a hundred wherein we fail in this duty of loving our country it would be an endless labour and therefore i shall not attempt it  but here i would not be misunderstood by the love of our country i do not mean loyalty to our king for that is a duty of another nature and a man may be very loyal in the common sense of the word without one grain of public good at his heart witness this very kingdom we live in i verily believe that since the beginning of the world no nation upon earth ever shewed all circumstances considered such high constant marks of loyalty in all their actions and behaviour as we have done and at the same time no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called a public spirit when i say the people i mean the bulk or mass of the people for i have nothing to do with those in power  therefore i shall think my time not ill spent if i can persuade most or all of you who hear me to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several stations to do all the public good you are able for i am certainly persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare  i therefore undertake to shew you three things  first that there are few people so weak or mean who have it not sometimes in their power to be useful to the public  secondly that it is often in the power of the meanest among mankind to do mischief to the public  and lastly that all wilful injuries done to the public are very great and aggravated sins in the sight of god  first there are few people so weak or mean who have it not sometimes in their power to be useful to the public solomon tells us of a poor wise man who saved a city by his counsel it hath often happened that a private soldier by some unexpected brave attempt hath been instrumental in obtaining a great victory how many obscure men have been authors of very useful inventions whereof the world now reaps the benefit the very example of honesty and industry in a poor tradesman will sometimes spread through a neighbourhood when others see how successful he is and thus so many useful members are gained for which the whole body of the public is the better whoever is blessed with a true public spirit god will certainly put it into his way to make use of that blessing for the ends it was given him by some means or other and therefore it hath been observed in most ages that the greatest actions for the benefit of the commonwealth have been performed by the wisdom or courage the contrivance or industry of particular men and not of numbers and that the safety of a kingdom hath often been owing to those hands from whence it was least expected  but secondly it is often in the power of the meanest among mankind to do mischief to the public and hence arise most of those miseries with which the states and kingdoms of the earth are infested how many great princes have been murdered by the meanest ruffians the weakest hand can open a floodgate to drown a country which a thousand of the strongest cannot stop those who have thrown off all regard for public good will often have it in their way to do public evil and will not fail to exercise that power whenever they can the greatest blow given of late to this kingdom was by the dishonesty of a few manufacturers who by imposing bad ware at foreign markets in almost the only traffic permitted to us did half ruin that trade by which this poor unhappy kingdom now suffers in the midst of sufferings i speak not here of persons in high stations who ought to be free from all reflection and are supposed always to intend the welfare of the community but we now find by experience that the meanest instrument may by the concurrence of accidents have it in his power to bring a whole kingdom to the very brink of destruction and is at this present endeavouring to finish his work and hath agents among ourselves who are contented to see their own country undone to be small sharers in that iniquitous gain which at last must end in their own ruin as well as ours i confess it was chiefly the consideration of that great danger we are in which engaged me to discourse to you on this subject to exhort you to a love of your country and a public spirit when all you have is at stake to prefer the interest of your prince and your fellowsubjects before that of one destructive impostor and a few of his adherents  perhaps it may be thought by some that this way of discoursing is not so proper from the pulpit but surely when an open attempt is made and far carried on to make a great kingdom one large poorhouse to deprive us of all means to exercise hospitality or charity to turn our cities and churches into ruins to make the country a desert for wild beasts and robbers to destroy all arts and sciences all trades and manufactures and the very tillage of the ground only to enrich one obscure illdesigning projector and his followers it is time for the pastor to cry out that the wolf is getting into his flock to warn them to stand together and all to consult the common safety and god be praised for his infinite goodness in raising such a spirit of union among us at least in this point in the midst of all our former divisions which union if it continue will in all probability defeat the pernicious design of this pestilent enemy to the nation  but from hence it clearly follows how necessary the love of our country or a public spirit is in every particular man since the wicked have so many opportunities of doing public mischief every man is upon his guard for his private advantage but where the public is concerned he is apt to be negligent considering himself only as one among two or three millions among whom the loss is equally shared and thus he thinks he can be no great sufferer meanwhile the trader the farmer and the shopkeeper complain of the hardness and deadness of the times and wonder whence it comes while it is in a great measure owing to their own folly for want of that love of their country and public spirit and firm union among themselves which are so necessary to the prosperity of every nation  another method by which the meanest wicked man may have it in his power to injure the public is false accusation whereof this kingdom hath afforded too many examples neither is it long since no man whose opinions were thought to differ from those in fashion could safely converse beyond his nearest friends for fear of being sworn against as a traitor by those who made a traffic of perjury and subornation by which the very peace of the nation was disturbed and men fled from each other as they would from a lion or a bear got loose and it is very remarkable that the pernicious project now in hand to reduce us to beggary was forwarded by one of these false accusers who had been convicted of endeavouring by perjury and subornation to take away the lives of several innocent persons here among us and indeed there could not be a more proper instrument for such a work  another method by which the meanest people may do injury to the public is the spreading of lies and false rumours thus raising a distrust among the people of a nation causing them to mistake their true interest and their enemies for their friends and this hath been likewise too successful a practice among us where we have known the whole kingdom misled by the grossest lies raised upon occasion to serve some particular turn as it hath also happened in the case i lately mentioned where one obscure man by representing our wants where they were least and concealing them where they were greatest had almost succeeded in a project of utterly ruining this whole kingdom and may still succeed if god doth not continue that public spirit which he hath almost miraculously kindled in us upon this occasion  thus we see the public is many times as it were at the mercy of the meanest instrument who can be wicked enough to watch opportunities of doing it mischief upon the principles of avarice or malice which i am afraid are deeply rooted in too many breasts and against which there can be no defence but a firm resolution in all honest men to be closely united and active in shewing their love to their country by preferring the public interest to their present private advantage if a passenger in a great storm at sea should hide his goods that they might not be thrown overboard to lighten the ship what would be the consequence the ship is cast away and he loses his life and goods together  we have heard of men who through greediness of gain have brought infected goods into a nation which bred a plague whereof the owners and their families perished first let those among us consider this and tremble whose houses are privately stored with those materials of beggary and desolation lately brought over to be scattered like a pestilence among their countrymen which may probably first seize upon themselves and their families until their houses shall be made a dunghill  i shall mention one practice more by which the meanest instruments often succeed in doing public mischief and this is by deceiving us with plausible arguments to make us believe that the most ruinous project they can offer is intended for our good as it happened in the case so often mentioned for the poor ignorant people allured by the appearing convenience in their small dealings did not discover the serpent in the brass2 but were ready like the israelites to offer incense to it neither could the wisdom of the nation convince them until some of good intentions made the cheat so plain to their sight that those who run may read and thus the design was to treat us in every point as the philistines treated samson i mean when he was betrayed by delilah first to put out our eyes and then bind us with fetters of brass  footnote 2 brass may be read woods halfpence ts  i proceed to the last thing i proposed which was to shew you that all wilful injuries done to the public are very great and aggravated sins in the sight of god  first it is apparent from scripture and most agreeable to reason that the safety and welfare of nations are under the most peculiar care of gods providence thus he promised abraham to save sodom if only ten righteous men could be found in it thus the reason which god gave to jonas for not destroying nineveh was because there were six score thousand men in that city  all government is from god who is the god of order and therefore whoever attempts to breed confusion or disturbance among a people doth his utmost to take the government of the world out of gods hands and to put it into the hands of the devil who is the author of confusion by which it is plain that no crime how heinous soever committed against particular persons can equal the guilt of him who does injury to the public  secondly all offenders against their country lie under this grievous difficulty that it is next to impossible to obtain a pardon or make restitution the bulk of mankind are very quick at resenting injuries and very slow in forgiving them and how shall one man be able to obtain the pardon of millions or repair the injuries he hath done to millions how shall those who by a most destructive fraud got the whole wealth of our neighbouring kingdom into their hands be ever able to make a recompence how will the authors and promoters of that villainous project for the ruin of this poor country be able to account with us for the injuries they have already done although they should no farther succeed the deplorable case of such wretches must entirely be left to the unfathomable mercies of god for those who know the least in religion are not ignorant that without our utmost endeavours to make restitution to the person injured and to obtain his pardon added to a sincere repentance there is no hope of salvation given in the gospel  lastly all offences against our own country have this aggravation that they are ungrateful and unnatural it is to our country we owe those laws which protect us in our lives our liberties our properties and our religion our country produced us into the world and continues to nourish us so that it is usually called our mother and there have been examples of great magistrates who have put their own children to death for endeavouring to betray their country as if they had attempted the life of their natural parent  thus i have briefly shewn you how terrible a sin it is to be an enemy to our country in order to incite you to the contrary virtue which at this juncture is so highly necessary when every mans endeavour will be of use we have hitherto been just able to support ourselves under many hardships but now the axe is laid to the root of the tree and nothing but a firm union among us can prevent our utter undoing this we are obliged to in duty to our gracious king as well as to ourselves let us therefore preserve that public spirit which god hath raised in us for our own temporal interest for if this wicked project should succeed which it cannot do but by our own folly if we sell ourselves for nought the merchant the shopkeeper the artificer must fly to the desert with their miserable families there to starve or live upon rapine or at least exchange their country for one more hospitable than that where they were born  thus much i thought it my duty to say to you who are under my care to warn you against those temporal evils which may draw the worst of spiritual evils after them such as heartburnings murmurings discontents and all manner of wickedness which a desperate condition of life may tempt men to  i am sensible that what i have now said will not go very far being confined to this assembly but i hope it may stir up others of my brethren to exhort their several congregations after a more effectual manner to shew their love for their country on this important occasion and this i am sure cannot be called meddling in affairs of state  i pray god protect his most gracious majesty and this kingdom long under his government and defend us from all ruinous projectors deceivers suborners perjurers false accusers and oppressors from the virulence of party and faction and unite us in loyalty to our king love to our country and charity to each other  and this we beg for jesus christ his sake to whom c     on the martyrdom of king charles i  preached at st patricks dublin jan 30 172526 being sunday   genesis xlix 5 6 7  simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations  o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall  cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel   i know very well that the church hath been often censured for keeping holy this day of humiliation in memory of that excellent king and blessed martyr charles i who rather chose to die on a scaffold than betray the religion and liberties of his people wherewith god and the laws had entrusted him but at the same time it is manifest that those who make such censures are either people without any religion at all or who derive their principles and perhaps their birth from the abettors of those who contrived the murder of that prince and have not yet shewn the world that their opinions are changed it is alleged that the observation of this day hath served to continue and increase the animosity and enmity among our countrymen and to disunite protestants that a law was made upon the restoration of the martyrs son for a general pardon and oblivion forbidding all reproaches upon that occasion and since none are now alive who were actors or instruments in that tragedy it is thought hard and uncharitable to keep up the memory of it for all generations  now because i conceive most of you to be ignorant in many particulars concerning that horrid murder and the rebellion which preceded it i will  first relate to you so much of the story as may be sufficient for your information  secondly i will tell you the consequences which this bloody deed had upon these kingdoms  and lastly i will shew you to what good uses this solemn day of humiliation may be applied  as to the first in the reign of this prince charles the martyr the power and prerogative of the king were much greater than they are in our times and so had been for at least seven hundred years before and the best princes we ever had carried their power much farther than the blessed martyr offered to do in the most blameable part of his reign but the lands of the crown having been prodigally bestowed to favourites in the preceding reigns the succeeding kings could not support themselves without taxes raised by parliament which put them under a necessity of frequently calling those assemblies and the crown lands being gotten into the hands of the nobility and gentry beside the possessions of which the church had been robbed by king henry the eighth power which always follows property grew to lean to the side of the people by whom even the just rights of the crown were often disputed  but further upon the cruel persecution raised against the protestants under queen mary among great numbers who fled the kingdom to seek for shelter several went and resided at geneva which is a commonwealth governed without a king and where the religion contrived by calvin is without the order of bishops when the protestant faith was restored by queen elizabeth those who fled to geneva returned among the rest home to england and were grown so fond of the government and religion of the place they had left that they used all possible endeavours to introduce both into their own country at the same time continually preaching and railing against ceremonies and distinct habits of the clergy taxing whatever they disliked as a remnant of popery and continued extremely troublesome to the church and state under that great queen as well as her successor king james i these people called themselves puritans as pretending to a purer faith than those of the church established and these were the founders of our dissenters they did not think it sufficient to leave all the errors of popery but threw off many laudable and edifying institutions of the primitive church and at last even the government of bishops which having been ordained by the apostles themselves had continued without interruption in all christian churches for above fifteen hundred years and all this they did not because those things were evil but because they were kept by the papists from thence they proceeded by degrees to quarrel with the kingly government because as i have already said the city of geneva to which their fathers had flown for refuge was a commonwealth or government of the people  these puritans about the middle of the martyrs reign were grown to a considerable faction in the kingdom and in the lower house of parliament they filled the public with the most false and bitter libels against the bishops and the clergy accusing chiefly the very best among them of popery and at the same time the house of commons grew so insolent and uneasy to the king that they refused to furnish him with necessary supplies for the support of his family unless upon such conditions as he could not submit to without forfeiting his conscience and honour and even his coronation oath and in such an extremity he was forced upon a practice no way justifiable of raising money for which however he had the opinion of the judges on his side for wicked judges there were in those times as well as in ours there were likewise many complaints and sometimes justly made against the proceedings of a certain court called the starchamber a judicature of great antiquity but had suffered some corruptions for which however the king was nowise answerable i cannot recollect any more subjects of complaint with the least ground of reason nor is it needful to recollect them because this gracious king did upon the first application redress all grievances by an act of parliament and put it out of his power to do any hardships for the future but that wicked faction in the house of commons not content with all those marks of his justice and condescension urged still for more and joining with a factious party from scotland who had the same fancies in religion forced him to pass an act for cutting off the head of his best and chief minister and at the same time compelled him by tumults and threatenings of a packed rabble poisoned with the same doctrines to pass another law by which it should not be in his power to dissolve that parliament without their own consent thus by the greatest weakness and infatuation that ever possessed any mans spirit this prince did in effect sign his own destruction for the house of commons having the reins in their own hands drove on furiously sent him every day some unreasonable demand and when he refused to grant it made use of their own power and declared that an ordinance of both houses without the kings consent should be obeyed as a law contrary to all reason and equity as well as to the fundamental constitution of the kingdom  about this time the rebellion in ireland broke out wherein his parliament refused to assist him nor would accept his offer to come hither in person to subdue those rebels these and a thousand other barbarities forced the king to summon his loyal subjects to his standard in his own defence meanwhile the english parliament instead of helping the poor protestants here seized on the very army that his majesty was sending over for our relief and turned them against their own sovereign the rebellion in england continued for four or five years at last the king was forced to fly in disguise to the scots who sold him to the rebels and these puritans had the impudent cruelty to try his sacred person in a mock court of justice and cut off his head which he might have saved if he would have yielded to betray the constitution in church and state  in this whole proceeding simeon and levi were brethren the wicked insinuations of those fanatical preachers stirring up the cruelty of the soldiers who by force of arms excluded from the house every member of parliament whom they apprehended to bear the least inclination towards an agreement with the king suffering only those to enter who thirsted chiefly for his blood and this is the very account given by their own writers from whence it is clear that this prince was in all respects a real martyr for the true religion and the liberty of the people that odious parliament had first turned the bishops out of the house of lords in a few years after they murdered their king then immediately abolished the whole house of lords and so at last obtained their wishes of having a government of the people and a new religion both after the manner of geneva without a king a bishop or a nobleman and this they blasphemously called the kingdom of christ and his saints  this is enough for your information on the first head i shall therefore proceed to the second wherein i will shew you the miserable consequences which that abominable rebellion and murder produced in these nations  first the irish rebellion was wholly owing to that wicked english parliament for the leaders in the irish popish massacre would never have dared to stir a finger if they had not been encouraged by that rebellious spirit in the english house of commons which they very well knew must disable the king from sending any supplies to his protestant subjects here and therefore we may truly say that the english parliament held the kings hands while the irish papists here were cutting our grandfathers throats  secondly that murderous puritan parliament when they had all in their own power could not agree upon any one method of settling a form either of religion or civil government but changed every day from schism to schism from heresy to heresy and from one faction to another from whence arose that wild confusion still continuing in our several ways of serving god and those absurd notions of civil power which have so often torn us with factions more than any other nation in europe  thirdly to this rebellion and murder have been owing the rise and progress of atheism among us for men observing what numberless villainies of all kinds were committed during twenty years under pretence of zeal and the reformation of gods church were easily tempted to doubt that all religion was a mere imposture and the same spirit of infidelity so far spread among us at this present is nothing but the fruit of the seeds sown by those rebellious hypocritical saints  fourthly the old virtue and loyalty and generous spirit of the english nation were wholly corrupted by the power the doctrine and the example of those wicked people many of the ancient nobility were killed and their families extinct in defence of their prince and country or murdered by the merciless courts of justice some of the worst among them favoured or complied with the reigning iniquities and not a few of the new set created when the martyrs son was restored were such who had drunk too deep of the bad principles then prevailing  fifthly the children of the murdered prince were forced to fly for the safety of their lives to foreign countries where one of them at least i mean king james ii was seduced to popery which ended in the loss of his kingdoms the misery and desolation of this country and a long and expensive war abroad our deliverance was owing to the valour and conduct of the late king and therefore we ought to remember him with gratitude but not mingled with blasphemy or idolatry it was happy that his interests and ours were the same and god gave him greater success than our sins deserved but as a house thrown down by a storm is seldom rebuilt without some change in the foundation so it hath happened that since the late revolution men have sat much looser in the true fundamentals both of religion and government and factions have been more violent treacherous and malicious than ever men running naturally from one extreme into another and for private ends taking up those very opinions professed by the leaders in that rebellion which carried the blessed martyr to the scaffold  sixthly another consequence of this horrid rebellion and murder was the destroying or defacing of such vast number of gods houses in their selfwill they digged down a wall if a stranger should now travel in england and observe the churches in his way he could not otherwise conclude than that some vast army of turks or heathens had been sent on purpose to ruin and blot out all marks of christianity they spared neither the statues of saints nor ancient prelates nor kings nor benefactors broke down the tombs and monuments of men famous in their generations seized the vessels of silver set apart for the holiest use tore down the most innocent ornaments both within and without made the houses of prayer dens of thieves or stables for cattle these were the mildest effects of puritan zeal and devotion for christ and this was what themselves affected to call a thorough reformation in this kingdom those ravages were not so easily seen for the people here being too poor to raise such noble temples the mean ones we had were not defaced but totally destroyed  upon the whole it is certain that although god might have found out many other ways to have punished a sinful people without permitting this rebellion and murder yet as the course of the world hath run ever since we need seek for no other causes of all the public evils we have hitherto suffered or may suffer for the future by the misconduct of princes or wickedness of the people  i go on now upon the third head to shew you to what good uses this solemn day of humiliation may be applied  first it may be an instruction to princes themselves to be careful in the choice of those who are their advisers in matters of law all the judges of england except one or two advised the king that he might legally raise money upon the subjects for building of ships without consent of parliament which as it was the greatest oversight of his reign so it proved the principal foundation of all his misfortunes princes may likewise learn from hence not to sacrifice a faithful servant to the rage of a faction nor to trust any body of men with a greater share of power than the laws of the land have appointed them much less to deposit it in their hands until they shall please to restore it  secondly by bringing to mind the tragedy of this day and the consequences that have arisen from it we shall be convinced how necessary it is for those in power to curb in season all such unruly spirits as desire to introduce new doctrines and discipline in the church or new forms of government in the state those wicked puritans began in queen elizabeths time to quarrel only with surplices and other habits with the ring in matrimony the cross in baptism and the like thence they went on to further matters of higher importance and at last they must needs have the whole government of the church dissolved this great work they compassed first by depriving the bishops of their seats in parliament then they abolished the whole order and at last which was their original design they seized on all the churchlands and divided the spoil among themselves and like jeroboam made priests of the very dregs of the people this was their way of reforming the church as to the civil government you have already heard how they modelled it upon the murder of their king and discarding the nobility yet clearly to shew what a babel they had built after twelve years trial and twenty several sorts of government the nation grown weary of their tyranny was forced to call in the son of him whom those reformers had sacrificed and thus were simeon and levi divided in jacob and scattered in israel  thirdly although the successors of these puritans i mean our present dissenters do not think fit to observe this day of humiliation yet since it would be very proper in them upon some occasions to renounce in a public manner those principles upon which their predecessors acted and it will be more prudent in them to do so because those very puritans of whom ours are followers found by experience that after they had overturned the church and state murdered their king and were projecting what they called a kingdom of the saints they were cheated of the power and possessions they only panted after by an upstart sect of religion that grew out of their own bowels who subjected them to one tyrant while they were endeavouring to set up a thousand  fourthly those who profess to be followers of our church established and yet presume in discourse to justify or excuse that rebellion and murder of the king ought to consider how utterly contrary all such opinions are to the doctrine of christ and his apostles as well as to the articles of our church and to the preaching and practice of its true professors for above a hundred years of late times indeed and i speak it with grief of heart we have heard even sermons of a strange nature although reason would make one think it a very unaccountable way of procuring favour under a monarchy by palliating and lessening the guilt of those who murdered the best of kings in cold blood and for a time destroyed the very monarchy itself pray god we may never more hear such doctrine from the pulpit nor have it scattered about in print to poison the people  fifthly some general knowledge of this horrid rebellion and murder with the consequences they had upon these nations may be a warning to our people not to believe a lie and to mistrust those deluding spirits who under pretence of a purer and more reformed religion would lead them from their duty to god and the laws politicians may say what they please but it is no hard thing at all for the meanest person who hath common understanding to know whether he be well or ill governed if he be freely allowed to follow his trade and calling if he be secure in his property and hath the benefit of the law to defend himself against injustice and oppression if his religion be different from that of his country and the government think fit to tolerate it which he may be very secure of let it be what it will he ought to be fully satisfied and give no offence by writing or discourse to the worship established as the dissenting preachers are too apt to do but if he hath any new visions of his own it is his duty to be quiet and possess them in silence without disturbing the community by a furious zeal for making proselytes this was the folly and madness of those ancient puritan fanatics they must needs overturn heaven and earth violate all the laws of god and man make their country a field of blood to propagate whatever wild or wicked opinions came into their heads declaring all their absurdities and blasphemies to proceed from the holy ghost  to conclude this head in answer to that objection of keeping up animosity and hatred between protestants by the observation of this day if there be any sect or sort of people among us who profess the same principles in religion and government which those puritan rebels put in practice i think it is the interest of all those who love the church and king to keep up as strong a party against them as possible until they shall in a body renounce all those wicked opinions upon which their predecessors acted to the disgrace of christianity and the perpetual infamy of the english nation  when we accuse the papists of the horrid doctrine that no faith ought to be kept with heretics they deny it to a man and yet we justly think it dangerous to trust them because we know their actions have been sometimes suitable to that opinion but the followers of those who beheaded the martyr have not yet renounced their principles and till they do they may be justly suspected neither will the bare name of protestants set them right for surely christ requires more from us than a profession of hating popery which a turk or an atheist may do as well as a protestant  if an enslaved people should recover their liberty from a tyrannical power of any sort who could blame them for commemorating their deliverance by a day of joy and thanksgiving and doth not the destruction of a church a king and three kingdoms by the artifices hypocrisy and cruelty of a wicked race of soldiers and preachers and other sons of belial equally require a solemn time of humiliation especially since the consequences of that bloody scene still continue as i have already shewn in their effects upon us   thus i have done with the three heads i proposed to discourse on but before i conclude i must give a caution to those who hear me that they may not think i am pleading for absolute unlimited power in any one man it is true all power is from god and as the apostle says the powers that be are ordained of god but this is in the same sense that all we have is from god our food and raiment and whatever possessions we hold by lawful means nothing can be meant in those or any other words of scripture to justify tyrannical power or the savage cruelties of those heathen emperors who lived in the time of the apostles and so st paul concludes the powers that be are ordained of god for what why for the punishment of evil doers and the praise the reward of them that do well there is no more inward value in the greatest emperor than in the meanest of his subjects his body is composed of the same substance the same parts and with the same or greater infirmities his education is generally worse by flattery and idleness and luxury and those evil dispositions that early power is apt to give it is therefore against common sense that his private personal interest or pleasure should be put in the balance with the safety of millions every one of which is his equal by nature equal in the sight of god equally capable of salvation and it is for their sakes not his own that he is entrusted with the government over them he hath as high trust as can safely be reposed in one man and if he discharge it as he ought he deserves all the honour and duty that a mortal may be allowed to receive his personal failings we have nothing to do with and errors in government are to be imputed to his ministers in the state to what height those errors may be suffered to proceed is not the business of this day or this place or of my function to determine when oppressions grow too great and universal to be borne nature or necessity may find a remedy but if a private person reasonably expects pardon upon his amendment for all faults that are not capital it would be a hard condition indeed not to give the same allowance to a prince who must see with other mens eyes and hear with other mens ears which are often wilfully blind and deaf such was the condition of the martyr and is so in some degree of all other princes yet this we may justly say in defence of the common people in all civilized nations that it must be a very bad government indeed where the body of the subjects will not rather choose to live in peace and obedience than take up arms on pretence of faults in the administration unless where the vulgar are deluded by false preachers to grow fond of new visions and fancies in religion which managed by dexterous men for sinister ends of malice envy or ambition have often made whole nations run mad this was exactly the case in the whole progress of that great rebellion and the murder of king charles i but the late revolution under the prince of orange was occasioned by a proceeding directly contrary the oppression and injustice there beginning from the throne for that unhappy prince king james ii did not only invade our laws and liberties but would have forced a false religion upon his subjects for which he was deservedly rejected since there could be no other remedy found or at least agreed on but under the blessed martyr the deluded people would have forced many false religions not only on their fellowsubjects but even upon their sovereign himself and at the same time invaded all his undoubted rights and because he would not comply raised a horrid rebellion wherein by the permission of god they prevailed and put their sovereign to death like a common criminal in the face of the world  therefore those who seem to think they cannot otherwise justify the late revolution and the change of the succession than by lessening the guilt of the puritans do certainly put the greatest affront imaginable upon the present powers by supposing any relation or resemblance between that rebellion and the late revolution and consequently that the present establishment is to be defended by the same arguments which those usurpers made use of who to obtain their tyranny trampled under foot all the laws of both god and man  one great design of my discourse was to give you warning against running into either extreme of two bad opinions with relation to obedience as kings are called gods upon earth so some would allow them an equal power with god over all laws and ordinances and that the liberty and property and life and religion of the subject depended wholly upon the breath of the prince which however i hope was never meant by those who pleaded for passive obedience and this opinion hath not been confined to that party which was first charged with it but hath sometimes gone over to the other to serve many an evil turn of interest or ambition who have been as ready to enlarge prerogative where they could find their own account as the highest maintainers of it  on the other side some look upon kings as answerable for every mistake or omission in government and bound to comply with the most unreasonable demands of an unquiet faction which was the case of those who persecuted the blessed martyr of this day from his throne to the scaffold  between these two extremes it is easy from what hath been said to choose a middle to be good and loyal subjects yet according to your power faithful assertors of your religion and liberties to avoid all broachers and preachers of newfangled doctrines in the church to be strict observers of the laws which cannot be justly taken from you without your own consent in short to obey god and the king and meddle not with those who are given to change  which that you may all do c     on the poor mans contentment   philippians chap iv part of the 11th verse  i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content   the holy scripture is full of expressions to set forth the miserable condition of man during the whole progress of his life his weakness pride and vanity his unmeasurable desires and perpetual disappointments the prevalency of his passions and the corruptions of his reason his deluding hopes and his real as well as imaginary fears his natural and artificial wants his cares and anxieties the diseases of his body and the diseases of his mind the shortness of his life his dread of a future state with his carelessness to prepare for it and the wise men of all ages have made the same reflections  but all these are general calamities from which none are excepted and being without remedy it is vain to bewail them the great question long debated in the world is whether the rich or the poor are the least miserable of the two it is certain that no rich man ever desired to be poor and that most if not all poor men desire to be rich whence it may be argued that in all appearance the advantage lieth on the side of wealth because both parties agree in preferring it before poverty but this reasoning will be found to be false for i lay it down as a certain truth that god almighty hath placed all men upon an equal foot with respect to their happiness in this world and the capacity of attaining their salvation in the next or at least if there be any difference it is not to the advantage of the rich and the mighty now since a great part of those who usually make up our congregations are not of considerable station and many among them of the lower sort and since the meaner people are generally and justly charged with the sin of repining and murmuring at their own condition to which however their betters axe sufficiently subject although perhaps for shame not always so loud in their complaints i thought it might be useful to reason upon this point in as plain a manner as i can i shall therefore shew first that the poor enjoy many temporal blessings which are not common to the rich and the great and likewise that the rich and the great are subject to many temporal evils which are not common to the poor  but here i would not be misunderstood perhaps there is not a word more abused than that of the poor or wherein the world is more generally mistaken among the number of those who beg in our streets or are halfstarved at home or languish in prison for debt there is hardly one in a hundred who doth not owe his misfortunes to his own laziness or drunkenness or worse vices  to these he owes those very diseases which often disable him from getting his bread such wretches are deservedly unhappy they can only blame themselves and when we are commanded to have pity on the poor these are not understood to be of the number  it is true indeed that sometimes honest endeavouring men are reduced to extreme want even to the begging of alms by losses by accidents by diseases and old age without any fault of their own but these are very few in comparison of the other nor would their support be any sensible burthen to the public if the charity of welldisposed persons were not intercepted by those common strollers who are most importunate and who least deserve it these indeed are properly and justly called the poor whom it should be our study to find out and distinguish by making them partake of our superfluity and abundance  but neither have these anything to do with my present subject for by the poor i only intend the honest industrious artificer the meaner sort of tradesmen and the labouring man who getteth his bread by the sweat of his brows in town or country and who make the bulk of mankind among us  first i shall therefore shew first that the poor in the sense i understand the word do enjoy many temporal blessings which are not common to the rich and great and likewise that the rich and great are subject to many temporal evils which are not common to the poor  secondly from the arguments offered to prove the foregoing head i shall draw some observations that may be useful for your practice  i as to the first health we know is generally allowed to be the best of all earthly possessions because it is that without which we can have no satisfaction in any of the rest for riches are of no use if sickness taketh from us the ability of enjoying them and power and greatness are then only a burthen now if we would look for health it must be in the humble habitation of the labouring man or industrious artificer who earn their bread by the sweat of their brows and usually live to a good old age with a great degree of strength and vigour  the refreshment of the body by sleep is another great happiness of the meaner sort their rest is not disturbed by the fear of thieves and robbers nor is it interrupted by surfeits of intemperance labour and plain food supply the want of quieting draughts and the wise man telleth us that the sleep of the labouring man is sweet as to children which are certainly accounted of as a blessing even to the poor where industry is not wanting they are an assistance to honest parents instead of being a burthen they are healthy and strong and fit for labour neither is the father in fear lest his heir should be ruined by an unequal match nor is he solicitous about his rising in the world farther than to be able to get his bread  the poorer sort are not the objects of general hatred or envy they have no twinges of ambition nor trouble themselves with party quarrels or state divisions the idle rabble who follow their ambitious leaders in such cases do not fall within my description of the poorer sort for it is plain i mean only the honest industrious poor in town or country who are safest in times of public disturbance in perilous seasons and public revolutions if they will be quiet and do their business for artificers and husbandmen are necessary in all governments but in such seasons the rich are the public mark because they are oftentimes of no use but to be plundered like some sort of birds who are good for nothing but their feathers and so fall a prey to the strongest side  let us proceed on the other side to examine the disadvantages which the rich and the great lie under with respect to the happiness of the present life  first then while health as we have said is the general portion of the lower sort the gout the dropsy the stone the cholic and all other diseases are continually haunting the palaces of the rich and the great as the natural attendants upon laziness and luxury neither does the rich man eat his sumptuous fare with half the appetite and relish that even the beggars do the crumbs which fall from his table but on the contrary he is full of loathing and disgust or at best of indifference in the midst of plenty thus their intemperance shortens their lives without pleasing their appetites  business fear guilt design anguish and vexation are continually buzzing about the curtains of the rich and the powerful and will hardly suffer them to close their eyes unless when they are dosed with the fumes of strong liquors  it is a great mistake to imagine that the rich want but few things their wants are more numerous more craving and urgent than those of poorer men for these endeavour only at the necessaries of life which make them happy and they think no farther but the desire of power and wealth is endless and therefore impossible to be satisfied with any acquisitions  if riches were so great a blessing as they are commonly thought they would at least have this advantage to give their owners cheerful hearts and countenances they would often stir them up to express their thankfulness to god and discover their satisfaction to the world but in fact the contrary to all this is true for where are there more cloudy brows more melancholy hearts or more ingratitude to their great benefactor than among those who abound in wealth and indeed it is natural that it should be so because those men who covet things that are hard to be got must be hard to please whereas a small thing maketh a poor man happy and great losses cannot befall him  it is likewise worth considering how few among the rich have procured their wealth by just measures how many owe their fortunes to the sins of their parents how many more to their own if mens titles were to be tried before a true court of conscience where false swearing and a thousand vile artifices that are well known and can hardly be avoided in human courts of justice would avail nothing how many would be ejected with infamy and disgrace how many grow considerable by breach of trust by bribery and corruption how many have sold their religion with the rights and liberties of themselves and others for power and employments  and it is a mistake to think that the most hardened sinner who oweth his possessions or titles to any such wicked arts of thieving can have true peace of mind under the reproaches of a guilty conscience and amid the cries of ruined widows and orphans  i know not one real advantage that the rich have over the poor except the power of doing good to others but this is an advantage which god hath not given wicked men the grace to make use of the wealth acquired by evil means was never employed to good ends for that would be to divide the kingdom of satan against itself whatever hath been gained by fraud avarice oppression and the like must be preserved and increased by the same methods  i shall add but one thing more upon this head which i hope will convince you that god whose thoughts are not as our thoughts never intended riches or power to be necessary for the happiness of mankind in this life because it is certain that there is not one single good quality of the mind absolutely necessary to obtain them where men are resolved to be rich at any rate neither honour justice temperance wisdom religion truth or learning for a slight acquaintance of the world will inform us that there have been many instances of men in all ages who have arrived at great possessions and great dignities by cunning fraud or flattery without any of these or any other virtues that can be named now if riches and greatness were such blessings that good men without them could not have their share of happiness in this life how cometh it to pass that god should suffer them to be often dealt to the worst and most profligate of mankind that they should be generally procured by the most abominable means and applied to the basest and most wicked uses this ought not to be conceived of a just a merciful a wise and almighty being we must therefore conclude that wealth and power are in their own nature at best but things indifferent and that a good man may be equally happy without them provided that he hath a sufficiency of the common blessings of human life to answer all the reasonable and virtuous demands of nature which his industry will provide and sobriety will prevent his wanting agurs prayer with the reasons of his wish are full to this purpose give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain  from what hath been said i shall in the second place offer some considerations that may be useful for your practice  and here i shall apply myself chiefly to those of the lower sort for whose comfort and satisfaction this discourse is principally intended for having observed the great sin of those who do not abound in wealth to be that of murmuring and repining that god hath dealt his blessings unequally to the sons of men i thought it would be of great use to remove out of your minds so false and wicked an opinion by shewing that your condition is really happier than most of you imagine  first therefore it hath been always agreed in the world that the present happiness of mankind consisted in the ease of our body and the quiet of our mind but from what has been already said it plainly appears that neither wealth nor power do in any sort contribute to either of these two blessings if on the contrary by multiplying our desires they increase our discontents if they destroy our health gall us with painful diseases and shorten our life if they expose us to hatred to envy to censure to a thousand temptations it is not easy to see why a wise man should make them his choice for their own sake although it were in his power would any of you who are in health and strength of body with moderate food and raiment earned by your own labour rather choose to be in the rich mans bed under the torture of the gout unable to take your natural rest or natural nourishment with the additional load of a guilty conscience reproaching you for injustice oppressions covetousness and fraud no but you would take the riches and power and leave behind the inconveniences that attend them and so would every man living but that is more than our share and god never intended this world for such a place of rest as we would make it for the scripture assureth us that it was only designed as a place of trial nothing is more frequent than a man to wish himself in anothers condition yet he seldom doth it without some reserve he would not be so old he would not be so sickly he would not be so cruel he would not be so insolent he would not be so vicious he would not be so oppressive so griping and so on from whence it is plain that in their own judgment men are not so unequally dealt with as they would at first sight imagine for if i would not change my condition with another man without any exception or reservation at all i am in reality more happy than he  secondly you of the meaner sort are subject to fewer temptations than the rich and therefore your vices are more unpardonable labour subdueth your appetites to be satisfied with common things the business of your several callings filleth up your whole time so that idleness which is the bane and destruction of virtue doth not lead you into the neighbourhood of sin your passions are cooler by not being inflamed with excess and therefore the gate and the way that lead to life are not so straight and so narrow to you as to those who live among all the allurements to wickedness to serve god with the best of your care and understanding and to be just and true in your dealings is the short sum of your duty and will be the more strictly required of you because nothing lieth in the way to divert you from it  thirdly it is plain from what i have said that you of the lower rank have no just reason to complain of your condition because as you plainly see it affordeth you so many advantages and freeth you from so many vexations so many distempers both of body and mind which pursue and torment the rich and powerful  fourthly you are to remember and apply that the poorest person is not excused from doing good to others and even relieving the wants of his distressed neighbour according to his abilities and if you perform your duty in this point you far outdo the greatest liberalities of the rich and will accordingly be accepted of by god and get your reward for it is our saviours own doctrine when the widow gave her two mites the rich give out of their abundance that is to say what they give they do not feel it in their way of living but the poor man who giveth out of his little stock must spare it from the necessary food and raiment of himself and his family and therefore our saviour adds that the widow gave more than all who went before her for she gave all she had even all her living and so went home utterly unprovided to supply her necessities  lastly as it appeareth from what hath been said that you in the lower rank have in reality a greater share of happiness your work of salvation is easier by your being liable to fewer temptations and as your reward in heaven is much more certain than it is to the rich if you seriously perform your duty for yours is the kingdom of heaven so your neglect of it will be less excusable will meet with fewer allowances from god and will be punished with double stripes for the most unknowing among you cannot plead ignorance of what you have been so early taught i hope so often instructed in and which is so easy to be understood i mean the art of leading a life agreeable to the plain and positive laws of god perhaps you may think you lie under one disadvantage which the great and rich have not that idleness will certainly reduce you to beggary whereas those who abound in wealth lie under no necessity either of labour or temperance to keep enough to live on but this is indeed one part of your happiness that the lowness of your condition in a manner forceth you to what is pleasing to god and necessary for your daily support thus your duty and interest are always the same  to conclude since our blessed lord instead of a rich and honourable station in this world was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition let not those on whom the bounty of providence hath bestowed wealth and honours despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station but rather with their utmost power by their countenance by their protection by just payment of their honest labour encourage their daily endeavours for the support of themselves and their families on the other hand let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men and so with diligence in their several employments live soberly righteously and godlily in this present world that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the gospel to the poor i mean the kingdom of heaven  now to god the father c     a sermon on the causes of the wretched condition of ireland1  footnote 1 this is not very properly styled a sermon but considered as a political dissertation it has great merit and it is highly worthy of the subject and the author most of the circumstances here founded upon as the causes of national distress are the subject of separate disquisitions in those political writings connected with ireland but they are here summed up and brought into one view and the opinions expressed form a sort of index to the deans tenets upon the state of that country s   psalm cxliv part of the 14th and 15th verses  that there be no complaining in our streets happy is the people that is in such a case   it is a very melancholy reflection that such a country as ours which is capable of producing all things necessary and most things convenient for life sufficient for the support of four times the number of its inhabitants should yet lie under the heaviest load of misery and want our streets crowded with beggars so many of our lower sort of tradesmen labourers and artificers not able to find clothes and food for their families  i think it may therefore be of some use to lay before you the chief causes of this wretched condition we are in and then it will be easier to assign what remedies are in our power toward removing at least some part of these evils  for it is ever to be lamented that we lie under many disadvantages not by our own faults which are peculiar to ourselves and which no other nation under heaven hath any reason to complain of  i shall therefore first mention some causes of our miserieswhich i doubt are not to be remedied until god shall put it in the hearts of those who are stronger to allow us the common rights and privileges of brethren fellowsubjects and even of mankind the first cause of our misery is the intolerable hardships we lie under in every branch of our trade by which we are become as hewers of wood and drawers of water to our rigorous neighbours  the second cause of our miserable state is the folly the vanity and ingratitude of those vast numbers who think themselves too good to live in the country which gave them birth and still gives them bread and rather choose to pass their days and consume their wealth and draw out the very vitals of their mother kingdom among those who heartily despise them  these i have but lightly touched on because i fear they are not to be redressed and besides i am very sensible how ready some people are to take offence at the honest truth and for that reason i shall omit several other grievances under which we are long likely to groan  i shall therefore go on to relate some other causes of this nations poverty by which if they continue much longer it must infallibly sink to utter ruin  the first is that monstrous pride and vanity in both sexes especially the weaker sex who in the midst of poverty are suffered to run into all kind of expense and extravagance in dress and particularly priding themselves to wear nothing but what cometh from abroad disdaining the growth or manufacture of their own country in those articles where they can be better served at home with half the expense and this is grown to such a height that they will carry the whole yearly rent of a good estate at once on their body and as there is in that sex a spirit of envy by which they cannot endure to see others in a better habit than themselves so those whose fortunes can hardly support their families in the necessaries of life will needs vie with the richest and greatest amongst us to the ruin of themselves and their posterity  neither are the men less guilty of this pernicious folly who in imitation of a gaudiness and foppery of dress introduced of late years into our neighbouring kingdom as fools are apt to imitate only the defects of their betters cannot find materials in their own country worthy to adorn their bodies of clay while their minds are naked of every valuable quality  thus our tradesmen and shopkeepers who deal in home goods are left in a starving condition and only those encouraged who ruin the kingdom by importing among us foreign vanities  another cause of our low condition is our great luxury the chief support of which is the materials of it brought to the nation in exchange for the few valuable things left us whereby so many thousand families want the very necessaries of life  thirdly in most parts of this kingdom the natives are from their infancy so given up to idleness and sloth that they often choose to beg or steal rather than support themselves with their own labour they marry without the least view or thought of being able to make any provision for their families and whereas in all industrious nations children are looked on as a help to their parents with us for want of being early trained to work they are an intolerable burthen at home and a grievous charge upon the public as appeareth from the vast number of ragged and naked children in town and country led about by strolling women trained up in ignorance and all manner of vice  lastly a great cause of this nations misery is that egyptian bondage of cruel oppressing covetous landlords expecting that all who live under them should make bricks without straw who grieve and envy when they see a tenant of their own in a whole coat or able to afford one comfortable meal in a month by which the spirits of the people are broken and made for slavery the farmers and cottagers almost through the whole kingdom being to all intents and purposes as real beggars as any of those to whom we give our charity in the streets and these cruel landlords are every day unpeopling their kingdom by forbidding their miserable tenants to till the earth against common reason and justice and contrary to the practice and prudence of all other nations by which numberless families have been forced either to leave the kingdom or stroll about and increase the number of our thieves and beggars  such and much worse is our condition at present if i had leisure or liberty to lay it before you and therefore the next thing which might be considered is whether there may be any probable remedy found at the least against some part of these evils for most of them are wholly desperate  but this being too large a subject to be now handled and the intent of my discourse confining me to give some directions concerning the poor of this city i shall keep myself within those limits it is indeed in the power of the lawgivers to found a school in every parish of the kingdom for teaching the meaner and poorer sort of children to speak and read the english tongue and to provide a reasonable maintenance for the teachers this would in time abolish that part of barbarity and ignorance for which our natives are so despised by all foreigners this would bring them to think and act according to the rules of reason by which a spirit of industry and thrift and honesty would be introduced among them and indeed considering how small a tax would suffice for such a work it is a public scandal that such a thing should never have been endeavoured or perhaps so much as thought on  to supply the want of such a law several pious persons in many parts of this kingdom have been prevailed on by the great endeavours and good example set them by the clergy to erect charityschools in several parishes to which very often the richest parishioners contribute the least in those schools children are or ought to be trained up to read and write and cast accounts and these children should if possible be of honest parents gone to decay through age sickness or other unavoidable calamity by the hand of god not the brood of wicked strollers for it is by no means reasonable that the charity of wellinclined people should be applied to encourage the lewdness of those profligate abandoned women who crowd our streets with their borrowed or spurious issue  in those hospitals which have good foundations and rents to support them whereof to the scandal of christianity there are very few in this kingdom i say in such hospitals the children maintained ought to be only of decayed citizens and freemen and be bred up to good trades but in these smallparish charityschools which have no support but the casual goodwill of charitable people i do altogether disapprove the custom of putting the children prentice except to the very meanest trades otherwise the poor honest citizen who is just able to bring up his child and pay a small sum of money with him to a good master is wholly defeated and the bastard issue perhaps of some beggar preferred before him and hence we come to be so overstocked with prentices and journeymen more than our discouraged country can employ and i fear the greatest part of our thieves pickpockets and other vagabonds are of this number  therefore in order to make these parish charityschools of great and universal use i agree with the opinion of many wise persons that a new turn should be given to this whole matter  i think there is no complaint more just than what we find in almost every family of the folly and ignorance the fraud and knavery the idleness and viciousness the wasteful squandering temper of servants who are indeed become one of the many public grievances of the kingdom whereof i believe there are few masters that now hear me who are not convinced by their own experience and i am not very confident that more families of all degrees have been ruined by the corruptions of servants than by all other causes put together neither is this to be wondered at when we consider from what nurseries so many of them are received into our houses the first is the tribe of wicked boys wherewith most corners of this town are pestered who haunt public doors these having been born of beggars and bred to pilfer as soon as they can go or speak as years come on are employed in the lowest offices to get themselves bread are practised in all manner of villainy and when they are grown up if they are not entertained in a gang of thieves are forced to seek for a service the other nursery is the barbarous and desert part of the country from whence such lads come up hither to seek their fortunes who are bred up from the dunghill in idleness ignorance lying and thieving from these two nurseries i say a great number of our servants come to us sufficient to corrupt all the rest thus the whole race of servants in this kingdom have gotten so ill a reputation that some persons from england come over hither into great stations are said to have absolutely refused admitting any servant born among us into their families neither can they be justly blamed for although it is not impossible to find an honest native fit for a good service yet the inquiry is too troublesome and the hazard too great for a stranger to attempt  if we consider the many misfortunes that befall private families it will be found that servants are the causes and instruments of them all are our goods embezzled wasted and destroyed is our house burnt down to the ground it is by the sloth the drunkenness or the villainy of servants are we robbed and murdered in our beds it is by confederacy with our servants are we engaged in quarrels and misunderstandings with our neighbours these were all begun and inflamed by the false malicious tongues of our servants are the secrets of our families betrayed and evil repute spread of us our servants were the authors do false accusers rise up against us an evil too frequent in this country they have been tampering with our servants do our children discover folly malice pride cruelty revenge undutifulness in their words and actions are they seduced to lewdness or scandalous marriages it is all by our servants nay the very mistakes follies blunders and absurdities of those in our service are able to ruffle and discompose the mildest nature and are often of such consequence as to put whole families into confusion  since therefore not only our domestic peace and quiet and the welfare of our children but even the very safety of our lives reputations and fortunes have so great a dependence upon the choice of our servants i think it would well become the wisdom of the nation to make some provision in so important an affair but in the meantime and perhaps to better purpose it were to be wished that the children of both sexes entertained in the parish charityschools were bred up in such a manner as would give them a teachable disposition and qualify them to learn whatever is required in any sort of service for instance they should be taught to read and write to know somewhat in casting accounts to understand the principles of religion to practise cleanliness to get a spirit of honesty industry and thrift and be severely punished for every neglect in any of these particulars for it is the misfortune of mankind that if they are not used to be taught in their early childhood whereby to acquire what i call a teachable disposition they cannot without great difficulty learn the easiest thing in the course of their lives but are always awkward and unhandy their minds as well as bodies for want of early practice growing stiff and unmanageable as we observe in the sort of gentlemen who kept from school by the indulgence of their parents but a few years are never able to recover the time they have lost and grow up in ignorance and all manner of vice whereof we have too many examples all over the nation but to return to what i was saying if these charity children were trained up in the manner i mentioned and then bound apprentices in the families of gentlemen and citizens for which a late law giveth great encouragement being accustomed from their first entrance to be always learning some useful thing they would learn in a month more than another without those advantages can do in a year and in the meantime be very useful in a family as far as their age and strength would allow and when such children come to years of discretion they will probably be a useful example to their fellowservants at least they will prove a strong check upon the rest for i suppose everybody will allow that one good honest diligent servant in a house may prevent abundance of mischief in the family  these are the reasons for which i urge this matter so strongly and i hope those who listen to me will consider them  i shall now say something about that great number of poor who under the name of common beggars infest our streets and fill our ears with their continual cries and craving importunity this i shall venture to call an unnecessary evil brought upon us for the gross neglect and want of proper management in those whose duty it is to prevent it but before i proceed farther let me humbly presume to vindicate the justice and mercy of god and his dealings with mankind upon this particular he hath not dealt so hardly with his creatures as some would imagine when they see so many miserable objects ready to perish for want for it would infallibly be found upon strict enquiry that there is hardly one in twenty of those miserable objects who do not owe their present poverty to their own faults to their present sloth and negligence to their indiscreet marriage without the least prospect of supporting a family to their foolish expensiveness to their drunkenness and other vices by which they have squandered their gettings and contracted diseases in their old age and to speak freely is it any way reasonable or just that those who have denied themselves many lawful satisfactions and conveniences of life from a principle of conscience as well as prudence that they might not be a burthen to the public should be charged with supporting others who have brought themselves to less than a morsel of bread by their idleness extravagance and vice yet such and no other are far the greatest number not only in those who beg in our streets but even of what we call poor decayed housekeepers whom we are apt to pity as real objects of charity and distinguish them from common beggars although in truth they both owe their undoing to the same causes only the former is either too nicely bred to endure walking half naked in the streets or too proud to own their wants for the artificer or other tradesman who pleadeth he is grown too old to work or look after business and therefore expecteth assistance as a decayed housekeeper may we not ask him why he did not take care in his youth and strength of days to make some provision against old age when he saw so many examples before him of people undone by their idleness and vicious extravagance and to go a little higher whence cometh it that so many citizens and shopkeepers of the most creditable trade who once made a good figure go to decay by their expensive pride and vanity affecting to educate and dress their children above their abilities or the state of life they ought to expect  however since the best of us have too many infirmities to answer for we ought not to be severe upon those of others and therefore if our brother through grief or sickness or other incapacity is not in a condition to preserve his being we ought to support him to the best of our power without reflecting over seriously on the causes that brought him to his misery but in order to this and to turn our charity into its proper channel we ought to consider who and where those objects are whom it is chiefly incumbent upon us to support  by the ancient law of this realm still in force every parish is obliged to maintain its own poor which although some may think to be not very equal because many parishes are very rich and have few poor among them and others the contrary yet i think may be justly defended for as to remote country parishes in the desert part of the kingdom the necessaries of life are there so cheap that the infirm poor may be provided for with little burden to the inhabitants but in what i am going to say i shall confine myself only to this city where we are overrun not only with our own poor but with a far greater number from every part of the nation now i say this evil of being encumbered with so many foreign beggars who have not the least title to our charity and whom it is impossible for us to support may be easily remedied if the government of this city in conjunction with the clergy and parish officers would think it worth their care and i am sure few things deserve it better for if every parish would take a list of those begging poor which properly belong to it and compel each of them to wear a badge marked and numbered so as to be seen and known by all they meet and confine them to beg within the limits of their own parish severely punishing them when they offend and driving out all interlopers from other parishes we could then make a computation of their numbers and the strollers from the country being driven away the remainder would not be too many for the charity of those who pass by to maintain neither would any beggar although confined to his own parish be hindered from receiving the charity of the whole town because in this case those welldisposed persons who walk the streets will give their charity to such whom they think proper objects wherever they meet them provided they are found in their own parishes and wearing their badges of distinction and as to those parishes which bordered upon the skirts and suburbs of the town where country strollers are used to harbour themselves they must be forced to go back to their homes when they find nobody to relieve them because they want that mark which only gives them licence to beg upon this point it were to be wished that inferior parish officers had better encouragement given them to perform their duty in driving away all beggars who do not belong to the parish instead of conniving at them as it is said they do for some small contribution for the whole city would save much more by ridding themselves of many hundred beggars than they would lose by giving parish officers a reasonable support  it should seem a strange unaccountable thing that those who have probably been reduced to want by riot lewdness and idleness although they have assurance enough to beg alms publicly from all they meet should yet be too proud to wear the parish badge which would turn so much to their own advantage by ridding them of such great numbers who now intercept the greatest part of what belongeth to them yet it is certain that there are very many who publicly declare they will never wear those badges and many others who either hide or throw them away but the remedy for this is very short easy and just by trying them like vagabonds and sturdy beggars and forcibly driving them out of the town  therefore as soon as this expedient of wearing badges shall be put in practice i do earnestly exhort all those who hear me never to give their alms to any public beggar who doth not fully comply with this order by which our number of poor will be so reduced that it will be much easier to provide for the rest our shopdoors will be no longer crowded with so many thieves and pickpockets in beggars habits nor our streets so dangerous to those who are forced to walk in the night  thus i have with great freedom delivered my thoughts upon this subject which so nearly concerneth us it is certainly a bad scheme to any christian country which god hath blessed with fruitfulness and where the people enjoy the just rights and privileges of mankind that there should be any beggars at all but alas among us where the whole nation itself is almost reduced to beggary by the disadvantages we lie under and the hardships we are forced to bear the laziness ignorance thoughtlessness squandering temper slavish nature and uncleanly manner of living in the poor popish natives together with the cruel oppressions of their landlords who delight to see their vassals in the dust i say that in such a nation how can we otherwise expect than to be overrun with objects of misery and want therefore there can be no other method to free this city from so intolerable a grievance than by endeavouring as far as in us lies that the burthen may be more equally divided by contributing to maintain our own poor and forcing the strollers and vagabonds to return to their several homes in the country there to smite the conscience of those oppressors who first stripped them of all their substance  i might here if the time would permit offer many arguments to persuade to works of charity but you hear them so often from the pulpit that i am willing to hope you may not now want them besides my present design was only to shew where your alms would be best bestowed to the honour of god your own ease and advantage the service of your country and the benefit of the poor i desire you will all weigh and consider what i have spoken and according to your several stations and abilities endeavour to put it in practice and god give you good success to whom with the son and holy ghost be all honour c  the grace of our lord jesus christ c     a sermon upon sleeping in church   acts chap xx ver 9  and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead   i have chosen these words with design if possible to disturb some part in this audience of half an hours sleep for the convenience and exercise whereof this place at this season of the day is very much celebrated  there is indeed one mortal disadvantage to which all preaching is subject that those who by the wickedness of their lives stand in greatest need have usually the smallest share for either they are absent upon the account of idleness or spleen or hatred to religion or in order to doze away the intemperance of the week or if they do come they are sure to employ their minds rather any other way than regarding or attending to the business of the place  the accident which happened to this young man in the text hath not been sufficient to discourage his successors but because the preachers now in the world however they may exceed st paul in the art of setting men to sleep do extremely fall short of him in the working of miracles therefore men are become so cautious as to choose more safe and convenient stations and postures for taking their repose without hazard of their persons and upon the whole matter choose rather to trust their destruction to a miracle than their safety however this being not the only way by which the lukewarm christians and scorners of the age discover their neglect and contempt of preaching i shall enter expressly into consideration of this matter and order my discourse in the following method  first i shall produce several instances to shew the great neglect of preaching now amongst us  secondly i shall reckon up some of the usual quarrels men have against preaching  thirdly i shall set forth the great evil of this neglect and contempt of preaching and discover the real causes from whence it proceedeth  lastly i shall offer some remedies against this great and spreading evil   first i shall produce certain instances to shew the great neglect of preaching now among us  these may be reduced under two heads first mens absence from the service of the church and secondly their misbehaviour when they are here  the first instance of mens neglect is in their frequent absence from the church  there is no excuse so trivial that will not pass upon some mens consciences to excuse their attendance at the public worship of god some are so unfortunate as to be always indisposed on the lords day and think nothing so unwholesome as the air of a church others have their affairs so oddly contrived as to be always unluckily prevented by business with some it is a great mark of wit and deep understanding to stay at home on sundays others again discover strange fits of laziness that seize them particularly on that day and confine them to their beds others are absent out of mere contempt of religion and lastly there are not a few who look upon it as a day of rest and therefore claim the privilege of their cattle to keep the sabbath by eating drinking and sleeping after the toil and labour of the week now in all this the worst circumstance is that these persons are such whose companies are most required and who stand most in need of a physician  secondly mens great neglect and contempt of preaching appear by their misbehaviour when at church  if the audience were to be ranked under several heads according to their behaviour when the word of god is delivered how small a number would appear of those who receive it as they ought how much of the seed then sown would be found to fall by the wayside upon stony ground or among thorns and how little good ground would there be to take it a preacher cannot look round from the pulpit without observing that some are in a perpetual whisper and by their air and gesture give occasion to suspect that they are in those very minutes defaming their neighbour others have their eyes and imagination constantly engaged in such a circle of objects perhaps to gratify the most unwarrantable desires that they never once attend to the business of the place the sound of the preachers words doth not so much as once interrupt them some have their minds wandering among idle worldly or vicious thoughts some lie at catch to ridicule whatever they hear and with much wit and humour provide a stock of laughter by furnishing themselves from the pulpit but of all misbehaviour none is comparable to that of those who come here to sleep opium is not so stupefying to many persons as an afternoon sermon perpetual custom hath so brought it about that the words of whatever preacher become only a sort of uniform sound at a distance than which nothing is more effectual to lull the senses for that it is the very sound of the sermon which bindeth up their faculties is manifest from hence because they all awake so very regularly as soon as it ceaseth and with much devotion receive the blessing dozed and besotted with indecencies i am ashamed to repeat  i proceed secondly to reckon up some of the usual quarrels men have against preaching and to shew the unreasonableness of them  such unwarrantable demeanour as i have described among christians in the house of god in a solemn assembly while their faith and duty are explained and delivered have put those who are guilty upon inventing some excuses to extenuate their fault this they do by turning the blame either upon the particular preacher or upon preaching in general first they object against the particular preacher his manner his delivery his voice are disagreeable his style and expression are flat and low sometimes improper and absurd the matter is heavy trivial and insipid sometimes despicable and perfectly ridiculous or else on the other side he runs up into unintelligible speculation empty notions and abstracted flights all clad in words above usual understandings  secondly they object against preaching in general it is a perfect road of talk they know already whatever can be said they have heard the same an hundred times over they quarrel that preachers do not relieve an old beaten subject with wit and invention and that now the art is lost of moving mens passions so common among the ancient orators of greece and rome these and the like objections are frequently in the mouths of men who despise the foolishness of preaching but let us examine the reasonableness of them  the doctrine delivered by all preachers is the same so we preach and so ye believe but the manner of delivering is suited to the skill and abilities of each which differ in preachers just as in the rest of mankind however in personal dislikes of a particular preacher are these men sure they are always in the right do they consider how mixed a thing is every audience whose taste and judgment differ perhaps every day not only from each other but themselves and how to calculate a discourse that shall exactly suit them all is beyond the force and reach of human reason knowledge or invention wit and eloquence are shining qualities that god hath imparted in great degrees to very few nor any more to be expected in the generality of any rank among men than riches and honour but further if preaching in general be all old and beaten and that they are already so well acquainted with it more shame and guilt to them who so little edify by it but these men whose ears are so delicate as not to endure a plain discourse of religion who expect a constant supply of wit and eloquence on a subject handled so many thousand times what will they say when we turn the objection upon themselves who with all the rude and profane liberty of discourse they take upon so many thousand subjects are so dull as to furnish nothing but tedious repetitions and little paltry nauseous commonplaces so vulgar so worn or so obvious as upon any other occasion but that of advancing vice would be hooted off the stage nor lastly are preachers justly blamed for neglecting human oratory to move the passions which is not the business of a christian orator whose office it is only to work upon faith and reason all other eloquence hath been a perfect cheat to stir up mens passions against truth and justice for the service of a faction to put false colours upon things and by an amusement of agreeable words make the worse reason appear to be the better this is certainly not to be allowed in christian eloquence and therefore st paul took quite the other course he came not with excellency of words or enticing speech of mens wisdom but in plain evidence of the spirit and power and perhaps it was for that reason the young man eutychus used to the grecian eloquence grew tired and fell so fast asleep  i go on thirdly to set forth the great evil of this neglect and scorn of preaching and to discover the real causes from whence it proceedeth  i think it is obvious1 that this neglect of preaching hath very much occasioned the great decay of religion among us to this may be imputed no small part of that contempt some men bestow on the clergy for whoever talketh without being regarded is sure to be despised to this we owe in a great measure the spreading of atheism and infidelity among us for religion like all other things is soonest put out of countenance by being ridiculed the scorn of preaching might perhaps have been at first introduced by men of nice ears and refined taste but it is now become a spreading evil through all degrees and both sexes for since sleeping talking and laughing are qualities sufficient to furnish out a critic the meanest and most ignorant have set up a title and succeeded in it as well as their betters thus are the last efforts of reforming mankind rendered wholly useless how shall they hear saith the apostle without a preacher but if they have a preacher and make it a point of wit or breeding not to hear him what remedy is left to this neglect of preaching we may also entirely impute that gross ignorance among us in the very principles of religion which it is amazing to find in persons who very much value their own knowledge and understanding in other things yet it is a visible inexcusable ignorance even in the meanest among us considering the many advantages they have of learning their duty and it hath been the great encouragement to all manner of vice for in vain we preach down sin to a people whose hearts are waxed gross whose ears are dull of hearing and whose eyes are closed therefore christ himself in his discourses frequently rouseth up the attention of the multitude and of his disciples themselves with this expression he that hath ears to hear let him hear but among all neglects of preaching none is so fatal as that of sleeping in the house of god a scorner may listen to truth and reason and in time grow serious an unbeliever may feel the pangs of a guilty conscience one whose thoughts or eyes wander among other objects may by a lucky word be called back to attention but the sleeper shuts up all avenues to his soul he is like the deaf adder that hearkeneth not to the voice of the charmer charm he never so wisely and we may preach with as good success to the grave that is under his feet  footnote 1 hawkesworth swifts works vol xiii 1762 inserts here to believe ts  but the great evil of this neglect will further yet appear from considering the real causes whence it proceedeth whereof the first i take to be an evil conscience many men come to church to save or gain a reputation or because they will not be singular but comply with an established custom yet all the while they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins these men can expect to hear of nothing but terrors and threatenings their sins laid open in true colours and eternal misery the reward of them therefore no wonder they stop their ears and divert their thoughts and seek any amusement rather than stir the hell within them  another cause of this neglect is a heart set upon worldly things men whose minds are much enslaved to earthly affairs all the week cannot disengage or break the chain of their thoughts so suddenly as to apply to a discourse that is wholly foreign to what they have most at heart tell a usurer of charity and mercy and restitution you talk to the deaf his heart and soul with all his senses are got among his bags or he is gravely asleep and dreaming of a mortgage tell a man of business that the cares of the world choke the good seed that we must not encumber ourselves with much serving that the salvation of his soul is the one thing necessary you see indeed the shape of a man before you but his faculties are all gone off among clients and papers thinking how to defend a bad cause or find flaws in a good one or he weareth out the time in drowsy nods  a third cause of the great neglect and scorn of preaching ariseth from the practice of men who set up to decry and disparage religion these being zealous to promote infidelity and vice learn a rote of buffoonery that serveth all occasions and refutes the strongest arguments for piety and good manners these have a set of ridicule calculated for all sermons and all preachers and can be extreme witty as often as they please upon the same fund  let me now in the last place offer some remedies against this great evil  it will be one remedy against the contempt of preaching rightly to consider the end for which it was designed there are many who place abundance of merit in going to church although it be with no other prospect but that of being well entertained wherein if they happen to fail they return wholly disappointed hence it is become an impertinent vein among people of all sorts to hunt after what they call a good sermon as if it were a matter of pastime and diversion our business alas is quite another thing either to learn or at least be reminded of our duty to apply the doctrines delivered compare the rules we hear with our lives and actions and find wherein we have transgressed these are the dispositions men should bring into the house of god and then they will be little concerned about the preachers wit or eloquence nor be curious to enquire out his faults and infirmities but consider how to correct their own  another remedy against the contempt of preaching is that men would consider whether it be not reasonable to give more allowances for the different abilities of preachers than they usually do refinements of style and flights of wit as they are not properly the business of any preacher so they cannot possibly be the talents of all in most other discourses men are satisfied with sober sense and plain reason and as understandings usually go even that is not over frequent then why they should be so over nice in expectation of eloquence2 where it is neither necessary nor convenient is hard to imagine  footnote 2 hawkesworth 1762 edit has over nice and expecting for sense but both the 4to and the 8vo of 1764 agree with scott as above ts  lastly the scorners of preaching would do well to consider that this talent of ridicule they value so much is a perfection very easily acquired and applied to all things whatsoever neither is anything at all the worse because it is capable of being perverted to burlesque perhaps it may be the more perfect upon that score since we know the most celebrated pieces have been thus treated with greatest success it is in any mans power to suppose a fools cap on the wisest head and then laugh at his own supposition i think there are not many things cheaper than supposing and laughing and if the uniting these two talents can bring a thing into contempt it is hard to know where it may end  to conclude these considerations may perhaps have some effect while men are awake but what arguments shall we use to the sleeper what methods shall we take to hold open his eyes will he be moved by considerations of common civility we know it is reckoned a point of very bad manners to sleep in private company when perhaps the tedious impertinence of many talkers would render it at least as excusable as at the dullest sermon do they think it a small thing to watch four hours at a play where all virtue and religion are openly reviled and can they not watch one half hour to hear them defended is this to deal like a judge i mean like a good judge to listen on one side of the cause and sleep on the other i shall add but one word more that this indecent sloth is very much owing to that luxury and excess men usually practise upon this day by which half the service thereof is turned to sin men dividing the time between god and their bellies when after a gluttonous meal their senses dozed and stupefied they retire to gods house to sleep out the afternoon surely brethren these things ought not so to be  he that hath ears to hear let him hear and god give us all grace to hear and receive his holy word to the salvation of our own souls                                   appendix i   swifts remarks on dr gibbss paraphrase of the psalms   note  the following manuscript was literally copied from the

note  the above was written from the manuscript mentioned in the first page now in the hands of nicholas coyne esq being the only copy in the kingdom of ireland he having purchased the original and afterwards generously given it to his friend dr dunkin finding the doctor extremely uneasy at the disappointment the earl of chesterfield was like to meet with as he had promised the earl to attend the auction and procure it for him at any price and is now transcribed by neale molloy of dublin esqr by the favour of the said nicholas coyne his brotherinlaw and sent by him to his kinsman and dear friend charles molloy of london esqre  dublin 26th of may 1748  the epistle dedicatory to princess anne in dr gibbss volume has also been annotated chiefly by dr dunkin but as these are mostly too filthy to be published i have omitted the few notes by swift which consist merely of marginalia corrections of words and a few satirical interpolations of no great consequence i have corrected dr

nomen ferat aequus iniqui   ultra quàm satis est virtutem si petat ipsam    hor epist 1 vi 16    this proposal which has not been included in the editions of swifts works issued by scott faulkner or hawkesworth appeared originally but in a shorter form in the tatler no 220 september 4th 1710 in this form the whole of the first portion from the beginning to the paragraph commencing the church thermometer is omitted as are also the last paragraphs of the essay including the advertisement the text of the present reprint i have taken from the miscellanies vol viii 1745 pp 217229 in all modern editions of the tatler this paper is ascribed to addison but the style and the subject are so characteristic of swift that although i am not in a position to say definitely that it is by him i think it deserves a place in the form of an appendix the date of its appearance in the tatler is somewhat against swift having written it since he was at that time on his way to london and of the few contributions he sent to the tatler it is agreed by all editors that the first is the paper on the same subject as the letter to the lord high treasurer which appeared in no 230 september 28th 1710  ts   appendix ii    proposal for preventing the   further growth of popery   having with great sorrow of heart observed the increase of popery among us of late years and how ineffectual the penal laws and statutes of this realm have been for near forty years last past towards reclaiming that blind and deluded people from their errors notwithstanding the good intentions of the legislators and the pious and unwearied labours of the many learned divines of the established church who have preached to them without ceasing although hitherto without success  having also remarked in his graces speech to both houses of parliament most kind offers of his graces good offices towards obtaining such further laws as shall be thought necessary towards bringing home the said wandering sheep into the fold of the church as also a good disposition in the parliament to join in the laudable work towards which every good protestant ought to contribute at least his advice i think it a proper time to lay before the public a scheme which was writ some years since and laid by to be ready on a fit occasion  that whereas the several penal laws and statutes now in being against papists have been found ineffectual and rather tend to confirm than reclaim men from their errors as calling a man coward is a ready way to make him fight it is humbly proposed  i that the said penal laws and statutes against papists except the law of gavelkind and that which disqualifies them for places be repealed abrogated annulled destroyed and obliterated to all intents and purposes  ii that in the room of the said penal laws and statutes all ecclesiastical jurisdiction be taken from out of the hands of the clergy of the established church and the same be vested in the several popish archbishops bishops deans and archdeacons nevertheless so as such jurisdiction be exercised over persons of the popish religion only  iii that a popish priest shall be settled by law in each and every parish in ireland  iv that the said popish priest shall on taking the oath of allegiance to his majesty be entitled to a tenth part or tithe of all things tithable in ireland belonging to the papists within their respective parishes yet so as such grant of tithes to such popish priests shall not be construed in law or equity to hinder the protestant clergyman of such parish from receiving and collecting his tithes in like manner as he does at present  v that in case of detention or subtraction of tithes by any papist the parish priest do have his remedy at law in any of his majestys courts in the same manner as now practised by the clergy of the established church together with all other ecclesiastical dues and for their further discovery to vex their people at law it might not be amiss to oblige the solicitorgeneral or some other able kings counsel to give his advice or assistance to such priests gratis for which he might receive a salary out of the barrack fund military contingencies or concordatum having observed the exceedings there better paid than of the army or any other branch of the establishment and i would have no delay in payment in a matter of this importance  vi that the archbishops and bishops have power to visit the inferior clergy and to extort proxies exhibits and all other perquisites usual in popish and protestant countries  vii that the convocation having been found by long experience to be hurtful to true religion be for ever hereafter abolished among protestants  viii that in the room thereof the popish archbishops bishops priests deans archdeacons and proctors have liberty to assemble themselves in convocation and be impowered to make such canons as they shall think proper for the government of the papists in ireland  ix and that the secular arm being necessary to enforce obedience to ecclesiastical censure the sheriffs constables and other officers be commanded to execute the decrees and sentences of the said popish convocation with secrecy and dispatch or in lieu thereof they may be at liberty to erect an inquisition with proper officers of their own  x that as papists declare themselves converts to the established church all spiritual power over them shall cease  xi that as soon as any whole parish shall renounce the popish religion the priest of such parish shall for his good services have a pension of £200 per ann settled on him for life and that he be from such time exempt from preaching and praying and other duties of his function in like manner as protestant divines with equal incomes are at present  xii that each bishop so soon as his diocese shall become protestants be called my lord and have a pension of two thousand pounds per annum during life  xiii that when a whole province shall be reclaimed the archbishop shall be called his grace and have a pension of three thousand pounds per ann during life and be admitted a member of his majestys most honourable privy council  the good consequences of this scheme which will execute itself without murmurings against the government are very visible i shall mention a few of the most obvious  i the giving the priest a right to the tithe would produce lawsuits and wrangles his reverence being entituled to a certain income at all events would consider himself as a legal incumbent and behave accordingly and apply himself more to fleecing than feeding his flock his necessary attendance on the courts of justice would leave his people without a spiritual guide by which means protestant curates who have no suits about tithes would be furnished with proper opportunities for making converts which is very much wanted  ii the erecting a spiritual jurisdiction amongst them would in all probability drive as many out of that communion as a due execution of such jurisdiction hath hitherto drove from amongst ourselves  iii an inquisition would still be a further improvement and most certainly would expedite the conversion of papists  i know it may be objected to this scheme and with some shew of reason that should the popish princes abroad pursue the same methods with regard to their protestant subjects the protestant interest in europe would thereby be considerably weakened but as we have no reason to suspect popish counsels will ever produce so much moderation i think the objection ought to have but little weight  a due execution of this scheme will soon produce many converts from popery nevertheless to the end may it be known when they shall be of the true church i have ordered a large parcel of ecclesiastical or church thermometers to be made one of which is to be hung up in each parish church the description and use of which take as follows in the words of the ingenious isaac bickerstaff esq  the1 church thermometer which i am now to treat of is supposed have been invented in the reign of henry the eighth about the time when that religious prince put some to death for owning the popes supremacy and others for denying transubstantiation i do not find however any great use made of this instrument till it fell into the hand of a learned and vigilant priest or minister for he frequently wrote himself both the one and the other who was some time vicar of bray this gentleman lived in his vicarage to a good old age and after having seen several successions of his neighbouring clergy either burnt or banished departed this life with the satisfaction of having never deserted his flock and died vicar of bray as this glass was first designed to calculate the different degrees of heat in religion as it raged in popery or as it cooled and grew temperate in the reformation it was marked at several distances after the manner our ordinary thermometer is to this day viz extreme hot sultry hot very hot hot warm temperate cold just freezing frost hard frost great frost extreme cold  footnote 1 in the tatler this paragraph is preceded by the following from my own apartment sept 4having received many letters filled with compliments and acknowledgments for my late useful discovery of the political barometer i shall here communicate to the publican account of my ecclesiastical thermometer the latter giving as manifest prognostications of the changes and revolutions in church as the former does of those in state and both of them being absolutely necessary for every prudent subject who is resolved to keep what he has and get what he can ts  it is well known that torricellius2 the inventor of the common weatherglass made the experiment of a long tube which held thirtytwo foot of water and that a more modern virtuoso finding such a machine altogether unwieldly and useless and considering that thirtytwo inches of quicksilver weighed as much as so many foot of water in a tube of the same circumference invented that sizeable instrument which is now in use after this manner that i might adapt the thermometer i am now speaking of to the present constitution of our church as divided into high and low i have made some necessary variations both in the tube and the fluid it contains in the first place i ordered a tube to be cast in a planetary hour and took care to seal it hermetically when the sun was in conjunction with saturn i then took the proper precautions about the fluid which is a compound of two different liquors one of them a spirit drawn out of a strong heady wine the other a particular sort of rockwater colder than ice and clearer than crystal the spirit is of a red fiery colour and so very apt to ferment that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the water or pent up very close it will burst the vessel that holds it and fly up in a fume and smoke the water on the contrary is of such a subtile piercing cold that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the spirits it will sink almost through every thing it is put into and seems to be of the same nature as the water mentioned by quintus curtius which says the historian could be contained in nothing but in the hoof or as the oxford manuscript has it the skull of an ass the thermometer is marked according to the following figure which i set down at length not only to give my reader a clear idea of it but also to fill up my paper  footnote 2 evangelista torricelli 16081647 was assistant to galileo and is famous as the discoverer of the phenomena on which he made the barometer in 1644 he published opera geometrica ts     ignorance   persecution   wrath   zeal   church   moderation   lukewarmness   infidelity   ignorance  the reader will observe that the church is placed in the middle point of the glass between zeal and moderation the situation in which she always flourishes and in which every good englishman wishes her who is a friend to the constitution of his country however when it mounts to zeal it is not amiss and when it sinks to moderation it is still in admirable temper the worst of it is that when once it begins to rise it has still an inclination to ascend insomuch that it is apt to climb from zeal to wrath and from wrath to persecution which often ends in ignorance and very often proceeds from it in the same manner it frequently takes its progress through the lower half of the glass and when it has a tendency to fall will gradually descend from moderation to lukewarmness and from lukewarmness to infidelity which very often terminates in ignorance and always proceeds from it  it is a common observation that the ordinary thermometer will be affected by the breathing of people who are in the room where it stands and indeed it is almost incredible to conceive how the glass i am now describing will fall by the breath of the multitude crying popery or on the contrary how it will rise when the same multitude as it sometimes happens cry out in the same breath the church is in danger  as soon as i have finished this my glass and adjusted it to the abovementioned scale of religion that i might make proper experiments with it i carried it under my cloak to several coffeehouses and other places of resort about this great city at saint jamess coffeehouse the liquor stood at moderation but at wills to my extreme surprise it subsided to the very lowest mark of the glass at the grecian it mounted but just one point higher at the rainbow it still ascended two degrees childs fetched it up to zeal and other adjacent coffeehouses to wrath  it fell in the lower half of the glass as i went further into the city till at length it settled at moderation where it continued all the time i stayed about the change as also whilst i passed by the bank and here i cannot but take notice that through the whole course of my remarks i never observed my glass to rise at the same time that the stocks did  to complete the experiment i prevailed upon a friend of mine who works under me in the occult sciences to make a progress with my glass through the whole island of great britain and after his return to present me with a register of his observations i guessed beforehand at the temper of several places he passed through by the characters they have had time out of mind thus that facetious divine dr fuller3 speaking of the town of banbury near a hundred years ago tells us it was a place famous for cakes and zeal which i find by my glass is true to this day as to the latter part of his description though i must confess it is not in the same reputation for cakes that it was in the time of that learned author and thus of other places in short i have now by me digested in an alphabetical order all the counties corporations and boroughs in great britain with their respective tempers as they stand related to my thermometer but this i shall keep to myself because i would by no means do any thing that may seem to influence any ensuing election  footnote 3 thomas fuller dd 16081661 was the author of history of the worthies of england history of the holy war and many other works distinguished for their humour and style ts  the point of doctrine which i would propagate by this my invention is the same which was long ago advanced by that able teacher horace out of whom i have taken my text for this discourse we should be careful not to overshoot ourselves in the pursuits even of virtue whether zeal or moderation be the point we aim at let us keep fire out of the one and frost out of the other but alas the world is too wise to want such a precaution the terms highchurch and lowchurch as commonly used do not so much denote a principle as they distinguish a party they are like words of battle they have nothing to do with their original signification but are only given out to keep a body of men together and to let them know friends from enemies  i must confess i have considered with some attention the influence which the opinions of these great national sects have upon their practice and do look upon it as one of the unaccountable things of our times that multitudes of honest gentlemen who entirely agree in their lives should take it in their heads to differ in their religion4  footnote 4 here the tatler paper ends ts  i shall conclude this paper with an account of a conference which happened between a very excellent divine whose doctrine was easy and formerly much respected and a lawyer                                       and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life  he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou  and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself  and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live  but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour  and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead  and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side  and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side  but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him  and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him  and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee  which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves  and he said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise luke x 25 to 38                                       advertisement  there is now in the press a proposal for raising a fund towards paying the national debt by the following means the author would have commissioners appointed to search all the public and private libraries booksellers shops and warehouses in this kingdom for such books as are of no use to the owner or to the public viz all comments on the holy scriptures whether called sermons creeds bodies of divinity tomes of casuistry vindications confutations essays answers replies rejoinders or surrejoinders together with all other learned treatises and books of divinity of what denomination or class soever as also all comments on the laws of the land such as reports lawcases decrees guides for attorneys and young clerks and in fine all the books now in being in this kingdom whether of divinity law physic metaphysics logics or politics except the pure text of the holy scriptures the naked text of the laws a few books of morality poetry music architecture agriculture mathematics merchandise and history the author would have the aforesaid useless books carried to the several papermills there to be wrought into white paper which to prevent damage or complaints he would have performed by the commentators critics popular preachers apothecaries learned lawyers attorneys solicitors logicians physicians almanacmakers and others of the like wrong turn of mind the said paper to be sold and the produce applied to discharge the national debt what should remain of the said debt unsatisfied might be paid

bettesworth   the rencontre with serjeant bettesworth to which reference has already been made in the note prefixed to the presbyterians plea of merit is further illustrated by the resolution which the inhabitants of the liberty of st patricks passed and which they presented to the dean bettesworth as a note in the thirteenth volume of swifts works 1762 states engaged his footman and two ruffians to attend him in order to secure the dean wherever they met him until he had gratified his resentment either by maiming or stabbing him accordingly he went directly to the deanery and hearing the dean was at a friends house rev mr john worralls in big ship street followed him thither charged him with writing the said verses but had not courage enough to put his bloody design in execution however as he had the assurance to relate this affair to several noblemen and gentlemen the inhabitants of the liberty of st patricks waited upon the dean and presented the following paper signed by above thirty of them in the name of themselves and the rest of their neighbourhood  we the inhabitants of the liberty of the dean and chapter of st patricks dublin and the neighbourhood of the same having been informed by universal report that a certain man of this city hath openly threatened and sworn before many hundred people as well persons of quality as others that he resolves upon the first opportunity by the help of several ruffians to murder or maim the reverend the dean of st patrick our neighbour benefactor and the head of the liberty of st patrick upon a frivolous unproved suspicion of the said deans having written some lines in verse reflecting on the said man  therefore we the said inhabitants of the said liberty and in the neighbourhood thereof from our great love and respect to the said dean to whom the whole kingdom hath so many obligations as well as we of the liberty do unanimously declare that we will endeavour to defend the life and limbs of the said dean against the said man and all his ruffians and murderers as far as the law will allow if he or any of them presume to come into the said liberty with any wicked malicious intent against the house or family or person or goods of the said dean to which we have cheerfully sincerely and heartily set our hands  swift at the time of receiving this resolution lay very ill in bed and was unable to receive the deputation in person he however dictated the following reply  gentlemen  i receive with great thankfulness these many kind expressions of your concern for my safety as well as your declared resolution to defend me as far as the laws of god and man will allow against all murderers and ruffians who shall attempt to enter into the liberty with any bloody or wicked designs upon my life my limbs my house or my goods gentlemen my life is in the hand of god and whether it may be cut off by treachery or open violence or by the common way of other men as long as it continueth i shall ever bear a grateful memory for this favour you have shewn beyond my expectation and almost exceeding my wishes  the inhabitants of the liberty as well as those of the neighbourhood have lived with me in great amity for near twenty years which i am confident will never diminish during my life i am chiefly sorry that by two cruel disorders of deafness and giddiness which have pursued me for four months i am not in condition either to hear or to receive you much less to return my most sincere acknowledgements which in justice and gratitude i ought to do may god bless you and your families

misfortune that since your graces return to this kingdom i have not been able to attend you as my duty and gratitude for your favours as well as the honour of having been so many years known to you obliged me to do i have been pursued by two old disorders a giddiness and deafness which used to leave me in three or four weeks but now have continued four months thus i am put under a necessity to write what i would rather have chosen to say in your graces presence  on monday last week towards evening there came to the deanery one mr bettesworth who being told by the servants that i was gone to a friends house1 went thither to inquire for me and was admitted into the street parlour i left my company in the back room and went to him he began with asking me whether i were the author of certain verses wherein he was reflected on the singularity of the man in his countenance manner action style and tone of voice made me call to mind that i had once seen him about two or three years ago at mr ludlows countryhouse but i could not recollect his name and of what calling he might be i had never heard i therefore desired to know who and what he was said i had heard of some such verses but knew no more he then signified to me that he was a serjeantatlaw and a member of parliament after which he repeated the lines that concerned him with great emphasis said i was mistaken in one thing for he assured me he was no booby but owned himself to be a coxcomb however that being a point of controversy wherein i had no concern i let it drop as to the verses he insisted that by his taste and skill in poetry he was as sure i wrote them as if he had seen them fall from my pen but i found the chief weight of his argument lay upon two words that rhymed to his name which he knew could come from none but me he then told me that since i would not own the verses and that since he could not get satisfaction by any course of law he would get it by his pen and show the world what a man i was when he began to grow overwarm and eloquent i called in the gentleman of the house from the room adjoining and the serjeant going on with less turbulence went away he had a footman in the hall during all his talk who was to have opened the door for one or more fellows as he has since reported and likewise that he had a sharp knife in his pocket ready to stab or maim me but the master and mistress of the house who knew his character and could hear every word from the room they were in had prepared a sufficient defence in such a case as they afterward told me he has since related to five hundred persons of all ranks about five hundred falsehoods of this conversation of my fears and his own brutalities against all probability as well as fact and some of them as i have been assured even in the presence of your grace his meanings and his movements were indeed peevish enough but his words were not he threatened me with nothing but his pen yet owned he had no pretence to wit and indeed i am heartily glad for his own sake that he proceeded no farther for the least uproar would have called his nearest neighbours first to my assistance and next to the manifest danger of his life and i would not willingly have even a dog killed upon my account ever since he has amused himself with declaring in all companies especially before bishops and lords and members of parliament his resolutions for vengeance and the several manners by which he will put it in execution  footnote 1 the rev mr worralls ts  it is only to the advice of some judicious friends that your grace owes the trouble of this letter for though i may be dispirited enough by sickness and years yet i have little reason to apprehend any danger from that man and those who seem to have most regard for my safety are no more apprehensive than myself especially such as best know his character for his very enemies and even his ridiculers who are of the two by far the greater number allow him to be a peaceable man in all things except his words his rhetorical actions his looks and his hatred to the clergy which however are all known by abundance of experience to be perfectly harmless and particularly as to the clergy i do not doubt but if he will be so good to continue steadfast in his principles and practices he may at proper junctures contribute very much to the honour and interests of that reverend body as well as employ and improve the wit of many young gentlemen in the city the university and the rest of the kingdom  what i have said to your grace is only meant as a poor endeavour to preserve myself in your good opinion and in the continuance of your favour i am with the highest respect etc  jonathan swift       appendix iv    a true and faithful narrative of what   passed in london during the general   consternation of all ranks and   degrees of mankind    on tuesday wednesday thursday and   friday last     note  william whiston 16671752 born at norton leicestershire was educated at tamworth school and clare college cambridge he resigned the living at lowestoft presented to him by his patron and friend bishop moore of norwich on accepting the professorship of mathematics vacated by sir isaac newton he was a profound scholar and mathematician but obtained a somewhat harassing fame by his propagation of arianism indeed his public lectures and sermons as well as his publications vindicating his attitude forced the authorities to deprive him of his lectureship and expel him from the university in 1717 whiston founded a society for promoting primitive christianity and its meetings were held at his house in cross street hatton garden but the society lived only for two years in that curious medley memoirs of the life of mr william whiston by himself we are told that he had a model made of the original tabernacle of moses from his own plans and toured the country giving lectures on the coming of the messiah the restoration of the jews to their own country and the rebuilding of the temple according to the model the millennium he foretold would commence in 1766  he wrote a prodigious number of tracts pamphlets commentaries and biblical expositions in support of his particular view of christianity but the works for which he is now remembered are his astronomical and mechanical papers and his wellknown translation of josephuss history of the jews  the pamphlet which follows is written in ridicule of whistons prophetic pronouncements scott ascribes its authorship to swift but the miscellanies of 1747 and hawkesworth in the edition of 1766 of swifts works place it in the list of contents with other pieces under the heading by mr pope and mr gay  the present text is practically that given by scott which is based on that in the third edition of the miscellanies of 1732  ts     a true and faithful   narrative    of    what passed in london during the general consternation   of all ranks and degrees of mankind    on tuesday wednesday thursday and   friday last   on tuesday the 13th of october mr whiston held his lecture near the royal exchange to an audience of fourteen worthy citizens his subscribers and constant hearers besides these there were five chance auditors for that night only who had paid their shillings apiece i think myself obliged to be very particular in this relation lest my veracity should be suspected which makes me appeal to the men who were present of which number i myself was one their names are    henry watson haberdasher   george hancock druggist   john lewis drysalter   william jones cornchandler   henry

contrary to his advertisement he thought himself in duty and conscience obliged to change the subject matter of his intended discourse here he paused and seemed for a short space as it were lost in devotion and mental prayer after which with great earnestness and vehemence he spake as follows  friends and fellowcitizens all speculative science is at an end the period of all things is at hand on friday next this world shall be no more put not your confidence in me brethren for tomorrow morning five minutes after five the truth will be evident in that instant the comet shall appear of which i have heretofore warned you as ye have heard believe go hence and prepare your wives your families and friends for the universal change  at this solemn and dreadful prediction the whole society appeared in the utmost astonishment but it would be unjust not to remember that mr whiston himself was in so calm a temper as to return a shilling apiece to the youths who had been disappointed of their lecture which i thought from a man of his integrity a convincing proof of his own faith in the prediction  as we thought it a duty in charity to warn all men in two or three hours the news had spread through the city at first indeed our report met with but little credit it being by our greatest dealers in stocks thought only a court artifice to sink them that some choice favourites might purchase at a lower rate for the south sea that very evening fell five per cent the india eleven and all the other funds in proportion but at the court end of the town our attestations were entirely disbelieved or turned into ridicule yet nevertheless the news spread everywhere and was the subject matter of all conversation  that very night as i was credibly informed mr whiston was sent for to a great lady who is very curious in the learned sciences and addicted to all the speculative doubts of the most able philosophers but he was not now to be found and since at other times he has been known not to decline that honour i make no doubt he concealed himself to attend the great business of his soul but whether it was the ladys faith or inquisitiveness that occasioned her to send is a point i shall not presume to determine as for his being sent for to the secretarys office by a messenger it is now known to be a matter notoriously false and indeed at first it had little credit with me that so zealous and honest a man should be ordered into custody as a seditious preacher who is known to be so wellaffected to the present happy establishment  twas now i reflected with exceeding trouble and sorrow that i had disused family prayers for above five years and though it has been a custom of late entirely neglected by men of any business or station i determined within myself no longer to omit so reasonable and religious a duty i acquainted my wife with my intentions but two or three neighbours having been engaged to sup with us that night and many hours being unwarily spent at cards i was prevailed upon by her to put it off till the next day she reasoning that it would be time enough to take off the servants from their business which this practice must infallibly occasion for an hour or two every day after the comet had made its appearance  zachery bowen a quaker and my next neighbour had no sooner heard of the prophecy but he made me a visit i informed him of everything i had heard but found him quite obstinate in his unbelief for said he be comforted friend thy tidings are impossibilities for were these things to happen they must have been foreseen by some of our brethren this indeed as in all other spiritual cases with this set of people was his only reason against believing me and as he was fully persuaded that the prediction was erroneous he in a very neighbourly manner admonished me against selling my stock at the present low price which he said beyond dispute must have a rise before monday when this unreasonable consternation should be over  but on wednesday morning i believe to the exact calculation of mr whiston the comet appeared for at three minutes after five by my own watch i saw it he indeed foretold that it would be seen at five minutes after five but as the best watches may be a minute or two too slow i am apt to think his calculation just to a minute  in less than a quarter of an hour all cheapside was crowded with a vast concourse of people and notwithstanding it was so early it is thought that through all that part of the town there was not man woman or child except the sick or infirm left in their beds from my own balcony i am confident i saw several thousands in the street and counted at least seventeen who were upon their knees and seemed in actual devotion eleven of them indeed appeared to be old women of about fourscore the six others were men in advanced life but as i could guess two of them might be under seventy  it is highly probable that an event of this nature may be passed over by the greater historians of our times as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep schemes of politicians and mysteries of state for which reason i thought it might not be unacceptable to record the facts which in the space of three days came to my knowledge either as an eyewitness or from unquestionable authorities nor can i think this narrative will be entirely without its use as it may enable us to form a more just idea of our countrymen in general particularly in regard to their faith religion morals and politics  before wednesday noon the belief was universal that the day of judgment was at hand insomuch that a waterman of my acquaintance told me he counted no less than one hundred and twentythree clergymen who had been ferried over to lambeth before twelve oclock these it is said went thither to petition that a short prayer might be penned and ordered there being none in the service upon that occasion but as in things of this nature it is necessary that the council be consulted their request was not immediately complied with and this i affirm to be the true and only reason that the churches were not that morning so well attended and is in noways to be imputed to the fears and consternation of the clergy with which the freethinkers have since very unjustly reproached them  my wife and i went to church where we had not been for many years on a weekday and with a very large congregation were disappointed of the service but what will be scarce credible by the carelessness of a prentice in our absence we had a piece of fine cambric carried off by a shoplifter so little impression was yet made on the minds of those wicked women  i cannot omit the care of a particular director of the bank i hope the worthy and wealthy knight will forgive me that i endeavour to do him justice for it was unquestionably owing to sir gilbert heathcotes1 sagacity that all the fireoffices were required to have a particular eye upon the bank of england let it be recorded to his praise that in the general hurry this struck him as his nearest and tenderest concern but the next day in the evening after having taken due care of all his books bills and bonds i was informed his mind was wholly turned upon spiritual matters yet ever and anon he could not help expressing his resentment against the tories and jacobites to whom he imputed that sudden run upon the bank which happened on this occasion  footnote 1 sir gilbert heathcote had before signalized his care for the bank when in equal danger by petitioning against the lordtreasurer godolphins being removed as a measure that would destroy the public credit h  a great man whom at this time it may not be prudent to name employed all the wednesday morning to make up such an account as might appear fair in case he should be called upon to produce it on the friday but was forced to desist after having for several hours together attempted it not being able to bring himself to a resolution to trust the many hundred articles of his secret transactions upon paper  another seemed to be very melancholy which his flatterers imputed to his dread of losing his power in a day or two but i rather take it that his chief concern was the terror of being tried in a court that could not be influenced and where a majority of voices could avail him nothing it was observed too that he had but few visitors that day  this added so much to his mortification that he read through the first chapter of the book of job and wept over it bitterly in short he seemed a true penitent in everything but in charity to his neighbour no business was that day done in his countinghouse it is said too that he was advised to restitution but i never heard that he complied with it any farther than in giving halfacrown apiece to several crazed and starving creditors who attended in the outward room  three of the maids of honour sent to countermand their birthday clothes two of them burnt all their collections of novels and romances and sent to a booksellers in pallmall to buy each of them a bible and taylors holy living and dying but i must do all of them the justice to acknowledge that they shewed a very decent behaviour in the drawingroom and restrained themselves from those innocent freedoms and little levities so commonly incident to young ladies of their profession so many birthday suits were countermanded the next day that most of the tailors and mantua makers discharged all their journeymen and women a grave elderly lady of great erudition and modesty who visits these young ladies seemed to be extremely shocked by the apprehensions that she was to appear naked before the whole world and no less so that all mankind was to appear naked before her which might so much divert her thoughts as to incapacitate her to give ready and apt answers to the interrogatories that might be made her the maids of honour who had both modesty and curiosity could not imagine the sight so disagreeable as was represented nay one of them went so far as to say she perfectly longed to see it for it could not be so indecent when everybody was to be alike and they had a day or two to prepare themselves to be seen in that condition upon this reflection each of them ordered a bathingtub to be got ready that evening and a lookingglass to be set by it so much are these young ladies both by nature and custom addicted to cleanly appearance  a westcountry gentleman told me he got a churchlease filled up that morning for the same sum which had been refused for three years successively i must impute this merely to accident for i cannot imagine that any divine could take the advantage of his tenant in so unhandsome a manner or that the shortness of the life was in the least his consideration though i have heard the same worthy prelate aspersed and maligned since upon this very account  the term being so near the alarm among the lawyers was inexpressible though some of them i was told were so vain as to promise themselves some advantage in making their defence by being versed in the practice of our earthly courts it is said too that some of the chief pleaders were heard to express great satisfaction that there had been but few state trials of late years several attorneys demanded the return of fees that had been given the lawyers but it was answered the fee was undoubtedly charged to their client and that they could not connive at such injustice as to suffer it to be sunk in the attorneys pockets our sage and learned judges had great consolation insomuch as they had not pleaded at the bar for several years the barristers rejoiced in that they were not attorneys and the attorneys felt no less satisfaction that they were not pettifoggers scriveners and other meaner officers of the law  as to the army far be it from me to conceal the truth every soldiers behaviour was as undismayed and undaunted as if nothing was to happen i impute not this to their want of faith but to their martial disposition though i cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more oaths than are requisite of which there was no remarkable diminution this morning on the parade in st jamess park but possibly it was by choice and on consideration that they continued this way of expression not to intimidate the common soldiers or give occasion to suspect that even the fear of damnation could make any impression upon their superior officers a duel was fought the same morning between two colonels not occasioned as was reported because the one was put over the others head that being a point which might at such a juncture have been accommodated by the mediation of friends but as this was upon the account of a lady it was judged it could not be put off at this time above all others but demanded immediate satisfaction i am apt to believe that a young officer who desired his surgeon to defer putting him into a salivation till saturday might make this request out of some opinion he had of the truth of the prophecy for the apprehensions of any danger in the operation could not be his motive the surgeon himself having assured me that he had before undergone three severe operations of the like nature with great resignation and fortitude  there was an order issued that the chaplains of the several regiments should attend their duty but as they were dispersed about in several parts of england it was believed that most of them could not be found or so much as heard of till the great day was over  most of the considerable physicians by their outward demeanour seemed to be unbelievers but at the same time they everywhere insinuated that there might be a pestilential malignancy in the air occasioned by the comet which might be armed against by proper and timely medicines this caution had but little effect for as the time approached the christian resignation of the people increased and most of them which was never before known had their souls more at heart than their bodies  if the reverend clergy shewed more concern than others i charitably impute it to their great charge of souls and what confirmed me in this opinion was that the degrees of apprehension and terror could be distinguished to be greater or less according to their ranks and degrees in the church  the like might be observed in all sorts of ministers though not of the church of england the higher their rank the more was their fear  i speak not of the court for fear of offence and i forbear inserting the names of particular persons to avoid the imputation of slander so that the reader will allow the narrative must be deficient and is therefore desired to accept hereof rather as a sketch than a regular circumstantial history  i was not informed of any persons who shewed the least joy except three malefactors who were to be executed on the monday following and one old man a constant churchgoer who being at the point of death expressed some satisfaction at the news  on thursday morning there was little or nothing transacted in changealley there were a multitude of sellers but so few buyers that one cannot affirm the stocks bore any certain price except among the jews who this day reaped great profit by their infidelity there were many who called themselves christians who offered to buy for time but as these were people of great distinction i choose not to mention them because in effect it would seem to accuse them both of avarice and infidelity  the run upon the bank is too well known to need a particular relation for it never can be forgotten that no one person whatever except the directors themselves and some of their particular friends and associates could convert a bill all that day into specie all hands being employed to serve them  in the several churches of the city and suburbs there were seven thousand two hundred and fortyfive who publicly and solemnly declared before the congregation that they took to wife their several keptmistresses which was allowed as valid marriage the priest not having time to pronounce the ceremony in form  at st brides church in fleetstreet mr woolston2 who writ against the miracles of our saviour in the utmost terrors of conscience made a public recantation dr mandeville3 who had been groundlessly reported formerly to have done the same did it now in good earnest at st jamess gate as did also at the temple church several gentlemen who frequent coffeehouses near the bar so great was the faith and fear of two of them that they dropped dead on the spot but i will not record their names lest i should be thought invidiously to lay an odium on their families and posterity  footnote 2 thomas woolston 16691733 a deistical writer born at northampton became a fellow of sidney college cambridge for his work six discourses on the miracles of christ he was sentenced to imprisonment for one year and fined one hundred pounds ts  footnote 3  bernard de mandeville md author of the fable of the bees a deistical work the scope of which was to prove that private vices are public benefits the work was attacked by bishop berkeley in his alciphron de mandeville was born in holland about 1670 but came over to england and settled there about the middle of the eighteenth century he also wrote the virgin unmasked the grumbling hive and free thoughts on religion he died in 1733 ts  most of the players who had very little faith before were now desirous of having as much as they could and therefore embraced the roman catholic religion the same thing was observed of some bawds and ladies of pleasure  an irish gentleman out of pure friendship came to make me a visit and advised me to hire a boat for the ensuing day and told me that unless i gave earnest for one immediately he feared it might be too late for his countrymen had secured almost every boat upon the river as judging that in the general conflagration to be upon the water would be the safest place  there were two lords and three commoners who out of scruple of conscience very hastily threw up their pensions as imagining a pension was only an annual retaining bribe all the other great pensioners i was told had their scruples quieted by a clergyman or two of distinction whom they happily consulted  it was remarkable that several of our very richest tradesmen of the city in common charity gave away shillings and sixpences to the beggars who plied about the church doors and at a particular church in the city a wealthy churchwarden with his own hands distributed fifty twelvepenny loaves to the poor by way of restitution for the many great and costly feasts which he had eaten of at their expense  three great ladies a valetdechambre two lords a customhouseofficer five halfpay captains and a baronet all noted gamesters came publicly into a church at westminster and deposited a very considerable sum of money in the ministers hands the parties whom they had defrauded being either out of town or not to be found but so great is the hardness of heart of this fraternity that among either the noble or vulgar gamesters though the profession is so general i did not hear of any other restitution of this sort at the same time i must observe that in comparison of these through all parts of the town the justice and penitence of the highwaymen housebreakers and common pickpockets was very remarkable  the directors of our public companies were in such dreadful apprehensions that one would have thought a parliamentary inquiry was at hand yet so great was their presence of mind that all the thursday morning was taken up in private transfers which by malicious people was thought to be done with design to conceal their effects  i forbear mentioning the private confessions of particular ladies to their husbands for as their children were born in wedlock and of consequence are legitimate it would be an invidious task to record them as bastards and particularly after their several husbands have so charitably forgiven them  the evening and night through the whole town were spent in devotions both public and private the churches for this one day were so crowded by the nobility and gentry that thousands of common people were seen praying in the public streets in short one would have thought the whole town had been really and seriously religious but what was very remarkable all the different persuasions kept by themselves for as each thought the other would be damned not one would join in prayer with the other  at length friday came and the people covered all the streets expecting watching and praying but as the day wore away their fears first began to abate then lessened every hour at night they were almost extinct till the total darkness that hitherto used to terrify now comforted every freethinker and atheist great numbers went together to the taverns bespoke suppers and broke up whole hogsheads for joy the subject of all wit and conversation was to ridicule the prophecy and rally each other all the quality and gentry were perfectly ashamed nay some utterly disowned that they had manifested any signs of religion  but the next day even the common people as well as their betters appeared in their usual state of indifference they drank they whored they swore they lied they cheated they quarrelled they murdered in short the world went on in the old channel  i need not give any instances of what will so easily be credited but i cannot omit relating that mr woolston advertised in that very saturdays evening post a new treatise against the miracles of our saviour and that the few who had given up their pensions the day before solicited to have them continued which as they had not been thrown up upon any ministerial point i am
