preface  to the second posthumous volume1  in a letter to  the right hon william elliot   my dear siras some prefatory account of the materials which compose this second posthumous volume of the works of mr burke and of the causes which have prevented its earlier appearance will be expected from me i hope i may be indulged in the inclination i feel to run over these matters in a letter to you rather than in a formal address to the public  of the delay that has intervened since the publication of the former volume i shall first say a few words having undertaken in conjunction with the late dr laurence to examine the manuscript papers of mr burke and to select and prepare for the press such of them as should be thought proper for publication the difficulties attending our coöperation were soon experienced by us the remoteness of our places of residence in summer and our professional and other avocations in winter opposed perpetual obstacles to the progress of our undertaking  soon after the publication of the fourth volume i was rendered incapable of attending to any business by a severe and tedious illness and it was not long after my recovery before the health of our invaluable friend began gradually to decline and soon became unequal to the increasing labors of his profession and the discharge of his parliamentary duties at length we lost a man of whom as i shall have occasion to speak more particularly in another part of this undertaking i will now content myself with saying that in my humble opinion he merited and certainly obtained with those best acquainted with his extensive learning and information a considerable rank amongst the eminent persons who have adorned the age in which we have lived and of whose services the public have been deprived by a premature death  from these causes little progress had been made in our work when i was deprived of my coadjutor but from that time you can testify of me that i have not been idle you can bear witness to the confused state in which the materials that compose the present volume came into my hands the difficulty of reading many of the manuscripts obscured by innumerable erasures corrections interlineations and marginal insertions would perhaps have been insuperable to any person less conversant in the manuscripts of mr burke than myself to this difficulty succeeded that of selecting from several detached papers written upon the same subject and the same topics such as appeared to contain the authors last thoughts and emendations when these difficulties were overcome there still remained in many instances that of assigning its proper place to many detached members of the same piece where no direct note of connection had been made these circumstances whilst they will lead the reader not to expect in the cases to which they apply the finished productions of mr burke imposed upon me a task of great delicacy and difficultynamely that of deciding upon the publication of any and which of these unfinished pieces i must here beg permission of you and lord fitzwilliam to inform the public that in the execution of this part of my duty i requested and obtained your assistance  our first care was to ascertain from such evidence internal and external as the manuscripts themselves afforded what pieces appeared to have been at any time intended by the author for publication our next was to select such as though not originally intended for publication yet appeared to contain matter that might contribute to the gratification and instruction of the public our last object was to determine what degree of imperfection and incorrectness in papers of either of these classes ought or ought not to exclude them from a place in the present volume this was doubtless the most nice and arduous part of our undertaking the difficulty however was in our minds greatly diminished by our conviction that the reputation of our author stood far beyond the reach of injury from any injudicious conduct of ours in making this selection on the other hand we were desirous that nothing should be withheld from which the public might derive any possible benefit  nothing more is now necessary than that i should give a short account of the writings which compose the present volume   i fourth letter on a regicide peace  some account has already been given of this letter in the advertisement to the fourth quarto volume2 that part of it which is contained between the first and the middle of the page 673 is taken from a manuscript which nearly to the conclusion had received the authors last corrections the subsequent part to the middle of the page 714 is taken from some loose manuscripts that were dictated by the author but do not appear to have been revised by him and though they as well as what follows to the conclusion were evidently designed to make a part of this letter the editor alone is responsible for the order in which they are here placed the last part from the middle of the page 71 had been printed as a part of the letter which was originally intended to be the third on regicide peace as in the preface to the fourth volume has already been noticed  it was thought proper to communicate this letter before its publication to lord auckland the author of the pamphlet so frequently alluded to in it his lordship in consequence of this communication was pleased to put into my hands a letter with which he had sent his pamphlet to mr burke at the time of its publication and mr burkes answer to that letter these pieces together with the note with which his lordship transmitted them to me are prefixed to the letter on regicide peace  ii letter to the empress of russia iii letter to sir charles bingham iv letter to the honorable charles james fox  of these letters it will be sufficient to remark that they come under the second of those classes into which as i before observed we divided the papers that presented themselves to our consideration  v letter to the marquis of rockingham vi an address to the king vii an address to the british colonists in north america  these pieces relate to a most important period in the present reign and i hope no apology will be necessary for giving them to the public  viii letter to the right honorable edmund sexton pery ix letter to thomas burgh esq x letter to john merlott esq  the reader will find in a note annexed to each of these letters an account of the occasions on which they were written the letter to t burgh esq had found its way into some of the periodical prints of the time in dublin  xi reflections on the approaching executions  it may not perhaps now be generally known that mr burke was a marked object of the rioters in this disgraceful commotion from whose fury he narrowly escaped the reflections will be found to contain maxims of the soundest judicial policy and do equal honor to the head and heart of their illustrious writer  xii letter to the right honorable henry dundas with the sketch of a negro code  mr burke in the letter to mr dundas has entered fully into his own views of the slave trade and has thereby rendered any further explanation on that subject at present unnecessary with respect to the code itself an unsuccessful attempt was made to procure the copy of it transmitted to mr dundas it was not to be found amongst his papers the editor has therefore been obliged to have recourse to a rough draft of it in mr burkes own handwriting from which he hopes he has succeeded in making a pretty correct transcript of it as well as in the attempt he has made to supply the marginal references alluded to in mr burkes letter to mr dundas  xiii letter to the chairman of the buckinghamshire meeting  of the occasion of this letter an account is given in the note subjoined prefixed to it  xiv tracts and letters relative to the laws against popery in ireland  these pieces consist of  1 an unfinished tract on the popery laws of this tract the reader will find an account in the note prefixed to it  2 a letter to william smith esq several copies of this letter having got abroad it was printed and published in dublin without the permission of mr burke or of the gentleman to whom it was addressed  3 second letter to sir hercules langrishe this may be considered as supplementary to the first letter addressed to the same person in january 1792 which was published in the third volume5  4 letter to richard burke esq of this letter it will be necessary to observe that the first part of it appears to have been originally addressed by mr burke to his son in the manner in which it is now printed but to have been left unfinished after whose death he probably designed to have given the substance of it with additional observations to the public in some other form but never found leisure or inclination to finish it  5 a letter on the affairs of ireland written in the year 1797 the name of the person to whom this letter was addressed does not appear on the manuscript nor has the letter been found to which it was written as an answer and as the gentleman whom he employed as an amanuensis is not now living no discovery of it can be made unless this publication of the letter should produce some information respecting it that may enable us in a future volume to gratify on this point the curiosity of the reader the letter was dictated as he himself tells us from his couch at bath to which place he had gone by the advice of his physicians in march 1797 his health was now rapidly declining the vigor of his mind remained unimpaired this my dear friend was i believe the last letter dictated by him on public affairshere ended his political labors  xv fragments and notes of speeches in parliament  1 speech on the acts of uniformity  2 speech on a bill for the relief of protestant dissenters  3 speech on the petition of the unitarians  4 speech on the middlesex election  5 speech on a bill for shortening the duration of parliaments  6 speech on the reform of the representation in parliament  7 speech on a bill for explaining the powers of juries in prosecutions for libels  7 letter relative to the same subject  8 speech on a bill for repealing the marriage act  9 speech on a bill to quiet the possessions of the subject against dormant claims of the church  with respect to these fragments i have already stated the reasons by which we were influenced in our determination to publish them an account of the state in which these manuscripts were found is given in the note prefixed to this article  xvi hints for an essay on the drama  this fragment was perused in manuscript by a learned and judicious critic our late lamented friend mr malone and under the protection of his opinion we can feel no hesitation in submitting it to the judgment of the public  xvii we are now come to the concluding article of this volumethe essay on the history of england  at what time of the authors life it was written cannot now be exactly ascertained but it was certainly begun before he had attained the age of twentyseven years as it appears from an entry in the books of the late mr dodsley that eight sheets of it which contain the first seventyfour pages of the present edition6 were printed in the year 1757 this is the only part that has received the finishing stroke of the author in those who are acquainted with the manner in which mr burke usually composed his graver literary works and of which some account is given in the advertisement prefixed to the fourth volume this circumstance will excite a deep regret and whilst the public partakes with us in this feeling it will doubtless be led to judge with candor and indulgence of a work left in this imperfect and unfinished state by its author  before i conclude it may not be improper to take this opportunity of acquainting the public with the progress that has been made towards the completion of this undertaking the sixth and seventh volumes which will consist entirely of papers that have a relation to the affairs of the east india company and to the impeachment of mr hastings are now in the press the suspension of the consideration of the affairs of the east india company in parliament till its nest session has made me very desirous to get the sixth volume out as early as possible in the next winter the ninth and eleventh reports of the select committee appointed to take into consideration certain affairs of the east india company in the year 1783 were written by mr burke and will be given in that volume they contain a full and comprehensive view of the commerce revenues civil establishment and general policy of the company and will therefore be peculiarly interesting at this time to the public  the eighth and last volume will contain a narrative of the life of mr burke which will be accompanied with such parts of his familiar correspondence and other occasional productions as shall be thought fit for publication7 the materials relating to the early years of his life alluded to in the advertisement to the fourth volume have been lately recovered and the communication of such as may still remain in the possession of any private individuals is again most earnestly requested  unequal as i feel myself to the task i shall my dear friend lose no time nor spare any pains in discharging the arduous duty that has devolved upon me you know the peculiar difficulties i labor under from the failure of my eyesight and you may congratulate me upon the assistance which i have now procured from my neighbor the worthy chaplain8 of bromley college who to the useful qualification of a most patient amanuensis adds that of a good scholar and intelligent critic  and now adieu my dear

the right honorable the lord auckland to the lord bishop of rochester  eden farm kent july 18th 1812  my dear lordmr burkes fourth letter to lord fitzwilliam is personally interesting to me i have perused it with a respectful attention  when i communicated to mr burke in 1795 the printed work which he arraigns and discusses i was aware that he would differ from me  some light is thrown on the transaction by my note which gave rise to it and by his answer which exhibits the admirable powers of his great and good mind deeply suffering at the time under a domestic calamity  i have selected these two papers from my manuscript collection and now transmit them to your lordship with a wish that they may be annexed to the publication in question  i have the honor to be my dear lord  yours most sincerely  auckland  to the right rev the lord bishop of rochester                                       letter from lord auckland to the right honorable edmund burke   eden farm kent october 28th 1795  my dear sir  though in the stormy ocean of the last twentythree years we have seldom sailed on the same tack there has been nothing hostile in our signals or manoeuvres and on my part at least there has been a cordial disposition towards friendly and respectful sentiments under that influence i now send to you a small work which exhibits my fair and full opinions on the arduous circumstances of the moment as far as the cautions necessary to be observed will permit me to go beyond general ideas  three or four of those friends with whom i am most connected in public and private life are pleased to think that the statement in question which at first made part of a confidential paper may do good and accordingly a very large impression will be published today i neither seek to avow the publication nor do i wish to disavow it i have no anxiety in that respect but to contribute my mite to do service at a moment when service is much wanted  i am my dear sir  most sincerely yours  auckland  right hon edmund burke                                       letter from the right honorable edmund burke to lord auckland  my dear lord  i am perfectly sensible of the very flattering honor you have done me in turning any part of your attention towards a dejected old man buried in the anticipated grave of a feeble old age forgetting and forgotten in an obscure and melancholy retreat  in this retreat i have nothing relative to this world to do but to study all the tranquillity that in the state of my mind i am capable of to that end i find it but too necessary to call to my aid an oblivion of most of the circumstances pleasant and unpleasant of my lifeto think as little and indeed to know as little as i can of everything that is doing about meand above all to divert my mind from all presagings and prognostications of what i must if i let my speculations loose consider as of absolute necessity to happen after my death and possibly even before it your address to the public which you have been so good as to send to me obliges me to break in upon that plan and to look a little on what is behind and very much on what is before me it creates in my mind a variety of thoughts and all of them unpleasant  it is true my lord what you say that through our public life we have generally sailed on somewhat different tacks we have so undoubtedly and we should do so still if i had continued longer to keep the sea in that difference you rightly observe that i have always done justice to your skill and ability as a navigator and to your good intentions towards the safety of the cargo and of the ships company i cannot say now that we are on different tacks there would be no propriety in the metaphor i can sail no longer my vessel cannot be said to be even in port she is wholly condemned and broken up to have an idea of that vessel you must call to mind what you have often seen on the kentish road those planks of tough and hardy oak that used for years to brave the buffets of the bay of biscay are now turned with their warped grain and empty trunnionholes into very wretched pales for the inclosure of a wretched farmyard  the style of your pamphlet and the eloquence and power of composition you display in it are such as do great honor to your talents and in conveying any other sentiments would give me very great pleasure perhaps i do not very perfectly comprehend your purpose and the drift of your arguments if i do not pray do not attribute my mistake to want of candor but to want of sagacity i confess your address to the public together with other accompanying circumstances has filled me with a degree of grief and dismay which i cannot find words to express if the plan of politics there recommendedpray excuse my freedomshould be adopted by the kings councils and by the good people of this kingdom as so recommended undoubtedly it will nothing can be the consequence but utter and irretrievable ruin to the ministry to the crown to the successionto the importance to the independence to the very existence of this country this is my feeble perhaps but clear positive decided long and maturely reflected and frequently declared opinion from which all the events which have lately come to pass so far from turning me have tended to confirm beyond the power of alteration even by your eloquence and authority i find my dear lord that you think some persons who are not satisfied with the securities of a jacobin peace to be persons of intemperate minds i may be and i fear i am with you in that description but pray my lord recollect that very few of the causes which make men intemperate can operate upon me sanguine hopes vehement desires inordinate ambition implacable animosity party attachments or party interestsall these with me have no existence for myself or for a family alas i have none i have nothing to hope or to fear in this world i am attached by principle inclination and gratitude to the king and to the present ministry  perhaps you may think that my animosity to opposition is the cause of my dissent on seeing the politics of mr fox which while i was in the world i combated by every instrument which god had put into my hands and in every situation in which i had taken part so completely if i at all understand you adopted in your lordships book but it was with pain i broke with that great man forever in that cause and i assure you it is not without pain that i differ with your lordship on the same principles but it is of no concern i am far below the region of those great and tempestuous passions i feel nothing of the intemperance of mind it is rather sorrow and dejection than anger  once more my best thanks for your very polite attention and do me the favor to believe me with the most perfect sentiments of respect and regard  my dear lord  your lordships most obedient and humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield oct 30th 1795  friday evening     letter iv  to the earl fitzwilliam   my dear lordi am not sure that the best way of discussing any subject except those that concern the abstracted sciences is not somewhat in the way of dialogue to this mode however there are two objections the first that it happens as in the puppetshow one man speaks for all the personages an unnatural uniformity of tone is in a manner unavoidable the other and more serious objection is that as the author if not an absolute skeptic must have some opinion of his own to enforce he will be continually tempted to enervate the arguments he puts into the mouth of his adversary or to place them in a point of view most commodious for their refutation there is however a sort of dialogue not quite so liable to these objections because it approaches more nearly to truth and nature it is called controversy here the parties speak for themselves if the writer who attacks anothers notions does not deal fairly with his adversary the diligent reader has it always in his power by resorting to the work examined to do justice to the original author and to himself for this reason you will not blame me if in my discussion of the merits of a regicide peace i do not choose to trust to my own statements but to bring forward along with them the arguments of the advocates for that measure if i choose puny adversaries writers of no estimation or authority then you will justly blame me i might as well bring in at once a fictitious speaker and thus fall into all the inconveniences of an imaginary dialogue this i shall avoid and i shall take no notice of any author who my friends in town do not tell me is in estimation with those whose opinions he supports  a piece has been sent to me called some remarks on the apparent circumstances of the war in the fourth week of october 1795 with a french motto que faire encore une fois dans une telle nuit attendre le jour the very title seemed to me striking and peculiar and to announce something uncommon in the time i have lived to i always seem to walk on enchanted ground everything is new and according to the fashionable phrase revolutionary in former days authors valued themselves upon the maturity and fulness of their deliberations accordingly they predicted perhaps with more arrogance than reason an eternal duration to their works the quite contrary is our present fashion writers value themselves now on the instability of their opinions and the transitory life of their productions on this kind of credit the modern institutors open their schools they write for youth and it is sufficient if the instruction lasts as long as a present love or as the painted silks and cottons of the season  the doctrines in this work are applied for their standard with great exactness to the shortest possible periods both of conception and duration the title is some remarks on the apparent circumstances of the war in the fourth week of october 1795 the time is critically chosen a month or so earlier would have made it the anniversary of a bloody parisian september when the french massacre one another a day or two later would have carried it into a london november the gloomy month in which it is said by a pleasant author that englishmen hang and drown themselves in truth this work has a tendency to alarm us with symptoms of public suicide however there is one comfort to be taken even from the gloomy time of year it is a rotting season if what is brought to market is not good it is not likely to keep long even buildings run up in haste with untempered mortar in that humid weather if they are illcontrived tenements do not threaten long to incumber the earth the author tells us and i believe he is the very first author that ever told such a thing to his readers that the entire fabric of his speculations might be overset by unforeseen vicissitudes and what is far more extraordinary that even the whole consideration might be varied whilst he was writing those pages truly in my poor judgment this circumstance formed a very substantial motive for his not publishing those illconsidered considerations at all he ought to have followed the good advice of his motto que faire encore dans une telle nuit attendre le jour he ought to have waited till he had got a little more daylight on this subject night itself is hardly darker than the fogs of that time  finding the last week in october so particularly referred to and not perceiving any particular event relative to the war which happened on any of the days in that week i thought it possible that they were marked by some astrological superstition to which the greatest politicians have been subject i therefore had recourse to my riders almanack there i found indeed something that characterized the work and that gave directions concerning the sudden political and natural variations and for eschewing the maladies that are most prevalent in that aguish intermittent season the last week of october on that week the sagacious astrologer rider in his note on the third column of the calendar side teaches us to expect variable and cold weather but instead of encouraging us to trust ourselves to the haze and mist and doubtful lights of that changeable week on the answerable part of the opposite page he gives us a salutary caution indeed it is very nearly in the words of the authors motto avoid says he being out late at night and in foggy weather for a cold now caught may last the whole winter9 this ingenious author who disdained the prudence of the almanack walked out in the very fog he complains of and has led us to a very unseasonable airing at that time whilst this noble writer by the vigor of an excellent constitution formed for the violent changes he prognosticates may shake off the importunate rheum and malignant influenza of this disagreeable week a whole parliament may go on spitting and snivelling and wheezing and coughing during a whole session all this from listening to variable hebdomadal politicians who run away from their opinions without giving us a months warningand for not listening to the wise and friendly admonitions of dr cardanus rider who never apprehends he may change his opinions before his pen is out of his hand but always enables us to lay in at least a years stock of useful information  at first i took comfort i said to myself that if i should as i fear i must oppose the doctrines of the last week of october it is probable that by this time they are no longer those of the eminent writer to whom they are attributed he gives us hopes that long before this he may have embraced the direct contrary sentiments if i am found in a conflict with those of the last week of october i may be in full agreement with those of the last week in december or the first week in january 1796 but a second edition and a french translation for the benefit i must suppose of the new regicide directory have let down a little of these flattering hopes we and the directory know that the author whatever changes his works seemed made to indicate like a weathercock grown rusty remains just where he was in the last week of last october it is true that his protest against binding him to his opinions and his reservation of a right to whatever opinions he pleases remain in their full force this variability is pleasant and shows a fertility of fancy      qualis in æthereo felix vertumnus olympo     mille habet ornatus mille decenter habet  yet doing all justice to the sportive variability of these weekly daily or hourly speculators shall i be pardoned if i attempt a word on the part of us simple country folk it is not good for us however it may be so for great statesmen that we should be treated with variable politics i consider different relations as prescribing a different conduct i allow that in transactions with an enemy a minister may and often must vary his demands with the day possibly with the hour with an enemy a fixed plan variable arrangements this is the rule the nature of the transaction prescribes but all this belongs to treaty all these shiftings and changes are a sort of secret amongst the parties till a definite settlement is brought about such is the spirit of the proceedings in the doubtful and transitory state of things between enmity and friendship in this change the subjects of the transformation are by nature carefully wrapt up in their cocoons the gay ornament of summer is not seemly in his aurelia state this mutability is allowed to a foreign negotiator but when a great politician condescends publicly to instruct his own countrymen on a matter which may fix their fate forever his opinions ought not to be diurnal or even weekly these ephemerides of politics are not made for our slow and coarse understandings our appetite demands a piece of resistance we require some food that will stick to the ribs we call for sentiments to which we can attach ourselvessentiments in which we can take an interestsentiments on which we can warm on which we can ground some confidence in ourselves or in others we do not want a largess of inconstancy poor souls we have enough of that sort of poverty at home there is a difference too between deliberation and doctrine a man ought to be decided in his opinions before he attempts to teach his fugitive lights may serve himself in some unknown region but they cannot free us from the effects of the error into which we have been betrayed his active willothewisp may be gone nobody can guess where whilst he leaves us bemired and benighted in the bog  having premised these few reflections upon this new mode of teaching a lesson which whilst the scholar is getting by heart the master forgets i come to the lesson itself on the fullest consideration of it i am utterly incapable of saying with any great certainty what it is in the detail that the author means to affirm or deny to dissuade or recommend his march is mostly oblique and his doctrine rather in the way of insinuation than of dogmatic assertion it is not only fugitive in its duration but is slippery in the extreme whilst it lasts examining it part by part it seems almost everywhere to contradict itself and the author who claims the privilege of varying his opinions has exercised this privilege in every section of his remarks for this reason amongst others i follow the advice which the able writer gives in his last page which is to consider the impression of what he has urged taken from the whole and not from detached paragraphs that caution was not absolutely necessary i should think it unfair to the author and to myself to have proceeded otherwise this authors whole however like every other whole cannot be so well comprehended without some reference to the parts but they shall be again referred to the whole without this latter attention several of the passages would certainly remain covered with an impenetrable and truly oracular obscurity  the great general pervading purpose of the whole pamphlet is to reconcile us to peace with the present usurpation in france in this general drift of the author i can hardly be mistaken the other purposes less general and subservient to the preceding scheme are to show first that the time of the remarks was the favorable time for making that peace upon our side secondly that on the enemys side their disposition towards the acceptance of such terms as he is pleased to offer was rationally to be expected the third purpose was to make some sort of disclosure of the terms which if the regicides are pleased to grant them this nation ought to be contented to accept these form the basis of the negotiation which the author whoever he is proposes to open  before i consider these remarks along with the other reasonings which i hear on the same subject i beg leave to recall to your mind the observation i made early in our correspondence and which ought to attend us quite through the discussion of this proposed peace amity or fraternity or whatever you may call itthat is the real quality and character of the party you have to deal with this i find as a thing of no importance has everywhere escaped the author of the october remarks that hostile power to the period of the fourth week in that month has been ever called and considered as an usurpation in that week for the first time it changed its name of an usurped power and took the simple name of france the word france is slipped in just as if the government stood exactly as before that revolution which has astonished terrified and almost overpowered europe france says the author will do thisit is the interest of francethe returning honor and generosity of france c calways merely france just as if we were in a common political war with an old recognized member of the commonwealth of christian europeand as if our dispute had turned upon a mere matter of territorial or commercial controversy which a peace might settle by the imposition or the taking off a duty with the gain or the loss of a remote island or a frontier town or two on the one side or the other this shifting of persons could not be done without the hocuspocus of abstraction we have been in a grievous error we thought that we had been at war with rebels against the lawful government but that we were friends and allies of what is properly france friends and allies to the legal body politic of france but by sleight of hand the jacobins are clean vanished and it is france we have got under our cup blessings on his soul that first invented sleep said don sancho panza the wise all those blessings and ten thousand times more on him who found out abstraction personification and impersonals in certain cases they are the first of all soporifics terribly alarmed we should be if things were proposed to us in the concrete and if fraternity was held out to us with the individuals who compose this france by their proper names and descriptionsif we were told that it was very proper to enter into the closest bonds of amity and good correspondence with the devout pacific and tenderhearted sieyès with the allaccomplished reubell with the humane guillotinists of bordeaux tallien and isabeau with the meek butcher legendre and with the returned humanity and generosity that had been only on a visit abroad of the virtuous regicide brewer santerre this would seem at the outset a very strange scheme of amity and concordnay though we had held out to us as an additional douceur an assurance of the cordial fraternal embrace of our pious and patriotic countryman thomas paine but plain truth would here be shocking and absurd therefore comes in abstraction and personification make your peace with france that word france sounds quite as well as any other and it conveys no idea but that of a very pleasant country and very hospitable inhabitants nothing absurd and shocking in amity and good correspondence with france permit me to say that i am not yet well acquainted with this newcoined france and without a careful assay i am not willing to receive it in currency in place of the old louisdor  having therefore slipped the persons with whom we are to treat out of view we are next to be satisfied that the french revolution which this peace is to fix and consolidate ought to give us no just cause of apprehension though the author labors this point yet he confesses a fact indeed he could not conceal it which renders all his labors utterly fruitless he confesses that the regicide means to dictate a pacification and that this pacification according to their decree passed but a very few days before his publication appeared is to unite to their empire either in possession or dependence new barriers many frontier places of strength a large seacoast and many seaports he ought to have stated it that they would annex to their territory a country about a third as large as france and much more than half as rich and in a situation the most important for command that it would be possible for her anywhere to possess  to remove this terror even if the regicides should carry their point and to give us perfect repose with regard to their empire whatever they may acquire or whomsoever they might destroy he raises a doubt whether france will not be ruined by retaining these conquests and whether she will not wholly lose that preponderance which she has held in the scale of european powers and will not eventually be destroyed by the effect of her present successes or at least whether so far as the political interests of england are concerned she france will remain an object of as much jealousy and alarm as she was under the reign of a monarch here indeed is a paragraph full of meaning it gives matter for meditation almost in every word of it the secret of the pacific politicians is out this republic at all hazards is to be maintained it is to be confined within some bounds if we can if not with every possible acquisition of power it is still to be cherished and supported it is the return of the monarchy we are to dread and therefore we ought to pray for the permanence of the regicide authority esto perpetua is the devout ejaculation of our frà paolo for the republic one and indivisible it was the monarchy that rendered france dangerous regicide neutralizes all the acrimony of that power and renders it safe and social the october speculator is of opinion that monarchy is of so poisonous a quality that a moderate territorial power is far more dangerous to its neighbors under that abominable regimen than the greatest empire in the hands of a republic this is jacobinism sublimed and exalted into most pure and perfect essence it is a doctrine i admit made to allure and captivate if anything in the world can the jacobin directory to mollify the ferocity of regicide and to persuade those patriotic hangmen after their reiterated oaths for our extirpation to admit this wellhumbled nation to the fraternal embrace i do not wonder that this tub of october has been racked off into a french cask it must make its fortune at paris that translation seems the language the most suited to these sentiments our author tells the french jacobins that the political interests of great britain are in perfect unison with the principles of their governmentthat they may take and keep the keys of the civilized world for they are safe in their unambitious and faithful custody we say to them we may indeed wish you to be a little less murderous wicked and atheistical for the sake of morals we may think it were better you were less newfangled in your speech for the sake of grammar but as politicians provided you keep clear of monarchy all our fears alarms and jealousies are at an end at least they sink into nothing in comparison of our dread of your detestable royalty a flatterer of cardinal mazarin said when that minister had just settled the match between the young louis the fourteenth and a daughter of spain that this alliance had the effect of faith and had removed mountainsthat the pyrenees were levelled by that marriage you may now compliment reubell in the same spirit on the miracles of regicide and tell him that the guillotine of louis the sixteenth had consummated a marriage between great britain and france which dried up the channel and restored the two countries to the unity which it is said they had before the unnatural rage of seas and earthquakes had broke off their happy junction it will be a fine subject for the poets who are to prophesy the blessings of this peace  i am now convinced that the remarks of the last week of october cannot come from the author to whom they are given they are such a direct contradiction to the style of manly indignation with which he spoke of those miscreants and murderers in his excellent memorial to the states of hollandto that very state which the author who presumes to personate him does not find it contrary to the political interests of england to leave in the hands of these very miscreants against whom on the part of england he took so much pains to animate their republic this cannot be and if this argument wanted anything to give it new force it is strengthened by an additional reason that is irresistible knowing that noble person as well as myself to be under very great obligations to the crown i am confident he would not so very directly contradict even in the paroxysm of his zeal against monarchy the declarations made in the name and with the fullest approbation of our sovereign his master and our common benefactor in those declarations you will see that the king instead of being sensible of greater alarm and jealousy from a neighboring crowned head than from these regicides attributes all the dangers of europe to the latter let this writer hear the description given in the royal declaration of the scheme of power of these miscreants as a system destructive of all public order maintained by proscriptions exiles and confiscations without number by arbitrary imprisonments by massacres which cannot be remembered without horror and at length by the execrable murder of a just and beneficent sovereign and of the illustrious princess who with an unshaken firmness has shared all the misfortunes of her royal consort his protracted sufferings his cruel captivity his ignominious death after thus describing with an eloquence and energy equalled only by its truth the means by which this usurped power had been acquired and maintained that government is characterized with equal force his majesty far from thinking monarchy in france to be a greater object of jealousy than the regicide usurpation calls upon the french to reestablish a monarchical government for the purpose of shaking off the yoke of a sanguinary anarchyof that anarchy which has broken all the most sacred bonds of society dissolved all the relations of civil life violated every right confounded every dutywhich uses the name of liberty to exercise the most cruel tyranny to annihilate all property to seize on all possessionswhich founds its power on the pretended consent of the people and itself carries fire and sword through extensive provinces for having demanded their laws their religion and their lawful sovereign  that strain i heard was of a higher mood that declaration of our sovereign was worthy of his throne it is in a style which neither the pen of the writer of october nor such a poor crowquill as mine can ever hope to equal i am happy to enrich my letter with this fragment of nervous and manly eloquence which if it had not emanated from the awful authority of a throne if it were not recorded amongst the most valuable monuments of history and consecrated in the archives of states would be worthy as a private composition to live forever in the memory of men  in those admirable pieces does his majesty discover this new opinion of his political security in having the chair of the scorner that is the discipline of atheism and the block of regicide set up by his side elevated on the same platform and shouldering with the vile image of their grim and bloody idol the inviolable majesty of his throne the sentiments of these declarations are the very reverse they could not be other speaking of the spirit of that usurpation the royal manifesto describes with perfect truth its internal tyranny to have been established as the very means of shaking the security of all other statesas disposing arbitrarily of the property and blood of the inhabitants of france in order to disturb the tranquillity of other nations and to render all europe the theatre of the same crimes and of the same misfortunes it was but a natural inference from this fact that the royal manifesto does not at all rest the justification of this war on common principles that it was not only to defend his own rights and those of his allies but that all the dearest interests of his people imposed upon him a duty still more importantthat of exerting his efforts for the preservation of civil society itself as happily established among the nations of europe on that ground the protection offered is to those who by declaring for a monarchical government shall shake off the yoke of a sanguinary anarchy it is for that purpose the declaration calls on them to join the standard of an hereditary monarchydeclaring that the peace and safety of this kingdom and the other powers of europe materially depend on the reëstablishment of order in france his majesty does not hesitate to declare that the reëstablishment of monarchy in the person of louis the seventeenth and the lawful heirs of the crown appears to him his majesty the best mode of accomplishing these just and salutary views  this is what his majesty does not hesitate to declare relative to the political safety and peace of his kingdom and of europe and with regard to france under her ancient hereditary monarchy in the course and order of legal succession but in comes a gentleman in the fag end of october dripping with the fogs of that humid and uncertain season and does not hesitate in diameter to contradict this wise and just royal declaration and stoutly on his part to make a counter declarationthat france so far as the political interests of england are concerned will not remain under the despotism of regicide and with the better part of europe in her hands so much an object of jealousy and alarm as she was under the reign of a monarch when i hear the master and reason on one side and the servant and his single and unsupported assertion on the other my part is taken  this is what the octobrist says of the political interests of england which it looks as if he completely disconnected with those of all other nations but not quite so he just allows it possible with an at least that the other powers may not find it quite their interest that their territories should be conquered and their subjects tyrannized over by the regicides no fewer than ten sovereign princes had some the whole all a very considerable part of their dominions under the yoke of that dreadful faction amongst these was to be reckoned the first republic in the world and the closest ally of this kingdom which under the insulting name of an independency is under her iron yoke and as long as a faction averse to the old government is suffered there to domineer cannot be otherwise i say nothing of the austrian netherlands countries of a vast extent and amongst the most fertile and populous of europe and with regard to us most critically situated the rest will readily occur to you  but if there are yet existing any people like me oldfashioned enough to consider that we have an important part of our very existence beyond our limits and who therefore stretch their thoughts beyond the pomoerium of england for them too he has a comfort which will remove all their jealousies and alarms about the extent of the empire of regicide these conquests eventually will be the cause of her destruction so that they who hate the cause of usurpation and dread the power of france under any form are to wish her to be a conqueror in order to accelerate her ruin a little more conquest would be still better will he tell us what dose of dominion is to be the quantum sufficit for her destructionfor she seems very voracious of the food of her distemper to be sure she is ready to perish with repletion she has a boulimia and hardly has bolted down one state than she calls for two or three more there is a good deal of wit in all this but it seems to me with all respect to the author to be carrying the joke a great deal too far i cannot yet think that the armies of the allies were of this way of thinking and that when they evacuated all these countries it was a stratagem of war to decoy france into ruinor that if in a treaty we should surrender them forever into the hands of the usurpation the lease the author supposes it is a masterstroke of policy to effect the destruction of a formidable rival and to render her no longer an object of jealousy and alarm this i assure the author will infinitely facilitate the treaty the usurpers will catch at this bait without minding the hook which this crafty angler for the jacobin gudgeons of the new directory has so dexterously placed under it  every symptom of the exacerbation of the public malady is with him as with the doctor in molière a happy prognostic of recoveryflanders gone tant mieuxholland subdued charmingspain beaten and all the hither germany conquered bravo better and better stillbut they will retain all their conquests on a treaty best of allwhat a delightful thing it is to have a gay physician who sees all things as the french express it couleur de rose what an escape we have had that we and our allies were not the conquerors by these conquests previous to her utter destruction she is wholly to lose that preponderance which she held in the scale of the european powers bless me this new system of france after changing all other laws reverses the law of gravitation by throwing in weight after weight her scale rises and will byandby kick the beam certainly there is one sense in which she loses her preponderance that is she is no longer preponderant against the countries she has conquered they are part of herself but i beg the author to keep his eyes fixed on the scales for a moment longer and then to tell me in downright earnest whether he sees hitherto any signs of her losing preponderance by an augmentation of weight and power has she lost her preponderance over spain by her influence in spain are there any signs that the conquest of savoy and nice begins to lessen her preponderance over switzerland and the italian statesor that the canton of berne genoa and tuscany for example have taken arms against heror that sardinia is more adverse than ever to a treacherous pacification was it in the last week of october that the german states showed that jacobin france was losing her preponderance did the king of prussia when he delivered into her safe custody his territories on this side of the rhine manifest any tokens of his opinion of her loss of preponderance look on sweden and on denmark is her preponderance less visible there  it is true that in a course of ages empires have fallen and in the opinion of some not in mine by their own weight sometimes they have been unquestionably embarrassed in their movements by the dissociated situation of their dominions such was the case of the empire of charles the fifth and of his successor it might be so of others but so compact a body of empire so fitted in all the parts for mutual support with a frontier by nature and art so impenetrable with such facility of breaking out with irresistible force from every quarter was never seen in such an extent of territory from the beginning of time as in that empire which the jacobins possessed in october 1795 and which boissy danglas in his report settled as the law for europe and the dominion assigned by nature for the republic of regicide but this empire is to be her ruin and to take away all alarm and jealousy on the part of england and to destroy her preponderance over the miserable remains of europe  these are choice speculations with which the author amuses himself and tries to divert us in the blackest hours of the dismay defeat and calamity of all civilized nations they have but one faultthat they are directly contrary to the common sense and common feeling of mankind if i had but one hour to live i would employ it in decrying this wretched system and die with my pen in my hand to mark out the dreadful consequences of receiving an arrangement of empire dictated by the despotism of regicide to my own country and to the lawful sovereigns of the christian world  i trust i shall hardly be told in palliation of this shameful system of politics that the author expresses his sentiments only as doubts in such things it may be truly said that once to doubt is once to be resolved it would be a strange reason for wasting the treasures and shedding the blood of our country to prevent arrangements on the part of another power of which we were doubtful whether they might not be even to our advantage and render our neighbor less than before the object of our jealousy and alarm in this doubt there is much decision no nation would consent to carry on a war of skepticism but the fact is this expression of doubt is only a mode of putting an opinion when it is not the drift of the author to overturn the doubt otherwise the doubt is never stated as the authors own nor left as here it is unanswered indeed the mode of stating the most decided opinions in the form of questions is so little uncommon particularly since the excellent queries of the excellent berkeley that it became for a good while a fashionable mode of composition  here then the author of the fourth week of october is ready for the worst and would strike the bargain of peace on these conditions i must leave it to you and to every considerate man to reflect upon the effect of this on any continental alliances present or future and whether it would be possible if this book was thought of the least authority that its maxims with regard to our political interest must not naturally push them to be beforehand with us in the fraternity with regicide and thus not only strip us of any steady alliance at present but leave us without any of that communion of interest which could produce alliances in future indeed with these maxims we should be well divided from the world  notwithstanding this new kind of barrier and security that is found against her ambition in her conquests yet in the very same paragraph he admits that for the present at least it is subversive of the balance of power this i confess is not a direct contradiction because the benefits which he promises himself from it according to his hypothesis are future and more remote  so disposed is this author to peace that having laid a comfortable foundation for our security in the greatness of her empire he has another in reserve if that should fail upon quite a contrary ground that is a speculation of her crumbling to pieces and being thrown into a number of little separate republics after paying the tribute of humanity to those who will be ruined by all these changes on the whole he is of opinion that the change might be compatible with general tranquillity and with the establishment of a peaceful and prosperous commerce among nations whether france be great or small firm and entire or dissipated and divided all is well provided we can have peace with her  but without entering into speculations about her dismemberment whilst she is adding great nations to her empire is it then quite so certain that the dissipation of france into such a cluster of petty republics would be so very favorable to the true balance of power in europe as this author imagines it would be and to the commerce of nations i greatly differ from him i perhaps shall prove in a future letter with the political map of europe before my eye that the general liberty and independence of the great christian commonwealth could not exist with such a dismemberment unless it were followed as probably enough it would by the dismemberment of every other considerable country in europe and what convulsions would arise in the constitution of every state in europe it is not easy to conjecture in the mode impossible not to foresee in the mass speculate on good my lord provided you ground no part of your politics on such unsteady speculations but as to any practice to ensue are we not yet cured of the malady of speculating on the circumstances of things totally different from those in which we live and move five years has this monster continued whole and entire in all its members far from falling into a division within itself it is augmented by tremendous additions we cannot bear to look that frightful form in the face as it is and in its own actual shape we dare not be wise we have not the fortitude of rational fear we will not provide for our future safety but we endeavor to hush the cries of present timidity by guesses at what may be hereafter      tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow  is this our style of talk when          all our yesterdays have lighted fools     the way to dusty death  talk not to me of what swarm of republics may come from this carcass it is no carcass now now whilst we are talking it is full of life and action what say you to the regicide empire of today tell me my friend do its terrors appall you into an abject submission or rouse you to a vigorous defence but doi no longer prevent itdo go onlook into futurity has this empire nothing to alarm you when all struggle against it is over when mankind shall be silent before it when all nations shall be disarmed disheartened and truly divided by a treacherous peace its malignity towards humankind will subsist with undiminished heat whilst the means of giving it effect must proceed and every means of resisting it must inevitably and rapidly decline  against alarm on their politic and military empire these are the writers sedative remedies but he leaves us sadly in the dark with regard to the moral consequences which he states have threatened to demolish a system of civilization under which his country enjoys a prosperity unparalleled in the history of man we had emerged from our first terrors but here we sink into them againhowever only to shake them off upon the credit of his being a man of very sanguine hopes  against the moral terrors of this successful empire of barbarism though he has given us no consolation here in another place he has formed other securitiessecurities indeed which will make even the enormity of the crimes and atrocities of france a benefit to the world we are to be cured by her diseases we are to grow proud of our constitution upon the distempers of theirs governments throughout all europe are to become much stronger by this event this too comes in the favorite mode of doubt and perhaps to those he says who meditate on the workings of the human mind a doubt may perhaps arise whether the effects which i have described namely the change he supposes to be wrought on the public mind with regard to the french doctrines though at present a salutary check to the dangerous spirit of innovation may not prove favorable to abuses of power by creating a timidity in the just cause of liberty here the current of our apprehensions takes a contrary course instead of trembling for the existence of our government from the spirit of licentiousness and anarchy the author would make us believe we are to tremble for our liberties from the great accession of power which is to accrue to government  i believe i have read in some author who criticized the productions of the famous jurieu that it is not very wise in people who dash away in prophecy to fix the time of accomplishment at too short a period mr brothers may meditate upon this at his leisure he was a melancholy prognosticator and has had the fate of melancholy men but they who prophesy pleasant things get great present applause and in days of calamity people have something else to think of they lose in their feeling of their distress all memory of those who flattered them in their prosperity but merely for the credit of the prediction nothing could have happened more unluckily for the noble lords sanguine expectations of the amendment of the public mind and the consequent greater security to government from the examples in france than what happened in the week after the publication of his hebdomadal system i am not sure it was not in the very week one of the most violent and dangerous seditions broke out that we have seen in several years this sedition menacing to the public security endangering the sacred person of the king and violating in the most audacious manner the authority of parliament surrounded our sovereign with a murderous yell and warwhoop for that peace which the noble lord considers as a cure for all domestic disturbances and dissatisfactions  so far as to this general cure for popular disorders as for government the two houses of parliament instead of being guided by the speculations of the fourth week in october and throwing up new barriers against the dangerous power of the crown which the noble lord considered as no unplausible subject of apprehension the two houses of parliament thought fit to pass two acts for the further strengthening of that very government against a most dangerous and widespread faction  unluckily too for this kind of sanguine speculation on the very first day of the everfamed last week of october a large daring and seditious meeting was publicly held from which meeting this atrocious attempt against the sovereign publicly originated  no wonder that the author should tell us that the whole consideration might be varied whilst he was writing those pages in one and that the most material instance his speculations not only might be but were at that very time entirely overset their warcry for peace with france was the same with that of this gentle author but in a different note his is the gemitus columbæ cooing and wooing fraternity theirs the funereal screams of birds of night calling for their illomened paramours but they are both songs of courtship these regicides considered a regicide peace as a cure for all their evils and so far as i can find they showed nothing at all of the timidity which the noble lord apprehends in what they call the just cause of liberty  however it seems that notwithstanding these awkward appearances with regard to the strength of government he has still his fears and doubts about our liberties to a free people this would be a matter of alarm but this physician of october has in his shop all sorts of salves for all sorts of sores it is curious that they all come from the inexhaustible drugshop of the regicide dispensary it costs him nothing to excite terror because he lays it at his pleasure he finds a security for this danger to liberty from the wonderful wisdom to be taught to kings to nobility and even to the lowest of the people by the late transactions  i confess i was always blind enough to regard the french revolution in the act and much more in the example as one of the greatest calamities that had ever fallen upon mankind i now find that in its effects it is to be the greatest of all blessings if so we owe amende honorable to the jacobins they it seems were right and if they were right a little earlier than we are it only shows that they exceeded us in sagacity if they brought out their right ideas somewhat in a disorderly manner it must be remembered that great zeal produces some irregularity but when greatly in the right it must be pardoned by those who are very regularly and temperately in the wrong the master jacobins had told me this a thousand times i never believed the masters nor do i now find myself disposed to give credit to the disciple i will not much dispute with our author which party has the best of this revolutionthat which is from thence to learn wisdom or that which from the same event has obtained power the dispute on the preference of strength to wisdom may perhaps be decided as horace has decided the controversy between art and nature i do not like to leave all the power to my adversary and to secure nothing to myself but the untimely wisdom that is taught by the consequences of folly i do not like my share in the partition because to his strength my adversary may possibly add a good deal of cunning whereas my wisdom may totally fail in producing to me the same degree of strength but to descend from the authors generalities a little nearer to meaning the security given to liberty is thisthat governments will have learned not to precipitate themselves into embarrassments by speculative wars sovereigns and princes will not forget that steadiness moderation and economy are the best supports of the eminence on which they stand there seems to me a good deal of oblique reflection in this lesson as to the lesson itself it is at all times a good one one would think however by this formal introduction of it as a recommendation of the arrangements proposed by the author it had never been taught before either by precept or by experienceand that these maxims are discoveries reserved for a regicide peace but is it permitted to ask what security it affords to the liberty of the subject that the prince is pacific or frugal the very contrary has happened in our history our best securities for freedom have been obtained from princes who were either warlike or prodigal or both  although the amendment of princes in these points can have no effect in quieting our apprehensions for liberty on account of the strength to be acquired to government by a regicide peace i allow that the avoiding of speculative wars may possibly be an advantage provided i well understand what the author means by a speculative war i suppose he means a war grounded on speculative advantages and not wars founded on a just speculation of danger does he mean to include this war which we are now carrying on amongst those speculative wars which this jacobin peace is to teach sovereigns to avoid hereafter if so it is doing the party an important service does he mean that we are to avoid such wars as that of the grand alliance made on a speculation of danger to the independence of europe i suspect he has a sort of retrospective view to the american war as a speculative war carried on by england upon one side and by louis the sixteenth on the other as to our share of that war let reverence to the dead and respect to the living prevent us from reading lessons of this kind at their expense i dont know how far the author may find himself at liberty to wanton on that subject but for my part i entered into a coalition which when i had no longer a duty relative to that business made me think myself bound in honor not to call it up without necessity but if he puts england out of the question and reflects only on louis the sixteenth i have only to say dearly has he answered it i will not defend him but all those who pushed on the revolution by which he was deposed were much more in fault than he was they have murdered him and have divided his kingdom as a spoil but they who are the guilty are not they who furnish the example they who reign through his fault are not among those sovereigns who are likely to be taught to avoid speculative wars by the murder of their master i think the author will not be hardy enough to assert that they have shown less disposition to meddle in the concerns of that very america than he did and in a way not less likely to kindle the flame of speculative war here is one sovereign not yet reclaimed by these healing examples will he point out the other sovereigns who are to be reformed by this peace their wars may not be speculative but the world will not be much mended by turning wars from unprofitable and speculative to practical and lucrative whether the liberty or the repose of mankind is regarded if the authors new sovereign in france is not reformed by the example of his own revolution that revolution has not added much to the security and repose of poland for instance or taught the three great partitioning powers more moderation in their second than they had shown in their first division of that devoted country the first division which preceded these destructive examples was moderation itself in comparison of what has been done since the period of the authors amendment  this paragraph is written with something of a studied obscurity if it means anything it seems to hint as if sovereigns were to learn moderation and an attention to the liberties of their people from the fate of the sovereigns who have suffered in this war and eminently of louis the sixteenth  will he say whether the king of sardinias horrible tyranny was the cause of the loss of savoy and of nice what lesson of moderation does it teach the pope i desire to know whether his holiness is to learn not to massacre his subjects nor to waste and destroy such beautiful countries as that of avignon lest he should call to their assistance that great deliverer of nations jourdan coupetête what lesson does it give of moderation to the emperor whose predecessor never put one man to death after a general rebellion of the low countries that the regicides never spared man woman or child whom they but suspected of dislike to their usurpations what then are all these lessons about the softening the character of sovereigns by this regicide peace on reading this section one would imagine that the poor tame sovereigns of europe had been a sort of furious wild beasts that stood in need of some uncommonly rough discipline to subdue the ferocity of their savage nature  as to the example to be learnt from the murder of louis the sixteenth if a lesson to kings is not derived from his fate i do not know whence it can come the author however ought not to have left us in the dark upon that subject to break our shins over his hints and insinuations is it then true that this unfortunate monarch drew his punishment upon himself by his want of moderation and his oppressing the liberties of which he had found his people in possession is not the direct contrary the fact and is not the example of this revolution the very reverse of anything which can lead to that softening of character in princes which the author supposes as a security to the people and has brought forward as a recommendation to fraternity with those who have administered that happy emollient in the murder of their king and the slavery and desolation of their country  but the author does not confine the benefit of the regicide lesson to kings alone he has a diffusive bounty nobles and men of property will likewise be greatly reformed they too will be led to a review of their social situation and dutiesand will reflect that their large allotment of worldly advantages is for the aid and benefit of the whole is it then from the fate of juigné archbishop of paris or of the cardinal de rochefoucault and of so many others who gave their fortunes and i may say their very beings to the poor that the rich are to learn that their fortunes are for the aid and benefit of the whole i say nothing of the liberal persons of great rank and property lay and ecclesiastic men and women to whom we have had the honor and happiness of affording an asylum i pass by these lest i should never have done or lest i should omit some as deserving as any i might mention why will the author then suppose that the nobles and men of property in france have been banished confiscated and murdered on account of the savageness and ferocity of their character and their being tainted with vices beyond those of the same order and description in other countries no judge of a revolutionary tribunal with his hands dipped in their blood and his maw gorged with their property has yet dared to assert what this author has been pleased by way of a moral lesson to insinuate  their nobility and their men of property in a mass had the very same virtues and the very same vices and in the very same proportions with the same description of men in this and in other nations i must do justice to suffering honor generosity and integrity i do not know that any time or any country has furnished more splendid examples of every virtue domestic and public i do not enter into the councils of providence but humanly speaking many of these nobles and men of property from whose disastrous fate we are it seems to learn a general softening of character and a revision of our social situations and duties appear to me full as little deserving of that fate as the author whoever he is can be many of them i am sure were such as i should be proud indeed to be able to compare myself with in knowledge in integrity and in every other virtue my feeble nature might shrink though theirs did not from the proof but my reason and my ambition tell me that it would be a good bargain to purchase their merits with their fate  for which of his vices did that great magistrate despréménil lose his fortune and his head what were the abominations of malesherbes that other excellent magistrate whose sixty years of uniform virtue was acknowledged in the very act of his murder by the judicial butchers who condemned him on account of what misdemeanors was he robbed of his property and slaughtered with two generations of his offspringand the remains of the third race with a refinement of cruelty and lest they should appear to reclaim the property forfeited by the virtues of their ancestor confounded in an hospital with the thousands of those unhappy foundling infants who are abandoned without relation and without name by the wretchedness or by the profligacy of their parents  is the fate of the queen of france to produce this softening of character was she a person so very ferocious and cruel as by the example of her death to frighten us into common humanity is there no way to teach the emperor a softening of character and a review of his social situation and duty but his consent by an infamous accord with regicide to drive a second coach with the austrian arms through the streets of paris along which after a series of preparatory horrors exceeding the atrocities of the bloody execution itself the glory of the imperial race had been carried to an ignominious death is this a lesson of moderation to a descendant of maria theresa drawn from the fate of the daughter of that incomparable woman and sovereign if he learns this lesson from such an object and from such teachers the man may remain but the king is deposed if he does not carry quite another memory of that transaction in the inmost recesses of his heart he is unworthy to reign he is unworthy to live in the chronicle of disgrace he will have but this short tale told of him he was the first emperor of his house that embraced a regicide he was the last that wore the imperial purple far am i from thinking so ill of this august sovereign who is at the head of the monarchies of europe and who is the trustee of their dignities and his own  what ferocity of character drew on the fate of elizabeth the sister of king louis the sixteenth for which of the vices of that pattern of benevolence of piety and of all the virtues did they put her to death for which of her vices did they put to death the mildest of all human creatures the duchess of biron what were the crimes of those crowds of matrons and virgins of condition whom they mas sacred with their juries of blood in prisons and on scaffolds what were the enormities of the infant king whom they caused by lingering tortures to perish in their dungeon and whom if at last they dispatched by poison it was in that detestable crime the only act of mercy they have ever shown  what softening of character is to be had what review of their social situations and duties is to be taught by these examples to kings to nobles to men of property to women and to infants the royal family perished because it was royal the nobles perished because they were noble the men women and children who had property because they had property to be robbed of the priests were punished after they had been robbed of their all not for their vices but for their virtues and their piety which made them an honor to their sacred profession and to that nature of which we ought to be proud since they belong to it my lord nothing can be learned from such examples except the danger of being kings queens nobles priests and children to be butchered on account of their inheritance these are things at which not vice not crime not folly but wisdom goodness learning justice probity beneficence stand aghast by these examples our reason and our moral sense are not enlightened but confounded and there is no refuge for astonished and affrighted virtue but being annihilated in humility and submission sinking into a silent adoration of the inscrutable dispensations of providence and flying with trembling wings from this world of daring crimes and feeble pusillanimous halfbred bastard justice to the asylum of another order of things in an unknown form but in a better life  whatever the politician or preacher of september or of october may think of the matter it is a most comfortless disheartening desolating example dreadful is the example of ruined innocence and virtue and the completest triumph of the completest villany that ever vexed and disgraced mankind the example is ruinous in every point of view religious moral civil political it establishes that dreadful maxim of machiavel that in great affairs men are not to be wicked by halves this maxim is not made for a middle sort of beings who because they cannot be angels ought to thwart their ambition and not endeavor to become infernal spirits it is too well exemplified in the present time where the faults and errors of humanity checked by the imperfect timorous virtues have been overpowered by those who have stopped at no crime it is a dreadful part of the example that infernal malevolence has had pious apologists who read their lectures on frailties in favor of crimeswho abandon the weak and court the friendship of the wicked to root out these maxims and the examples that support them is a wise object of years of war this is that war this is that moral war it was said by old trivulzio that the battle of marignano was the battle of the giantsthat all the rest of the many he had seen were those of the cranes and pygmies this is true of the objects at least of the contest for the greater part of those which we have hitherto contended for in comparison were the toys of children  the october politician is so full of charity and goodnature that he supposes that these very robbers and murderers themselves are in a course of melioration on what ground i cannot conceive except on the long practice of every crime and by its complete success he is an origenist and believes in the conversion of the devil all that runs in the place of blood in his veins is nothing but the milk of human kindness he is as soft as a curdthough as a politician he might be supposed to be made of sterner stuff he supposes to use his own expression that the salutary truths which he inculcates are making their way into their bosoms their bosom is a rock of granite on which falsehood has long since built her stronghold poor truth has had a hard work of it with her little pickaxe nothing but gunpowder will do  as a proof however of the progress of this sap of truth he gives us a confession they had made not long before he wrote their fraternity as was lately stated by themselves in a solemn report has been the brotherhood of cain and abel and they have organized nothing but bankruptcy and famine a very honest confession trulyand much in the spirit of their oracle rousseau yet what is still more marvellous than the confession this is the very fraternity to which our author gives us such an obliging invitation to accede there is indeed a vacancy in the fraternal corps a brother and a partner is wanted if we please we may fill up the place of the butchered abel and whilst we wait the destiny of the departed brother we may enjoy the advantages of the partnership by entering without delay into a shop of readymade bankruptcy and famine these are the douceurs by which we are invited to regicide fraternity and friendship but still our author considers the confession as a proof that truth is making its way into their bosoms no it is not making its way into their bosoms it has forced its way into their mouths the evil spirit by which they are possessed though essentially a liar is forced by the tortures of conscience to confess the truthto confess enough for their condemnation but not for their amendment shakspeare very aptly expresses this kind of confession devoid of repentance from the mouth of an usurper a murderer and a regicide              we are ourselves compelled     even to the teeth and forehead of our faults     to give in evidence  whence is their amendment why the author writes that on their murderous insurrectionary system their own lives are not sure for an hour nor has their power a greater stability true they are convinced of it and accordingly the wretches have done all they can to preserve their lives and to secure their power but not one step have they taken to amend the one or to make a more just use of the other their wicked policy has obliged them to make a pause in the only massacres in which their treachery and cruelty had operated as a kind of savage justicethat is the massacre of the accomplices of their crimes they have ceased to shed the inhuman blood of their fellowmurderers but when they take any of those persons who contend for their lawful government their property and their religion notwithstanding the truth which this author says is making its way into their bosoms it has not taught them the least tincture of mercy this we plainly see by their massacre at quiberon where they put to death with every species of contumely and without any exception every prisoner of war who did not escape out of their hands to have had property to have been robbed of it and to endeavor to regain itthese are crimes irremissible to which every man who regards his property or his life in every country ought well to look in all connection with those with whom to have had property was an offence to endeavor to keep it a second offence to attempt to regain it a crime that puts the offender out of all the laws of peace or war you cannot see one of those wretches without an alarm for your life as well as your goods they are like the worst of the french and italian banditti who whenever they robbed were sure to murder  are they not the very same ruffians thieves assassins and regicides that they were from the beginning have they diversified the scene by the least variety or produced the face of a single new villany tædet harum quotidianarum formarum oh but i shall be answered it is now quite another thingthey are all changed you have not seen them in their state dressesthis makes an amazing difference the new habit of the directory is so charmingly fancied that it is impossible not to fall in love with so welldressed a constitutionthe costume of the sansculotte constitution of 1793 was absolutely insufferable the committee for foreign affairs were such slovens and stunk so abominably that no muscadin ambassador of the smallest degree of delicacy of nerves could come within ten yards of them but now they are so powdered and perfumed and ribanded and sashed and plumed that though they are grown infinitely more insolent in their fine clothes even than they were in their rags and that was enough as they now appear there is something in it more grand and noble something more suitable to an awful roman senate receiving the homage of dependent tetrarchs like that senate their perpetual model for conduct towards other nations they permit their vassals during their good pleasure to assume the name of kings in order to bestow more dignity on the suite and retinue of the sovereign republic by the nominal rank of their slaves ut habeant instrumenta servitutis et reges all this is very fine undoubtedly and ambassadors whose hands are almost out for want of employment may long to have their part in this august ceremony of the republic one and indivisible but with great deference to the new diplomatic taste we old people must retain some squaretoed predilection for the fashions of our youth  i am afraid you will find me my lord again falling into my usual vanity in valuing myself on the eminent men whose society i once enjoyed i remember in a conversation i once had with my ever dear friend garrick who was the first of actors because he was the most acute observer of nature i ever knew i asked him how it happened that whenever a senate appeared on the stage the audience seemed always disposed to laughter he said the reason was plain the audience was well acquainted with the faces of most of the senators they knew that they were no other than candlesnuffers revolutionary sceneshifters second and third mob prompters clerks executioners who stand with their axe on their shoulders by the wheel grinners in the pantomime murderers in tragedies who make ugly faces under black wigsin short the very scum and refuse of the theatre and it was of course that the contrast of the vileness of the actors with the pomp of their habits naturally excited ideas of contempt and ridicule  so it was at paris on the inaugural day of the constitution for the present year the foreign ministers were ordered to attend at this investiture of the directoryfor so they call the managers of their burlesque government the diplomacy who were a sort of strangers were quite awestruck with the pride pomp and circumstance of this majestic senate whilst the sansculotte gallery instantly recognized their old insurrectionary acquaintance burst out into a horselaugh at their absurd finery and held them in infinitely greater contempt than whilst they prowled about the streets in the pantaloons of the last years constitution when their legislators appeared honestly with their daggers in their belts and their pistols peeping out of their sidepocketholes like a bold brave banditti as they are the parisians and i am much of their mind think that a thief with a crape on his visage is much worse than a barefaced knave and that such robbers richly deserve all the penalties of all the black acts in this their thin disguise their comrades of the late abdicated sovereign canaille hooted and hissed them and from that day have no other name for them than what is not quite so easy to render into english impossible to make it very civil english it belongs indeed to the language of the halles but without being instructed in that dialect it was the opinion of the polite lord chesterfield that no man could be a complete master of french their parisian brethren called them gueux plumés which though not elegant is expressive and characteristic feathered scoundrels i think comes the nearest to it in that kind of english but we are now to understand that these gueux for no other reason that i can divine except their red and white clothes form at last a state with which we may cultivate amity and have a prospect of the blessings of a secure and permanent peace in effect then it was not with the men or their principles or their polities that we quarrelled our sole dislike was to the cut of their clothes  but to pass over their dressesgood god in what habits did the representatives of the crowned heads of europe appear when they came to swell the pomp of their humiliation and attended in solemn function this inauguration of regicide that would be the curiosity under what robes did they cover the disgrace and degradation of the whole college of kings what warehouses of masks and dominoes furnished a cover to the nakedness of their shame the shop ought to be known it will soon have a good trade were the dresses of the ministers of those lately called potentates who attended on that occasion taken from the wardrobe of that propertyman at the opera from whence my old acquaintance anacharsis clootz some years ago equipped a body of ambassadors whom he conducted as from all the nations of the world to the bar of what was called the constituent assembly among those mock ministers one of the most conspicuous figures was the representative of the british nation who unluckily was wanting at the late ceremony in the face of all the real ambassadors of the sovereigns of europe was this ludicrous representation of their several subjects under the name of oppressed sovereigns10 exhibited to the assembly that assembly received an harangue in the name of those sovereigns against their kings delivered by this clootz actually a subject of prussia under the name of ambassador of the human race at that time there was only a feeble reclamation from one of the ambassadors of these tyrants and oppressors a most gracious answer was given to the ministers of the oppressed sovereigns and they went so far on that occasion as to assign them in that assumed character a box at one of their festivals  i was willing to indulge myself in an hope that this second appearance of ambassadors was only an insolent mummery of the same kind but alas anacharsis himself all fanatic as he was could not have imagined that his opera procession should have been the prototype of the real appearance of the representatives of all the sovereigns of europe themselves to make the same prostration that was made by those who dared to represent their people in a complaint against them but in this the french republic has followed as they always affect to do and have hitherto done with success the example of the ancient romans who shook all governments by listening to the complaints of their subjects and soon after brought the kings themselves to answer at their bar at this last ceremony the ambassadors had not clootz for their cotterel pity that clootz had not had a reprieve from the guillotine till he had completed his work but that engine fell before the curtain had fallen upon all the dignity of the earth  on this their gaudy day the new regicide directory sent for that diplomatic rabble as bad as themselves in principle but infinitely worse in degradation they called them out by a sort of roll of their nations one after another much in the manner in which they called wretches out of their prison to the guillotine when these ambassadors of infamy appeared before them the chief director in the name of the rest treated each of them with a short affected pedantic insolent theatric laconiuma sort of epigram of contempt when they had thus insulted them in a style and language which never before was heard and which no sovereign would for a moment endure from another supposing any of them frantic enough to use it to finish their outrage they drummed and trumpeted the wretches out of their hall of audience  among the objects of this insolent buffoonery was a person supposed to represent the king of prussia to this worthy representative they did not so much as condescend to mention his master they did not seem to know that he had one they addressed themselves solely to prussia in the abstract notwithstanding the infinite obligation they owed to their early protector for their first recognition and alliance and for the part of his territory he gave into their hands for the firstfruits of his homage none but dead monarchs are so much as mentioned by them and those only to insult the living by an invidious comparison they told the prussians they ought to learn after the example of frederick the great a love for france what a pity it is that he who loved france so well as to chastise it was not now alive by an unsparing use of the rod which indeed he would have spared little to give them another instance of his paternal affection but the directory were mistaken these are not days in which monarchs value themselves upon the title of great they are grown philosophic they are satisfied to be good  your lordship will pardon me for this no very long reflection on the short but excellent speech of the plumed director to the ambassador of cappadocia the imperial ambassador was not in waiting but they found for austria a good judean representation with great judgment his highness the grand duke had sent the most atheistic coxcomb to be found in florence to represent at the bar of impiety the house of apostolic majesty and the descendants of the pious though highminded maria theresa he was sent to humble the whole race of austria before those grim assassins reeking with the blood of the daughter of maria theresa whom they sent half dead in a dungcart to a cruel execution and this trueborn son of apostasy and infidelity this renegado from the faith and from all honor and all humanity drove an austrian coach over the stones which were yet wet with her bloodwith that blood which dropped every step through her tumbrel all the way she was drawn from the horrid prison in which they had finished all the cruelty and horrors not executed in the face of the sun the hungarian subjects of maria theresa when they drew their swords to defend her rights against france called her with correctness of truth though not with the same correctness perhaps of grammar a king moriamur pro rege nostro maria theresa she lived and died a king and others will have subjects ready to make the same vow when in either sex they show themselves real kings  when the directory came to this miserable fop they bestowed a compliment on his matriculation into their philosophy but as to his master they made to him as was reasonable a reprimand not without a pardon and an oblique hint at the whole family what indignities have been offered through this wretch to his master and how well borne it is not necessary that i should dwell on at present i hope that those who yet wear royal imperial and ducal crowns will learn to feel as men and as kings if not i predict to them they will not long exist as kings or as men  great britain was not there almost in despair i hope she will never in any rags and coversluts of infamy be seen at such an exhibition the hour of her final degradation is not yet come she did not herself appear in the regicide presence to be the sport and mockery of those bloody buffoons who in the merriment of their pride were insulting with every species of contumely the fallen dignity of the rest of europe but britain though not personally appearing to bear her part in this monstrous tragicomedy was very far from being forgotten the newrobed regicides found a representative for her and who was this representative without a previous knowledge any one would have given a thousand guesses before he could arrive at a tolerable divination of their rancorous insolence they chose to address what they had to say concerning this nation to the ambassador of america they did not apply to this ambassador for a mediation that indeed would have indicated a want of every kind of decency but it would have indicated nothing more but in this their american apostrophe your lordship will observe they did not so much as pretend to hold out to us directly or through any mediator though in the most humiliating manner any idea whatsoever of peace or the smallest desire of reconciliation to the states of america themselves they paid no compliment they paid their compliment to washington solely and on what ground this most respectable commander and magistrate might deserve commendation on very many of those qualities which they who most disapprove some part of his proceedings not more justly than freely attribute to him but they found nothing to commend in him but the hatred he bore to great britain i verily believe that in the whole history of our european wars there never was such a compliment paid from the sovereign of one state to a great chief of another not one ambassador from any one of those powers who pretend to live in amity with this kingdom took the least notice of that unheardof declaration nor will great britain till she is known with certainty to be true to her own dignity find any one disposed to feel for the indignities that are offered to her to say the truth those miserable creatures were all silent under the insults that were offered to themselves they pocketed their epigrams as ambassadors formerly took the gold boxes and miniature pictures set in diamonds presented them by sovereigns at whose courts they had resided it is to be presumed that by the next post they faithfully and promptly transmitted to their masters the honors they had received i can easily conceive the epigram which will be presented to lord auckland or to the duke of bedford as hereafter according to circumstances they may happen to represent this kingdom few can have so little imagination as not readily to conceive the nature of the boxes of epigrammatic lozenges that will be presented to them  but hæ nugæ seria ducunt in mala the conduct of the regicide faction is perfectly systematic in every particular and it appears absurd only as it is strange and uncouth not as it has an application to the ends and objects of their policy when by insult after insult they have rendered the character of sovereigns vile in the eyes of their subjects they know there is but one step more to their utter destruction all authority in a great degree exists in opinion royal authority most of all the supreme majesty of a monarch cannot be allied with contempt men would reason not unplausibly that it would be better to get rid of the monarchy at once than to suffer that which was instituted and well instituted to support the glory of the nation to become the instrument of its degradation and disgrace  a good many reflections will arise in your lordships mind upon the time and circumstances of that most insulting and atrocious declaration of hostility against this kingdom the declaration was made subsequent to the noble lords encomium on the new regicide constitutionafter the pamphlet had made something more than advances towards a reconciliation with that ungracious race and had directly disowned all those who adhered to the original declaration in favor of monarchy it was even subsequent to the unfortunate declaration in the speech from the throne which this pamphlet but too truly announced of the readiness of our government to enter into connections of friendship with that faction here was the answer from the throne of regicide to the speech from the throne of great britain they go out of their way to compliment general washington on the supposed rancor of his heart towards this country it is very remarkable that they make this compliment of malice to the chief of the united states who had first signed a treaty of peace amity and commerce with this kingdom this radical hatred according to their way of thinking the most recent solemn compacts of friendship cannot or ought not to remove in this malice to england as in the one great comprehensive virtue all other merits of this illustrious person are entirely merged for my part i do not believe the fact to be so as they represent it certainly it is not for mr washingtons honor as a gentleman a christian or a president of the united states after the treaty he has signed to entertain such sentiments i have a moral assurance that the representation of the regicide directory is absolutely false and groundless if it be it is a stronger mark of their audacity and insolence and still a stronger proof of the support they mean to give to the mischievous faction they are known to nourish there to the ruin of those states and to the end that no british affections should ever arise in that important part of the world which would naturally lead to a cordial hearty british alliance upon the bottom of mutual interest and ancient affection it shows in what part it is and with what a weapon they mean a deadly blow at the heart of great britain one really would have expected from this new constitution of theirs which had been announced as a great reform and which was to be more than any of their former experimental schemes alliable with other nations that they would in their very first public act and their declaration to the collected representation of europe and america have affected some degree of moderation or at least have observed a guarded silence with regard to their temper and their views no such thing they were in haste to declare the principles which are spun into the primitive staple of their frame they were afraid that a moments doubt should exist about them in their very infancy they were in haste to put their hand on their infernal altar and to swear the same immortal hatred to england which was sworn in the succession of all the shortlived constitutions that preceded it with them everything else perishes almost as soon as it is formed this hatred alone is immortal this is their impure vestal fire that never is extinguished and never will it be extinguished whilst the system of regicide exists in france what are we not to believe them men are too apt to be deceitful enough in their professions of friendship and this makes a wise man walk with some caution through life such professions in some cases may be even a ground of further distrust but when a man declares himself your unalterable enemy no man ever declared to another a rancor towards him which he did not feel falsos in amore odia non fingere said an author who points his observations so as to make them remembered  observe my lord that from their invasion of flanders and holland to this hour they have never made the smallest signification of a desire of peace with this kingdom with austria or indeed with any other power that i know of as superiors they expect others to begin we have complied as you may see the hostile insolence with which they gave such a rebuff to our first overture in the speech from the throne did not hinder us from making from the same throne a second advance the two houses a second time coincided in the same sentiments with a degree of apparent unanimity for there was no dissentient voice but yours with which when they reflect on it they will be as much ashamed as i am to this our new humiliating overture such at whatever hazard i must call it what did the regicide directory answer not one public word of a readiness to treat nothey feel their proud situation too well they never declared whether they would grant peace to you or not they only signified to you their pleasure as to the terms on which alone they would in any case admit you to it you showed your general disposition to peace and to forward it you left everything open to negotiations as to any terms you can possibly obtain they shut out all negotiation at the very commencement they declared that they never would make a peace by which anything that ever belonged to france should be ceded we would not treat with the monarchy weakened as it must obviously be in any circumstance of restoration without a reservation of something for indemnity and securityand that too in words of the largest comprehension you treat with the regicides without any reservation at all on their part they assure you formally and publicly that they will give you nothing in the name of indemnity or security or for any other purpose  it is impossible not to pause here for a moment and to consider the manner in which such declarations would have been taken by your ancestors from a monarch distinguished for his arrogancean arrogance which even more than his ambition incensed and combined all europe against him whatever his inward intentions may have been did louis the fourteenth ever make a declaration that the true bounds of france were the ocean the mediterranean and the rhine in any overtures for peace did he ever declare that he would make no sacrifices to promote it his declarations were always directly to the contrary and at the peace of ryswick his actions were to the contrary at the close of the war almost in every instance victorious all europe was astonished even those who received them were astonished at his concessions let those who have a mind to see how little in comparison the most powerful and ambitious of all monarchs is to be dreaded consult the very judicious critical observations on the politics of that reign inserted in the military treatise of the marquis de montalembert let those who wish to know what is to be dreaded from an ambitious republic consult no author no military critic no historical critic let them open their own eyes which degeneracy and pusillanimity have shut from the light that pains them and let them not vainly seek their security in a voluntary ignorance of their danger  to dispose us towards this peacean attempt in which our author has i do not know whether to call it the good or ill fortune to agree with whatever is most seditious factious and treasonable in this countrywe are told by many dealers in speculation but not so distinctly by the author himself too great distinctness of affirmation not being his faultbut we are told that the french have lately obtained a very pretty sort of constitution and that it resembles the british constitution as if they had been twinned together in the wombmire sagaces fallere hospites discrimen obscurum it may be so but i confess i am not yet made to it nor is the noble author he finds the elements excellent but the disposition very inartificial indeed contrary to what we might expect at paris the meat is good the cookery abominable i agree with him fully in the last and if i were forced to allow the first i should still think with our old coarse byword that the same power which furnished all their former restaurateurs sent also their present cooks i have a great opinion of thomas paine and of all his productions i remember his having been one of the committee for forming one of their annual constitutions i mean the admirable constitution of 1793 after having been a chamber council to the no less admirable constitution of 1791 this pious patriot has his eyes still directed to his dear native country notwithstanding her in gratitude to so kind a benefactor this outlaw of england and lawgiver to france is now in secret probably trying his hand again and inviting us to him by making his constitution such as may give his disciples in england some plausible pretext for going into the house that he has opened we have discovered it seems that all which the boasted wisdom of our ancestors has labored to bring to perfection for six or seven centuries is nearly or altogether matched in six or seven days at the leisure hours and sober intervals of citizen thomas paine      but though the treacherous tapster thomas     hangs a new angel two doors from us     as fine as daubers hands can make it     in hopes that strangers may mistake it     we think it both a shame and sin     to quit the good old angel inn  indeed in this good old house where everything at least is well aired i shall be content to put up my fatigued horses and here take a bed for the long night that begins to darken upon me had i however the honor i must now call it so of being a member of any of the constitutional clubs i should think i had carried my point most completely it is clear by the applauses bestowed on what the author calls this new constitution a mixed oligarchy that the difference between the clubbists and the old adherents to the monarchy of this country is hardly worth a scuffle let it depart in peace and light lie the earth on the british constitution by this easy manner of treating the most difficult of all subjects the constitution for a great kingdom and by letting loose an opinion that they may be made by any adventurers in speculation in a small given time and for any country all the ties which whether of reason or prejudice attach mankind to their old habitual domestic governments are not a little loosened all communion which the similarity of the basis has produced between all the governments that compose what we call the christian world and the republic of europe would be dissolved by these hazarded speculations france is more approximated to us in constitution than in situation and in proportion as we recede from the ancient system of europe we approach to that connection which alone can remain to us a close alliance with the newdiscovered moral and political world in france  these theories would be of little importance if we did not only know but sorely feel that there is a strong jacobin faction in this country which has long employed itself in speculating upon constitutions and to whom the circumstance of their government being homebred and prescriptive seems no sort of recommendation what seemed to us to be the best system of liberty that a nation ever enjoyed to them seems the yoke of an intolerable slavery this speculative faction had long been at work the french revolution did not cause it it only discovered it increased it and gave fresh vigor to its operations i have reason to be persuaded that it was in this country and from english writers and english caballers that france herself was instituted in this revolutionary fury the communion of these two factions upon any pretended basis of similarity is a matter of very serious consideration they are always considering the formal distributions of power in a constitution the moral basis they consider as nothing very different is my opinion i consider the moral basis as everythingthe formal arrangements further than as they promote the moral principles of government and the keeping desperately wicked persons as the subjects of laws and not the makers of them to be of little importance what signifies the cutting and shuffling of cards while the pack still remains the same as a basis for such a connection as has subsisted between the powers of europe we had nothing to fear but from the lapses and frailties of menand that was enough but this new pretended republic has given us more to apprehend from what they call their virtues than we had to dread from the vices of other men avowedly and systematically they have given the upperhand to all the vicious and degenerate part of human nature it is from their lapses and deviations from their principle that alone we have anything to hope  i hear another inducement to fraternity with the present rulers they have murdered one robespierre this robespierre they tell us was a cruel tyrant and now that he is put out of the way all will go well in france astræa will again return to that earth from which she has been an emigrant and all nations will resort to her golden scales it is very extraordinary that the very instant the mode of paris is known here it becomes all the fashion in london this is their jargon it is the old bonton of robbers who cast their common crimes on the wickedness of their departed associates i care little about the memory of this same robespierre i am sure he was an execrable villain i rejoiced at his punishment neither more nor less than i should at the execution of the present directory or any of its members but who gave robespierre the power of being a tyrant and who were the instruments of his tyranny the present virtuous constitutionmongers he was a tyrant they were his satellites and his hangmen their sole merit is in the murder of their colleague they have expiated their other murders by a new murder it has always been the case among this banditti they have always had the knife at each others throats after they had almost blunted it at the throats of every honest man these people thought that in the commerce of murder he was like to have the better of the bargain if any time was lost they therefore took one of their short revolutionary methods and massacred him in a manner so perfidious and cruel as would shock all humanity if the stroke was not struck by the present rulers on one of their own associates but this last act of infidelity and murder is to expiate all the rest and to qualify them for the amity of an humane and virtuous sovereign and civilized people i have heard that a tartar believes when he has killed a man that all his estimable qualities pass with his clothes and arms to the murderer but i have never heard that it was the opinion of any savage scythian that if he kills a brother villain he is ipso facto absolved of all his own offences the tartarian doctrine is the most tenable opinion the murderers of robespierre besides what they are entitled to by being engaged in the same tontine of infamy are his representatives have inherited all his murderous qualities in addition to their own private stock but it seems we are always to be of a party with the last and victorious assassins i confess i am of a different mind and am rather inclined of the two to think and speak less hardly of a dead ruffian than to associate with the living i could better bear the stench of the gibbeted murderer than the society of the bloody felons who yet annoy the world whilst they wait the recompense due to their ancient crimes they merit new punishment by the new offences they commit there is a period to the offences of robespierre they survive in his assassins better a living dog says the old proverb than a dead lion not so here murderers and hogs never look well till they are hanged from villany no good can arise but in the example of its fate so i leave them their dead robespierre either to gibbet his memory or to deify him in their pantheon with their marat and their mirabeau  it is asserted that this government promises stability god of his mercy forbid if it should nothing upon earth besides itself can be stable we declare this stability to be the ground of our making peace with them assuming it therefore that the men and the system are what i have described and that they have a determined hostility against this countryan hostility not only of policy but of predilectionthen i think that every rational being would go along with me in considering its permanence as the greatest of all possible evils if therefore we are to look for peace with such a thing in any of its monstrous shapes which i deprecate it must be in that state of disorder confusion discord anarchy and insurrection such as might oblige the momentary rulers to forbear their attempts on neighboring states or to render these attempts less operative if they should kindle new wars when was it heard before that the internal repose of a determined and wicked enemy and the strength of his government became the wish of his neighbor and a security against either his malice or his ambition the direct contrary has always been inferred from that state of things accordingly it has ever been the policy of those who would preserve themselves against the enterprises of such a malignant and mischievous power to cut out so much work for him in his own states as might keep his dangerous activity employed at home  it is said in vindication of this system which demands the stability of the regicide power as a ground for peace with them that when they have obtained as now it is said though not by this noble author they have a permanent government they will be able to preserve amity with this kingdom and with others who have the misfortune to be in their neighborhood granted they will be able to do so without question but are they willing to do so produce the act produce the declaration have they made any single step towards it have they ever once proposed to treat  the assurance of a stable peace grounded on the stability of their system proceeds on this hypothesisthat their hostility to other nations has proceeded from their anarchy at home and from the prevalence of a populace which their government had not strength enough to master this i utterly deny i insist upon it as a fact that in the daring commencement of all their hostilities and their astonishing perseverance in them so as never once in any fortune high or low to propose a treaty of peace to any power in europe they have never been actuated by the people on the contrary the people i will not say have been moved but impelled by them and have generally acted under a compulsion of which most of us are as yet thank god unable to form an adequate idea the war against austria was formally declared by the unhappy louis the sixteenth but who has ever considered louis the sixteenth since the revolution to have been the government the second regicide assembly then the only government was the author of that war and neither the nominal king nor the nominal people had anything to do with it further than in a reluctant obedience it is to delude ourselves to consider the state of france since their revolution as a state of anarchy it is something far worse anarchy it is undoubtedly if compared with government pursuing the peace order morals and prosperity of the people but regarding only the power that has really guided from the day of the revolution to this time it has been of all governments the most absolute despotic and effective that has hitherto appeared on earth never were the views and politics of any government pursued with half the regularity system and method that a diligent observer must have contemplated with amazement and terror in theirs their state is not an anarchy but a series of shortlived tyrannies we do not call a republic with annual magistrates an anarchy theirs is that kind of republic but the succession is not effected by the expiration of the term of the magistrates service but by his murder every new magistracy succeeding by homicide is auspicated by accusing its predecessors in the office of tyranny and it continues by the exercise of what they charged upon others  this strong hand is the law and the sole law in their state i defy any person to show any other lawor if any such should be found on paper that it is in the smallest degree or in any one instance regarded or practised in all their successions not one magistrate or one form of magistracy has expired by a mere occasional popular tumult everything has been the effect of the studied machinations of the one revolutionary cabal operating within itself upon itself that cabal is all in all france has no public it is the only nation i ever heard of where the people are absolutely slaves in the fullest sense in all affairs public and private great and small even down to the minutest and most recondite parts of their household concerns the helots of laconia the regardants to the manor in russia and in poland even the negroes in the west indies know nothing of so searching so penetrating so heartbreaking a slavery much would these servile wretches call for our pity under that unheardof yoke if for their perfidious and unnatural rebellion and for their murder of the mildest of all monarchs they did not richly deserve a punishment not greater than their crime  on the whole therefore i take it to be a great mistake to think that the want of power in the government furnished a natural cause of war whereas the greatness of its power joined to its use of that power the nature of its system and the persons who acted in it did naturally call for a strong military resistance to oppose them and rendered it not only just but necessary but at present i say no more on the genius and character of the power set up in france i may probably trouble you with it more at large hereafter this subject calls for a very full exposure at present it is enough for me if i point it out as a matter well worthy of consideration whether the true ground of hostility was not rightly conceived very early in this war and whether anything has happened to change that system except our ill success in a war which in no principal instance had its true destination as the object of its operations that the war has succeeded ill in many cases is undoubted but then let us speak the truth and say we are defeated exhausted dispirited and must submit this would be intelligible the world would be inclined to pardon the abject conduct of an undone nation but let us not conceal from ourselves our real situation whilst by every species of humiliation we are but too strongly displaying our sense of it to the enemy  the writer of the remarks in the last week of october appears to think that the present government in france contains many of the elements which when properly arranged are known to form the best practical governmentsand that the system whatever may become its particular form is no longer likely to be an obstacle to negotiation if its form now be no obstacle to such negotiation i do not know why it was ever so suppose that this government promised greater permanency than any of the former a point on which i can form no judgment still a link is wanting to couple the permanence of the government with the permanence of the peace on this not one word is said nor can there be in my opinion this deficiency is made up by strengthening the first ringlet of the chain that ought to be but that is not stretched to connect the two propositions all seems to be done if we can make out that the last french edition of regicide is like to prove stable  as a prognostic of this stability it is said to be accepted by the people here again i join issue with the fraternizers and positively deny the fact some submission or other has been obtained by some means or other to every government that hitherto has been set up and the same submission would by the same means be obtained for any other project that the wit or folly of man could possibly devise the constitution of 1790 was universally received the constitution which followed it under the name of a convention was universally submitted to the constitution of 1793 was universally accepted unluckily this years constitution which was formed and its genethliacon sung by the noble author while it was yet in embryo or was but just come bloody from the womb is the only one which in its very formation has been generally resisted by a very great and powerful party in many parts of the kingdom and particularly in the capital it never had a popular choice even in show those who arbitrarily erected the new building out of the old materials of their own convention were obliged to send for an army to support their work like brave gladiators they fought it out in the streets of paris and even massacred each other in their house of assembly in the most edifying manner and for the entertainment and instruction of their excellencies the foreign ambassadors who had a box in this constitutional amphitheatre of a free people  at length after a terrible struggle the troops prevailed over the citizens the citizen soldiers the everfamed national guards who had deposed and murdered their sovereign were disarmed by the inferior trumpeters of that rebellion twenty thousand regular troops garrison paris thus a complete military government is formed it has the strength and it may count on the stability of that kind of power this power is to last as long as the parisians think proper every other ground of stability but from military force and terror is clean out of the question to secure them further they have a strong corps of irregulars readyarmed thousands of those hellhounds called terrorists whom they had shut up in prison on their last revolution as the satellites of tyranny are let loose on the people the whole of their government in its origination in its continuance in all its actions and in all its resources is force and nothing but force a forced constitution a forced election a forced subsistence a forced requisition of soldiers a forced loan of money  they differ nothing from all the preceding usurpations but that to the same odium a good deal more of contempt is added in this situation notwithstanding all their military force strengthened with the undisciplined power of the terrorists and the nearly general disarming of paris there would almost certainly have been before this an insurrection against them but for one cause the people of france languish for peace they all despaired of obtaining it from the coalesced powers whilst they had a gang of professed regicides at their head and several of the least desperate republicans would have joined with better men to shake them wholly off and to produce something more ostensible if they had not been reiteratedly told that their sole hope of peace was the very contrary to what they naturally imagined that they must leave off their cabals and insurrections which could serve no purpose but to bring in that royalty which was wholly rejected by the coalesced kings that to satisfy them they must tranquilly if they could not cordially submit themselves to the tyranny and the tyrants they despised and abhorred peace was held out by the allied monarchies to the people of france as a bounty for supporting the republic of regicides in fact a coalition begun for the avowed purpose of destroying that den of robbers now exists only for their support if evil happens to the princes of europe from the success and stability of this infernal business it is their own absolute crime  we are to understand however for sometimes so the author hints that something stable in the constitution of regicide was required for our amity with it but the noble remarker is no more solicitous about this point than he is for the permanence of the whole body of his october speculations if says he speaking of the regicide they can obtain a practicable constitution even for a limited period of time they will be in a condition to reestablish the accustomed relations of peace and amity pray let us leave this bushfighting what is meant by a limited period of time does it mean the direct contrary to the terms an unlimited period if it is a limited period what limitation does he fix as a ground for his opinion otherwise his limitation is unlimited if he only requires a constitution that will last while the treaty goes on ten days existence will satisfy his demands he knows that france never did want a practicable constitution nor a government which endured for a limited period of time her constitutions were but too practicable and short as was their duration it was but too long they endured time enough for treaties which benefited themselves and have done infinite mischief to our cause but granting him his strange thesis that hitherto the mere form or the mere term of their constitutions and not their indisposition but their instability has been the cause of their not preserving the relations of amityhow could a constitution which might not last half an hour after the noble lords signature of the treaty in the company in which he must sign it insure its observance if you trouble yourself at all with their constitutions you are certainly more concerned with them after the treaty than before it as the observance of conventions is of infinitely more consequence than the making them can anything be more palpably absurd and senseless than to object to a treaty of peace for want of durability in constitutions which had an actual duration and to trust a constitution that at the time of the writing had not so much as a practical existence there is no way of accounting for such discourse in the mouths of men of sense but by supposing that they secretly entertain a hope that the very act of having made a peace with the regicides will give a stability to the regicide system this will not clear the discourse from the absurdity but it will account for the conduct which such reasoning so ill defends what a roundabout way is this to peaceto make war for the destruction of regicides and then to give them peace in order to insure a stability that will enable them to observe it i say nothing of the honor displayed in such a system it is plain it militates with itself almost in all the parts of it in one part it supposes stability in their constitution as a ground of a stable peace in another part we are to hope for peace in a different waythat is by splitting this brilliant orb into little stars and this would make the face of heaven so fine no there is no system upon which the peace which in humility we are to supplicate can possibly stand  i believe before this time that the more form of a constitution in any country never was fixed as the sole ground of objecting to a treaty with it with other circumstances it may be of great moment what is incumbent on the assertors of the fourth week of october system to prove is not whether their then expected constitution was likely to be stable or transitory but whether it promised to this country and its allies and to the peace and settlement of all europe more goodwill or more good faith than any of the experiments which have gone before it on these points i would willingly join issue  observe first the manner in which the remarker describes very truly as i conceive the people of france under that auspicious government and then observe the conduct of that government to other nations the people without any established constitution distracted by popular convulsions in a state of inevitable bankruptcy without any commerce with their principal ports blockaded and without a fleet that could venture to face one of our detached squadrons admitting as fully as he has stated it this condition of france i would fain know how he reconciles this condition with his ideas of any kind of a practicable constitution or duration for a limited period which are his sine qua non of peace but passing by contradictions as no fair objections to reasoning this state of things would naturally at other times and in other governments have produced a disposition to peace almost on any terms but in that state of their country did the regicide government solicit peace or amity with other nations or even lay any specious grounds for it in propositions of affected moderation or in the most loose and general conciliatory language the direct contrary it was but a very few days before the noble writer had commenced his remarks as if it were to refute him by anticipation that his france thought fit to lay out a new territorial map of dominion and to declare to us and to all europe what territories she was willing to allot to her own empire and what she is content during her good pleasure to leave to others  this their law of empire was promulgated without any requisition on that subject and proclaimed in a style and upon principles which never had been heard of in the annals of arrogance and ambition she prescribed the limits to her empire not upon principles of treaty convention possession usage habitude the distinction of tribes nations or languages but by physical aptitudes having fixed herself as the arbiter of physical dominion she construed the limits of nature by her convenience that was nature which most extended and best secured the empire of france  i need say no more on the insult offered not only to all equity and justice but to the common sense of mankind in deciding legal property by physical principles and establishing the convenience of a party as a rule of public law the noble advocate for peace has indeed perfectly well exploded this daring and outrageous system of pride and tyranny i am most happy in commending him when he writes like himself but hear still further and in the same good strain the great patron and advocate of amity with this accommodating mild and unassuming power when he reports to you the law they give and its immediate effectsthey amount says he to the sacrifice of powers that have been the most nearly connected with usthe direct or indirect annexation to france of all the ports of the continent from dunkirk to hamburgan immense accession of territoryand in one word the abandonment of the independence of europe this is the law the author and i use no different terms which this new government almost as soon as it could cry in the cradle and as one of the very first acts by which it auspicated its entrance into function the pledge it gives of the firmness of its policysuch is the law that this proud power prescribes to abject nations what is the comment upon this law by the great jurist who recommends us to the tribunal which issued the decree an obedience to it would be says he dishonorable to us and exhibit us to the present age and to posterity as submitting to the law prescribed to us by our enemy  here i recognize the voice of a british plenipotentiary i begin to feel proud of my country but alas the short date of human elevation the accents of dignity died upon his tongue this author will not assure us of his sentiments for the whole of a pamphlet but in the sole energetic part of it he does not continue the same through an whole sentence if it happens to be of any sweep or compass in the very womb of this last sentence pregnant as it should seem with a hercules there is formed a little bantling of the mortal race a degenerate puny parenthesis that totally frustrates our most sanguine views and expectations and disgraces the whole gestation here is this destructive parenthesis unless some adequate compensation be secured to us to us the christian world may shift for itself europe may groan in slavery we may be dishonored by receiving law from an enemybut all is well provided the compensation to us be adequate to what are we reserved an adequate compensation for the sacrifice of powers the most nearly connected with usan adequate compensation for the direct or indirect annexation to france of all the ports of the continent from dunkirk to hamburgan adequate compensation for the abandonment of the independence of europe would that when all our manly sentiments are thus changed our manly language were changed along with them and that the english tongue were not employed to utter what our ancestors never dreamed could enter into an english heart  but let us consider this matter of adequate compensation who is to furnish it from what funds is it to be drawn is it by another treaty of commerce i have no objections to treaties of commerce upon principles of commerce traffic for trafficall is fair but commerce in exchange for empire for safety for glory we set out in our dealing with a miserable cheat upon ourselves i know it may be said that we may prevail on this proud philosophical military republic which looks down with contempt on trade to declare it unfit for the sovereign of nations to be eundem negotiatorem et dominum that in virtue of this maxim of her state the english in france may be permitted as the jews are in poland and in turkey to execute all the little inglorious occupationsto be the sellers of new and the buyers of old clothes to be their brokers and factors and to be employed in casting up their debits and credits whilst the master republic cultivates the arts of empire prescribes the forms of peace to nations and dictates laws to a subjected world but are we quite sure that when we have surrendered half europe to them in hope of this compensation the republic will confer upon us those privileges of dishonor are we quite certain that she will permit us to farm the guillotineto contract for the provision of her twenty thousand bastilesto furnish transports for the myriads of her exiles to guianato become commissioners for her naval storesor to engage for the clothing of those armies which are to subdue the poor relics of christian europe no she is bespoke by the jew subjects of her own amsterdam for all these services  but if these or matters similar are not the compensations the remarker demands and that on consideration he finds them neither adequate nor certain who else is to be the chapman and to furnish the purchasemoney at this market of all the grand principles of empire of law of civilization of morals and of religion where british faith and honor are to be sold by inch of candle who is to be the dedecorum pretiosus emptor is it the navis hispanæ magister is it to be furnished by the prince of peace unquestionably spain as yet possesses mines of gold and silver and may give us in pesos duros an adequate compensation for our honor and our virtue when these things are at all to be sold they are the vilest commodities at market  it is full as singular as any of the other singularities in this work that the remarker talking so much as he does of cessions and compensations passes by spain in his general settlement as if there were no such country on the globeas if there were no spain in europe no spain in america but this great matter of political deliberation cannot be put out of our thoughts by his silence she has furnished compensationsnot to you but to france the regicide republic and the still nominally subsisting monarchy of spain are unitedand are united upon a principle of jealousy if not of bitter enmity to great britain the noble writer has here another matter for meditation it is not from dunkirk to hamburg that the ports are in the hands of france they are in the hands of france from hamburg to gibraltar how long the new dominion will last i cannot tell but france the republic has conquered spain and the ruling party in that court acts by her orders and exists by her power  the noble writer in his views into futurity has forgotten to look back to the past if he chooses it he may recollect that on the prospect of the death of philip the fourth and still more on the event all europe was moved to its foundations in the treaties of partition that first were entered into and in the war that afterwards blazed out to prevent those crowns from being actually or virtually united in the house of bourbon the predominance of france in spain and above all in the spanish indies was the great object of all these movements in the cabinet and in the field the grand alliance was formed upon that apprehension on that apprehension the mighty war was continued during such a number of years as the degenerate and pusillanimous impatience of our dwindled race can hardly bear to have reckoned a war equal within a few years in duration and not perhaps inferior in bloodshed to any of those great contests for empire which in history make the most awful matter of recorded memory      ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis     omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu     horrida contremuere sub altis ætheris auris     in dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum     omnibus humanis esset terrâque marique  when this war was ended i cannot stay now to examine how the object of the war was the object of the treaty when it was found impracticable or less desirable than before wholly to exclude a branch of the bourbon race from that immense succession the point of utrecht was to prevent the mischiefs to arise from the influence of the greater upon the lesser branch his lordship is a great member of the diplomatic body he has of course all the fundamental treaties which make the public statute law of europe by heart and indeed no active member of parliament ought to be ignorant of their general tenor and leading provisions in the treaty which closed that war and of which it is a fundamental part because relating to the whole policy of the compact it was agreed that spain should not give anything from her territory in the west indies to france this article apparently onerous to spain was in truth highly beneficial but oh the blindness of the greatest statesman to the infinite and unlookedfor combinations of things which lie hid in the dark prolific womb of futurity the great trunk of bourbon is cut down the withered branch is worked up into the construction of a french regicide republic here we have formed a new unlookedfor monstrous heterogeneous alliancea doublenatured monster republic above and monarchy below there is no centaur of fiction no poetic satyr of the woods nothing short of the hieroglyphic monsters of egypt dog in head and man in body that can give an idea of it none of these things can subsist in nature so at least it is thought but the moral world admits monsters which the physical rejects  in this metamorphosis the first thing done by spain in the honeymoon of her new servitude was with all the hardihood of pusillanimity utterly to defy the most solemn treaties with great britain and the guaranty of europe she has yielded the largest and fairest part of one of the largest and fairest islands in the west indies perhaps on the globe to the usurped powers of france she completes the title of those powers to the whole of that important central island of hispaniola she has solemnly surrendered to the regicides and butchers of the bourbon family what that court never ventured perhaps never wished to bestow on the patriarchal stock of her own august house  the noble negotiator takes no notice of this portentous junction and this audacious surrender the effect is no less than the total subversion of the balance of power in the west indies and indeed everywhere else this arrangement considered in itself but much more as it indicates a complete union of france with spain is truly alarming does he feel nothing of the change this makes in that part of his description of the state of france where he supposes her not able to face one of our detached squadrons does he feel nothing for the condition of portugal under this new coalition is it for this state of things he recommends our junction in that common alliance as a remedy it is surely already monstrous enough we see every standing principle of policy every old governing opinion of nations completely gone and with it the foundation of all their establishments can spain keep herself internally where she is with this connection does he dream that spain unchristian or even uncatholic can exist as a monarchy this author indulges himself in speculations of the division of the french republic i only say that with much greater reason he might speculate on the republicanism and the subdivision of spain  it is not peace with france which secures that feeble government it is that peace which if it shall continue decisively ruins spain such a peace is not the peace which the remnant of christianity celebrates at this holy season in it there is no glory to god on high and not the least tincture of goodwill to man what things we have lived to see the king of spain in a group of moors jews and renegadoes and the clergy taxed to pay for his conversion the catholic king in the strict embraces of the most unchristian republic i hope we shall never see his apostolic majesty his faithful majesty and the king defender of the faith added to that unhallowed and impious fraternity  the noble author has glimpses of the consequences of peace as well as i he feels for the colonies of great britain one of the principal resources of our commerce and our naval power if piratical france shall be established as he knows she must be in the west indies if we sue for peace on such terms as they may condescend to grant us he feels that their very colonial system for the interior is not compatible with the existence of our colonies i tell him and doubt not i shall be able to demonstrate that being what she is if she possesses a rock there we cannot be safe has this author had in his view the transactions between the regicide republic and the yet nominally subsisting monarchy of spain  i bring this matter under your lordships consideration that you may have a more complete view than this author chooses to give of the true france you have to deal with as to its nature and to its force and its disposition mark it my lord france in giving her law to spain stipulated for none of her indemnities in europe no enlargement whatever of her frontier whilst we are looking for indemnities from france betraying our own safety in a sacrifice of the independence of europe france secures hers by the most important acquisition of territory ever made in the west indies since their first settlement she appears it is only in appearance to give up the frontier of spain and she is compensated not in appearance but in reality by a territory that makes a dreadful frontier to the colonies of great britain  it is sufficiently alarming that she is to have the possession of this great island but all the spanish colonies virtually are hers is there so puny a whipster in the petty form of the school of politics who can be at a loss for the fate of the british colonies when he combines the french and spanish consolidation with the known critical and dubious dispositions of the united states of america as they are at present but which when a peace is made when the basis of a regicide ascendency in spain is laid will no longer be so good as dubious and critical but i go a great deal further and on much consideration of the condition and circumstances of the west indies and of the genius of this new republic as it has operated and is likely to operate on them i say that if a single rock in the west indies is in the hands of this transatlantic morocco we have not an hours safety there  the remarker though he slips aside from the main consideration seems aware that this arrangement standing as it does in the west indies leaves us at the mercy of the new coalition or rather at the mercy of the sole guiding part of it he does not indeed adopt a supposition such as i make who am confident that anything which can give them a single good port and opportune piratical station there would lead to our ruin the author proceeds upon an idea that the regicides may be an existing and considerable territorial power in the west indies and of course her piratical system more dangerous and as real however for that desperate case he has an easy remedy but surely in his whole shop there is nothing so extraordinary it is that we three france spain and england there are no other of any moment should adopt some analogy in the interior systems of government in the several islands which we may respectively retain after the closing of the war this plainly can be done only by a convention between the parties and i believe it would be the first war ever made to terminate in an analogy of the interior government of any country or any parts of such countries such a partnership in domestic government is i think carrying fraternity as far as it will go  it will be an affront to your sagacity to pursue this matter into all its details suffice it to say that if this convention for analogous domestic government is made it immediately gives a right for the residence of a consul in all likelihood some negro or man of color in every one of your islands a regicide ambassador in london will be at all your meetings of west india merchants and planters and in effect in all our colonial councils not one order of council can hereafter be made or any one act of parliament relative to the west india colonies even be agitated which will not always afford reasons for protests and perpetual interference the regicide republic will become an integral part of the colonial legislature and so far as the colonies are concerned of the british too but it will be still worse as all our domestic affairs are interlaced more or less intimately with our external this intermeddling must everywhere insinuate itself into all other interior transactions and produce a copartnership in our domestic concerns of every description  such are the plain inevitable consequences of this arrangement of a system of analogous interior government on the other hand without it the author assures us and in this i heartily agree with him that the correspondence and communications between the neighboring colonies will be great that the disagreements will be incessant and that causes even of national quarrels will arise from day to day most true but for the reasons i have given the case if possible will be worse by the proposed remedy by the triple fraternal interior analogyan analogy itself most fruitful and more foodful than the old ephesian statue with the three tier of breasts your lordship must also observe how infinitely this business must be complicated by our interference in the slowpaced saturnian movements of spain and the rapid parabolic flights of france but such is the diseasesuch is the curesuch is and must be the effect of regicide vicinity  but what astonishes me is that the negotiator who has certainly an exercised understanding did not see that every person habituated to such meditations must necessarily pursue the train of thought further than he has carried it and must ask himself whether what he states so truly of the necessity of our arranging an analogous interior government in consequence of the vicinity of our possessions in the west indies does not as extensively apply and much more forcibly to the circumstance of our much nearer vicinity with the parent and author of this mischief i defy even his acuteness and ingenuity to show me any one point in which the cases differ except that it is plainly more necessary in europe than in america indeed the further we trace the details of the proposed peace the more your lordship will be satisfied that i have not been guilty of any abuse of terms when i use indiscriminately as i always do in speaking of arrangements with regicide the words peace and fraternity an analogy between our interior governments must be the consequence the noble negotiator sees it as well as i do i deprecate this jacobin interior analogy but hereafter perhaps i may say a good deal more upon this part of the subject  the noble lord insists on very little more than on the excellence of their constitution the hope of their dwindling into little republics and this close copartnership in government i hear of others indeed that offer by other arguments to reconcile us to this peace and fraternity the regicides they say have renounced the creed of the rights of man and declared equality a chimera this is still more strange than all the rest they have apostatized from their apostasy they are renegadoes from that impious faith for which they subverted the ancient government murdered their king and imprisoned butchered confiscated and banished their fellowsubjects and to which they forced every man to swear at the peril of his life and now to reconcile themselves to the world they declare this creed bought by so much blood to be an imposture and a chimera i have no doubt that they always thought it to be so when they were destroying everything at home and abroad for its establishment it is no strange thing to those who look into the nature of corrupted man to find a violent persecutor a perfect unbeliever of his own creed but this is the very first time that any man or set of men were hardy enough to attempt to lay the ground of confidence in them by an acknowledgment of their own falsehood fraud hypocrisy treachery heterodox doctrine persecution and cruelty everything we hear from them is new and to use a phrase of their own revolutionary everything supposes a total revolution in all the principles of reason prudence and moral feeling if possible this their recantation of the chief parts in the canon of the rights of man is more infamous and causes greater horror than their originally promulgating and forcing down the throats of mankind that symbol of all evil it is raking too much into the dirt and ordure of human nature to say more of it  i hear it said too that they have lately declared in favor of property this is exactly of the same sort with the former what need had they to make this declaration if they did not know that by their doctrines and practices they had totally subverted all property what government of europe either in its origin or its continuance has thought it necessary to declare itself in favor of property the more recent ones were formed for its protection against former violations the old consider the inviolability of property and their own existence as one and the same thing and that a proclamation for its safety would be sounding an alarm on its danger but the regicide banditti knew that this was not the first time they have been obliged to give such assurances and had as often falsified them they knew that after butchering hundreds of men women and children for no other cause than to lay hold on their property such a declaration might have a chance of encouraging other nations to run the risk of establishing a commercial house amongst them it is notorious that these very jacobins upon an alarm of the shopkeeper of paris made this declaration in favor of property these brave fellows received the apprehensions expressed on that head with indignation and said that property could be in no danger because all the world knew it was under the protection of the sansculottes at what period did they not give this assurance did they not give it when they fabricated their first constitution did they not then solemnly declare it one of the rights of a citizen a right of course only declared and not then fabricated to depart from his country and choose another domicilium without detriment to his property did they not declare that no property should be confiscated from the children for the crime of the parent can they now declare more fully their respect for property than they did at that time and yet was there ever known such horrid violences and confiscations as instantly followed under the very persons now in power many of them leading members of that assembly and all of them violators of that engagement which was the very basis of their republicconfiscations in which hundreds of men women and children not guilty of one act of duty in resisting their usurpation were involved this keeping of their old is then to give us a confidence in their new engagements but examine the matter and you will see that the prevaricating sons of violence give no relief at all where at all it can be wanted they renew their old fraudulent declaration against confiscations and then they expressly exclude all adherents to their ancient lawful government from any benefit of it that is to say they promise that they will secure all their brother plunderers in their share of the common plunder the fear of being robbed by every new succession of robbers who do not keep even the faith of that kind of society absolutely required that they should give security to the dividends of spoil else they could not exist a moment but it was necessary in giving security to robbers that honest men should be deprived of all hope of restitution and thus their interests were made utterly and eternally incompatible so that it appears that this boasted security of property is nothing more than a seal put upon its destruction this ceasing of confiscation is to secure the confiscators against the innocent proprietors that very thing which is held out to you as your cure is that which makes your malady and renders it if once it happens utterly incurable you my lord who possess a considerable though not an invidious estate may be well assured that if by being engaged as you assuredly would be in the defence of your religion your king your order your laws and liberties that estate should be put under confiscation the property would be secured but in the same manner at your expense  but after all for what purpose are we told of this reformation in their principles and what is the policy of all this softening in ours which is to be produced by their example it is not to soften us to suffering innocence and virtue but to mollify us to the crimes and to the society of robbers and ruffians but i trust that our countrymen will not be softened to that kind of crimes and criminals for if we should our hearts will be hardened to everything which has a claim on our benevolence a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice they who bear cruelty are accomplices in it the pretended gentleness which excludes that charitable rancor produces an indifference which is half an approbation they never will love where they ought to love who do not hate where they ought to hate  there is another piece of policy not more laudable than this in reading these moral lectures which lessens our hatred to criminals and our pity to sufferers by insinuating that it has been owing to their fault or folly that the latter have become the prey of the former by flattering us that we are not subject to the same vices and follies it induces a confidence that we shall not suffer the same evils by a contact with the infamous gang of robbers who have thus robbed and butchered our neighbors before our faces we must not be flattered to our ruin our vices are the same as theirs neither more nor less if any faults we had which wanted this french example to call us to a softening of character and a review of our social relations and duties there is yet no sign that we have commenced our reformation we seem by the best accounts i have from the world to go on just as formerly some to undo and some to be undone there is no change at all and if we are not bettered by the sufferings of war this peace which for reasons to himself best known the author fixes as the period of our reformation must have something very extraordinary in it because hitherto ease opulence and their concomitant pleasure have never greatly disposed mankind to that serious reflection and review which the author supposes to be the result of the approaching peace with vice and crime i believe he forms a right estimate of the nature of this peace and that it will want many of those circumstances which formerly characterizes that state of things  if i am right in my ideas of this new republic the different states of peace and war will make no difference in her pursuits it is not an enemy of accident that we have to deal with enmity to us and to all civilized nations is wrought into the very stamina of its constitution it was made to pursue the purposes of that fundamental enmity the design will go on regularly in every position and in every relation their hostility is to break us to their dominion their amity is to debauch us to their principles in the former we are to contend with their force in the latter with their intrigues but we stand in a very different posture of defence in the two situations in war so long as government is supported we fight with the whole united force of the kingdom when under the name of peace the war of intrigue begins we do not contend against our enemies with the whole force of the kingdom nowe shall have to fight if it should be a fight at all and not an ignominious surrender of everything which has made our country venerable in our eyes and dear to our hearts we shall have to light with but a portion of our strength against the whole of theirs gentlemen who not long since thought with us but who now recommend a jacobin peace were at that time sufficiently aware of the existence of a dangerous jacobin faction within this kingdom awhile ago they seemed to be tremblingly alive to the number of those who composed it to their dark subtlety to their fierce audacity to their admiration of everything that passes in france to their eager desire of a close communication with the mother faction there at this moment when the question is upon the opening of that communication not a word of our english jacobins that faction is put out of sight and out of thought it vanished at the crowing of the cock scarcely had the gallic harbinger of peace and light begun to utter his lively notes than all the cackling of us poor tory geese to alarm the garrison of the capitol was forgot11 there was enough of indemnity before now a complete act of oblivion is passed about the jacobins of england though one would naturally imagine it would make a principal object in all fair deliberation upon the merits of a project of amity with the jacobins of france but however others may choose to forget the faction the faction does not choose to forget itself nor however gentlemen may choose to flatter themselves it does not forget them  never in any civil contest has a part been taken with more of the warmth or carried on with more of the arts of a party the jacobins are worse than lost to their country their hearts are abroad their sympathy with the regicides of france is complete just as in a civil contest they exult in all their victories they are dejected and mortified in all their defeats nothing that the regicides can do and they have labored hard for the purpose can alienate them from their cause you and i my dear lord have often observed on the spirit of their conduct when the jacobins of france by their studied deliberated catalogued files of murders with the poniard the sabre and the tribunal have shocked whatever remained of human sensibility in our breasts then it was they distinguished the resources of party policy they did not venture directly to confront the public sentiment for a very short time they seemed to partake of it they began with a reluctant and sorrowful confession they deplored the stains which tarnished the lustre of a good cause after keeping a decent time of retirement in a few days crept out an apology for the excesses of men cruelly irritated by the attacks of unjust power grown bolder as the first feeling of mankind decayed and the color of these horrors began to fade upon the imagination they proceeded from apology to defence they urged but still deplored the absolute necessity of such a proceeding then they made a bolder stride and marched from defence to recrimination they attempted to assassinate the memory of those whose bodies their friends had massacred and to consider their murder as a less formal act of justice they endeavored even to debauch our pity and to suborn it in favor of cruelty they wept over the lot of those who were driven by the crimes of aristocrats to republican vengeance every pause of their cruelty they considered as a return of their natural sentiments of benignity and justice then they had recourse to history and found out all the recorded cruelties that deform the annals of the world in order that the massacres of the regicides might pass for a common event and even that the most merciful of princes who suffered by their hands should bear the iniquity of all the tyrants who have at any time infested the earth in order to reconcile us the better to this republican tyranny they confounded the bloodshed of war with the murders of peace and they computed how much greater prodigality of blood was exhibited in battles and in the storm of cities than in the frugal wellordered massacres of the revolutionary tribunals of france  as to foreign powers so long as they were conjoined with great britain in this contest so long they were treated as the most abandoned tyrants and indeed the basest of the human race the moment any of them quits the cause of this government and of all governments he is rehabilitated his honor is restored all attainders are purged the friends of jacobins are no longer despots the betrayers of the common cause are no longer traitors  that you may not doubt that they look on this war as a civil war and the jacobins of france as of their party and that they look upon us though locally their countrymen in reality as enemies they have never failed to run a parallel between our late civil war and this war with the jacobins of france they justify their partiality to those jacobins by the partiality which was shown by several here to the colonies and they sanction their cry for peace with the regicides of france by some of our propositions for peace with the english in america  this i do not mention as entering into the controversy how far they are right or wrong in this parallel but to show that they do make it and that they do consider themselves as of a party with the jacobins of france you cannot forget their constant correspondence with the jacobins whilst it was in their power to carry it on when the communication is again opened the interrupted correspondence will commence we cannot be blind to the advantage which such a party affords to regicide france in all her viewsand on the other hand what an advantage regicide france holds out to the views of the republican party in england slightly as they have considered their subject i think this can hardly have escaped the writers of political ephemerides for any month or year they have told us much of the amendment of the regicides of france and of their returning honor and generosity have they told anything of the reformation and of the returning loyalty of the jacobins of england have they told us of their gradual softening towards royalty have they told us what measures they are taking for putting the crown in commission and what approximations of any kind they are making towards the old constitution of their country nothing of this the silence of these writers is dreadfully expressive they dare not touch the subject but it is not annihilated by their silence nor by our indifference it is but too plain that our constitution cannot exist with such a communication our humanity our manners our morals our religion cannot stand with such a communication the constitution is made by those things and for those things without them it cannot exist and without them it is no matter whether it exists or not  it was an ingenious parliamentary christmas play by which in both houses you anticipated the holidays it was a relaxation from your graver employment it was a pleasant discussion you had which part of the family of the constitution was the elder branchwhether one part did not exist prior to the others and whether it might exist and flourish if the others were cast into the fire12 in order to make this saturnalian amusement general in the family you sent it down stairs that judges and juries might partake of the entertainment the unfortunate antiquary and augur who is the butt of all this sport may suffer in the roistering horseplay and practical jokes of the servants hall but whatever may become of him the discussion itself and the timing it put me in mind of what i have read where i do not recollect that the subtle nation of the greeks were busily employed in the church of santa sophia in a dispute of mixed natural philosophy metaphysics and theology whether the light on mount tabor was created or uncreated and were ready to massacre the holders of the unfashionable opinion at the very moment when the ferocious enemy of all philosophy and religion mahomet the second entered through a breach into the capital of the christian world i may possibly suffer much more than mr reeves i shall certainly give much more general offence for breaking in upon this constitutional amusement concerning the created or uncreated nature of the two houses of parliament and by calling their attention to a problem which may entertain them less but which concerns them a great deal morethat is whether with this gallic jacobin fraternity which they are desired by some writers to court all the parts of the government about whose combustible or incombustible qualities they are contending may not be cast into the fire together he is a strange visionary but he is nothing worse who fancies that any one part of our constitution whatever right of primogeniture it may claim or whatever astrologers may divine from its horoscope can possibly survive the others as they have lived so they will die together i must do justice to the impartiality of the jacobins i have not observed amongst them the least predilection for any of those parts if there has been any difference in their malice i think they have shown a worse disposition to the house of commons than to the crown as to the house of lords they do not speculate at all about it and for reasons that are too obvious to detail  the question will be concerning the effect of this french fraternity on the whole mass have we anything to apprehend from jacobin communication or have we not if we have not is it by our experience before the war that we are to presume that after the war no dangerous communion can exist between those who are well affected to the new constitution of france and ill affected to the old constitution here  in conversation i have not yet found nor heard of any persons except those who undertake to instruct the public so unconscious of the actual state of things or so little prescient of the future who do not shudder all over and feel a secret horror at the approach of this communication i do not except from this observation those who are willing more than i find myself disposed to submit to this fraternity never has it been mentioned in my hearing or from what i can learn in my inquiry without the suggestion of an alien bill or some other measures of the same nature as a defence against its manifest mischief who does not see the utter insufficiency of such a remedy if such a remedy could be at all adopted we expel suspected foreigners from hence and we suffer every englishman to pass over into france to be initiated in all the infernal discipline of the place to cabal and to be corrupted by every means of cabal and of corruption and then to return to england charged with their worst dispositions and designs in france he is out of the reach of your police and when he returns to england one such english emissary is worse than a legion of french who are either tonguetied or whose speech betrays them but the worst aliens are the ambassador and his train these you cannot expel without a proof always difficult of direct practice against the state a french ambassador at the head of a french party is an evil which we have never experienced the mischief is by far more visible than the remedy but after all every such measure as an alien bill is a measure of hostility a preparation for it or a cause of dispute that shall bring it on in effect it is fundamentally contrary to a relation of amity whose essence is a perfectly free communication everything done to prevent it will provoke a foreign war everything when we let it proceed will produce domestic distraction we shall be in a perpetual dilemma but it is easy to see which side of the dilemma will be taken the same temper which brings us to solicit a jacobin peace will induce us to temporize with all the evils of it by degrees our minds will be made to our circumstances the novelty of such things which produces half the horror and all the disgust will be worn off our ruin will be disguised in profit and the sale of a few wretched baubles will bribe a degenerate people to barter away the most precious jewel of their souls our constitution is not made for this kind of warfare it provides greatly for our happiness it furnishes few means for our defence it is formed in a great measure upon the principle of jealousy of the crownand as things stood when it took that turn with very great reason i go farther it must keep alive some part of that fire of jealousy eternally and chastely burning or it cannot be the british constitution at various periods we have had tyranny in this country more than enough we have had rebellions with more or less justification some of our kings have made adulterous connections abroad and trucked away for foreign gold the interests and glory of their crown but before this time our liberty has never been corrupted i mean to say that it has never been debauched from its domestic relations to this time it has been english liberty and english liberty only our love of liberty and our love of our country were not distinct things liberty is now it seems put upon a larger and more liberal bottom we are menand as men undoubtedly nothing human is foreign to us we cannot be too liberal in our general wishes for the happiness of our kind but in all questions on the mode of procuring it for any particular community we ought to be fearful of admitting those who have no interest in it or who have perhaps an interest against it into the consultation above all we cannot be too cautious in our communication with those who seek their happiness by other roads than those of humanity morals and religion and whose liberty consists and consists alone in being free from those restraints which are imposed by the virtues upon the passions  when we invite danger from a confidence in defensive measures we ought first of all to be sure that it is a species of danger against which any defensive measures that can be adopted will be sufficient next we ought to know that the spirit of our laws or that our own dispositions which are stronger than laws are susceptible of all those defensive measures which the occasion may require a third consideration is whether these measures will not bring more odium than strength to government and the last whether the authority that makes them in a general corruption of manners and principles can insure their execution let no one argue from the state of things as he sees them at present concerning what will be the means and capacities of government when the time arrives which shall call for remedies commensurate to enormous evils  it is an obvious truth that no constitution can defend itself it must be defended by the wisdom and fortitude of men these are what no constitution can give they are the gifts of god and he alone knows whether we shall possess such gifts at the time we stand in need of them constitutions furnish the civil means of getting at the natural it is all that in this case they can do but our constitution has more impediments than helps its excellencies when they come to be put to this sort of proof may be found among its defects  nothing looks more awful and imposing than an ancient fortification its lofty embattled walls its bold projecting rounded towers that pierce the sky strike the imagination and promise inexpugnable strength but they are the very things that make its weakness you may as well think of opposing one of these old fortresses to the mass of artillery brought by a french irruption into the field as to think of resisting by your old laws and your old forms the new destruction which the corps of jacobin engineers of today prepare for all such forms and all such laws besides the debility and false principle of their construction to resist the present modes of attack the fortress itself is in ruinous repair and there is a practicable breach in every part of it  such is the work but miserable works have been defended by the constancy of the garrison weatherbeaten ships have been brought safe to port by the spirit and alertness of the crew but it is here that we shall eminently fail the day that by their consent the seat of regicide has its place among the thrones of europe there is no longer a motive for zeal in their favor it will at best be cold unimpassioned dejected melancholy duty the glory will seem all on the other side the friends of the crown will appear not as champions but as victims discountenanced mortified lowered defeated they will fall into listlessness and indifference they will leave things to take their course enjoy the present hour and submit to the common fate  is it only an oppressive nightmare with which we have been loaded is it then all a frightful dream and are there no regicides in the world have we not heard of that prodigy of a ruffian who would not suffer his benignant sovereign with his hands tied behind him and stripped for execution to say one parting word to his deluded peopleof santerre who commanded the drums and trumpets to strike up to stifle his voice and dragged him backward to the machine of murder this nefarious villain for a few days i may call him so stands high in france as in a republic of robbers and murderers he ought what hinders this monster from being sent as ambassador to convey to his majesty the first compliments of his brethren the regicide directory they have none that can represent them more properly i anticipate the day of his arrival he will make his public entry into london on one of the pale horses of his brewery as he knows that we are pleased with the paris taste for the orders of knighthood13 he will fling a bloody sash across his shoulders with the order of the holy guillotine surmounting the crown appendant to the riband thus adorned he will proceed from whitechapel to the further end of pall mall all the music of london playing the marseillaise hymn before him and escorted by a chosen detachment of the légion de lÉchafaud it were only to be wished that no illfated loyalist for the imprudence of his zeal may stand in the pillory at charing cross under the statue of king charles the first at the time of this grand procession lest some of the rotten eggs which the constitutional society shall let fly at his indiscreet head may hit the virtuous murderer of his king they might soil the state dress which the ministers of so many crowned heads have admired and in which sir clement cotterel is to introduce him at st jamess  if santerre cannot be spared from the constitutional butcheries at home tallien may supply his place and in point of figure with advantage he has been habituated to commissions and he is as well qualified as santerre for this nero wished the roman people had but one neck the wish of the more exalted tallien when he sat in judgment was that his sovereign had eightythree heads that he might send one to every one of the departments tallien will make an excellent figure at guildhall at the next sheriffs feast he may open the ball with my lady mayoress but this will be after he has retired from the public table and gone into the private room for the enjoyment of more social and unreserved conversation with the ministers of state and the judges of the bench there these ministers and magistrates will hear him entertain the worthy aldermen with an instructing and pleasing narrative of the manner in which he made the rich citizens of bordeaux squeak and gently led them by the public credit of the guillotine to disgorge their antirevolutionary pelf  all this will be the display and the towntalk when our regicide is on a visit of ceremony at home nothing will equal the pomp and splendor of the hôtel de la république there another scene of gaudy grandeur will be opened when his citizen excellency keeps the festival which every citizen is ordered to observe for the glorious execution of louis the sixteenth and renews his oath of detestation of kings a grand ball of course will be given on the occasion then what a hurlyburly what a crowding what a glare of a thousand flambeaux in the square what a clamor of footmen contending at the door what a rattling of a thousand coaches of duchesses countesses and lady marys choking the way and overturning each other in a struggle who should be first to pay her court to the citoyenne the spouse of the twentyfirst husband he the husband of the thirtyfirst wife and to hail her in the rank of honorable matrons before the four days duration of marriage is expiredmorals as they were decorum the great outguard of the sex and the proud sentiment of honor which makes virtue more respectable where it is and conceals human frailty where virtue may not be will be banished from this land of propriety modesty and reserve  we had before an ambassador from the most christian king we shall have then one perhaps two as lately from the most antichristian republic his chapel will be great and splendid formed on the model of the temple of reason at paris while the famous ode of the infamous chénier will be sung and a prostitute of the street adored as a goddess we shall then have a french ambassador without a suspicion of popery one good it will have it will go some way in quieting the minds of that synod of zealous protestant lay elders who govern ireland on the pacific principles of polemic theology and who now from dread of the pope cannot take a cool bottle of claret or enjoy an innocent parliamentary job with any tolerable quiet  so far as to the french communication herewhat will be the effect of our communication there we know that our new brethren whilst they everywhere shut up the churches increased in paris at one time at least fourfold the operahouses the playhouses the public shows of all kinds and even in their state of indigence and distress no expense was spared for their equipment and decoration they were made an affair of state there is no invention of seduction never wholly wanting in that place that has not been increasedbrothels gaminghouses everything and there is no doubt but when they are settled in a triumphant peace they will carry all these arts to their utmost perfection and cover them with every species of imposing magnificence they have all along avowed them as a part of their policy and whilst they corrupt young minds through pleasure they form them to crimes every idea of corporal gratification is carried to the highest excess and wooed with all the elegance that belongs to the senses all elegance of mind and manners is banished a theatrical bombastic windy phraseology of heroic virtue blended and mingled up with a worse dissoluteness and joined to a murderous and savage ferocity forms the tone and idiom of their language and their manners any one who attends to all their own descriptions narratives and dissertations will find in that whole place more of the air of a body of assassins banditti housebreakers and outlawed smugglers joined to that of a gang of strolling players expelled from and exploded orderly theatres with their prostitutes in a brothel at their debauches and bacchanals than anything of the refined and perfected virtues or the polished mitigated vices of a great capital  is it for this benefit we open the usual relations of peace and amity is it for this our youth of both sexes are to form themselves by travel is it for this that with expense and pains we form their lisping infant accents to the language of france i shall be told that this abominable medley is made rather to revolt young and ingenuous minds so it is in the description so perhaps it may in reality to a chosen few so it may be when the magistrate the law and the church frown on such manners and the wretches to whom they belongwhen they are chased from the eye of day and the society of civil life into nightcellars and caves and woods but when these men themselves are the magistrateswhen all the consequence weight and authority of a great nation adopt themwhen we see them conjoined with victory glory power and dominion and homage paid to them by every governmentit is not possible that the downhill should not be slid into recommended by everything which has opposed it let it be remembered that no young man can go to any part of europe without taking this place of pestilential contagion in his way and whilst the less active part of the community will be debauched by this travel whilst children are poisoned at these schools our trade will put the finishing hand to our ruin no factory will be settled in france that will not become a club of complete french jacobins the minds of young men of that description will receive a taint in their religion their morals and their politics which they will in a short time communicate to the whole kingdom  whilst everything prepares the body to debauch and the mind to crime a regular church of avowed atheism established by law with a direct and sanguinary persecution of christianity is formed to prevent all amendment and remorse conscience is formally deposed from its dominion over the mind what fills the measure of horror is that schools of atheism are set up at the public charge in every part of the country that some english parents will be wicked enough to send their children to such schools there is no doubt better this island should be sunk to the bottom of the sea than that so far as human infirmity admits it should not be a country of religion and morals  with all these causes of corruption we may well judge what the general fashion of mind will be through both sexes and all conditions such spectacles and such examples will overbear all the laws that ever blackened the cumbrous volumes of our statutes when royalty shall have disavowed itselfwhen it shall have relaxed all the principles of its own supportwhen it has rendered the system of regicide fashionable and received it as triumphant in the very persons who have consolidated that system by the perpetration of every crime who have not only massacred the prince but the very laws and magistrates which were the support of royalty and slaughtered with an indiscriminate proscription without regard to either sex or age every person that was suspected of an inclination to king law or magistracyi say will any one dare to be loyal will any one presume against both authority and opinion to hold up this unfashionable antiquated exploded constitution  the jacobin faction in england must grow in strength and audacity it will be supported by other intrigues and supplied by other resources than yet we have seen in action confounded at its growth the government may fly to parliament for its support but who will answer for the temper of a house of commons elected under these circumstances who will answer for the courage of a house of commons to arm the crown with the extraordinary powers that it may demand but the ministers will not venture to ask half of what they know they want they will lose half of that half in the contest and when they have obtained their nothing they will be driven by the cries of faction either to demolish the feeble works they have thrown up in a hurry or in effect to abandon them as to the house of lords it is not worth mentioning the peers ought naturally to be the pillars of the crown but when their titles are rendered contemptible and their property invidious and a part of their weakness and not of their strength they will be found so many degraded and trembling individuals who will seek by evasion to put off the evil day of their ruin both houses will be in perpetual oscillation between abortive attempts at energy and still more unsuccessful attempts at compromise you will be impatient of your disease and abhorrent of your remedy a spirit of subterfuge and a tone of apology will enter into all your proceedings whether of law or legislation your judges who now sustain so masculine an authority will appear more on their trial than the culprits they have before them the awful frown of criminal justice will be smoothed into the silly smile of seduction judges will think to insinuate and soothe the accused into conviction and condemnation and to wheedle to the gallows the most artful of all delinquents but they will not be so wheedled they will not submit even to the appearance of persons on their trial their claim to this exemption will be admitted the place in which some of the greatest names which ever distinguished the history of this country have stood will appear beneath their dignity the criminal will climb from the dock to the sidebar and take his place and his tea with the counsel from the bar of the counsel by a natural progress he will ascend to the bench which long before had been virtually abandoned they who escape from justice will not suffer a question upon reputation they will take the crown of the causeway they will be revered as martyrs they will triumph as conquerors nobody will dare to censure that popular part of the tribunal whose only restraint on misjudgment is the censure of the public they who find fault with the decision will be represented as enemies to the institution juries that convict for the crown will be loaded with obloquy the juries who acquit will be held up as models of justice if parliament orders a prosecution and fails as fail it will it will be treated to its face as guilty of a conspiracy maliciously to prosecute its care in discovering a conspiracy against the state will be treated as a forged plot to destroy the liberty of the subject every such discovery instead of strengthening government will weaken its reputation  in this state things will be suffered to proceed lest measures of vigor should precipitate a crisis the timid will act thus from character the wise from necessity our laws had done all that the old condition of things dictated to render our judges erect and independent but they will naturally fail on the side upon which they had taken no precautions the judicial magistrates will find themselves safe as against the crown whose will is not their tenure the power of executing their office will be held at the pleasure of those who deal out fame or abuse as they think fit they will begin rather to consult their own repose and their own popularity than the critical and perilous trust that is in their hands they will speculate on consequences when they see at court an ambassador whose robes are lined with a scarlet dyed in the blood of judges it is no wonder nor are they to blame when they are to consider how they shall answer for their conduct to the criminal of today turned into the magistrate of tomorrow  the press  the army  when thus the helm of justice is abandoned an universal abandonment of all other posts will succeed government will be for a while the sport of contending factions who whilst they fight with one another will all strike at her she will be buffeted and beat forward and backward by the conflict of those billows until at length tumbling from the gallic coast the victorious tenth wave shall ride like the bore over all the rest and poop the shattered weatherbeaten leaky waterlogged vessel and sink her to the bottom of the abyss  among other miserable remedies that have been found in the materia medica of the old college a change of ministry will be proposed and probably will take place they who go out can never long with zeal and goodwill support government in the hands of those they hate in a situation of fatal dependence on popularity and without one aid from the little remaining power of the crown it is not to be expected that they will take on them that odium which more or less attaches upon every exertion of strong power the ministers of popularity will lose all their credit at a stroke if they pursue any of those means necessary to give life vigor and consistence to government they will be considered as venal wretches apostates recreant to all their own principles acts and declarations they cannot preserve their credit but by betraying that authority of which they are the guardians  to be sure no prognosticating symptoms of these things have as yet appearednothing even resembling their beginnings may they never appear may these prognostications of the author be justly laughed at and speedily forgotten if nothing as yet to cause them has discovered itself let us consider in the authors excuse that we have not yet seen a jacobin legation in england the natural declared sworn ally of sedition has not yet fixed its headquarters in london  there never was a political contest upon better or worse grounds that by the heat of partyspirit may not ripen into civil confusion if ever a party adverse to the crown should be in a condition here publicly to declare itself and to divide however unequally the natural force of the kingdom they are sure of an aid of fifty thousand men at ten days warning from the opposite coast of france but against this infusion of a foreign force the crown has its guaranties old and new but i should be glad to hear something said of the assistance which loyal subjects in france have received from other powers in support of that lawful government which secured their lawful property i should be glad to know if they are so disposed to a neighborly provident and sympathetic attention to their public engagements by what means they are to come at us is it from the powerful states of holland we are to reclaim our guaranty is it from the king of prussia and his steady good affections and his powerful navy that we are to look for the guaranty of our security is it from the netherlands which the french may cover with the swarms of their citizensoldiers in twentyfour hours that we are to look for this assistance this is to suppose too that all these powers have no views offensive or necessities defensive of their own they will cut out work for one another and france will cut out work for them all  that the christian religion cannot exist in this country with such a fraternity will not i think be disputed with me on that religion according to our mode all our laws and institutions stand as upon their base that scheme is supposed in every transaction of life and if that were done away everything else as in france must be changed along with it thus religion perishing and with it this constitution it is a matter of endless meditation what order of things would follow it but what disorder would fill the space between the present and that which is to come in the gross is no matter of doubtful conjecture it is a great evil that of a civil war but in that state of things a civil war which would give to good men and a good cause some means of struggle is a blessing of comparison that england will not enjoy the moment the struggle begins it ends they talk of mr humes euthanasia of the british constitution gently

power and greatness in my humble situation i can behold majesty in its splendor without being dazzled and i am capable of respecting it in its fall  it is madam from my strong sense of what is due to dignity in undeserved misfortune that i am led to felicitate your imperial majesty on the use you have lately made of your power the princes and nobility of france who from honor and duty from blood and from principle are attached to that unhappy crown have experienced your favor and countenance and there is no doubt that they will finally enjoy the full benefit of your protection the generosity of your imperial majesty has induced you to take an interest in their cause and your sagacity has made you perceive that in the case of the sovereign of france the cause of all sovereigns is triedthat in the case of its church the cause of all churchesand that in the case of its nobility is tried the cause of all the respectable orders of all society and even of society itself  your imperial majesty has sent your minister to reside where the crown of france in this disastrous eclipse of royalty can alone truly and freely be represented that is in its royal bloodwhere alone the nation can be represented that is in its natural and inherent dignity a throne cannot be represented by a prison the honor of a nation cannot be represented by an assembly which disgraces and degrades it at coblentz only the king and the nation of france are to be found  your imperial majesty who reigns and lives for glory has nobly and wisely disdained to associate your crown with a faction which has for its object the subversion of all thrones  you have not recognized this universal public enemy as a part of the system of europe you have refused to sully the lustre of your empire by any communion with a body of fanatical usurpers and tyrants drawn out of the dregs of society and exalted to their evil eminence by the enormity of their crimesan assemblage of tyrants wholly destitute of any distinguished qualification in a single person amongst them that can command reverence from our reason or seduce it from our prejudices these enemies of sovereigns if at all acknowledged must be acknowledged on account of that enmity alone they have nothing else to recommend them  madam it is dangerous to praise any human virtue before the accomplishment of the tasks which it imposes on itself but in expressing my part of what i hope is or will become the general voice in admiration of what you have done i run no risk at all with your imperial majesty declaration and execution beginning and conclusion are at their different seasons one and the same thing  on the faith and declaration of some of the first potentates of europe several thousands of persons comprehending the best men and the best gentlemen in france have given up their country their houses their fortunes their professional situation their all and are now in foreign lands struggling under the most grievous distresses whatever appearances may menace nobody fears that they can be finally abandoned such a dereliction could not be without a strong imputation on the public and private honor of sovereignty itself nor without an irreparable injury to its interests it would give occasion to represent monarchs as natural enemies to each other and that they never support or countenance any subjects of a brother prince except when they rebel against him we individuals mere spectators of the scene but who sock our liberties under the shade of legal authority and of course sympathize with the sufferers in that cause never can permit ourselves to believe that such an event can disgrace the history of our time the only thing to be feared is delay in winch are included many mischiefs the constancy of the oppressed will be broken the power of tyrants will be confirmed already the multitude of french officers drawn from their several corps by hopes inspired by the freely declared disposition of sovereigns have left all the posts in which they might one day have effectually served the good cause abandoned to the enemy  tour imperial majestys just influence which is still greater than your extensive power will animate and expedite the efforts of other sovereigns from your wisdom other states will learn that they who wait until all the powers of europe are at once in motion can never move at all it would add to the unexampled calamities of our time if the uncommon union of sentiment in so many powers should prove the very cause of defeating the benefit which ought to flow from their general good disposition no sovereign can run any risk from the designs of other powers whilst engaged in tins glorious and necessary work if any attempt could be feared your imperial majestys power and justice would secure your allies against all danger madam your glory will be complete if after having given peace to europe by your moderation you shall bestow stability on all its governments by your vigor and decision the debt which your imperial majestys august predecessors have contracted to the ancient manners of europe by means of which they civilized a vast empire will be nobly repaid by preserving those manners from the hideous change with which they are now menaced by the intervention of russia the world will be preserved from barbarism and ruin  a private individual of a remote country in himself wholly without importance unauthorized and unconnected not as an english subject but as a citizen of the world presumes to submit his thoughts to one of the greatest and wisest sovereigns that europe has seen he does it without fear because he does not involve in his weakness if such it is his king his country or his friends he is not afraid that he shall offend your imperial majestybecause secure in itself true greatness is always accessible and because respectfully to speak what we conceive to be truth is the best homage which can be paid to true dignity  i am madam with the utmost possible respect and veneration  your imperial majestys  most obedient and most humble servant  edm burke  beaconsfield november 1st 1791     a  letter  to  sir charles bingham bart  on the  irish absentee tax  october 30 1773   note       from authentic documents found with the copy of this letter     among mr burkes papers it appears that in the year 1773 a     project of imposing a tax upon all proprietors of landed     estates in ireland whose ordinary residence should be in     great britain had been adopted and avowed by his majestys     ministers at that time a remonstrance against this measure     as highly unjust and impolitic was presented to the     ministers by several of the principal irish absentees and     the project was subsequently abandoned   letter  dear siri am much flattered by your very obliging letter and the rather because it promises an opening to our future correspondence this may be my only indemnification for very great losses one of the most odious parts of the proposed absentee tax is its tendency to separate friends and to make as ugly breaches in private society as it must make in the unity of the great political body i am sure that much of the satisfaction of some circles in london will be lost by it do you think that our friend mrs vesey will suffer her husband to vote for a tax that is to destroy the evenings at bolton row i trust we shall have other supporters of the same sex equally powerful and equally deserving to be so who will not abandon the common cause of their own liberties and our satisfactions we shall be barbarized on both sides of the water if we do not see one another now and then we shall sink into surly brutish johns and you will degenerate into wild irish it is impossible that we should be the wiser or the more agreeable certainly we shall not love one another the better for this forced separation which our ministers who have already done so much for the dissolution of every other sort of good connection are now meditating for the further improvement of this too well united empire their next step will be to encourage all the colonies about thirty separate governments to keep their people from all intercourse with each other and with the mother country a gentleman of new york or barbadoes will be as much gazed at as a strange animal from nova zembla or otaheite and those rogues the travellers will tell us what stories they please about poor old ireland  in all seriousness though i am a great deal more than half serious in what i have been saying i look upon this projected tax in a very evil light i think it is not advisable i am sure it is not necessary and as it is not a mere matter of finance but involves a political question of much importance i consider the principle and precedent as far worse than the thing itself you are too kind in imagining i can suggest anything new upon the subject the objections to it are very glaring and must strike the eyes of all those who have not their reasons for shutting them against evident truth i have no feelings or opinions on this subject which i do not partake with all the sensible and informed people that i meet with at first i could scarcely meet with any one who could believe that this scheme originated from the english government they considered it not only as absurd but as something monstrous and unnatural in the first instance it strikes at the power of this country in the end at the union of the whole empire i do not mean to express most certainly i do not entertain in my mind anything invidious concerning the superintending authority of great britain but if it be true that the several bodies which make up this complicated mass are to be preserved as one empire an authority sufficient to preserve that unity and by its equal weight and pressure to consolidate the various parts that compose it must reside somewhere that somewhere can only be in england possibly any one member distinctly taken might decide in favor of that residence within itself but certainly no member would give its voice for any other except this so that i look upon the residence of the supreme power to be settled here not by force or tyranny or even by mere long usage but by the very nature of things and the joint consent of the whole body  if all this be admitted then without question this country must have the sole right to the imperial legislation by which i mean that law which regulates the polity and economy of the several parts as they relate to one another and to the whole but if any of the parts which not for oppression but for order are placed in a subordinate situation will assume to themselves the power of hindering or checking the resort of their municipal subjects to the centre or even to any other part of the empire they arrogate to themselves the imperial rights which do not which cannot belong to them and so far as in them lies destroy the happy arrangement of the entire empire  a free communication by discretionary residence is necessary to all the other purposes of communication for what purpose are the irish and plantation laws sent hither but as means of preserving this sovereign constitution whether such a constitution was originally right or wrong this is not the time of day to dispute if any evils arise from it let us not strip it of what may be useful in it by taking the english privy council into your legislature you obtain a new a further and possibly a more liberal consideration of all your acts if a local legislature shall by oblique means tend to deprive any of the people of this benefit and shall make it penal to them to follow into england the laws which may affect them then the english privy council will have to decide upon your acts without those lights that may enable them to judge upon what grounds you made them or how far they ought to be modified received or rejected  to what end is the ultimate appeal in judicature lodged in this kingdom if men may be disabled from following their suits here and may be taxed into an absolute denied of justice you observe my dear sir that i do not assert that in all cases two shillings will necessarily cut off this means of correcting legislative and judicial mistakes and thus amount to a denial of justice i might indeed state cases in which this very quantum of tax would be fully sufficient to defeat this right but i argue not on the case but on the principle and i am sure the principle implies it they who may restrain may prohibit they who may impose two shillings may impose ten shillings in the pound and those who may condition the tax to six months annual absence may carry that condition to six weeks or even to six days and thereby totally defeat the wise means which have been provided for extensive and impartial justice and for orderly wellpoised and wellconnected government  what is taxing the resort to and residence in any place but declaring that your connection with that place is a grievance is not such an irish tax as is now proposed a virtual declaration that england is a foreign country and a renunciation on your part of the principle of common naturalization which runs through this whole empire  do you or does any irish gentleman think it a mean privilege that the moment he sets his foot upon this ground he is to all intents and purposes an englishman you will not be pleased with a law which by its operation tends to disqualify you from a seat in this parliament and if your own virtue or fortune or if that of your children should carry you or them to it should you like to be excluded from the possibility of a peerage in this kingdom if in ireland we lay it down as a maxim that a residence in great britain is a political evil and to be discouraged by penal taxes you must necessarily reject all the privileges and benefits which are connected with such a residence  i can easily conceive that a citizen of dublin who looks no further than his counter may think that ireland will be repaid for such a loss by any small diminution of taxes or any increase in the circulation of money that may be laid out in the purchase of claret or groceries in his corporation in such a man an error of that kind as it would be natural would be excusable but i cannot think that any educated man any man who looks with an enlightened eye on the interest of ireland can believe that it is not highly for the advantage of ireland that this parliament which whether right or wrong whether we will or not will make some laws to bind ireland should always have in it some persons who by connection by property or by early prepossessions and affections are attached to the welfare of that country i am so clear upon this point not only from the clear reason of the thing but from the constant course of my observation by now having sat eight sessions in parliament that i declare it to you as my sincere opinion that if you must do either the one or the other it would be wiser by far and far better for ireland that some new privileges should attend the estates of irishmen members of the two houses here than that their characters should be stained by penal impositions and their properties loaded by unequal and unheardof modes of taxation i do really trust that when the matter comes a little to be considered a majority of our gentlemen will never consent to establish such a principle of disqualification against themselves and their posterity and for the sake of gratifying the schemes of a transitory administration of the cockpit or the castle or in compliance with the lightest part of the most vulgar and transient popularity fix so irreparable an injury on the permanent interest of their country  this law seems therefore to me to go directly against the fundamental points of the legislative and judicial constitution of these kingdoms and against the happy communion of their privileges but there is another matter in the tax proposed that contradicts as essentially a very great principle necessary for preserving the union of the various parts of a state because it does in effect discountenance mutual intermarriage and inheritance things that bind countries more closely together than any laws or constitutions whatsoever is it right that a woman who marries into ireland and perhaps well purchases her jointure or her dower there should not after her husbands death have it in her choice to return to her country and her friends without being taxed for it if an irish heiress should marry into an english family and that great property in both countries should thereby come to be united in this common issue shall the descendant of that marriage abandon his natural connection his family interests his public and his private duties and be compelled to take up his residence in ireland is there any sense or any justice in it unless you affirm that there should be no such intermarriage and no such mutual inheritance between the natives is there a shadow of reason that because a lord rockingham a duke of devonshire a sir george savile possess property in ireland which has descended to them without any act of theirs they should abandon their duty in parliament and spend the winters in dublin or having spent the session in westminster must they abandon their seats and all their family interests in yorkshire and derbyshire and pass the rest of the year in wicklow in cork or tyrone  see what the consequence must be from a municipal legislature considering itself as an unconnected body and attempting to enforce a partial residence a man may have property in more parts than two of this empire he may have property in jamaica and in north america as well as in england and ireland i know some that have property in all of them what shall we say to this case after the poor distracted citizen of the whole empire has in compliance with your partial law removed his family bid adieu to his connections and settled himself quietly and snug in a pretty box by the liffey he hears that the parliament of great britain is of opinion that all english estates ought to be spent in england and that they will tax him double if he does not return suppose him then if the nature of the two laws will permit it providing a flying camp and dividing his year as well as he can between england and ireland and at the charge of two town houses and two countryhouses in both kingdoms in this situation he receives an account that a law is transmitted from jamaica and another from pennsylvania to tax absentees from these provinces which are impoverished by the european residence of the possessors of their lands how is he to escape this ricochet crossfiring of so many opposite batteries of police and regulation if he attempts to comply he is likely to be more a citizen of the atlantic ocean and the irish sea than of any of these countries the matter is absurd and ridiculous and while ever the idea of mutual marriages inheritances purchases and privileges subsist can never be carried into execution with common sense or common justice  i do not know how gentlemen of ireland reconcile such an idea to their own liberties or to the natural use and enjoyment of their estates if any of their children should be left in a minority and a guardian should think as many do it matters not whether properly or no that his ward had better he educated in a school or university here than in ireland is he sure that he can justify the bringing a tax of ten per cent perhaps twenty on his pupils estate by giving what in his opinion is the best education in general or the best for that pupils particular character and circumstances can he justify his sending him to travel a necessary part of the higher style of education and notwithstanding what some narrow writers have said of great benefit to all countries but very particularly so to ireland suppose a guardian under the authority or pretence of such a tax of police had prevented our dear friend lord charlemont from going abroad would he have lost no satisfaction would his friends have lost nothing in the companion would his country have lost nothing in the cultivated taste with which he has adorned it in so many ways his natural elegance of mind would undoubtedly do a great deal but i will venture to assert without the danger of being contradicted that he adorns his present residence in ireland much the more for having resided a long time out of it will mr flood himself think he ought to have been driven by taxes into ireland whilst he prepared himself by an english education to understand and to defend the rights of the subject in ireland or to support the dignity of government there according as his opinions or the situation of things may lead him to take either part upon respectable principles i hope it is not forgot that an irish act of parliament sends its youth to england for the study of the law and compels a residence in the inns of court hero for some years will you send out with one breath and recall with another this act plainly provides for that intercourse which supposes the strictest union in laws and policy in both which the intended tax supposes an entire separation  it would be endless to go into all the inconveniences this tax will lead to in the conduct of private life and the use of property how many infirm people are obliged to change their climate whose life depends upon that change how many families straitened in their circumstances are there who from the shame sometimes from the utter impossibility otherwise of retrenching are obliged to remove from their country in order to preserve their estates in their families you begin then to burden these people precisely at the time when their circumstances of health and fortune render them rather objects of relief and commiseration  i know very well that a great proportion of the money of every subordinate country will flow towards the metropolis this is unavoidable other inconveniences too will result to particular parts and why why because they are particular partseach a member of a greater and not an whole within itself but those members are to consider whether these inconveniences are not fully balanced perhaps more than balanced by the united strength of a great and compact body i am sensible too of a difficulty that will be started against the application of some of the principles which i reason upon to the case of ireland it will be said that ireland in many particulars is not bound to consider itself as a part of the british body because this country in many instances is mistaken enough to treat you as foreigners and draws away your money by absentees without suffering you to enjoy your natural advantages in trade and commerce no man living loves restrictive regulations of any kind less than myself at best nine times in ten they are little better than laborious and vexatious follies often as in your case they are great oppressions as well as great absurdities but still an injury is not always a reason for retaliation nor is the folly of others with regard to us a reason for imitating it with regard to them before we attempt to retort we ought to consider whether we may not injure ourselves even more than our adversary since in the contest who shall go the greatest length in absurdity the victor is generally the greatest sufferer besides when there is an unfortunate emulation in restraints and oppressions the question of strength is of the highest importance it little becomes the feeble to be unjust justice is the shield of the weak and when they choose to lay this down and fight naked in the contest of mere power the event will be what must be expected from such imprudence  i ought to beg your pardon for running into this length you want no arguments to convince you on this subject and you want no resources of matter to convince others i ought too to ask pardon for having delayed my answer so long but i received your letter on tuesday in town and i was obliged to come to the country on business from the country i write at present but this day i shall go to town again i shall see lord rockingham who has spared neither time nor trouble in making a vigorous opposition to this inconsiderate measure i hope to be able to send you the papers which will give you information of the steps he has taken he has pursued this business with the foresight diligence and good sense with which he generally resists unconstitutional attempts of government a life of disinterestedness generosity and public spirit are his titles to have it believed that the effect which the tax may have upon his private property is not the sole nor the principal motive to his exertions i know he is of opinion that the opposition in ireland ought to be carried on with that spirit as if no aid was expected from this country and here as if nothing would be done in ireland many things have been lost by not acting in this manner  i am told that you are not likely to be alone in the generous stand you are to make against this unnatural monster of court popularity it is said mr hussey who is so very considerable at present and who is everything in expectation will give you his assistance i rejoice to see that very rare spectacle a good mind a great genius and public activity united together and united so early in life by not running into every popular humor he may depend upon it the popularity of his character will wear the better      non ponebat enim rumores ante salutem     ergo postque magisque viri nunc gloria claret  adieu my dear sir give my best respects to lady bingham and believe me with great truth and esteem  your most obedient and most humble servant  edm burke  beaconsfield 30th october 1773  to sir charles bingham     a  letter  to  the hon charles james fox  on the american war  october 8 1777   my dear charlesi am on many accounts exceedingly pleased with your journey to ireland i do not think it was possible to dispose better of the interval between this and the meeting of parliament i told you as much in the same general terms by the post my opinion of the infidelity of that conveyance hindered me from being particular i now sit down with malice prepense to kill you with a very long letter and must take my chance for some safe method of conveying the dose before i say anything to you of the place you are in or the business of it on which by the way a great deal might be said i will turn myself to the concluding part of your letter from chatsworth  you are sensible that i do not differ from you in many things and most certainly i do not dissent from the main of your doctrine concerning the heresy of depending upon contingencies you must recollect how uniform my sentiments have been on that subject i have ever wished a settled plan of our own founded in the very essence of the american business wholly unconnected with the events of the war and framed in such a manner as to keep up our credit and maintain our system at home in spite of anything which may happen abroad i am now convinced by a long and somewhat vexatious experience that such a plan is absolutely impracticable i think with you that some faults in the constitution of those whom we must love and trust are among the causes of this impracticability they are faults too that one can hardly wish them perfectly cured of as i am afraid they are intimately connected with honest disinterested intentions plentiful fortunes assured rank and quiet homes a great deal of activity and enterprise can scarcely ever be expected from such men unless some horrible calamity is just over their heads or unless they suffer some gross personal insults from power the resentment of which may be as unquiet and stimulating a principle in their minds as ambition is in those of a different complexion to say the truth i cannot greatly blame them we live at a time when men are not repaid in fame for what they sacrifice in interest or repose  on the whole when i consider of what discordant and particularly of what fleeting materials the opposition has been all along composed and at the same time review what lord rockingham has done with that and with his own shattered constitution for these last twelve years i confess i am rather surprised that he has done so much and persevered so long than that he has felt now and then some cold fits and that he grows somewhat languid and desponding at last i know that he and those who are much prevalent with him though they are not thought so much devoted to popularity as others do very much look to the people and more than i think is wise in them who do so little to guide and direct the public opinion without this they act indeed but they act as it were from compulsion and because it is impossible in their situation to avoid taking some part all this it is impossible to change and to no purpose to complain of  as to that popular humor which is the medium we float in if i can discern anything at all of its present state it is far worse than i have ever known or could ever imagine it the faults of the people are not popular vices at least they are not such as grow out of what we used to take to be the english temper and character the greatest number have a sort of an heavy lumpish acquiescence in government without much respect or esteem for those that compose it i really cannot avoid making some very unpleasant prognostics from this disposition of the people i think that many of the symptoms must have struck you i will mention one or two that are to me very remarkable you must know that at bristol we grow as an election interest and even as a party interest rather stronger than we were when i was chosen we have just now a majority in the corporation in this state of matters what think you have they done they have voted their freedom to lord sandwich and lord suffolkto the first at the very moment when the american privateers were domineering in the irish sea and taking the bristol traders in the bristol channelto the latter when his remonstrances on the subject of captures were the jest of paris and of europe this fine step was taken it seems in honor of the zeal of these two profound statesmen in the prosecution of john the painter so totally negligent are they of everything essential and so long and so deeply affected with trash the most low and contemptible just as if they thought the merit of sir john fielding was the most shining point in the character of great ministers in the most critical of all times and of all others the most deeply interesting to the commercial world my best friends in the corporation had no other doubts on the occasion than whether it did not belong to me by right of my representative capacity to be the bearer of this auspicious compliment in addition to this if it could receive any addition they now employ me to solicit as a favor of no small magnitude that after the example of newcastle they may be suffered to arm vessels for their own defence in the channel their memorial under the seal of merchants hall is now lying on the table before me not a soul has the least sensibility on finding themselves now for the first time obliged to act as if the community were dissolved and after enormous payments towards the common protection each part was to defend itself as if it were a separate state  i dont mention bristol as if that were the part furthest gone in this mortification far from it i know that there is rather a little more life in us than in any other place in liverpool they are literally almost ruined by this american war but they love it as they suffer from it in short from whatever i see and from whatever quarter i hear i am convinced that everything that is not absolute stagnation is evidently a partyspirit very adverse to our politics and to the principles from whence they arise there are manifest marks of the resurrection of the tory party they no longer criticize as all disengaged people in the world will on the acts of government but they are silent under every evil and hide and cover up every ministerial blander and misfortune with the officious zeal of men who think they have a party of their own to support in power the tories do universally think their power and consequence involved in the success of this american business the clergy are astonishingly warm in it and what the tories are when embodied and united with their natural head the crown and animated by their clergy no man knows better than yourself as to the whigs i think them far from extinct they are what they always were except by the able use of opportunities by far the weakest party in this country they have not yet learned the application of their principles to the present state of things and as to the dissenters the main effective part of the whig strength they are to use a favorite expression of our american campaign style not all in force they will do very little and as far as i can discern are rather intimidated than provoked at the denunciations of the court in the archbishop of yorks sermon i thought that sermon rather imprudent when i first saw it but it seems to have done its business  in this temper of the people i do not wholly wonder that our northern friends look a little towards events in war particularly i am afraid it must be so there is something so weighty and decisive in the events of war something that so completely overpowers the imagination of the vulgar that all counsels must in a great degree be subordinate to and attendant on them i am sure it was so in the last war very eminently so that on the whole what with the temper of the people the temper of our own friends and the domineering necessities of war we must quietly give up all ideas of any settled preconcerted plan we shall be lucky enough if keeping ourselves attentive and alert we can contrive to profit of the occasions as they arise though i am sensible that those who are best provided with a general scheme are fittest to take advantage of all contingencies however to act with any people with the least degree of comfort i believe we must contrive a little to assimilate to their character we must gravitate towards them if we would keep in the same system or expect that they should approach towards us they are indeed worthy of much concession and management i am quite convinced that they are the honestest public men that ever appeared in this country and i am sure that they are the wisest by far of those who appear in it at present none of those who are continually complaining of them but are themselves just as chargeable with all their faults and have a decent stock of their own into the bargain they our friends are i admit as you very truly represent them but indifferently qualified for storming a citadel after all god knows whether this citadel is to be stormed by them or by anybody else by the means they use or by any means i know that as they are abstractedly speaking to blame so there are those who cry out against them for it not with a friendly complaint as we do but with the bitterness of enemies but i know too that those who blame them for want of enterprise have shown no activity at all against the common enemy all their skill and all their spirit have been shown only in weakening dividing and indeed destroying their allies what they are and what we are is now pretty evidently experienced and it is certain that partly by our common faults but much more by the difficulties of our situation and some circumstances of unavoidable misfortune we are in little better than a sort of culdesac for my part i do all i can to give ease to my mind in this strange position i remember some years ago when i was pressing some points with great eagerness and anxiety and complaining with great vexation to the duke of richmond of the little progress i make he told me kindly and i believe very truly that though he was far from thinking so himself other people could not be persuaded i had not some latent private interest in pushing these matters which i urged with an earnestness so extreme and so much approaching to passion he was certainly in the right i am thoroughly resolved to give both to myself and to my friends less vexation on these subjects than hitherto i have donemuch less indeed  if you should grow too earnest you will be still more inexcusable than i was your having entered into affairs so much younger ought to make them too familiar to you to be the cause of much agitation and you have much more before you for your work do not be in haste lay your foundations deep in public opinion though as you are sensible i have never given you the least hint of advice about joining yourself in a declared connection with our party nor do i now yet as i love that party very well and am clear that you are better able to serve them than any man i know i wish that things should be so kept as to leave you mutually very open to one another in all changes and contingencies and i wish this the rather because in order to be very great as i am anxious that you should be always presuming that you are disposed to make a good use of power you will certainly want some better support than merely that of the crown for i much doubt whether with all your parts you are the man formed for acquiring real interior favor in this court or in any i therefore wish you a firm ground in the country and i do not know so firm and so sound a bottom to build on as our partywell i have done with this matter and you think i ought to have finished it long ago now i turn to ireland  observe that i have not heard a word of any news relative to it from thence or from london so that i am only going to state to you my conjectures as to facts and to speculate again on these conjectures i have a strong notion that the lateness of our meeting is owing to the previous arrangements intended in ireland i suspect they mean that ireland should take a sort of lead and act an efficient part in this war both with men and money it will sound well when we meet to tell us of the active zeal and loyalty of the people of ireland and contrast it with the rebellious spirit of america it will be a popular topicthe perfect confidence of ireland in the power of the british parliament from thence they will argue the little danger which any dependency of the crown has to apprehend from the enforcement of that authority it will be too somewhat flattering to the country gentlemen who might otherwise begin to be sullen to hold out that the burden is not wholly to rest upon them and it will pique our pride to be told that ireland has cheerfully stepped forward and when a dependant of this kingdom has already engaged itself in another years war merely for our dignity how can we who are principals in the quarrel hold off this scheme of policy seems to me so very obvious and is likely to be of so much service to the present system that i cannot conceive it possible they should neglect it or something like it they have already put the people of ireland to the proof have they not borne the earl of buckinghamshire the person who was employed to move the fiery committee in the house of lords in order to stimulate the ministry to this war who was in the chair and who moved the resolutions  it is within a few days of eleven years since i was in ireland and then after an absence of two those who have been absent from any scene for even a much shorter time generally lose the true practical notion of the country and of what may or may not be done in it when i knew ireland it was very different from the state of england where government is a vast deal the public something but individuals comparatively very little but if ireland bears any resemblance to what it was some years ago neither government nor public opinion can do a great deal almost the whole is in the hands of a few leading people the populace of dublin and some parts in the north are in some sort an exception but the primate lord hillsborough and lord hertford have great sway in the latter and the former may be considerable or not pretty much as the duke of leinster pleases on the whole the success of government usually depended on the bargain made with a very few men the resident lieutenancy may have made some change and given a strength to government which formerly i know it had not still however i am of opinion the former state though in other hands perhaps and in another manner still continues the house you are connected with is grown into a much greater degree of power than it had though it was very considerable at the period i speak of if the d of l takes a popular part he is sure of the city of dublin and he has a young man attached to him who stands very forward in parliament and in profession and by what i hear with more goodwill and less envy than usually attends so rapid a progress the movement of one or two principal men if they manage the little popular strength which is to be found in dublin and ulster may do a great deal especially when money is to be saved and taxes to be kept off i confess i should despair of your succeeding with any of them if they cannot be satisfied that every job which they can look for on account of carrying this measure would be just as sure to them for their ordinary support of government they are essential to government which at this time must not be disturbed and their neutrality will be purchased at as high a price as their alliance offensive and defensive now as by supporting they may get as much as by betraying their country it must be a great leaning to turpitude that can make them take a part in this war i am satisfied that if the duke of leinster and lord shannon would act together this business could not go on or if either of them took part with ponsonby it would have no better success hutchinsons situation is much altered since i saw you to please tisdall he had been in a manner laid aside at the castle it is now to be seen whether he prefers the gratification of his resentment and his appetite for popularity both of which are strong enough in him to the advantages which his independence gives him of making a new bargain and accumulating new offices on his heap pray do not be asleep in this scene of actionat this time if i am right the principal the protestants of ireland will be i think in general backward they form infinitely the greatest part of the landed and the moneyed interests and they will not like to pay the papists are reduced to beasts of burden they will give all they have their shoulders readily enough if they are flattered surely the state of ireland ought forever to teach parties moderation in their victories people crushed by law have no hopes but from power if laws are their enemies they will be enemies to laws and those who have much to hope and nothing to lose will always be dangerous more or less but this is not our present business if all this should prove a dream however let it not hinder you from writing to me and tolling me so you will easily refute in your conversation the little topics which they will set afloat such as that ireland is a boat and must go with the ship that if the americans contended only for their liberties it would be differentbut since they have declared independence and so forth  you are happy in enjoying townshends company remember me to him how does he like his private situation in a country where he was the son of the sovereignmrs burke and the two richards salute you cordially  eb  beaconsfield october 8th 1777     a  letter  to  the marquis of rockingham  with  addresses to the king  and  the british colonists in north america  in relation to  the measures of government in the american contest and a proposed secession of the opposition from parliament  january 1777   note       this letter with the two addresses which follow it was     written upon occasion of a proposed secession from parliament     of the members in both houses who had opposed the measures of     government in the contest between this country and the     colonies in north america from the time of the repeal of the     stamp act it appears from an indorsement written by mr     burke on the manuscript that he warmly recommended the     measure but for what reasons is not stated it was not     adopted   letter  to the marquis of rockingham  my dear lordi am afraid that i ought rather to beg your pardon for troubling you at all in this season of repose than to apologize for having been so long silent on the approaching business it comes upon us not indeed in the most agreeable manner but it does comeupon us and i believe your friends in general are in expectation of finding your lordship resolved in what way you are to meet it the deliberation is full of difficulties but the determination is necessary  the affairs of america seem to be drawing towards a crisis the howes are at this time in possession of or are able to awe the whole middle coast of america from delaware to the western boundary of massachusetts bay the naval barrier on the side of canada is broken a great tract of country is open for the supply of the troops the river hudson opens a way into the heart of the provinces and nothing can in all probability prevent an early and offensive campaign what the americans have done is in their circumstances truly astonishing it is indeed infinitely more than i expected from them but having done so much for some short time i began to entertain an opinion that they might do more it is now however evident that they cannot look standing armies in the face they are inferior in everything even in numbersi mean in the number of those whom they keep in constant duty and in regular pay there seem by the best accounts not to be above ten or twelve thousand men at most in their grand army the rest are militia and not wonderfully well composed or disciplined they decline a general engagementprudently enough if their object had been to make the war attend upon a treaty of good terms of subjection but when they look further this will not do an army that is obliged at all times and in all situations to decline an engagement may delay their ruin but can never defend their country foreign assistance they have little or none nor are likely soon to have more france in effect has no king nor any minister accredited enough either with the court or nation to undertake a design of great magnitude  in this state of things i persuade myself franklin is come to paris to draw from that court a definitive and satisfactory answer concerning the support of the colonies if he cannot get such an answer and i am of opinion that at present he cannot then it is to be presumed he is authorized to negotiate with lord stormont on the basis of dependence on the crown this i take to be his errand for i never can believe that he is come thither as a fugitive from his cause in the hour of its distress or that he is going to conclude a long life which has brightened every hour it has continued with so foul and dishonorable a flight on this supposition i thought it not wholly impossible that the whig party might be made a sort of mediators of the peace it is unnatural to suppose that in making an accommodation the americans should not choose rather to give credit to those who all along have opposed the measure of ministers than to throw themselves wholly on the mercy of their bitter uniform and systematic enemies it is indeed the victorious enemy that has the terms to offer the vanquished party and their friends are both of them reduced in their power and it is certain that those who are utterly broken and subdued have no option but as this is hardly yet the case of the americans in this middle state of their affairs much impaired but not perfectly ruined one would think it must be their interest to provide if possible some further security for the terms which they may obtain from their enemies if the congress could be brought to declare in favor of those terms for which one hundred members of the house of commons voted last year with some civility to the party which held out those terms it would undoubtedly have an effect to revive the cause of our liberties in england and to give the colonies some sort of mooring and anchorage in this country it seemed to me that franklin might be made to feel the propriety of such a step and as i have an acquaintance with him i had a strong desire of taking a turn to paris everything else failing one might obtain a better knowledge of the general aspect of affairs abroad than i believe any of us possess at present the duke of portland approved the idea but when i had conversed with the very few of your lordships friends who were in town and considered a little more maturely the constant temper and standing maxims of the party i laid aside the designnot being desirous of risking the displeasure of those for whose sake alone i wished to take that fatiguing journey at this severe season of the year  the duke of portland has taken with him some heads of deliberation which were the result of a discourse with his grace and mr montagu at burlington house it seems essential to the cause that your lordship should meet your friends with some settled plan either of action or inaction your friends will certainly require such a plan and i am sure the state of affairs requires it whether they call for it or not as to the measure of a secession with reasons after rolling the matter in my head a good deal and turning it an hundred ways i confess i still think it the most advisable notwithstanding the serious objections that lie against it and indeed the extreme uncertainty of all political measures especially at this time it provides for your honor i know of nothing else that can so well do this it is something perhaps all that can be done in our present situation some precaution in this respect is not without its motives that very estimation for which you have sacrificed everything else is in some danger of suffering in the general wreck and perhaps it is likely to suffer the more because you have hitherto confided more than was quite prudent in the clearness of your intentions and in the solidity of the popular judgment upon them the former indeed is out of the power of events the latter is full of levity and the very creature of fortune however such as it is and for one i do not think i am inclined to overvalue it both our interest and our duty make it necessary for us to attend to it very carefully so long as we act a part in public the measure you take for this purpose may produce no immediate effect but with regard to the party and the principles for whose sake the party exists all hope of their preservation or recovery depends upon your preserving your reputation  by the conversation of some friends it seemed as if they were willing to fall in with this design because it promised to emancipate them from the servitude of irksome business and to afford them an opportunity of retiring to ease and tranquillity if that be their object in the secession and addresses proposed there surely never were means worse chosen to gain their end and if this be any part of the project it were a thousand times better it were never undertaken the measure is not only unusual and as such critical but it is in its own nature strong and vehement in a high degree the propriety therefore of adopting it depends entirely upon the spirit with which it is supported and followed to pursue violent measures with languor and irresolution is not very consistent in speculation and not more reputable or safe in practice if your lordships friends do not go to this business with their whole hearts if they do not feel themselves uneasy without it if they do not undertake it with a certain degree of zeal and even with warmth and indignation it had better be removed wholly out of our thoughts a measure of less strength and more in the beaten circle of affairs if supported with spirit and industry would be on all accounts infinitely more eligible we have to consider what it is that in this undertaking we have against us we have the weight of king lords and commons in the other scale we have against us within a trifle the whole body of the law we oppose the more considerable part of the landed and mercantile interests we contend in a manner against the whole church we set our faces against great armies flushed with victory and navies who have tasted of civil spoil and have a strong appetite for more our strength whatever it is must depend for a good part of its effect upon events not very probable in such a situation such a step requires not only great magnanimity but unwearied activity and perseverance with a good deal too of dexterity and management to improve every accident in our favor  the delivery of this paper may have very important consequences it is true that the court may pass it over in silence with a real or affected contempt but this i do not think so likely if they do take notice of it the mildest course will be such an address from parliament as the house of commons made to the king on the london remonstrance in the year 1769 this address will be followed by addresses of a similar tendency from all parts of the kingdom in order to overpower you with what they will endeavor to pass as the united voice and sense of the nation but if they intend to proceed further and to take steps of a more decisive nature you are then to consider not what they may legally and justly do but what a parliament omnipotent in power influenced with party rage and personal resentment operating under the implicit military obedience of court discipline is capable of though they have made some successful experiments on juries they will hardly trust enough to them to order a prosecution for a supposed libel they may proceed in two ways either by an impeachment in which the tories may retort on the whigs but with better success though in a worse cause the proceedings in the case of sacheverell or they may without this form proceed as against the bishop of rochester by a bill of pains and penalties more or less grievous the similarity of the cases or the justice is as i said out of the question the mode of proceeding has several very ancient and very recent precedents none of these methods is impossible the court may select three or four of the most distinguished among you for the victims and therefore nothing is more remote from the tendency of the proposed act than any idea of retirement or repose on the contrary you have all of you as principals or auxiliaries a much better hotter and more desperate conflict in all probability to undergo than any you have been yet engaged in the only question is whether the risk ought to be run for the chance and it is no more of recalling the people of england to their ancient principles and to that personal interest which formerly they took in all public affairs at any rate i am sure it is right if we take this step to take it with a full view of the consequences and with minds and measures in a state of preparation to meet them it is not becoming that your boldness should arise from a want of foresight it is more reputable and certainly it is more safe too that it should be grounded on the evident necessity of encountering the dangers which you foresee  your lordship will have the goodness to excuse me if i state in strong terms the difficulties attending a measure which on the whole i heartily concur in but as from my want of importance i can be personally little subject to the most trying part of the consequences it is as little my desire to urge others to dangers in which i am myself to have no inconsiderable a share  if this measure should be thought too great for our strength or the dispositions of the times then the point will be to consider what is to be done in parliament a weak irregular desultory peevish opposition there will be as much too little as the other may be too big our scheme ought to be such as to have in it a succession of measures else it is impossible to secure anything like a regular attendance opposition will otherwise always carry a disreputable air neither will it be possible without that attendance to persuade the people that we are in earnest above all a motion should be well digested for the first day there is one thing in particular i wish to recommend to your lordships consideration that is the opening of the doors of the house of commons without this i am clearly convinced it will be in the power of ministry to make our opposition appear without doors just in what light they please to obtain a gallery is the easiest thing in the world if we are satisfied to cultivate the esteem of our adversaries by the resolution and energy with which we act against them but if their satisfaction and goodhumor be any part of our object the attempt i admit is idle  i had some conversation before i left town with the d of m he is of opinion that if you adhere to your resolution of seceding you ought not to appear on the first day of the meeting he thinks it can have no effect except to break the continuity of your conduct and thereby to weaken and fritter away the impression of it it certainly will seem odd to give solemn reasons for a discontinuance of your attendance in parliament after having two or three times returned to it and immediately after a vigorous act of opposition as to trials of the temper of the house there have been of that sort so many already that i see no reason for making another that would not hold equally good for another after thatparticularly as nothing has happened in the least calculated to alter the disposition of the house if the secession were to be general such an attendance followed by such an act would have force but being in its nature incomplete and broken to break it further by retreats and returns to the chase must entirely destroy its effect i confess i am quite of the d of ms opinion in this point  i send your lordship a corrected copy of the paper your lordship will be so good to communicate it if you should approve of the alterations to lord jc and sir gs i showed it to the d of p before his grace left town and at his the d of ps desire i have sent it to the d of r the principal alteration is in the pages last but one it is made to remove a difficulty which had been suggested to sir gs and which he thought had a good deal in it i think it much the better for that alteration indeed it may want still more corrections in order to adapt it to the present or probable future state of things  what shall i say in excuse for this long letter which frightens me when i look back upon it your lordship will take it and all in it with your usual incomparable temper which carries you through so much both from enemies and friends my most humble respects to lady r and believe me with the highest regard ever o  eb  i hear that dr franklin has had a most extraordinary reception at paris from all ranks of people  beaconsfield monday night jan 6 1777     address to the king   we your majestys most dutiful and loyal subjects several of the peers of the realm and several members of the house of commons chosen by the people to represent them in parliament do in our individual capacity but with hearts filled with a warm affection to your majesty with a strong attachment to your royal house and with the most unfeigned devotion to your true interest beg leave at this crisis of your affairs in all humility to approach your royal presence  whilst we lament the measures adopted by the public councils of the kingdom we do not mean to question the legal validity of their proceedings we do not desire to appeal from them to any person whatsoever we do not dispute the conclusive authority of the bodies in which we have a place over all their members we know that it is our ordinary duty to submit ourselves to the determinations of the majority in everything except what regards the just defence of our honor and reputation but the situation into which the british empire has been brought and the conduct to which we are reluctantly driven in that situation we hold ourselves bound by the relation in which we stand both to the crown and the people clearly to explain to your majesty and our country  we have been called upon in the speech from the throne at the opening of this session of parliament in a manner peculiarly marked singularly emphatical and from a place from whence anything implying censure falls with no common weight to concur in unanimous approbation of those measures which have produced our present distresses and threaten us in future with others far more grievous we trust therefore that we shall stand justified in offering to our sovereign and the public our reasons for persevering inflexibly in our uniform dissent from every part of those measures we lament them from an experience of their mischief as we originally opposed them from a sure foresight of their unhappy and inevitable tendency  we see nothing in the present events in the least degree sufficient to warrant an alteration in our opinion we were always steadily averse to this civil warnot because we thought it impossible that it should be attended with victory but because we were fully persuaded that in such a contest victory would only vary the mode of our ruin and by making it less immediately sensible would render it the more lasting and the more irretrievable experience had but too fully instructed us in the possibility of the reduction of a free people to slavery by foreign mercenary armies but we had an horror of becoming the instruments in a design of which in our turn we might become the victims knowing the inestimable value of peace and the contemptible value of what was sought by war we wished to compose the distractions of our country not by the use of foreign arms but by prudent regulations in our own domestic policy we deplored as your majesty has done in your speech from the throne the disorders which prevail in your empire but we are convinced that the disorders of the people in the present time and in the present place are owing to the usual and natural cause of such disorders at all times and in all places where such have prevailedthe misconduct of governmentthat they are owing to plans laid in error pursued with obstinacy and conducted without wisdom  we cannot attribute so much to the power of faction at the expense of human nature as to suppose that in any part of the world a combination of men few in number not considerable in rank of no natural hereditary dependencies should be able by the efforts of their policy alone or the mere exertion of any talents to bring the people of your american dominions into the disposition which has produced the present troubles we cannot conceive that without some powerful concurring cause any management should prevail on some millions of people dispersed over an whole continent in thirteen provinces not only unconnected but in many particulars of religion manners government and local interest totally different and adverse voluntarily to submit themselves to a suspension of all the profits of industry and all the comforts of civil life added to all the evils of an unequal war carried on with circumstances of the greatest asperity and rigor this sir we conceive could never have happened but from a general sense of some grievance so radical in its nature and so spreading in its effects as to poison all the ordinary satisfactions of life to discompose the frame of society and to convert into fear and hatred that habitual reverence ever paid by mankind to an ancient and venerable government  that grievance is as simple in its nature and as level to the most ordinary understanding as it is powerful in affecting the most languid passions it is  an attempt made to dispose of the property of a whole people without their consent  your majestys english subjects in the colonies possessing the ordinary faculties of mankind know that to live under such a plan of government is not to live in a state of freedom your english subjects in the colonies still impressed with the ancient feelings of the people from whom they are derived cannot live under a government which does not establish freedom as its basis  this scheme being therefore set up in direct opposition to the rooted and confirmed sentiments and habits of thinking of an whole people has produced the effects which ever must result from such a collision of power and opinion for we beg leave with all duty and humility to represent to your majesty what we fear has been industriously concealed from you that it is not merely the opinion of a very great number or even of the majority but the universal sense of the whole body of the people in those provinces that the practice of taxing in the mode and on the principles which have been lately contended for and enforced is subversive of all their rights  this sense has been declared as we understand on good information by the unanimous voice of all their assemblies each assembly also on this point is perfectly unanimous within itself it has been declared as fully by the actual voice of the people without these assemblies as by the constructive voice within them as well by those in that country who addressed as by those who remonstrated and it is as much the avowed opinion of those who have hazarded their all rather than take up arms against your majestys forces as of those who have run the same risk to oppose them the difference among them is not on the grievance but on the mode of redress and we are sorry to say that they who have conceived hopes from the placability of the ministers who influence the public councils of this kingdom disappear in the multitude of those who conceive that passive compliance only confirms and emboldens oppression  the sense of a whole people most gracious sovereign never ought to be contemned by wise and beneficent rulerswhatever may be the abstract claims or even rights of the supreme power we have been too early instructed and too long habituated to believe that the only firm seat of all authority is in the minds affections and interests of the people to change our opinions on the theoretic reasonings of speculative men or for the convenience of a mere temporary arrangement of state it is not consistent with equity or wisdom to set at defiance the general feelings of great communities and of all the orders which compose them much power is tolerated and passes unquestioned where much is yielded to opinion all is disputed where everything is enforced  such are our sentiments on the duty and policy of conforming to the prejudices of a whole people even where the foundation of such prejudices may be false or disputable but permit us to lay at your majestys feet our deliberate judgment on the real merits of that principle the violation of which is the known ground and origin of these troubles we assure your majesty that on our parts we should think ourselves unjustifiable as good citizens and not influenced by the true spirit of englishmen if with any effectual means of prevention in our hands we were to submit to taxes to which we did not consent either directly or by a representation of the people securing to us the substantial benefit of an absolutely free disposition of our own property in that important case and we add sir that if fortune instead of blessing us with a situation where we may have daily access to the propitious presence of a gracious prince had fixed us in settlements on the remotest part of the globe we must carry these sentiments with us as part of our beingpersuaded that the distance of situation would render this privilege in the disposal of property but the more necessary if no provision had been made for it such provision ought to be made or permitted abuses of subordinate authority increase and all means of redress lessen as the distance of the subject removes him from the seat of the supreme power what in those circumstances can save him from the last extremes of indignity and oppression but something left in his own hands which may enable him to conciliate the favor and control the excesses of government when no means of power to awe or to oblige are possessed the strongest ties which connect mankind in every relation social and civil and which teach them mutually to respect each other are broken independency from that moment virtually exists its formal declaration will quickly follow such must be our feelings for ourselves we are not in possession of another rule for our brethren  when the late attempt practically to annihilate that inestimable privilege was made great disorders and tumults very unhappily and very naturally arose from it in this state of things we were of opinion that satisfaction ought instantly to be given or that at least the punishment of the disorder ought to be attended with the redress of the grievance we were of opinion that if our dependencies had so outgrown the positive institutions made for the preservation of liberty in this kingdom that the operation of their powers was become rather a pressure than a relief to the subjects in the colonies wisdom dictated that the spirit of the constitution should rather be applied to their circumstances than its authority enforced with violence in those very parts where its reason became wholly inapplicable  other methods were then recommended and followed as infallible means of restoring peace and order we looked upon them to be what they have since proved to be the cause of inflaming discontent into disobedience and resistance into revolt the subversion of solemn fundamental charters on a suggestion of abuse without citation evidence or hearingthe total suspension of the commerce of a great maritime city the capital of a great maritime province during the pleasure of the crownthe establishment of a military force not accountable to the ordinary tribunals of the country in which it was kept upthese and other proceedings at that time if no previous cause of dissension had subsisted were sufficient to produce great troubles unjust at all times they were then irrational  we could not conceive when disorders had arisen from the complaint of one violated right that to violate every other was the proper means of quieting an exasperated people it seemed to us absurd and preposterous to hold out as the means of calming a people in a state of extreme inflammation and ready to take up arms the austere law which a rigid conqueror would impose as the sequel of the most decisive victories  recourse indeed was at the same time had to force and we saw a force sent out enough to menace liberty but not to awe oppositiontending to bring odium on the civil power and contempt on the militaryat once to provoke and encourage resistance force was sent out not sufficient to hold one town laws were passed to inflame thirteen provinces  this mode of proceeding by harsh laws and feeble armies could not be defended on the principle of mercy and forbearance for mercy as we conceive consists not in the weakness of the means but in the benignity of the ends we apprehend that mild measures may be powerfully enforced and that acts of extreme rigor and injustice may be attended with as much feebleness in the execution as severity in the formation  in consequence of these terrors which falling upon some threatened all the colonies made a common cause with the sufferers and proceeded on their part to acts of resistance in that alarming situation we besought your majestys ministers to entertain some distrust of the operation of coercive measures and to profit of their experience experience had no effect the modes of legislative rigor were construed not to have been erroneous in their policy but too limited in their extent new severities were adopted the fisheries of your people in america followed their charters and their mutual combination to defend what they thought their common rights brought on a total prohibition of their mutual commercial intercourse no distinction of persons or merits was observed the peaceable and the mutinous friends and foes were alike involved as if the rigor of the laws had a certain tendency to recommend the authority of the legislator  whilst the penal laws increased in rigor and extended in application over all the colonies the direct force was applied but to one part had the great fleet and foreign army since employed been at that time called for the greatness of the preparation would have declared the magnitude of the danger the nation would have been alarmed and taught the necessity of some means of reconciliation with our countrymen in america who whenever they are provoked to resistance demand a force to reduce them to obedience full as destructive to us as to them but parliament and the people by a premeditated concealment of their real situation were drawn into perplexities which furnished excuses for further armaments and whilst they were taught to believe themselves called to suppress a riot they found themselves involved in a mighty war  at length british blood was spilled by british hands a fatal era which we must ever deplore because your empire will forever feel it your majesty was touched with a sense of so great a disaster your paternal breast was affected with the sufferings of your english subjects in america in your speech from the throne in the beginning of the session of 1775 you were graciously pleased to declare yourself inclined to relieve their distresses and to pardon their errors you felt their sufferings under the late penal acts of parliament but your ministry felt differently not discouraged by the pernicious effects of all they had hitherto advised and notwithstanding the gracious declaration of your majesty they obtained another act of parliament in which the rigors of all the former were consolidated and embittered by circumstances of additional severity and outrage the whole trading property of america even unoffending shipping in port was indiscriminately and irrecoverably given as the plunder of foreign enemies to the sailors of your navy this property was put out of the reach of your mercy your people were despoiled and your navy by a new dangerous and prolific example corrupted with the plunder of their countrymen your people in that part of your dominions were put in their general and political as well as their personal capacity wholly out of the protection of your government  though unwilling to dwell on all the improper modes of carrying on this unnatural and ruinous war and which have led directly to the present unhappy separation of great britain and its colonies we must beg leave to represent two particulars which we are sure must have been entirely contrary to your majestys order or approbation every course of action in hostility however that hostility may be just or merited is not justifiable or excusable it is the duty of those who claim to rule over others not to provoke them beyond the necessity of the case nor to leave stings in their minds which must long rankle even when the appearance of tranquillity is restored we therefore assure your majesty that it is with shame and sorrow we have seen several acts of hostility which could have no other tendency than incurably to alienate the minds of your american subjects to excite by a proclamation issued by your majestys governor an universal insurrection of negro slaves in any of the colonies is a measure full of complicated horrors absolutely illegal suitable neither to the practice of war nor to the laws of peace of the same quality we look upon all attempts to bring down on your subjects an irruption of those fierce and cruel tribes of savages and cannibals in whom the vestiges of human nature are nearly effaced by ignorance and barbarity they are not fit allies for your majesty in a war with your people they are not fit instruments of an english government these and many other acts we disclaim as having advised or approved when done and we clear ourselves to your majesty and to all civilized nations from any participation whatever before or after the fact in such unjustifiable and horrid proceedings  but there is one weighty circumstance which we lament equally with the causes of the war and with the modes of carrying it onthat no disposition whatsoever towards peace or reconciliation has ever been shown by those who have directed the public councils of this kingdom either before the breaking out of these hostilities or during the unhappy continuance of them every proposition made in your parliament to remove the original cause of these troubles by taking off taxes obnoxious for their principle or their design has been overruledevery bill brought in for quiet rejected even on the first proposition the petitions of the colonies have not been admitted even to an hearing the very possibility of public agency by which such petitions could authentically arrive at parliament has been evaded and chicaned away all the public declarations which indicate anything resembling a disposition to reconciliation seem to us loose general equivocal capable of various meanings or of none and they are accordingly construed differently at different times by those on whose recommendation they have been made being wholly unlike the precision and stability of public faith and bearing no mark of that ingenuous simplicity and native candor and integrity which formerly characterized the english nation  instead of any relaxation of the claim of taxing at the discretion of parliament your ministers have devised a new mode of enforcing that claim much more effectual for the oppression of the colonies though not for your majestys service both as to the quantity and application than any of the former methods and their mode has been expressly held out by ministers as a plan not to be departed from by the house of commons and as the very condition on which the legislature is to accept the dependence of the colonies  at length when after repeated refusals to hear or to conciliate an act dissolving your government by putting your people in america out of your protection was passed your ministers suffered several months to elapse without affording to them or to any community or any individual amongst them the means of entering into that protection even on unconditional submission contrary to your majestys gracious declaration from the throne and in direct violation of the public faith  we cannot therefore agree to unite in new severities against the brethren of our blood for their asserting an independency to which we know in our conscience they have been necessitated by the conduct of those very persons who now make use of that argument to provoke us to a continuance and repetition of the acts which in a regular series have led to this great misfortune  the reasons dread sir which have been used to justify this perseverance in a refusal to hear or conciliate have been reduced into a sort of parliamentary maxims which we do not approve the first of these maxims is that the two houses ought not to receive as they have hitherto refused to receive petitions containing matter derogatory to any part of the authority they claim we conceive this maxim and the consequent practice to be unjustifiable by reason or the practice of other sovereign powers and that it must be productive if adhered to of a total separation between this kingdom and its dependencies the supreme power being in ordinary cases the ultimate judge can as we conceive suffer nothing in having any part of his rights excepted to or even discussed before himself we know that sovereigns in other countries where the assertion of absolute regal power is as high as the assertion of absolute power in any politic body can possibly be here have received many petitions in direct opposition to many of their claims of prerogativehave listened to themcondescended to discuss and to give answers to them this refusal to admit even the discussion of any part of an undefined prerogative will naturally tend to annihilate any privilege that can be claimed by every inferior dependent community and every subordinate order in the state  the next maxim which has been put as a bar to any plan of accommodation is that no offer of terms of peace ought to be made before parliament is assured that these terms will be accepted on this we beg leave to represent to your majesty that if in all events the policy of this kingdom is to govern the people in your colonies as a free people no mischief can possibly happen from a declaration to them and to the world of the manner and form in which parliament proposes that they shall enjoy the freedom it protects it is an encouragement to the innocent and meritorious that they at least shall enjoy those advantages which they patiently expected rather from the benignity of parliament than their own efforts persons more contumacious may also see that they are resisting terms of perhaps greater freedom and happiness than they are now in arms to obtain the glory and propriety of offered mercy is neither tarnished nor weakened by the folly of those who refuse to take advantage of it  we cannot think that the declaration of independency makes any natural difference in the reason and policy of the offer no prince out of the possession of his dominions and become a sovereign de jure only ever thought it derogatory to his rights or his interests to hold out to his former subjects a distinct prospect of the advantages to be derived from his readmission and a security for some of the most fundamental of those popular privileges in vindication of which he had been deposed on the contrary such offers have been almost uniformly made under similar circumstances besides as your majesty has been graciously pleased in your speech from the throne to declare your intention of restoring your people in the colonies to a state of law and liberty no objection can possibly lie against defining what that law and liberty are because those who offer and those who are to receive terms frequently differ most widely and most materially in the signification of these words and in the objects to which they apply  to say that we do not know at this day what the grievances of the colonies are be they real or pretended would be unworthy of us but whilst we are thus waiting to be informed of what we perfectly know we weaken the powers of the commissionerswe delay perhaps we lose the happy hour of peacewe are wasting the substance of both countrieswe are continuing the effusion of human of christian of english blood  we are sure that we must have your majestys heart along with us when we declare in favor of mixing something conciliatory with our force sir we abhor the idea of making a conquest of our countrymen we wish that they may yield to wellascertained wellauthenticated and wellsecured terms of reconciliationnot that your majesty should owe the recovery of your dominions to their total waste and destruction humanity will not permit us to entertain such a desire nor will the reverence we bear to the civil rights of mankind make us even wish that questions of great difficulty of the last importance and lying deep in the vital principles of the british constitution should be solved by the arms of foreign mercenary soldiers  it is not sir from a want of the most inviolable duty to your majesty not from a want of a partial and passionate regard to that part of your empire in which we reside and which we wish to be supreme that we have hitherto withstood all attempts to render the supremacy of one part of your dominions inconsistent with the liberty and safety of all the rest the motives of our opposition are found in those very sentiments which we are supposed to violate for we are convinced beyond a doubt that a system of dependence which leaves no security to the people for any part of their freedom in their own hands cannot be established in any inferior member of the british empire without consequentially destroying the freedom of that very body in favor of whose boundless pretensions such a scheme is adopted we know and feel that arbitrary power over distant regions is not within the competence nor to be exercised agreeably to the forms or consistently with the spirit of great popular assemblies if such assemblies are called to a nominal share in the exercise of such power in order to screen under general participation the guilt of desperate measures it tends only the more deeply to corrupt the deliberative character of those assemblies in training them to blind obedience in habituating them to proceed upon grounds of fact with which they can rarely be sufficiently acquainted and in rendering them executive instruments of designs the bottom of which they cannot possibly fathom  to leave any real freedom to parliament freedom must be left to the colonies a military government is the only substitute for civil liberty that the establishment of such a power in america will utterly ruin our finances though its certain effect is the smallest part of our concern it will become an apt powerful and certain engine for the destruction of our freedom here great bodies of armed men trained to a contempt of popular assemblies representative of an english peoplekept up for the purpose of exacting impositions without their consent and maintained by that exactioninstruments in subverting without any process of law great ancient establishments and respected forms of governmentsset free from and therefore above the ordinary english tribunals of the country where they servethese men cannot so transform themselves merely by crossing the sea as to behold with love and reverence and submit with profound obedience to the very same things in great britain which in america they had been taught to despise and had been accustomed to awe and humble all your majestys troops in the rotation of service will pass through this discipline and contract these habits if we could flatter ourselves that this would not happen we must be the weakest of men we must be the worst if we were indifferent whether it happened or not what gracious sovereign is the empire of america to us or the empire of the world if we lose our own liberties we deprecate this last of evils we deprecate the effect of the doctrines which must support and countenance the government over conquered englishmen  as it will be impossible long to resist the powerful and equitable arguments in favor of the freedom of these unhappy people that are to be drawn from the principle of our own liberty attempts will be made attempts have been made to ridicule and to argue away this principle and to inculcate into the minds of your people other maxims of government and other grounds of obedience than those which have prevailed at and since the glorious revolution by degrees these doctrines by being convenient may grow prevalent the consequence is not certain but a general change of principles rarely happens among a people without leading to a change of government  sir your throne cannot stand secure upon the principles of unconditional submission and passive obedienceon powers exercised without the concurrence of the people to be governedon acts made in defiance of their prejudices and habitson acquiescence procured by foreign mercenary troops and secured by standing armies these may possibly be the foundation of other thrones they must be the subversion of yours it was not to passive principles in our ancestors that we owe the honor of appearing before a sovereign who cannot feel that he is a prince without knowing that we ought to be free the revolution is a departure from the ancient course of the descent of this monarchy the people at that time reentered into their original rights and it was not because a positive law authorized what was then done but because the freedom and safety of the subject the origin and cause of all laws required a proceeding paramount and superior to them at that ever memorable and instructive period the letter of the law was superseded in favor of the substance of liberty to the free choice therefore of the people without either king or parliament we owe that happy establishment out of which both king and parliament were regenerated from that great principle of liberty have originated the statutes confirming and ratifying the establishment from which your majesty derives your right to rule over us those statutes have not given us our liberties our liberties have produced them every hour of your majestys reign your title stands upon the very same foundation on which it was at first laid and we do not know a better on which it can possibly be placed  convinced sir that you cannot have different rights and a different security in different parts of your dominions we wish to lay an even platform for your throne and to give it an unmovable stability by laying it on the general freedom of your people and by securing to your majesty that confidence and affection in all parts of your dominions which makes your best security and dearest title in this the chief seat of your empire  such sir being amongst us the foundation of monarchy itself much more clearly and much more peculiarly is it the ground of all parliamentary power parliament is a security provided for the protection of freedom and not a subtile fiction contrived to amuse the people in its place the authority of both houses can still less than that of the crown be supported upon different principles in different places so as to be for one part of your subjects a protector of liberty and for another a fund of despotism through which prerogative is extended by occasional powers whenever an arbitrary will finds itself straitened by the restrictions of law had it seemed good to parliament to consider itself as the indulgent guardian and strong protector of the freedom of the subordinate popular assemblies instead of exercising its powers to their annihilation there is no doubt that it never could have been their inclination because not their interest to raise questions on the extent of parliamentary rights or to enfeeble privileges which were the security of their own powers evident from necessity and not suspicious from an alarming mode or purpose in the exertion would as formerly they were be cheerfully submitted to and these would have been fully sufficient for conservation of unity in the empire and for directing its wealth to one common centre another use has produced other consequences and a power which refuses to be limited by moderation must either be lost or find other more distinct and satisfactory limitations  as for us a supposed or if it could be a real participation in arbitrary power would never reconcile our minds to its establishment we should be ashamed to stand before your majesty boldly asserting in our own favor inherent rights which bind and regulate the crown itself and yet insisting on the exercise in our own persons of a more arbitrary sway over our fellowcitizens and fellowfreemen  these gracious sovereign are the sentiments which we consider ourselves as bound in justification of our present conduct in the most serious and solemn manner to lay at your majestys feet we have been called by your majestys writs and proclamations and we have been authorized either by hereditary privilege or the choice of your people to confer and treat with your majesty in your highest councils upon the arduous affairs of your kingdom we are sensible of the whole importance of the duty which this constitutional summons implies we know the religious punctuality of attendance which in the ordinary course it demands it is no light cause which even for a time could persuade us to relax in any part of that attendance the british empire is in convulsions which threaten its dissolution those particular proceedings which cause and inflame this disorder after many years incessant struggle we find ourselves wholly unable to oppose and unwilling to behold all our endeavors having proved fruitless we are fearful at this time of irritating by contention those passions which we have found it impracticable to compose by reason we cannot permit ourselves to countenance by the appearance of a silent assent proceedings fatal to the liberty and unity of the empireproceedings which exhaust the strength of all your majestys dominions destroy all trust and dependence of our allies and leave us both at home and abroad exposed to the suspicious mercy and uncertain inclinations of our neighbor and rival powers to whom by this desperate course we are driving our countrymen for protection and with whom we have forced them into connections and may bind them by habits and by interestsan evil which no victories that may be obtained no severities which may be exorcised ever will or can remove  if but the smallest hope should from any circumstances appear of a return to the ancient maxims and true policy of this kingdom we shall with joy and readiness return to our attendance in order to give our hearty support to whatever means may be left for alleviating the complicated evils which oppress this nation  if this should not happen we have discharged our consciences by this faithful representation to your majesty and our country and however few in number or however we may be overborne by practices whose operation is but too powerful by the revival of dangerous exploded principles or by the misguided zeal of such arbitrary factions as formerly prevailed in this kingdom and always to its detriment and disgrace we have the satisfaction of standing forth and recording our names in assertion of those principles whose operation hath in better times made your majesty a great prince and the british dominions a mighty empire     address  to the  british colonists in north america   the very dangerous crisis into which the british empire is brought as it accounts for so it justifies the unusual step we take in addressing ourselves to you  the distempers of the state are grown to such a degree of violence and malignity as to render all ordinary remedies vain and frivolous in such a deplorable situation an adherence to the common forms of business appears to us rather as an apology to cover a supine neglect of duty than the means of performing it in a manner adequate to the exigency that presses upon us the common means we have already tried and tried to no purpose as our last resource we turn ourselves to you we address you merely in our private capacity vested with no other authority than what will naturally attend those in whose declarations of benevolence you have no reason to apprehend any mixture of dissimulation or design  we have this title to your attention we call upon it in a moment of the utmost importance to us all we find with infinite concern that arguments are used to persuade you of the necessity of separating yourselves from your ancient connection with your parent country grounded on a supposition that a general principle of alienation and enmity to you had pervaded the whole of this kingdom and that there does no longer subsist between you and us any common and kindred principles upon which we can possibly unite consistently with those ideas of liberty in which you have justly placed your whole happiness  if this fact were true the inference drawn from it would be irresistible but nothing is less founded we admit indeed that violent addresses have been procured with uncommon pains by wicked and designing men purporting to be the genuine voice of the whole people of englandthat they have been published by authority here and made known to you by proclamations in order by despair and resentment incurably to poison your minds against the origin of your race and to render all cordial reconciliation between us utterly impracticable the same wicked men for the same bad purposes have so far surprised the justice of parliament as to cut off all communication betwixt us except what is to go in their own fallacious and hostile channel  but we conjure you by the invaluable pledges which have hitherto united and which we trust will hereafter lastingly unite us that you do not suffer yourselves to be persuaded or provoked into an opinion that you are at war with this nation do not think that the whole or even the uninfluenced majority of englishmen in this island are enemies to their own blood on the american continent much delusion has been practised much corrupt influence treacherously employed but still a large and we trust the largest and soundest part of this kingdom perseveres in the most perfect unity of sentiments principles and affections with you it spreads out a large and liberal platform of common liberty upon which we may all unite forever it abhors the hostilities which have been carried on against you as much as you who feel the cruel effect of them it has disclaimed in the most solemn manner at the foot of the throne itself the addresses which tended to irritate your sovereign against his colonies we are persuaded that even many of those who unadvisedly have put their hands to such intemperate and inflammatory addresses have not at all apprehended to what such proceedings naturally lead and would sooner die than afford them the least countenance if they were sensible of their fatal effects on the union and liberty of the empire  for ourselves we faithfully assure you that we have ever considered you as rational creatures as free agents as men willing to pursue and able to discern your own true interest we have wished to continue united with you in order that a people of one origin and one character should be directed to the rational objects of government by joint counsels and protected in them by a common force other subordination in you we require none we have never pressed that argument of general union to the extinction of your local natural and just privileges sensible of what is due both to the dignity and weakness of man we have never wished to place over you any government over which in great fundamental points you should have no sort of check or control in your own hands or which should be repugnant to your situation principles and character  no circumstances of fortune you may be assured will ever induce us to form or tolerate any such design if the disposition of providence which we deprecate should even prostrate you at our feet broken in power and in spirit it would be our duty and inclination to revive by every practicable means that free energy of mind which a fortune unsuitable to your virtue had damped and dejected and to put you voluntarily in possession of those very privileges which you had in vain attempted to assert by arms for we solemnly declare that although we should look upon a separation from you as an heavy calamity and the heavier because we know you must have your full share in it yet we had much rather see you totally independent of this crown and kingdom than joined to it by so unnatural a conjunction as that of freedom with servitudea conjunction which if it were at all practicable could not fail in the end of being more mischievous to the peace prosperity greatness and power of this nation than beneficial by any enlargement of the bounds of nominal empire  but because brethren these professions are general and such as even enemies may make when they reserve to themselves the construction of what servitude and what liberty are we inform you that we adopt your own standard of the blessing of free government we are of opinion that you ought to enjoy the sole and exclusive right of freely granting and applying to the support of your administration what god has freely granted as a reward to your industry and we do not confine this immunity from exterior coercion in this great point solely to what regards your local establishment but also to what may be thought proper for the maintenance of the whole empire in this resource we cheerfully trust and acquiesce satisfied by evident reason that no other expectation of revenue can possibly be given by freemen and knowing from an experience uniform both on yours and on our side of the ocean that such an expectation has never yet been disappointed we know of no road to your coffers but through your affections  to manifest our sentiments the more clearly to you and to the world on this subject we declare our opinion that if no revenue at all which however we are far from supposing were to be obtained from you to this kingdom yet as long as it is our happiness to be joined with you in the bonds of fraternal charity and freedom with an open and flowing commerce between us one principle of enmity and friendship pervading and one right of war and peace directing the strength of the whole empire we are likely to be at least as powerful as any nation or as any combination of nations which in the course of human events may be formed against us we are sensible that a very large proportion of the wealth and power of every empire must necessarily be thrown upon the presiding state we are sensible that such a state ever has borne and ever must bear the greatest part and sometimes the whole of the public expenses and we think her well indemnified for that rather apparent than real inequality of charge in the dignity and preeminence she enjoys and in the superior opulence which after all charges defrayed must necessarily remain at the centre of affairs of this principle we are not without evidence in our remembrance not yet effaced of the glorious and happy days of this empire we are therefore incapable of that prevaricating style by which when taxes without your consent are to be extorted from you this nation is represented as in the lowest state of impoverishment and public distress but when we are called upon to oppress you by force of arms it is painted as scarcely feeling its impositions abounding with wealth and inexhaustible in its resources  we also reason and feel as you do on the invasion of your charters because the charters comprehend the essential forms by which you enjoy your liberties we regard them as most sacred and by no means to be taken away or altered without process without examination and without hearing as they have lately been we even think that they ought by no means to be altered at all but at the desire of the greater part of the people who live under them we cannot look upon men as delinquents in the mass much less are we desirous of lording over our brethren insulting their honest pride and wantonly overturning establishments judged to be just and convenient by the public wisdom of this nation at their institution and which long and inveterate use has taught you to look up to with affection and reverence as we disapproved of the proceedings with regard to the forms of your constitution so we are equally tender of every leading principle of free government we never could think with approbation of putting the military power out of the coercion of the civil justice in the country where it acts  we disclaim also any sort of share in that other measure which has been used to alienate your affections from this countrynamely the introduction of foreign mercenaries we saw their employment with shame and regret especially in numbers so far exceeding the english forces as in effect to constitute vassals who have no sense of freedom and strangers who have no common interest or feelings as the arbiters of our unhappy domestic quarrel  we likewise saw with shame the african slaves who had been sold to you on public faith and under the sanction of acts of parliament to be your servants and your guards employed to cut the throats of their masters  you will not we trust believe that born in a civilized country formed to gentle manners trained in a merciful religion and living in enlightened and polished times where even foreign hostility is softened from its original sternness we could have thought of letting loose upon you our late beloved brethren these fierce tribes of savages and cannibals in whom the traces of human nature are effaced by ignorance and barbarity we rather wished to have joined with you in bringing gradually that unhappy part of mankind into civility order piety and virtuous discipline than to have confirmed their evil habits and increased their natural ferocity by fleshing them in the slaughter of you whom our wiser and better ancestors had sent into the wilderness with the express view of introducing along with our holy religion its humane and charitable manners we do not hold that all things are lawful in war we should think that every barbarity in fire in wasting in murders in tortures and other cruelties too horrible and too full of turpitude for christian mouths to utter or ears to hear if done at our instigation by those who we know will make war thus if they make it at all to be to all intents and purposes as if done by ourselves we clear ourselves to you our brethren to the present age and to future generations to our king and our country and to europe which as a spectator beholds this tragic scene of every part or share in adding this last and worst of evils to the inevitable mischiefs of a civil war  we do not call you rebels and traitors we do not call for the vengeance of the crown against you we do not know how to qualify millions of our countrymen contending with one heart for an admission to privileges which we have ever thought our own happiness and honor by odious and unworthy names on the contrary we highly revere the principles on which you act though we lament some of their effects armed as you are we embrace you as our friends and as our brethren by the best and dearest ties of relation  we view the establishment of the english colonies on principles of liberty as that which is to render this kingdom venerable to future ages in comparison of this we regard all the victories and conquests of our warlike ancestors or of our own times as barbarous vulgar distinctions in which many nations whom we look upon with little respect or value have equalled if not far exceeded us this is the peculiar and appropriated glory of england those who have and who hold to that foundation of common liberty whether on this or on your side of the ocean we consider as the true and the only true englishmen those who depart from it whether there or here are attainted corrupted in blood and wholly fallen from their original rank and value they are the real rebels to the fair constitution and just supremacy of england  we exhort you therefore to cleave forever to those principles as being the true bond of union in this empireand to show by a manly perseverance that the sentiments of honor and the rights of mankind are not held by the uncertain events of war as you have hitherto shown a glorious and affecting example to the world that they are not dependent on the ordinary conveniences and satisfactions of life  knowing no other arguments to be used to men of liberal minds it is upon these very principles and these alone we hope and trust that no flattering and no alarming circumstances shall permit you to listen to the seductions of those who would alienate you from your dependence on the crown and parliament of this kingdom that very liberty which you so justly prize above all things originated here and it may be very doubtful whether without being constantly fed from the original fountain it can be at all perpetuated or preserved in its native purity and perfection untried forms of government may to unstable minds recommend themselves even by their novelty but you will do well to remember that england has been great and happy under the present limited monarchy subsisting in more or less vigor and purity for several hundred years none but england can communicate to you the benefits of such a constitution we apprehend you are not now nor for ages are likely to be capable of that form of constitution in an independent state besides let us suggest to you our apprehensions that your present union in which we rejoice and which we wish long to subsist cannot always subsist without the authority and weight of this great and long respected body to equipoise and to preserve you amongst yourselves in a just and fair equality it may not even be impossible that a long course of war with the administration of this country may be but a prelude to a series of wars and contentions among yourselves to end at length as such scenes have too often ended in a species of humiliating repose which nothing but the preceding calamities would reconcile to the dispirited few who survived them we allow that even this evil is worth the risk to men of honor when rational liberty is at stake as in the present case we confess and lament that it is but if ever a real security by parliament is given against the terror or the abuse of unlimited power and after such security given you should persevere in resistance we leave you to consider whether the risk is not incurred without an object or incurred for an object infinitely diminished by such concessions in its importance and value  as to other points of discussion when these grand fundamentals of your grants and charters are once settled and ratified by clear parliamentary authority as the ground for peace and forgiveness on our side and for a manly and liberal obedience on yours treaty and a spirit of reconciliation will easily and securely adjust whatever may remain of this we give you our word that so far as we are at present concerned and if by any event we should become more concerned hereafter you may rest assured upon the pledges of honor not forfeited faith not violated and uniformity of character and profession not yet broken we at least on these grounds will never fail you  respecting your wisdom and valuing your safety we do not call upon you to trust your existence to your enemies we do not advise you to an unconditional submission with satisfaction we assure you that almost all in both houses however unhappily they have been deluded so as not to give any immediate effect to their opinion disclaim that idea you can have no friends in whom you cannot rationally confide but parliament is your friend from the moment in which removing its confidence from those who have constantly deceived its good intentions it adopts the sentiments of those who have made sacrifices inferior indeed to yours but have however sacrificed enough to demonstrate the sincerity of their regard and value for your liberty and prosperity  arguments may be used to weaken your confidence in that public security because from some unpleasant appearances there is a suspicion that parliament itself is somewhat fallen from its independent spirit how far this supposition may be founded in fact we are unwilling to determine but we are well assured from experience that even if all were true that is contended for and in the extent too in which it is argued yet as long as the solid and welldisposed forms of this constitution remain there ever is within parliament itself a power of renovating its principles and effecting a selfreformation which no other plan of government has ever contained this constitution has therefore admitted innumerable improvements either for the correction of the original scheme or for removing corruptions or for bringing its principles better to suit those changes which have successively happened in the circumstances of the nation or in the manners of the people  we feel that the growth of the colonies is such a change of circumstances and that our present dispute is an exigency as pressing as any which ever demanded a revision of our government public troubles have often called upon this country to look into its constitution it has ever been bettered by such a revision if our happy and luxuriant increase of dominion and our diffused population have outgrown the limits of a constitution made for a contracted object we ought to bless god who has furnished us with this noble occasion for displaying our skill and beneficence in enlarging the scale of rational happiness and of making the politic generosity of this kingdom as extensive as its fortune if we set about this great work on both sides with the same conciliatory turn of mind we may now as in former times owe even to our mutual mistakes contentions and animosities the lasting concord freedom happiness and glory of this empire  gentlemen the distance between us with other obstructions has caused much misrepresentation of our mutual sentiments we therefore to obviate them as well as we are able take this method of assuring you of our thorough detestation of the whole war and particularly the mercenary and savage war carried on or attempted against youour thorough abhorrence of all addresses adverse to you whether public or privateour assurances of an invariable affection towards youour constant regard to your privileges and libertiesand our opinion of the solid security you ought to enjoy for them under the paternal care and nurture of a protecting parliament  though many of us have earnestly wished that the authority of that august and venerable body so necessary in many respects to the union of the whole should be rather limited by its own equity and discretion than by any bounds described by positive laws and public compactsand though we felt the extreme difficulty by any theoretical limitations of qualifying that authority so as to preserve one part and deny anotherand though you as we gratefully acknowledge had acquiesced most cheerfully under that prudent reserve of the constitution at that happy moment when neither you nor we apprehended a further return of the exercise of invidious powers we are now as fully persuaded as you can be by the malice inconstancy and perverse inquietude of many men and by the incessant endeavors of an arbitrary faction now too powerful that our common necessities do require a full explanation and ratified security for your liberties and our quiet  although his majestys condescension in committing the direction of his affairs into the hands of the known friends of his family and of the liberties of all his people would we admit be a great means of giving repose to your minds as it must give infinite facility to reconciliation yet we assure you that we think with such a security as we recommend adopted from necessity and not choice even by the unhappy authors and instruments of the public misfortunes that the terms of reconciliation if once accepted by parliament would not be broken we also pledge ourselves to you that we should give even to those unhappy persons an hearty support in effectuating the peace of the empire and every opposition in an attempt to cast it again into disorder  when that happy hour shall arrive let us in all affection recommend to you the wisdom of continuing as in former times or even in a more ample measure the support of your government and even to give to your administration some degree of reciprocal interest in your freedom we earnestly wish you not to furnish your enemies here or elsewhere with any sort of pretexts for reviving quarrels by too reserved and severe or penurious an exercise of those sacred rights which no pretended abuse in the exercise ought to impair nor by overstraining the principles of freedom to make them less compatible with those haughty sentiments in others which the very same principles may be apt to breed in minds not tempered with the utmost equity and justice  the wellwishers of the liberty and union of this empire salute you and recommend you most heartily to the divine protection     a  letter  to  the right hon edmund s pery  speaker of the irish house of commons  in relation to  a bill for the relief of the roman catholics of ireland  july 18 1778   note      this letter is addressed to mr pery afterwards lord pery     then speaker of the house of commons of ireland it appears     there had been much correspondence between that gentleman and     mr burke on the subject of heads of a bill which had     passed the irish house of commons in the summer of the year     1778 and had been transmitted by the irish privy council of     to england for the relief of his majestys roman catholic     subjects in ireland the bill contained a clause for     exempting the protestant dissenters of ireland from the     sacramental test which created a strong objection to the     whole measure on the part of the english government mr     burke employed his most strenuous efforts to remove the     prejudice which the kings ministers entertained against the     clause but the bill was ultimately returned without it and     in that shape passed the irish parliament 17th and 18th     geo iii cap 49 in the subsequent session however a     separate act was passed for the relief of the protestant     dissenters of ireland   letter  my dear siri received in due course your two very interesting and judicious letters which gave me many new lights and excited me to fresh activity in the important subject they related to however from that time i have not been perfectly free from doubt and uneasiness i used a liberty with those letters which perhaps nothing can thoroughly justify and which certainly nothing but the delicacy of the crisis the clearness of my intentions and your great goodnature can at all excuse i might conceal this from you but i think it better to lay the whole matter before you and submit myself to your mercyassuring you at the same time that if you are so kind as to continue your confidence on this or to renew it upon any other occasion i shall never be tempted again to make so bold and unauthorized an use of the trust you place in me i will state to you the history of the business since my last and then you will see how far i am excusable by the circumstances  on the 3rd of july i received a letter from the attorneygeneral dated the day before in which in a very open and obliging manner he desires my thoughts of the irish toleration bill and particularly of the dissenters clause i gave them to him by the return of the post at large but as the time pressed i kept no copy of the letter the general drift was strongly to recommend the whole and principally to obviate the objections to the part that related to the dissenters with regard both to the general propriety and to the temporary policy at this juncture i took likewise a good deal of pains to state the difference which had always subsisted with regard to the treatment of the protestant dissenters in ireland and in england and what i conceived the reason of that difference to be about the same time i was called to town for a day and i took an opportunity in westminster hall of urging the same points with all the force i was master of to the solicitorgeneral i attempted to see the chancellor for the same purpose but was not fortunate enough to meet him at home soon after my return hither on tuesday i received a very polite and i may say friendly letter from him wishing me on supposition that i had continued in town to dine with him as on that day in order to talk over the business of the toleration act then before him unluckily i had company with me and was not able to leave them until thursday when i went to town and called at his house but missed him however in answer to his letter i had before and instantly on the receipt of it written to him at large and urged such topics both with regard to the catholics and dissenters as i imagined were the most likely to be prevalent with him this letter i followed to town on thursday on my arrival i was much alarmed with a report that the ministry had thoughts of rejecting the whole bill mr mnamara seemed apprehensive that it was a determined measure and there seemed to be but too much reason for his fears  not having met the chancellor at home either on my first visit or my second after receiving his letter and fearful that the cabinet should come to come unpleasant resolution i went to the treasury on friday there i saw sir g cooper i possessed him of the danger of a partial and the inevitable mischief of the total rejection of the bill i reminded him of the understood compact between parties upon which the whole scheme of the toleration originating in the english bill was formedof the fair part which the whigs had acted in a business which though first started by them was supposed equally acceptable to all sides and the risk of which they took upon themselves when others declined it to this i added such matter as i thought most fit to engage government as governmentnot to sport with a singular opportunity which offered for the union of every description of men amongst us in support of the common interest of the whole and i ended by desiring to see lord north upon the subject sir grey cooper showed a very right sense of the matter and in a few minutes after our conversation i went down from the treasury chambers to lord norths house i had a great deal of discourse with him he told me that his ideas of toleration were large but that large as they were they did not comprehend a promiscuous establishment even in matters merely civil that he thought the established religion ought to be the religion of the state that in this idea he was not for the repeal of the sacramental test that indeed he knew the dissenters in general did not greatly scruple it but that very want of scruple showed less zeal against the establishment and after all there could no provision be made by human laws against those who made light of the tests which were formed to discriminate opinions on all this he spoke with a good deal of temper he did not indeed seem to think the test itself which was rightly considered by dissenters as in a manner dispensed with by an annual act of parliament and which in ireland was of a late origin and of much less extent than here a matter of much moment the thing which seemed to affect him most was the offence that would be taken at the repeal by the leaders among the church clergy here on one hand and on the other the steps which would be taken for its repeal in england in the next session in consequence of the repeal in ireland i assured him with great truth that we had no idea among the whigs of moving the repeal of the test i confessed very freely for my own part that if it were brought in i should certainly vote for it but that i should neither use nor did i think applicable any arguments drawn from the analogy of what was done in other parts of the british dominions we did not argue from analogy even in this island and united kingdom presbytery was established in scotland it became no reason either for its religious or civil establishment here in new england the independent congregational churches had an established legal maintenance whilst that country continued part of the british empire no argument in favor of independency was adduced from the practice of new england government itself lately thought fit to establish the roman catholic religion in canada but they would not suffer an argument of analogy to be used for its establishment anywhere else these things were governed as all things of that nature are governed not by general maxims but their own local and peculiar circumstances finding however that though he was very cool and patient i made no great way in the business of the dissenters i turned myself to try whether falling in with his maxims some modification might not be found the hint of which i received from your letter relative to the irish militia bill and the point i labored was so to alter the clause as to repeal the test quoad military and revenue offices for these being only subservient parts in the economy and execution rather than the administration of affairs the politic civil and judicial parts would still continue in the hands of the conformists to religious establishments without giving any hopes he however said that this distinction deserved to be considered after this i strongly pressed the mischief of rejecting the whole bill that a notion went abroad that government was not at this moment very well pleased with the dissenters as not very well affected to the monarchy that in general i conceived this to be a mistakebut if it were not the rejection of a bill in favor of others because something in favor of them was inserted instead of humbling and mortifying would infinitely exalt them for if the legislature had no means of favoring those whom they meant to favor as long as the dissenters could find means to get themselves included this would make them instead of their only being subject to restraint themselves the arbitrators of the fate of others and that not so much by their own strength which could not be prevented in its operation as by the coöperation of those whom they opposed in the conclusion i recommended that if they wished well to the measure which was the main object of the bill they must explicitly make it their own and stake themselves upon it that hitherto all their difficulties had arisen from their indecision and their wrong measures and to make lord north sensible of the necessity of giving a firm support to some part of the bill and to add weighty authority to my reasons i read him your letter of the 10th of july it seemed in some measure to answer the purpose which i intended i pressed the necessity of the management of the affair both as to conduct and as to gaining of men and i renewed my former advice that the lord lieutenant should be instructed to consult and cooperate with you in the whole affair all this was apparently very fairly taken  in the evening of that day i saw the lord chancellor with him too i had much discourse you know that he is intelligent sagacious systematic and determined at first he seemed of opinion that the relief contained in the bill was so inadequate to the mass of oppression it was intended to remove that it would be better to let it stand over until a more perfect and better digested plan could be settled this seemed to possess him very strongly in order to combat this notion and to show that the bill all things considered was a very great acquisition and that it was rather a preliminary than an obstruction to relief i ventured to show him your letter it had its effect he declared himself roundly against giving anything to a confederacy real or apparent to distress government that if anything was done for catholics or dissenters it should be done on its own separate merits and not by way of bargain and compromise that they should be each of them obliged to government not each to the other that this would be a perpetual nursery of faction in a word he seemed so determined on not uniting these plans that all i could say and i said everything i could think of was to no purpose but when i insisted on the disgrace to government which must arise from their rejecting a proposition recommended by themselves because their opposers had made a mixture separable too by themselves i was better heard on the whole i found him well disposed  as soon as i had returned to the country this affair lay so much on my mind and the absolute necessity of governments making a serious business of it agreeably to the seriousness they professed and the object required that i wrote to sir g cooper to remind him of the principles upon which we went in our conversation and to press the plan which was suggested for carrying them into execution he wrote to me on the 20th and assured me that lord north had given all due attention and respect to what you said to him on friday and will pay the same respect to the sentiments conveyed in your letter everything you say or write on the subject undoubtedly demands it whether this was mere civility or showed anything effectual in their intentions time and the success of this measure will show it is wholly with them and if it should fail you are a witness that nothing on our part has been wanting to free so large a part of our fellowsubjects and fellowcitizens from slavery and to free government from the weakness and danger of ruling them by force as to my own particular part the desire of doing this has betrayed me into a step which i cannot perfectly reconcile to myself you are to judge how far on the circumstances it may be excused i think it had a good effect you may be assured that i made this communication in a manner effectually to exclude so false and groundless an idea as that i confer with you any more than i confer with them on any party principle whatsoeveror that in this affair we look further than the measure which is in profession and i am sure ought to be in reason theirs  i am ever with the sincerest affection and esteem  my dear sir  your most faithful and obedient humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield 18th july 1778   i intended to have written sooner but it has not been in my power  to the speaker of the house of commons of ireland     two letters  to  thomas burgh esq  and  john merlott esq  in vindication of his parliamentary conduct relative to the affairs of ireland  1780     letter  to thomas burgh esq14   my dear siri do not know in what manner i am to thank you properly for the very friendly solicitude you have been so good as to express for my reputation the concern you have done me the honor to take in my affairs will be an ample indemnity from all that i may suffer from the rapid judgments of those who choose to form their opinions of men not from the life but from their portraits in a newspaper i confess to you that my frame of mind is so constructed i have in me so little of the constitution of a great man that i am more gratified with a very moderate share of approbation from those few who know me than i should be with the most clamorous applause from those multitudes who love to admire at a due distance  i am not however stoic enough to be able to affirm with truth or hypocrite enough affectedly to pretend that i am wholly unmoved at the difficulty which you and others of my friends in ireland have found in vindicating my conduct towards my native country it undoubtedly hurts me in some degree but the wound is not very deep if i had sought popularity in ireland when in the cause of that country i was ready to sacrifice and did sacrifice a much nearer a much more immediate and a much more advantageous popularity here i should find myself perfectly unhappy because i should be totally disappointed in my expectationsbecause i should discover when it was too late what common sense might have told me very early that i risked the capital of my fame in the most disadvantageous lottery in the world but i acted then as i act now and as i hope i shall act always from a strong impulse of right and from motives in which popularity either here or there has but a very little part  with the support of that consciousness i can bear a good deal of the coquetry of public opinion which has her caprices and must have her way miseri quibus intentata nitet i too have had my holiday of popularity in ireland i have even heard of an intention to erect a statue15 i believe my intimate acquaintance know how little that idea was encouraged by me and i was sincerely glad that it never took effect such honors belong exclusively to the tombthe natural and only period of human inconstancy with regard either to desert or to opinion for they are the very same hands which erect that very frequently and sometimes with reason enough pluck down the statue had such an unmerited and unlookedfor compliment been paid to me two years ago the fragments of the piece might at this hour have the advantage of seeing actual service while they were moving according to the law of projectiles to the windows of the attorneygeneral or of my old friend monk mason  to speak seriouslylet me assure you my dear sir that though i am not permitted to rejoice at all its effects there is not one man on your side of the water more pleased to see the situation of ireland so prosperous as that she can afford to throw away her friends she has obtained solely by her own efforts the fruits of a great victory which i am very ready to allow that the best efforts of her best wellwishers here could not have done for her so effectually in a great number of years and perhaps could not have done at all i could wish however merely for the sake of her own dignity that in turning her poor relations and antiquated friends out of doors though one of the most common effects of new prosperity she had thought proper to dismiss us with fewer tokens of unkindness it is true that there is no sort of danger in affronting men who are not of importance enough to have any trust of ministerial of royal or of national honor to surrender the unforced and unbought services of humble men who have no medium of influence in great assemblies but through the precarious force of reason must be looked upon with contempt by those who by their wisdom and spirit have improved the critical moment of their fortune and have debated with authority against pusillanimous dissent and ungracious compliance at the head of forty thousand men  such feeble auxiliaries as i talk of to such a force employed against such resistance i must own in the present moment very little worthy of your attention yet if one were to look forward it scarcely seems altogether politic to bestow so much liberality of invective on the whigs of this kingdom as i find has been the fashion to do both in and out of parliament that you should pay compliments in some tone or other whether ironical or serious to the minister from whose imbecility you have extorted what you could never obtain from his bounty is not unnatural in the first effusions of parliamentary gratitude to that minister for the early and voluntary benefits he has conferred upon ireland it might appear that you were wanting to the triumph of his surrender if you did not lead some of his enemies captive before him neither could you feast him with decorum if his particular taste were not consulted a minister who has never defended his measures in any other way than by railing at his adversaries cannot have his palate made all at once to the relish of positive commendation i cannot deny but that on this occasion there was displayed a great deal of the goodbreeding which consists in the accommodation of the entertainment to the relish of the guest  but that ceremony being past it would not be unworthy of the wisdom of ireland to consider what consequences the extinguishing every spark of freedom in this country may have upon your own liberties you are at this instant flushed with victory and full of the confidence natural to recent and untried power we are in a temper equally natural though very different we feel as men do who having placed an unbounded reliance on their force have found it totally to fail on trial we feel faint and heartless and without the smallest degree of selfopinion in plain words we are cowed when men give up their violence and injustice without a struggle their condition is next to desperate when no art no management no argument is necessary to abate their pride and overcome their prejudices and their uneasiness only excites an obscure and feeble rattling in their throat their final dissolution seems not far off in this miserable state we are still further depressed by the overbearing influence of the crown it acts with the officious cruelty of a mercenary nurse who under pretence of tenderness stifles us with our clothes and plucks the pillow from our heads injectu multæ vestis opprimi senem jubet under this influence we have so little will of our own that even in any apparent activity we may be got to assume i may say without any violence to sense and with very little to language we are merely passive we have yielded to your demands this session in the last session we refused to prevent them in both cases the passive and the active our principle was the same had the crown pleased to retain the spirit with regard to ireland which seems to be now all directed to america we should have neglected our own immediate defence and sent over the last man of our militia to fight with the last man of your volunteers  to this influence the principle of action the principle of policy and the principle of union of the present minority are opposed these principles of the opposition are the only thing which preserves a single symptom of life in the nation that opposition is composed of the far greater part of the independent property and independent rank of the kingdom of whatever is most untainted in character and of whatever ability remains unextinguished in the people and of all which tends to draw the attention of foreign countries upon this it is now in its final and conclusive struggle it has to struggle against a force to which i am afraid it is not equal the whole kingdom of scotland ranges with the venal the unprincipled and the wrongprincipled of this and if the kingdom of ireland thinks proper to pass into the same camp we shall certainly be obliged to quit the field in that case if i know anything of this country another constitutional opposition can never be formed in it and if this be impossible it will be at least as much so if there can be degrees in impossibility to have a constitutional administration at any future time the possibility of the former is the only security for the existence of the latter whether the present administration be in the least like one i must venture to doubt even in the honeymoon of the irish fondness to lord north which has succeeded to all their slappings and scratchings  if liberty cannot maintain its ground in this kingdom i am sure that it cannot have any long continuance in yours our liberty might now and then jar and strike a discord with that of ireland the thing is possible but still the instruments might play in concert but if ours be unstrung yours will be hung up on a peg and both will be mute forever your new military force may give you confidence and it serves well for a turn but you and i know that it has not root it is not perennial and would prove but a poor shelter for your liberty when this nation having no interest in its own could look upon yours with the eye of envy and disgust i cannot therefore help thinking and telling you what with great submission i think that if the parliament of ireland be so jealous of the spirit of our common constitution as she seems to be it was not so discreet to mix with the panegyric on the minister so large a portion of acrimony to the independent part of this nation you never received any sort of injury from them and you are grown to that degree of importance that the discourses in your parliament will have a much greater effect on our immediate fortune than our conversation can have upon yours in the end they will seriously affect both  i have looked back upon our conduct and our public conversations in order to discover what it is that can have given you offence i have done so because i am ready to admit that to offend you without any cause would be as contrary to true policy as i am sure it must be to the inclinations of almost every one of us about two years ago lord nugent moved six propositions in favor of ireland in the house of commons at the time of the motions and during the debate lord north was either wholly out of the house or engaged in other matters of business or pleasantry in the remotest recesses of the west saxon corner he took no part whatsoever in the affair but it was supposed his neutrality was more inclined towards the side of favor the mover being a person in office was however the only indication that was given of such a leaning we who supported the propositions finding them better relished than at first we looked for pursued our advantage and began to open a way for more essential benefits to ireland on the other hand those who had hitherto opposed them in vain redoubled their efforts and became exceedingly clamorous then it was that lord north found it necessary to come out of his fastness and to interpose between the contending parties in this character of mediator he declared that if anything beyond the first six resolutions should be attempted he would oppose the whole but that if we rested there the original motions should have his support on this a sort of convention took place between him and the managers of the irish business in which the six resolutions were to be considered as an uti possidetis and to be held sacred  by this time other parties began to appear a good many of the trading towns and manufactures of various kinds took the alarm petitions crowded in upon one another and the bar was occupied by a formidable body of council lord n was staggered by this new battery he is not of a constitution to encounter such an opposition as had then risen when there were no other objects in view than those that were then before the house in order not to lose him we were obliged to abandon bit by bit the most considerable part of the original agreement  in several parts however he continued fair and firm for my own part i acted as i trust i commonly do with decision i saw very well that the things we had got were of no great consideration but they were even in their defects somewhat leading i was in hopes that we might obtain gradually and by parts what we might attempt at once and in the whole without successthat one concession would lead to anotherand that the people of england discovering by a progressive experience that none of the concessions actually made were followed by the consequences they had dreaded their fears from what they were yet to yield would considerably diminish but that to which i attached myself the most particularly was to fix the principle of a free trade in all the ports of these islands as founded in justice and beneficial to the whole but principally to this the seat of the supreme power and this i labored to the utmost of my might upon general principles illustrated by all the commercial detail with which my little inquiries in life were able to furnish me i ought to forget such trifling things as those with all concerning myself and possibly i might have forgotten them if the lord advocate of scotland had not in a very flattering manner revived them in my memory in a full house in this session he told me that my arguments such as they were had made him at the period i allude to change the opinion with which he had come into the house strongly impressed i am sure that at the time at least twenty more told me the same thing i certainly ought not to take their style of compliment as a testimony to fact neither do i but all this showed sufficiently not what they thought of my ability but what they saw of my zeal i could say more in proof of the effects of that zeal and of the unceasing industry with which i then acted both in my endeavors which were apparent and those that were not so visible let it be remembered that i showed those dispositions while the parliament of england was in a capacity to deliberate and in a situation to refuse when there was something to be risked here by being suspected of a partiality to ireland when there was an honorable danger attending the profession of friendship to you which heightened its relish and made it worthy of a reception in manly minds but as for the awkward and nauseous parade of debate without opposition the flimsy device of tricking out necessity and disguising it in the habit of choice the shallow stratagem of defending by argument what all the world must perceive is yielded to forcethese are a sort of acts of friendship which i am sorry that any of my countrymen should require of their real friends they are things not to my taste and if they are looked upon as tests of friendship i desire for one that i may be considered as an enemy  what party purpose did my conduct answer at that time i acted with lord n i went to all the ministerial meetingsand he and his associates in office will do me the justice to say that aiming at the concord of the empire i made it my business to give his concessions all the value of which they were capable whilst some of those who were covered with his favors derogated from them treated them with contempt and openly threatened to oppose them if i had acted with my dearest and most valued friends if i had acted with the marquis of rockingham or the duke of richmond in that situation i could not have attended more to their honor or endeavored more earnestly to give efficacy to the measures i had taken in common with them the return which i and all who acted as i did have met with from him does not make me repent the conduct which i then held  as to the rest of the gentlemen with whom i have the honor to act they did not then or at any other time make a party affair of irish politics that matter was always taken up without concert but in general from the operation of our known liberal principles in government in commerce in religion in everything it was taken up favorably for ireland where some local interests bore hard upon the members they acted on the sense of their constituents upon ideas which though i do not always follow i cannot blame however two or three persons high in opposition and high in public esteem ran great risks in their boroughs on that occasion but all this was without any particular plan i need not say that ireland was in that affair much obliged to the liberal mind and enlarged understanding of charles fox to mr thomas townshend to lord midleton and others on reviewing that affair which gave rise to all the subsequent manoeuvres i am convinced that the whole of what has this day been done might have then been effected but then the minister must have taken it up as a great plan of national policy and paid with his person in every lodgment of his approach he must have used that influence to quiet prejudice which he has so often used to corrupt principle and i know that if he had he must have succeeded many of the most active in opposition would have given him an unequivocal support the corporation of london and the great body of the london west india merchants and planters which forms the greatest mass of that vast interest were disposed to fall in with such a plan they certainly gave no sort of discountenance to what was done or what was proposed but these are not the kind of objects for which our ministers bring out the heavy artillery of the state therefore as things stood at that time a great deal more was not practicable  last year another proposition was brought out for the relief of ireland it was started without any communication with a single person of activity in the country party and as it should seem without any kind of concert with government it appeared to me extremely raw and undigested the behavior of lord n on the opening of that business was the exact transcript of his conduct on the irish question in the former session it was a mode of proceeding which his nature has wrought into the texture of his politics and which is inseparable from them he chose to absent himself on the proposition and during the agitation of that businessalthough the business of the house is that alone for which he has any kind of relish or as i am told can be persuaded to listen to with any degree of attention but he was willing to let it take its course if it should pass without any considerable difficulty he would bring his acquiescence to tell for merit in ireland and he would have the credit out of his indolence of giving quiet to that country if difficulties should arise on the part of england he knew that the house was so well trained that he might at his pleasure call us off from the hottest scent as he acted in his usual manner and upon his usual principle opposition acted upon theirs and rather generally supported the measure as to myself i expressed a disapprobation at the practice of bringing imperfect and indigested projects into the house before means were used to quiet the clamors which a misconception of what we were doing might occasion at home and before measures were settled with men of weight and authority in ireland in order to render our acts useful and acceptable to that country i said that the only thing which could make the influence of the crown enormous without as well as within the house in any degree tolerable was that it might be employed to give something of order and system to the proceedings of a popular assembly that government being so situated as to have a large range of prospect and as it were a birdseye view of everything they might see distant dangers and distant advantages which were not so visible to those who stood on the common level they might besides observe them from this advantage in their relative and combined state which people locally instructed and partially informed could behold only in an insulated and unconnected mannerbut that for many years past we suffered under all the evils without any one of the advantages of a government influence that the business of a minister or of those who acted as such had been still further to contract the narrowness of mens ideas to confirm inveterate prejudices to inflame vulgar passions and to abet all sorts of popular absurdities in order the better to destroy popular rights and privileges that so far from methodizing the business of the house they had let all things run into an inextricable confusion and had left affairs of the most delicate policy wholly to chance  after i had expressed myself with the warmth i felt on seeing all government and order buried under the ruins of liberty and after i had made my protest against the insufficiency of the propositions i supported the principle of enlargement at which they aimed though short and somewhat wide of the markgiving as my sole reason that the more frequently these matters came into discussion the more it would tend to dispel fears and to eradicate prejudices  this was the only part i took the detail was in the hands of lord newhaven and lord beauchamp with some assistance from earl nugent and some independent gentlemen of irish property the dead weight of the minister being removed the house recovered its tone and elasticity we had a temporary appearance of a deliberative character the business was debated freely on both sides and with sufficient temper and the sense of the members being influenced by nothing but what will naturally influence men unbought their reason and their prejudices these two principles had a fair conflict and prejudice was obliged to give way to reason a majority appeared on a division in favor of the propositions  as these proceedings got out of doors glasgow and manchester and i think liverpool began to move but in a manner much more slow and languid than formerly nothing in my opinion would have been less difficult than entirely to have overborne their opposition the london west india trade was as on the former occasion so on this perfectly liberal and perfectly quiet and there is abroad so much respect for the united wisdom of the house when supposed to act upon a fair view of a political situation that i scarcely ever remember any considerable uneasiness out of doors when the most active members and those of most property and consideration in the minority have joined themselves to the administration many factious people in the towns i mentioned began indeed to revile lord north and to reproach his neutrality as treacherous and ungrateful to those who had so heartily and so warmly entered into all his views with regard to america that noble lord whose decided character it is to give way to the latest and nearest pressure without any sort of regard to distant consequences of any kind thought fit to appear on this signification of the pleasure of those his worthy friends and partisans and putting himself at the head of the posse scaccarii wholly regardless of the dignity and consistency of our miserable house drove the propositions entirely out of doors by a majority newly summoned to duty  in order to atone to ireland for this gratification to manchester he graciously permitted or rather forwarded two billsthat for encouraging the growth of tobacco and that for giving a bounty on exportation of hemp from ireland they were brought in by two very worthy members and on good principles but i was sorry to see them and after expressing my doubts of their propriety left the house little also else was said upon them my objections were two the first that the cultivation of those weeds if one of them could be at all cultivated to profit was adverse to the introduction of a good course of agriculture the other that the encouragement given to them tended to establish that mischievous policy of considering ireland as a country of staple and a producer of raw materials  when the rejection of the first propositions and the acceptance of the last had jointly as it was natural raised a very strong discontent in ireland lord rockingham who frequently said that there never seemed a more opportune time for the relief of ireland than that moment when lord north had rejected all rational propositions for its relief without consulting i believe any one living did what he is not often very willing to do but he thought this an occasion of magnitude enough to justify an extraordinary step he went into the closet and made a strong representation on the matter to the king which was not ill received and i believe produced good effects he then made the motion in the house of lords which you may recollect but he was content to withdraw all of censure which it contained on the solemn promise of ministry that they would in the recess of parliament prepare a plan for the benefit of ireland and have it in readiness to produce at the next meeting you may recollect that lord gower became in a particular manner bound for the fulfilling this engagement even this did not satisfy and most of the minority were very unwilling that parliament should be prorogued until something effectual on the subject should be doneparticularly as we saw that the distresses discontents and armaments of ireland were increasing every day and that we are not so much lost to common sense as not to know the wisdom and efficacy of early concession in circumstances such as ours  the session was now at an end the ministers instead of attending to a duty that was so urgent on them employed themselves as usual in endeavors to destroy the reputation of those who were bold enough to remind them of it they caused it to be industriously circulated through the nation that the distresses of ireland were of a nature hard to be traced to the true source that they had been monstrously magnified and that in particular the official reports from ireland had given the lie that was their phrase to lord rockinghams representations and attributing the origin of the irish proceedings wholly to us they asserted that everything done in parliament upon the subject was with a view of stirring up rebellion that neither the irish legislature nor their constituents had signified any dissatisfaction at the relief obtained in the session preceding the last that to convince both of the impropriety of their peaceable conduct opposition by making demands in the name of ireland pointed out what she might extort from great britain that the facility with which relief was formerly granted instead of satisfying opposition was calculated to create new demands these demands as they interfered with the commerce of great britain were certain of being opposeda circumstance which could not fail to create that desirable confusion which suits the views of the party that they the irish had long felt their own misery without knowing well from whence it came our worthy patriots by pointing out great britain as the cause of irish distress may have some chance of rousing irish resentment this i quote from a pamphlet as perfectly contemptible in point of writing as it is false in its facts and wicked in its design but as it is written under the authority of ministers by one of their principal literary pensioners and was circulated with great diligence and as i am credibly informed at a considerable expense to the public i use the words of that book to let you see in what manner the friends and patrons of ireland the heroes of your parliament represented all efforts for your relief here what means they took to dispose the minds of the people towards that great object and what encouragement they gave to all who should choose to exert themselves in your favor their unwearied endeavors were not wholly without success and the unthinking people in many places became illaffected towards us on this account for the ministers proceeded in your affairs just as they did with regard to those of america they always represented you as a parcel of blockheads without sense or even feeling that all your words were only the echo of faction here and as you have seen above that you had not understanding enough to know that your trade was cramped by restrictive acts of the british parliament unless we had for factious purposes given you the information they were so far from giving the least intimation of the measures which have since taken place that those who were supposed the best to know their intentions declared them impossible in the actual state of the two kingdoms and spoke of nothing but an act of union as the only way that could be found of giving freedom of trade to ireland consistently with the interests of this kingdom even when the session opened lord north declared that he did not know what remedy to apply to a disease of the cause of which he was ignorant and ministry not being then entirely resolved how far they should submit to your energy they by anticipation set the above author or some of his associates to fill the newspapers with invectives against us as distressing the minister by extravagant demands in favor of ireland  i need not inform you that everything they asserted of the steps taken in ireland as the result of our machinations was utterly false and groundless for myself i seriously protest to you that i neither wrote a word or received a line upon any matter relative to the trade of ireland or to the polities of it from the beginning of the last session to the day that i was honored with your letter it would be an affront to the talents in the irish parliament to say one word more  what was done in ireland during that period in and out of parliament never will be forgotten you raised an army new in its kind and adequate to its purposes it effected its end without its exertion it was not under the authority of law most certainly but it derived from an authority still higher and as they say of faith that it is not contrary to reason but above it so this army did not so much contradict the spirit of the law as supersede it what you did in the legislative body is above all praise by your proceeding with regard to the supplies you revived the grand use and characteristic benefit of parliament which was on the point of being entirely lost amongst us these sentiments i never concealed and never shall and mr fox expressed them with his usual power when he spoke on the subject  all this is very honorable to you but in what light must we see it how are we to consider your armament without commission from the crown when some of the first people in this kingdom have been refused arms at the time they did not only not reject but solicited the kings commissions here to arm and embody would be represented as little less than high treason if done on private authority with you it receives the thanks of a privy counsellor of great britain who obeys the irish house of lords in that point with pleasure and is made secretary of state the moment he lands here for his reward you shortened the credit given to the crown to six months you hung up the public credit of your kingdom by a thread you refused to raise any taxes whilst you confessed the public debt and public exigencies to be great and urgent beyond example you certainly acted in a great style and on sound and invincible principles but if we in the opposition which fills ireland with such loyal horrors had even attempted what we never did even attempt the smallest delay or the smallest limitation of supply in order to a constitutional coercion of the crown we should have been decried by all the court and tory mouths of this kingdom as a desperate faction aiming at the direct ruin of the country and to surrender it bound hand and foot to a foreign enemy by actually doing what we never ventured to attempt you have paid your court with such address and have won so much favor with his majesty and his cabinet that they have of their special grace and mere motion raised you to new titles and for the first time ill a speech from the throne complimented you with the appellation of faithful and loyaland in order to insult our lowspirited and degenerate obedience have thrown these epithets and your resistance together in our teeth what do you think were the feelings of every man who looks upon parliament in an higher light than that of a marketovert for legalizing a base traffic of votes and pensions when he saw you employ such means of coercion to the crown in order to coerce our parliament through that medium how much his majesty is pleased with his part of the civility must be left to his own taste but as to us you declared to the world that you knew that the way of bringing us to reason was to apply yourselves to the true source of all our opinions and the only motive to all our conduct now it seems you think yourselves affronted because a few of us express some indignation at the minister who has thought fit to strip us stark naked and expose the true state of our poxed and pestilential habit to the world think or say what you will in ireland i shall ever think it a crime hardly to be expiated by his blood he might and ought by a longer continuance or by an earlier meeting of this parliament to have given us the credit of some wisdom in foreseeing and anticipating an approaching force so far from it lord gower coming out of his own cabinet declares that one principal cause of his resignation was his not being able to prevail on the present minister to give any sort of application to this business even on the late meeting of parliament nothing determinate could be drawn from him or from any of his associates until you had actually passed the short money billwhich measure they flattered themselves and assured others you would never come up to disappointed in their expectation at of seeing the siege raised they surrendered at discretion  judge my dear sir of our surprise at finding your censure directed against those whose only crime was in accusing the ministers of not having prevented your demands by our graces of not having given you the natural advantages of your country in the most ample the most early and the most liberal manner and for not having given away authority in such a manner as to insure friendship that you should make the panegyric of the ministers is what i expected because in praising their bounty you paid a just compliment to your own force but that you should rail at us either individually or collectively is what i can scarcely think a natural proceeding i can easily conceive that gentlemen might grow frightened at what they had donethat they might imagine they had undertaken a business above their directionthat having obtained a state of independence for their country they meant to take the deserted helm into their own hands and supply by their very real abilities the total inefficacy of the nominal government all these might be real and might be very justifiable motives for their reconciling themselves cordially to the present court system but i do not so well discover the reasons that could induce them at the first feeble dawning of life in this country to do all in their power to cast a cloud over it and to prevent the least hope of our effecting the necessary reformations which are aimed at in our constitution and in our national economy  but it seems i was silent at the passing the resolutions why what had i to say if i had thought them too much i should have been accused of an endeavor to inflame england if i should represent them as too little i should have been charged with a design of fomenting the discontents of ireland into actual rebellion the treasury bench represented that the affair was a matter of state they represented it truly i therefore only asked whether they knew these propositions to be such as would satisfy ireland for if they were so they would satisfy me this did not indicate that i thought them too ample in this our silence however dishonorable to parliament there was one advantagethat the whole passed as far as it is gone with complete unanimity and so quickly that there was no time left to excite any opposition to it out of doors in the west india business reasoning on what had lately passed in the parliament of ireland and on the mode in which it was opened here i thought i saw much matter of perplexity but i have now better reason than ever to be pleased with my silence if i had spoken one of the most honest and able men16 in the irish parliament would probably have thought my observation an endeavor to sow dissension which he was resolved to preventand one of the most ingenious and one of the most amiable men17 that ever graced yours or any house of parliament might have looked on it as a chimera in the silence i observed i was strongly countenanced to say no more of it by every gentleman of ireland that i had the honor of conversing with in london the only word for that reason which i spoke was to restrain a worthy county member18 who had received some communication from a great trading place in the county he represents which if it had been opened to the house would have led to a perplexing discussion of one of the most troublesome matters that could arise in this business i got up to put a stop to it and i believe if you knew what the topic was you would commend my discretion  that it should be a matter of public discretion in me to be silent on the affairs of ireland is what on all accounts i bitterly lament i stated to the house what i felt and i felt as strongly as human sensibility can feel the extinction of my parliamentary capacity where i wished to use it most when i came into this parliament just fourteen years agointo this parliament then in vulgar opinion at least the presiding council of the greatest empire existing and perhaps all things considered that ever did exist obscure and a stranger as i was i considered myself as raised to the highest dignity to which a creature of our species could aspire in that opinion one of the chief pleasures in my situation what was first anduppermost in my thoughts was the hope without injury to this country to be somewhat useful to the place of my birth and education which in many respects internal and external i thought ill and impolitically governed but when i found that the house surrendering itself to the guidance of an authority not grown out of an experienced wisdom and integrity but out of the accidents of court favor had become the sport of the passions of men at once rash and pusillanimousthat it had even got into the habit of refusing everything to reason and surrendering everything to force all my power of obliging either my country or individuals was gone all the lustre of my imaginary rank was tarnished and i felt degraded even by my elevation i said this or something to this effect if it gives offence to ireland i am sorry for it it was the reason i gave for my silence and it was as far as it went the true one  with you this silence of mine and of others was represented as factious and as a discountenance to the measure of your relief do you think us children if it had been our wish to embroil matters and for the sake of distressing ministry to commit the two kingdoms in a dispute we had nothing to do but without at all condemning the propositions to have gone into the commercial detail of the objects of them it could not have been refused to us and you who know the nature of business so well must know that this would have caused such delays and given rise during that delay to such discussions as all the wisdom of your favorite minister could never have settled but indeed you mistake your men we tremble at the idea of a disunion of these two nations the only thing in which we differ with you is thisthat we do not think your attaching yourselves to the court and quarrelling with the independent part of this people is the way to promote the union of two free countries or of holding them together by the most natural and salutary ties                                       you will be frightened when you see this long letter i smile when i consider the length of it myself i never that i remember wrote any of the same extent but it shows me that the reproaches of the country that i once belonged to and in which i still have a dearness of instinct more than i can justify to reason make a greater impression on me than i had imagined but parting words are admitted to be a little tedious because they are not likely to be renewed if it will not be making yourself as troublesome to others as i am to you i shall be obliged to you if you will show this at their greatest leisure to the speaker to your excellent kinsman to mr grattan mr yelverton and mr daly all these i have the honor of being personally known to except mr yelverton to whom i am only known by my obligations to him if you live in any habits with my old friend the provost i shall be glad that he too sees this my humble apology  adieu once more accept my best thanks for the interest you take in me believe that it is received by an heart not yet so old as to have lost its susceptibility all here give you the best oldfashioned wishes of the season and believe me with the greatest truth and regard  my dear sir  your most faithful and obliged humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield new years day 1780   i am frightened at the trouble i give you and our friends but i recollect that you are mostly lawyers and habituated to read long tiresome papersand where your friendship is concerned without a fee i am sure too that you will not act the lawyer in scrutinizing too minutely every expression which my haste may make me use i forgot to mention my friend ohara and others but you will communicate it as you please  footnotes  14 mr thomas burgh of old town was a member of the house of commons in irelandit appears from a letter written by this gentleman to mr burke december 24 1779 and to which the following is an answer that the part mr burke had taken in the discussion which the affairs of ireland had undergone in the preceding sessions of parliament in england had been grossly misrepresented and much censured in ireland  15 this intention was communicated to mr burke in a letter from mr pery the speaker of the house of commons in ireland  16 mr grattan  17 mr hussey burgh  18 mr stanley member for lancashire     letter  to john merlott esq19   dear siri am very unhappy to find that my conduct in the business of ireland on a former occasion had made many to be cold and indifferent who would otherwise have been warm in my favor i really thought that events would have produced a quite contrary effect and would have proved to all the inhabitants of bristol that it was no desire of opposing myself to their wishes but a certain knowledge of the necessity of their affairs and a tender regard to their honor and interest which induced me to take the part which i then took they placed me in a situation which might enable me to discern what was fit to be done on a consideration of the relative circumstances of this country and all its neighbors this was what you could not so well do yourselves but you had a right to expect that i should avail myself of the advantage which i derived from your favor under the impressionof this duty and this trust i had endeavored to render by preventive graces and concessions every act of power at the same time an act of lenitythe result of english bounty and not of english timidity and distress i really flattered myself that the events which have proved beyond dispute the prudence of such a maxim would have obtained pardon for me if not approbation but if i have not been so fortunate i do most sincerely regret my great lossthis comfort however that if i have disobliged my constituents it was not in pursuit of any sinister interest or any party passion of my own but in endeavoring to save them from disgrace along with the whole community to which they and i belong i shall be concerned for this and very much so but i should be more concerned if in gratifying a present humor of theirs i had rendered myself unworthy of their former or their future choice i confess that i could not bear to face my constituents at the next general election if i had been a rival to lord north in the glory of having refused some small insignificant concessions in favor of ireland to the arguments and supplications of english members of parliamentand in the very next session on the demand of forty thousand irish bayonets of having made a speech of two hours long to prove that my former conduct was founded upon no one right principle either of policy justice or commerce i never heard a more elaborate more able more convincing and more shameful speech the debater obtained credit but the statesman was disgraced forever amends were made for having refused small but timely concessions by an unlimited and untimely surrender not only of every one of the objects of former restraints but virtually of the whole legislative power itself which had made them for it is not necessary to inform you that the unfortunate parliament of this kingdom did not dare to qualify the very liberty she gave of trading with her own plantations by applying of her own authority any one of the commercial regulations to the new traffic of ireland which bind us here under the several acts of navigation we were obliged to refer them to the parliament of ireland as conditions just in the same manner as if we were bestowing a privilege of the same sort on france and spain or any other independent power and indeed with more studied caution than we should have used not to shock the principle of their independence how the minister reconciled the refusal to reason and the surrender to arms raised in defiance of the prerogatives of the crown to his master i know not it has probably been settled in some way or other between themselves but however the king and his ministers may settle the question of his dignity and his rights i thought it became me by vigilance and foresight to take care of yours i thought i ought rather to lighten the ship in time than expose it to a total wreck the conduct pursued seemed to me without weight or judgment and more fit for a member for banbury than a member for bristol i stood therefore silent with grief and vexation on that day of the signal shame and humiliation of this degraded king and country but it seems the pride of ireland in the day of her power was equal to ours when we dreamt we were powerful too i have been abused there even for my silence which was construed into a desire of exciting discontent in england but thank god my letter to bristol was in print my sentiments on the policy of the measure were known and determined and such as no man could think me absurd enough to contradict when i am no longer a free agent i am obliged in the crowd to yield to necessity it is surely enough that i silently submit to power it is enough that i do not foolishly affront the conqueror it is too hard to force me to sing his praises whilst i am led in triumph before himor to make the panegyric of our own minister who would put me neither in a condition to surrender with honor or to fight with the smallest hope of victory i was i confess sullen and silent on that dayand shall continue so until i see some disposition to inquire into this and other causes of the national disgrace if i suffer in my reputation for it in ireland i am sorry but it neither does nor can affect me so nearly as my suffering in bristol for having wished to unite the interests of the two nations in a manner that would secure the supremacy of this  will you have the goodness to excuse the length of this letter my earnest desire of explaining myself in every point which may affect the mind of any worthy gentleman in bristol is the cause of it to yourself and to your liberal and manly notions i know it is not so necessary believe me  my dear sir  your most faithful and obedient humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield april 4th 1780   to john merlott esq bristol  footnotes  19 an eminent merchant in the city of bristol of which mr burke was one of the representatives in parliamentit relates to the same subject as the preceding letter     letters and reflections  on the  executions of the rioters  in 1780     letters      to the lord chancellor   my lordi hope i am not too late with the inclosed slight observations if the execution already ordered cannot be postponed might i venture to recommend that it should extend to one only and then the plan suggested in the inclosed paper may if your lordship thinks well of it take place with such improvements as your better judgment may dictate as to fewness of the executions and the good effects of that policy i cannot for my own part entertain the slightest doubt  if you have no objection and think it may not occupy

learn more early the probable extent of the executions in consequence of the late disturbances i take the liberty of laying before you with the sincerest deference to your judgment what appeared to me very early as reasonable in this business further thoughts have since occurred to me i confess my mind is under no small degree of solicitude and anxiety on the subject i am fully persuaded that a proper use of mercy would not only recommend the wisdom and steadiness of government but if properly used might be made a means of drawing out the principal movers in this wicked business who have hitherto eluded your scrutiny i beg pardon for this intrusion and have the honor to be with great regard and esteem  my lord  your lordships most obedient humble servant  edmund burke  charles street july 18 1780                                         to sir grey cooper bart20   dear sir  according to your desire i send you a copy of the few reflections on the subject of the present executions which occurred to me in the earliest period of the late disturbances and which all my experience and observation since have most strongly confirmed the executions taking those which have been made which are now ordered and which may be the natural consequence of the convictions in surrey will be undoubtedly too many to answer any good purpose great slaughter attended the suppression of the tumults and this ought to be taken in discount from the execution of the law for gods sake entreat of lord north to take a view of the sum total of the deaths before any are ordered for execution for by not doing something of this kind people are decoyed in detail into severities they never would have dreamed of if they had the whole in their view at once the scene in surrey would have affected the hardest heart that ever was in an human breast justice and mercy have not such opposite interests as people are apt to imagine i saw lord loughborough last night he seemed strongly impressed with the sense of what necessity obliged him to go through and i believe will enter into our ideas on the subject on this matter you see that no time is to be lost before a final determination the first thing i would recommend is that if the very next execution cannot be delayed by the way i do not see why it may not it may be of but a single person and that afterwards you should not exceed two or three for it is enough for one riot where the very act of parliament on which you proceed is rather a little hard in its sanctions and its construction not that i mean to complain of the latter as either new or strained but it was rigid from the first  i am dear sir  your most obedient humble servant  edmund burke  tuesday 18th july 1780   i really feel uneasy on this business and should consider it as a sort of personal favor if you do something to limit the extent and severity of the law on this point present my best compliments to lord north and if he thinks that i have had wishes to be serviceable to government on the late occasion i shall on my part think myself abundantly rewarded if a few lives less than first intended should be saved taken i should sincerely set it down as a personal obligation though the thing stands upon general and strong reason of its own21  footnotes  20 one of the secretaries of the treasury  21 it appears by the following extract from a letter written by the earl of mansfield to mr burke dated the 17th july 1780 that these reflections had also been communicated to himi have received the honor of your letter and very judicious thoughts having been so greatly injured myself i have thought it more decent not to attend the reports and consequently have not been present at any deliberation upon the subject     some thoughts  on the approaching executions  humbly offered to consideration   as the number of persons convicted on account of the late unhappy tumults will probably exceed what any ones idea of vengeance or example would deliver to capital punishment it is to be wished that the whole business as well with regard to the number and description of those who are to suffer death as with regard to those who shall be delivered over to lighter punishment or wholly pardoned should be entirely a work of reason  it has happened frequently in cases of this nature that the fate of the convicts has depended more upon the accidental circumstance of their being brought earlier or later to trial than to any steady principle of equity applied to their several cases without great care and sobriety criminal justice generally begins with anger and ends in negligence the first that are brought forward suffer the extremity of the law with circumstances of mitigation of their case and after a time the most atrocious delinquents escape merely by the satiety of punishment  in the business now before his majesty the following thoughts are humbly submitted  if i understand the temper of the public at this moment a very great part of the lower and some of the middling people of this city are in a very critical disposition and such as ought to be managed with firmness and delicacy in general they rather approve than blame the principles of the rioters though the better sort of them are afraid of the consequences of those very principles which they approve this keeps their minds in a suspended and anxious state which may very easily be exasperated by an injudicious severity into desperate resolutionsor by weak measures on the part of government it may be encouraged to the pursuit of courses which may be of the most dangerous consequences to the public  there is no doubt that the approaching executions will very much determine the future conduct of those people they ought to be such as will humble not irritate nothing will make government more awful to them than to see that it does not proceed by chance or under the influence of passion  it is therefore proposed that no execution should be made until the number of persons which government thinks fit to try is completed when the whole is at once under the eye an examination ought to be made into the circumstances of every particular convict and six at the very utmost of the fittest examples may then be selected for execution who ought to be brought out and put to death on one and the same day in six different places and in the most solemn manner that can be devised afterwards great care should be taken that their bodies may not be delivered to their friends or to others who may make them objects of compassion or even veneration some instances of the kind have happened with regard to the bodies of those killed in the riots the rest of the malefactors ought to be either condemned for larger longer or shorter terms to the lighters houses of correction service in the navy and the like according to the case  this small number of executions and all at one time though in different places is seriously recommended because it is certain that a great havoc among criminals hardens rather than subdues the minds of people inclined to the same crimes and therefore fails of answering its purpose as an example men who see their lives respected and thought of value by others come to respect that gift of god themselves to have compassion for oneself or to care more or less for ones own life is a lesson to be learned just as every other and i believe it will be found that conspiracies have been most common and most desperate where their punishment has been most extensive and most severe  besides the least excess in this way excites a tenderness in the milder sort of people which makes them consider government in an harsh and odious light the sense of justice in men is overloaded and fatigued with a long series of executions or with such a carnage at once as rather resembles a massacre than a sober execution of the laws the laws thus lose their terror in the minds of the wicked and their reverence in the minds of the virtuous  i have ever observed that the execution of one man fixes the attention and excites awe the execution of multitudes dissipates and weakens the effect but men reason themselves into disapprobation and disgust they compute more as they feel less and every severe act which does not appear to be necessary is sure to be offensive  in selecting the criminals a very different line ought to be followed from that recommended by the champions of the protestant association they recommend that the offenders for plunder ought to be punished and the offenders from principle spared but the contrary rule ought to be followed the ordinary executions of which there are enough in conscience are for the former species of delinquents but such common plunderers would furnish no example in the present case where the false or pretended principle of religion which leads to crimes is the very thing to be discouraged  but the reason which ought to make these people objects of selection for punishment confines the selection to very few for we must consider that the whole nation has been for a long time guilty of their crime toleration is a new virtue in any country it is a late ripe fruit in the best climates we ought to recollect the poison which under the name of antidotes against popery and such like mountebank titles has been circulated from our pulpits and from our presses from the heads of the church of england and the heads of the dissenters these publications by degrees have tended to drive all religion from our own minds and to fill them with nothing but a violent hatred of the religion of other people and of course with a hatred of their persons and so by a very natural progression they have led men to the destruction of their goods and houses and to attempts upon their lives  this delusion furnishes no reason for suffering that abominable spirit to be kept alive by inflammatory libels or seditious assemblies or for governments yielding to it in the smallest degree any point of justice equity or sound policy the king certainly ought not to give up any part of his subjects to the prejudices of another so far from it i am clearly of opinion that on the late occasion the catholics ought to have been taken more avowedly than they were under the protection of government as the dissenters had been on a similar occasion  but though we ought to protect against violence the bigotry of others and to correct our own too if we have any left we ought to reflect that an offence which in its cause is national ought not in its effects to be vindicated on individuals but with a very welltempered severity  for my own part i think the fire is not extinguishedon the contrary it seems to require the attention of government more than ever but as a part of any methodical plan for extinguishing this flame it really seems necessary that the execution of justice should be as steady and as cool as possible     some additional reflections  on the executions   the great number of sufferers seems to arise from the misfortune incident to the variety of judicatures which have tried the crimes it were well if the whole had been the business of one commission for now every trial seems as if it were a separate business and in that light each offence is not punished with greater severity than single offences of the kind are commonly marked but in reality and fact this unfortunate affair though diversified in the multitude of overt acts has been one and the same riot and therefore the executions so far as regards the general effect on the minds of men will have a reference to the unity of the offence and will appear to be much more severe than such a riot atrocious as it was can well justify in government i pray that it may be recollected that the chief delinquents have hitherto escaped and very many of those who are fallen into the hands of justice are a poor thoughtless set of creatures very little aware of the nature of their offence none of the listmakers the assemblers of the mob the directors and arrangers have been convicted the preachers of mischief remain safe and are wicked enough not to feel for their deluded disciplesno not at all i would not plead the ignorance of the law in any even the most ignorant as a justification but i am sure that when the question is of mercy it is a very great and powerful argument i have all the reason in the world to believe that they did not know their offence was capital  there is one argument which i beg may not be considered as brought for any invidious purpose or meant as imputing blame anywhere but which i think with candid and considerate men will have much weight the unfortunate delinquents were perhaps much encouraged by some remissness on the part of government itself the absolute and entire impunity attending the same offence in edinburgh which was over and over again urged as an example and encouragement to these unfortunate people might be a means of deluding them perhaps too a languor in the beginning of the riots here which suffered the leaders to proceed until very many as it were by the contagion of a sort of fashion were carried to these excesses might make these people think that there was something in the case which induced government to wink at the irregularity of the proceedings  the conduct and condition of the lord mayor ought in my opinion to be considered his answers to lord beauchamp to mr malo and to mr langdale make him appear rather an accomplice in the crimes than guilty of negligence as a magistrate such an example set to the mob by the first magistrate of the city tends greatly to palliate their offence  the license and complete impunity too of the publications which from the beginning instigated the people to such actions and in the midst of trials and executions still continues does in a great degree render these creatures an object of compassion in the public advertiser of this morning there are two or three paragraphs strongly recommending such outrages and stimulating the people to violence against the houses and persons of roman catholics and even against the chapels of the foreign ministers  i would not go so far as to adopt the maxim quicquid multis peccatur inultum but certainly offences committed by vast multitudes are somewhat palliated in the individuals who when so many escape are always looked upon rather as unlucky than criminal all our loose ideas of justice as it affects any individual have in them something of comparison to the situation of others and no systematic reasoning can wholly free us from such impressions  phil de comines says our english civil wars were less destructive than others because the cry of the conqueror always was spare the common people this principle of war should be at least as prevalent in the execution of justice the appetite of justice is easily satisfied and it is best nourished with the least possible blood we may too recollect that between capital punishment and total impunity there are many stages  on the whole every circumstance of mercy and of comparative justice does in my opinion plead in favor of such low untaught or illtaught wretches but above all the policy of government is deeply interested that the punishments should appear one solemn deliberate act aimed not at random and at particular offences but done with a relation to the general spirit of the tumults and they ought to be nothing more than what is sufficient to mark and discountenance that spirit  circumstances for mercy    not being principal   probable want of early and deliberate purposes   youth where the highest malice does not appear   sex where the highest malice does not appear   intoxication and levity or mere wantonness of any kind     a  letter  to  the right hon henry dundas  one of his majestys principal secretaries of state  with the  sketch of a negro code  1792   dear siri should have been punctual in sending you the sketch i promised of my old african code if some friends from london had not come in upon me last saturday and engaged me till noon this day i send this packet by one of them who is still here if what i send be as under present circumstances it must be imperfect you will excuse it as being done near twelve years ago about four years since i made an abstract of it upon which i cannot at present lay my hands but i hope the marginal heads will in some measure supply it  if the african trade could be considered with regard to itself only and as a single object i should think the utter abolition to be on the whole more advisable than any scheme of regulation an reform rather than suffer it to continue as it is i heartily wish it at an end what has been lately done has been done by a popular spirit which seldom calls for and indeed very rarely relishes a system made up of a great variety of parts and which is to operate its effect in a great length of time the people like short methods the consequences of which they sometimes have reason to repent of abolition is but a single act to prove the nature of the trade and to expose it properly required indeed a vast collection of materials which have been laboriously collected and compiled with great judgment it required also much perseverance and address to excite the spirit which has been excited without doors and which has carried it through the greatest eloquence ever displayed in the house has been employed to second the efforts which have been made abroad all this however leads but to one single resolve when this was done all was done i speak of absolute and immediate abolition the point which the first motions went to and which is in effect still pressed though in this session according to order it cannot take effect a remote and a gradual abolition though they may be connected are not the same thing the idea of the house seems to me if i rightly comprehend it that the two things are to be combined that is to say that the trade is gradually to decline and to cease entirely at a determinate period to make the abolition gradual the regulations must operate as a strong discouragement but it is much to be feared that a trade continued and discouraged and with a sentence of death passed upon it will perpetuate much ill blood between those who struggle for the abolition and those who contend for an effectual continuance  at the time when i formed the plan which i have the honor to transmit to you an abolition of the slave trade would have appeared a very chimerical project my plan therefore supposes the continued existence of that commerce taking for my basis that i had an incurable evil to deal with i cast about how i should make it as small an evil as possible and draw out of it some collateral good  in turning the matter over in my mind at that time and since i never was able to consider the african trade upon a ground disconnected with the employment of negroes in the west indies and distinct from their condition in the plantations whereon they serve i conceived that the true origin of the trade was not in the place it was begun at but at the place of its final destination i therefore was and i still am of opinion that the whole work ought to be taken up together and that a gradual abolition of slavery in the west indies ought to go hand in hand with anything which should be done with regard to its supply from the coast of africa i could not trust a cessation of the demand for this supply to the mere operation of any abstract principle such as that if their supply was cut off the planters would encourage and produce an effectual population knowing that nothing can be more uncertain than the operation of general principles if they are not embodied in specific regulations i am very apprehensive that so long as the slavery continues some means for its supply will be found if so i am persuaded that it is better to allow the evil in order to correct it than by endeavoring to forbid what we cannot be able wholly to prevent to leave it under an illegal and therefore an unreformed existence it is not that my plan does not lead to the extinction of the slave trade but it is through a very slow progress the chief effect of which is to be operated in our own plantations by rendering in a length of time all foreign supply unnecessary it was my wish whilst the slavery continued and the consequent commerce to take such measures as to civilize the coast of africa by the trade which now renders it more barbarous and to lead by degrees to a more reputable and possibly a more profitable connection with it than we maintain at present  i am sure that you will consider as a mark of my confidence in yours and mr pitts honor and generosity that i venture to put into your hands a scheme composed of many and intricate combinations without a full explanatory preface or any attendant notes to point out the principles upon which i proceeded in every regulation which i have proposed towards the civilization and gradual manumission of negroes in the two hemispheres i confess i trust infinitely more according to the sound principles of those who ever have at any time meliorated the state of mankind to the effect and influence of religion than to all the rest of the regulations put together  whenever in my proposed reformation we take our point of departure from a state of slavery we must precede the donation of freedom by disposing the minds of the objects to a disposition to receive it without danger to themselves or to us the process of bringing free savages to order and civilization is very different when a state of slavery is that upon which we are to work the very means which lead to liberty must partake of compulsion the minds of men being crippled with that restraint can do nothing for themselves everything must be done for them the regulations can owe little to consent everything must be the creature of power hence it is that regulations must be multiplied particularly as you have two parties to deal with the planter you must at once restrain and support and you must control at the same time that you ease the servant this necessarily makes the work a matter of care labor and expense it becomes in its nature complex but i think neither the object impracticable nor the expense intolerable and i am fully convinced that the cause of humanity would be far more benefited by the continuance of the trade and servitude regulated and reformed than by the total destruction of both or either what i propose however is but a beginning of a course of measures which an experience of the effects of the evil and the reform will enable the legislature hereafter to supply and correct  i need not observe to you that the forms are often neglected penalties not provided c c c but all this is merely mechanical and what a couple of days application would set to rights  i have seen what has been done by the west indian assemblies it is arrant trifling they have done little and what they have done is good for nothingfor it is totally destitute of an executory principle this is the point to which i have applied my whole diligence it is easy enough to say what shall be done to cause it to be donehic labor hoc opus  i ought not to apologize for letting this scheme lie beyond the period of the horatian keepingi ought much more to entreat an excuse for producing it now its whole value if it has any is the coherence and mutual dependency of parts in the scheme separately they can be of little or no use  i have the honor to be with very great respect and regard  dear sir  your most faithful and obedient humble servant  edmund burke  beaconsfield eastermonday night 1792     sketch of a negro code   this constitution consists of four principal members  i the rules for qualifying a ship for the african trade  ii the mode of carrying on the trade upon the coast of africa which includes a plan for introducing civilization in that part of the world  iii what is to be observed from the time of shipping negroes to the sale in the west india islands  iv the regulations relative to the state and condition of slaves in the west indies their manumission c   sidenote preamble  whereas it is expedient and comformable to the principles of true religion and morality and to the rules of sound policy to put an end to all traffic in the persons of men and to the detention of their said persons in a state of slavery as soon as the same may be effected without producing great inconveniences in the sudden change of practices of such long standing and during the time of the continuance of the said practices it is desirable and expedient by proper regulations to lessen the inconveniences and evils attendant on the said traffic and state of servitude until both shall be gradually done away  and whereas the objects of the said trade and consequential servitude and the

letter  to  the chairman of the buckinghamshire meeting  held at aylesbury april 13 1780  on the subject of  parliamentary reform     note      the meeting of the freeholders of the county of buckingham     which occasioned the following letter was called for the     purpose of taking into consideration a petition to parliament     for shortening the duration of parliaments and for a more     equal representation of the people in the house of commons   sirhaving heard yesterday by mere accident that there is an intention of laying before the county meeting new matter which is not contained in our petition and the consideration of which had been deferred to a fitter time by a majority of our committee in london permit me to take this method of submitting to you my reasons for thinking with our committee that nothing ought to be hastily deter mined upon the subject  our petition arose naturally from distresses which we felt and the requests which we made were in effect nothing more than that such things should be done in parliament as it was evidently the duty of parliament to do but the affair which will be proposed to you by a person of rank and ability is an alteration in the constitution of parliament itself it is impossible for you to have a subject before you of more importance and that requires a more cool and more mature consideration both on its own account and for the credit of our sobriety of mind who are to resolve upon it  the county will in some way or other be called upon to declare it your opinion that the house of commons is not sufficiently numerous and that the elections are not sufficiently frequentthat an hundred new knights of the shire ought to be added and that we are to have a new election once in three years for certain and as much oftener as the king pleases such will be the state of things if the proposition made shall take effect  all this may be proper but as an honest man i cannot possibly give my rote for it until i have considered it more fully i will not deny that our constitution may have faults and that those faults when found ought to be corrected but on the whole that constitution has been our own pride and an object of admiration to all other nations it is not everything which appears at first view to be faulty in such a complicated plan that is to be determined to be so in reality to enable us to correct the constitution the whole constitution must be viewed together and it must be compared with the actual state of the people and the circumstances of the time for that which taken singly and by itself may appear to be wrong when considered with relation to other things may be perfectly rightor at least such as ought to be patiently endured as the means of preventing something that is worse so far with regard to what at first view may appear a distemper in the constitution as to the remedy of that distemper an equal caution ought to be used because this latter consideration is not single and separate no more than the former there are many things in reformation which would be proper to be done if other things can be done along with them but which if they cannot be so accompanied ought not to be done at all i therefore wish when any new matter of this deep nature is proposed to me to have the whole scheme distinctly in my view and full time to consider of it please god i will walk with caution whenever i am not able clearly to see my way before me  i am now growing old i have from my very early youth been conversant in reading and thinking upon the subject of our laws and constitution as well as upon those of other times and other countries i have been for fifteen years a very laborious member of parliament and in that time have had great opportunities of seeing with my own eyes the working of the machine of our government and remarking where it went smoothly and did its business and where it checked in its movements or where it damaged its work i have also had and used the opportunities of conversing with men of the greatest wisdom and fullest experience in those matters and i do declare to you most solemnly and most truly that on the result of all this reading thinking experience and communication i am not able to come to an immediate resolution in favor of a change of the groundwork of our constitution and in particular that in the present state of the country in the present state of our representation in the present state of our rights and modes of electing in the present state of the several prevalent interests in the present state of the affairs and manners of this country the addition of an hundred knights of the shire and hurrying election on election will be things advantageous to liberty or good government  this is the present condition of my mind and this is my apology for not going as fast as others may choose to go in this business i do not by any means reject the propositions much less do i condemn the gentlemen who with equal good intentions with much better abilities and with infinitely greater personal weight and consideration than mine are of opinion that this matter ought to be decided upon instantly  i most heartily wish that the deliberate sense of the kingdom on this great subject should be known when it is known it must be prevalent it would be dreadful indeed if there was any power in the nation capable of resisting its unanimous desire or even the desire of any very great and decided majority of the people the people may be deceived in their choice of an object but i can scarcely conceive any choice they can make to be so very mischievous as the existence of any human force capable of resisting it it will certainly be the duty of every man in the situation to which god has called him to give his best opinion and advice upon the matter it will not be his duty let him think what he will to use any violent or any fraudulent means of counteracting the general wish or even of employing the legal and constructive organ of expressing the peoples sense against the sense which they do actually entertain  in order that the real sense of the people should be known upon so great an affair as this it is of absolute necessity that timely notice should be giventhat the matter should be prepared in open committees from a choice into which no class or description of men is to be excludedand the subsequent county meetings should be as full and as well attended as possible without these precautions the true sense of the people will ever be uncertain sure i am that no precipitate resolution on a great change in the fundamental constitution of any country can ever be called the real sense of the people  i trust it will not be taken amiss if as an inhabitant and freeholder of this county one indeed among the most inconsiderable i assert my right of dissenting as i do dissent fully and directly from any resolution whatsoever on the subject of an alteration in the representation and election of the kingdom at this time by preserving this light and exercising it with temper and moderation i trust i cannot offend the noble proposer for whom no man professes or feels more respect and regard than i do a want of concurrence in everything which can be proposed will in no sort weaken the energy or distract the efforts of men of upright intentions upon those points in which they are agreed assemblies that are met and with a resolution to be all of a mind are assemblies that can have no opinion at all of their own the first proposer of any measure must be their master i do not know that an amicable variety of sentiment conducted with mutual goodwill has any sort of resemblance to discord or that it can give any advantage whatsoever to the enemies of our common cause on the contrary a forced and fictitious agreement which every universal agreement must be is not becoming the cause of freedom if however any evil should arise from it which i confess i do not foresee i am happy that those who have brought forward new and arduous matter when very great doubts and some diversity of opinion must be foreknown are of authority and weight enough to stand against the consequences  i humbly lay these my sentiments before the county they are not taken up to serve any interests of my own or to be subservient to the interests of any man or set of men under heaven i could wish to be able to attend our meeting or that i had time to reason this matter more fully by letter but i am detained here upon our business what you have already put upon us is as much as we can do if we are prevented from going through it with any effect i fear it will be in part owing not more to the resistance of the enemies of our cause than to our imposing on ourselves such tasks as no human faculties employed as we are can be equal to our worthy members have shown distinguished ability and zeal in support of our petition i am just going down to a bill brought in to frustrate a capital part of your desires the minister is preparing to transfer the cognizance of the public accounts from those whom you and the constitution have chosen to control them to unknown persons creatures of his own for so much he annihilates parliament  i have the honor c  edmund burke  charles street 12th april 1780     fragments of a tract  relative to  the laws against popery  in ireland   note      the condition of the roman catholics in ireland appears to     lave engaged the attention of mr burke at a very early     period of his political life it was probably soon after the     year 1765 that he formed the plan of a work upon that     subject the fragments of which are now given to the public     no title is prefixed to it in the original manuscript and     the plan which it has been thought proper to insert here     was evidently designed merely for the convenience of the     author of the first chapter some unconnected fragments only     too imperfect for publication have been found of the second     there is a considerable portion perhaps nearly the whole     but the copy from which it is printed is evidently a first     rough draught the third chapter as far as it goes is taken     from a fair corrected copy but the end of the second part     of the first head is left unfinished and the discussion of     the second and third heads was either never entered upon or     the manuscript containing it has unfortunately been lost     what follows the third chapter appears to have been designed     for the beginning of the fourth and is evidently the first     rough draught and to this we have added a fragment which     appears to have been a part either of this or the first     chapter      in the volume with which it is intended to close this     posthumous publication of mr burkes works we shall have     occasion to enter into a more particular account of the part     which he took in the discussion of this great political     question at present it may suffice to say that the letter     to mr smith the second letter to sir hercules langrishe     and the letter to his son which here follow in order the     fragment on the popery laws are the only writings upon this     subject found amongst his papers in a state fit to appear in     this stage of the publication what remain are some small     fragments of the tract and a few letters containing no new     matter of importance     tract  on the popery laws   the plan   i propose first to make an introduction in order to show the propriety of a closer inspection into the affairs of ireland and this takes up the first chapter which is to be spent in this introductory matter and in stating the popery laws in general as one leading cause of the imbecility of the country  ch ii states particularly the laws themselves in a plain and popular manner  ch iii begins the remarks upon them under the heads of 1st the objectwhich is a numerous people 2ndly their meansa restraint on property 3rdly their instruments of executioncorrupted morals which affect the national prosperity  ch iv the impolicy of those laws as they affect the national security  ch v reasons by which the laws are supported and answers to them     chapter ii   in order to lay this matter with full satisfaction before the reader i shall collect into one point of view and state as shortly and as clearly as i am able the purport of these laws according to the objects which they affect without making at present any further observation upon them but just what shall be necessary to render the drift and intention of the legislature and the tendency and operation of the laws the more distinct and evident  i shall begin with those which relate to the possession and inheritance of landed property in popish hands the first operation of those acts upon this object was wholly to change the course of descent by the common law to take away the right of primogeniture and in lieu thereof to substitute and establish a new species of statute gavelkind by this law on the death of a papist possessed of an estate in fee simple or in fee tail the land is to be divided by equal portions between all the male children and those portions are likewise to be parcelled out share and share alike amongst the descendants of each son and so to proceed in a similar distribution ad infinitum from this regulation it was proposed that some important consequences should follow first by taking away the right of primogeniture perhaps in the very first generation certainly in the second the families of papists however respectable and their fortunes however considerable would be wholly dissipated and reduced to obscurity and indigence without any possibility that they should repair them by their industry or abilitiesbeing as we shall see anon disabled from every species of permanent acquisition secondly by this law the right of testamentation is taken away which the inferior tenures had always enjoyed and all tenures from the 27th hen viii thirdly the right of settlement was taken away that no such persons should from the moment the act passed be enabled to advance themselves in fortune or connection by marriage being disabled from making any disposition in consideration of such marriage but what the law had previously regulated the reputable establishment of the eldest son as representative of the family or to settle a jointure being commonly the great object in such settlements which was the very power which the law had absolutely taken away  the operation of this law however certain might be too slow the present possessors might happen to be longlived the legislature knew the natural impatience of expectants and upon this principle they gave encouragement to children to anticipate the inheritance for it is provided that the eldest son of any papist shall immediately on his conformity change entirely the nature and properties of his fathers legal estate if he before held in fee simple or in other words had the entire and absolute dominion over the land he is reduced to an estate for his life only with all the consequences of the natural debility of that estate by which he becomes disqualified to sell mortgage charge except for his life or in any wise to do any act by which he may raise money for relief in his most urgent necessities the eldest son so conforming immediately acquires and in the lifetime of his father the permanent part what our law calls the reversion and inheritance of the estate and he discharges it by retrospect and annuls every sort of voluntary settlement made by the father ever so long before his conversion this he may sell or dispose of immediately and alienate it from the family forever  having thus reduced his fathers estate he may also bring his father into the court of chancery where he may compel him to swear to the value of his estate and to allow him out of that possession which had been before reduced to an estate for life such an immediate annual allowance as the lord chancellor or lord keeper shall judge suitable to his ago and quality  this indulgence is not confined to the eldest son the other children likewise by conformity may acquire the same privileges and in the same manner force from their father an immediate and independent maintenance it is very well worth remarking that the statutes have avoided to fix any determinate age for these emancipating conversions so that the children at any age however incapable of choice in other respects however immature or even infantile are yet considered sufficiently capable to disinherit their parents and totally to subtract themselves from their direction and control either at their own option or by the instigation of others by this law the tenure and value of a roman catholic in his real property is not only rendered extremely limited and altogether precarious but the paternal power is in all such families so enervated that it may well be considered as entirely taken away even the principle upon which it is founded seems to be directly reversed however the legislature feared that enough was not yet done upon this head the roman catholic parent by selling his real estate might in some sort preserve the dominion over his substance and his family and thereby evade the operation of these laws which intended to take away both besides frequent revolutions and many conversions had so broken the landed property of papists in that kingdom that it was apprehended that this law could have in a short time but a few objects upon which it would be capable of operating  to obviate these inconveniences another law was made by which the dominion of children over their parents was extended universally throughout the whole popish part of the nation and every child of every popish parent was encouraged to come into what is called a court of equity to prefer a bill against his father and compel him to confess upon oath the quantity and value of his substance personal as well as real of what nature soever or howsoever it might be employed upon which discovery the court is empowered to seize upon and allocate for the immediate maintenance of such child or children any sum not exceeding a third of the whole fortune and as to their future establishment on the death of the father no limits are assigned the chancery may if it thinks fit take the whole property personal as well as real money stock in trade c out of the power of the possessor and secure it in any manner they judge expedient for that purpose for the act has not assigned any sort of limit with regard to the quantity which is to be charged or given any direction concerning the means of charging and securing it a law which supersedes all observation  but the law is still more extensive in its provision because there was a possibility that the parent though sworn might by false representations evade the discovery of the ultimate value of his estate a new bill may be at any time brought by one any or all of the children for a further discovery his effects are to undergo a fresh scrutiny and a now distribution is to be made in consequence of it so that the parent has no security against perpetual inquietude and the reiteration of chancery suits but by what is somewhat difficult for human nature to comply with fully and without reserve abandoning his whole property to the discretion of the court to be disposed of in favor of such children  but is this enough and has the parent purchased his repose by such a surrender very far from it the law expressly and very carefully provides that he shall not before he can be secure from the persecution of his children it requires another and a much more extraordinary condition the children are authorized if they can find that their parent has by his industry or otherwise increased the value of his property since their first bill to bring another compelling a new account of the value of his estate in order to a new distribution proportioned to the value of the estate at the time of the new bill preferred they may bring such bills toties quoties upon every improvement of his fortune without any sort of limitation of time or regard to the frequency of such bills or to the quantity of the increase of the estate which shall justify the bringing them this act expressly provides that he shall have no respite from the persecution of his children but by totally abandoning all thoughts of improvement and acquisition  this is going a great way surely but the laws in question have gone much further not satisfied with calling upon children to revolt against their parents and to possess themselves of their substance there are cases where the withdrawing of the child from his fathers obedience is not left to the option of the child himself for if the wife of a roman catholic should choose to change her religion from that moment she deprives her husband of all management and direction of his children and even of all the tender satisfaction which a parent can feel in their society and which is the only indemnification he can have for all his cares and sorrows and they are to be torn forever at the earliest age from his house and family for the lord chancellor is not only authorized but he is strongly required to take away all his children from such popish parent to appoint where in what manner and by whom they are to be educated and the father is compelled to pay not for the ransom but for the deprivation of his children and to furnish such a sum as the chancellor thinks proper to appoint for their education to the age of eighteen years the case is the same if the husband should be the conformist though how the law is to operate in this case i do not see for the act expressly says that the child shall be taken from such popish parent and whilst such husband and wife cohabit it will be impossible to put it into execution without taking the child from one as well as from the other and then the effect of the law will be that if either husband or wife becomes protestant both are to be deprived of their children  the paternal power thus being wholly abrogated it is evident that by the last regulation the power of an husband over his wife is also considerably impaired because if it be in her power whenever she pleases to subtract the children from his protection and obedience she herself by that hold inevitably acquires a power and superiority over her husband  but she is not left dependent upon this oblique influence for if in any marriage settlement the husband has reserved to him a power of making a jointure and he dies without settling any her conformity executes his powers and executes them in as large extent as the chancellor thinks fit the husband is deprived of that coercive power over his wife which he had in his hands by the use he might make of the discretionary power reserved in the settlement  but if no such power had been reserved and no such settlement existed yet if the husband dies leaving his conforming wife without a filed provision by some settlement on his real estate his wife may apply to chancery where she shall be allotted a portion from his leases and other personal estate not exceeding one third of his whole clear substance the laws in this instance as well as in the former have presumed that the husband has omitted to make all the provision which he might have done for no other reason than that of her religion if therefore she chooses to balance any domestic misdemeanors to her husband by the public merit of conformity to the protestant religion the law will suffer no plea of such misdemeanors to be urged on the husbands part nor proof of that kind to be entered into she acquires a provision totally independent of his favor and deprives him of that source of domestic authority which the common law had left to him that of rewarding or punishing by a voluntary distribution of his effects what in his opinion was the good or ill behavior of his wife  thus the laws stand with regard to the property already acquired to its mode of descent and to family powers now as to the new acquisition of real property and both to the acquisition and security of personal the law stands thus  all persons of that persuasion are disabled from taking or purchasing directly or by a trust any lands any mortgage upon land any rents or profits from land any lease interest or term of any land any annuity for life or lives or years or any estate whatsoever chargeable upon or which may in any manner affect any lands  one exception and one only is admitted by the statutes to the universality of this exclusion viz a lease for a term not exceeding thirtyone years but even this privilege is charged with a prior qualification this remnant of a right is doubly curtailed 1st that on such a short lease a rent not less than two thirds of the full improved yearly value at the time of the making it shall be reserved during the whole continuance of the term and 2ndly it does not extend to the whole kingdom this lease must also be in possession and not in reversion if any lease is made exceeding either in duration or value and in the smallest degree the above limits the whole interest is forfeited and vested ipso facto in the first protestant discoverer or informer this discoverer thus invested with the property is enabled to sue for it as his own right the courts of law are not alone open to him he may and this is the usual method enter into either of the courts of equity and call upon the parties and those whom he suspects to be their trustees upon oath and under the penalties of perjury to discover against themselves the exact nature and value of their estates in every particular in order to induce their forfeiture on the discovery in such suits the informer is not liable to those delays which the ordinary procedure of those courts throws into the way of the justest claimant nor has the papist the indulgence which he it allows to the most fraudulent defendant that of plea and demurrer but the defendant is obliged to answer the whole directly upon oath the rule of favores ampliandi c is reversed by this act lest any favor should be shown or the force and operation of the law in any part of its progress be enervated all issues to be tried on this act are to be tried by none but known protestants  it is here necessary to state as a part of this law what has been for some time generally understood as a certain consequence of it the act had expressly provided that a papist could possess no sort of estate which might affect land except as before excepted on this a difficulty did not unnaturally arise it is generally known a judgment being obtained or acknowledged for any debt since the statute of westm 2 13 ed i c 18 one half of the debtors land is to be delivered unto the creditor until the obligation is satisfied under a writ called elegit and this writ has been ever since the ordinary assurance of the land and the great foundation of general credit in the nation although the species of holding under this writ is not specified in the statute the received opinion though not juridically delivered has been that if they attempt to avail themselves of that security because it may create an estate however precarious in land their whole debt or charge is forfeited and becomes the property of the protestant informer thus you observe first that by the express words of the law all possibility of acquiring any species of valuable property in any sort connected with land is taken away and secondly by the construction all security for money is also cut off no security is left except what is merely personal and which therefore most people who lend money would i believe consider as none at all  under this head of the acquisition of property the law meets them in every road of industry and in its direct and consequential provisions throws almost all sorts of obstacles in their way for they are not only excluded from all offices in church and state which though a just and necessary provision is yet no small restraint in the acquisition but they are interdicted from the army and the law in all its branches this point is carried to so scrupulous a severity that chamber practice and even private conveyancing the most voluntary agency are prohibited to them under the severest penalties and the most rigid modes of inquisition they have gone beyond even this for every barrister six clerk attorney or solicitor is obliged to take a solemn oath not to employ persons of that persuasionno not as hackney clerks at the miserable salary of seven shillings a week no tradesman of that persuasion is capable by any service or settlement to obtain his freedom in any town corporate so that they trade and work in their own native towns as aliens paying as such quarterage and other charges and impositions they are expressly forbidden in whatever employment to take more than two apprentices except in the linen manufacture only                                       in every state next to the care of the life and properties of the subject the education of their youth has been a subject of attention in the irish laws this point has not been neglected those who are acquainted with the constitution of our universities need not be informed that none but those who conform to the established church can be at all admitted to study there and that none can obtain degrees in them who do not previously take all the tests oaths and declarations lest they should be enabled to supply this defect by private academies and schools of their own the law has armed itself with all its terrors against such a practice popish schoolmasters of every species are proscribed by those acts and it is made felony to teach even in a private family so that papists are entirely excluded from an education in any of our authorized establishments for learning at home in order to shut up every avenue to instruction the act of king william in ireland has added to this restraint by precluding them from all foreign education  this act is worthy of attention on account of the singularity of some of its provisions being sent for education to any popish school or college abroad upon conviction incurs if the party sent has any estate of inheritance a kind of unalterable and perpetual outlawry the tender and incapable age of such a person his natural subjection to the will of others his necessary unavoidable ignorance of the laws stands for nothing in his favor he is disabled to sue in law or equity to be guardian executor or administrator he is rendered incapable of any legacy or deed of gift he forfeits all his goods and chattels forever and he forfeits for his life all his lands hereditaments offices and estate of freehold and all trusts powers or interests therein all persons concerned in sending them or maintaining them abroad by the least assistance of money or otherwise are involved in the same disabilities and subjected to the same penalties  the mode of conviction is as extraordinary as the penal sanctions of this act a justice of peace upon information that any child is sent away may require to be brought before him all persons charged or even suspected of sending or assisting and examine them and other persons on oath concerning the fact if on this examination he finds it probable that the party was sent contrary to this act he is then to bind over the parties and witnesses in any sum he thinks fit but not less than two hundred pounds to appear and take their trial at the next quarter sessions here the justices are to reexamine evidence until they arrive as before to what shall appear to them a probability for the rest they resort to the accused if they can prove that any person or any money or any bill of exchange has been sent abroad by the party accused they throw the proof upon him to show for what innocent purposes it was sent and on failure of such proof he is subjected to all the abovementioned penalties half the forfeiture is given to the crown the other half goes to the informer  it ought here to be remarked that this mode of conviction not only concludes the party has failed in his expurgatory proof but it is sufficient also to subject to the penalties and incapacities of the law the infant upon whose account the person has been so convicted it must be confessed that the law has not left him without some species of remedy in this case apparently of much hardship where one man is convicted upon evidence given against another if he has the good fortune to live for within a twelvemonth after his return or his age of twentyone he has a right to call for a new trial in which he also is to undertake the negative proof and to show by sufficient evidence that he has not been sent abroad against the intention of the act if he succeeds in this difficult exculpation and demonstrates his innocence to the satisfaction of the court he forfeits all his goods and chattels and all the profits of his lands incurred and received before such acquittal but he is freed from all other forfeitures and from all subsequent incapacities there is also another method allowed by the law in favor of persons under such unfortunate circumstances as in the former case for their innocence in this upon account of their expiation if within six months after their return with the punctilious observation of many ceremonies they conform to the established church and take all the oaths and subscriptions the legislature in consideration of the incapable age in which they were sent abroad of the merit of their early conformity and to encourage conversions only confiscates as in the former case the whole personal estate and the profits of the real in all other respects restoring and rehabilitating the party                                       so far as to property and education there remain some other heads upon which the acts have changed the course of the common law and first with regard to the right of selfdefence which consists in the use of arms this though one of the rights by the law of nature yet is so capable of abuses that it may not be unwise to make some regulations concerning them and many wise nations have thought proper to set several restrictions on this right especially temporary ones with regard to suspected persons and on occasion of some imminent danger to the public from foreign invasion or domestic commotions  but provisions in time of trouble proper and perhaps necessary may become in time of profound peace a scheme of tyranny the method which the statute law of ireland has taken upon this delicate article is to get rid of all difficulties at once by an universal prohibition to all persons at all times and under all circumstances who are not protestants of using or keeping any kind of weapons whatsoever in order to enforce this regulation the whole spirit of the common law is changed very severe penalties are enjoined the largest powers are vested in the lowest magistrates any two justices of peace or magistrates of a town with or without information at their pleasure by themselves or their warrant are empowered to enter and search the house of any papist or even of any other person whom they suspect to keep such arms in trust for them the only limitation to the extent of this power is that the search is to be made between the rising and setting of the sun but even this qualification extends no further than to the execution of the act in the open country for in all cities and their suburbs in towns corporate and markettowns they may at their discretion and without information break open houses and institute such search at any hour of the day or night this i say they may do at their discretion and it seems a pretty ample power in the hands of such magistrates however the matter does by no means totally rest on their discretion besides the discretionary and occasional search the statute has prescribed one that is general and periodical it is to be made annually by the warrant of the justices at their midsummer quarter sessions by the high and petty constables or any others whom they may authorize and by all corporate magistrates in all houses of papists and every other where they suspect arms for the use of such persons to be concealed with the same powers in all respects which attend the occasional search the whole of this regulation concerning both the general and particular search seems to have been made by a legislature which was not at all extravagantly jealous of personal liberty not trusting however to the activity of the magistrate acting officially the law has invited all voluntary informers by considerable rewards and even pressed involuntary informers into this service by the dread of heavy penalties with regard to the latter method two justices of peace or the magistrate of any corporation are empowered to summon before them any persons whatsoever to tender them an oath by which they oblige them to discover all persons who have any arms concealed contrary to law their refusal or declining to appear or appearing their refusal to inform subjects them to the severest penalties if peers or peeresses are summoned for they may be summoned by the bailiff of a corporation of six cottages to perform this honorable service and refuse to inform the first offence is three hundred pounds penalty the second is præmunirethat is to say imprisonment for life and forfeiture of all their goods persons of an inferior order are for the first offence fined thirty pounds for the second they too are subjected to præmunire so far as to involuntarynow as to voluntary informers the law entitles them to half the penalty incurred by carrying or keeping arms for on conviction of this offence the penalty upon persons of whatever substance is the sum of fifty pounds and a years imprisonment which cannot be remitted even by the crown  the only exception to this law is a license from the lord lieutenant and council to carry arms which by its nature is extremely limited and i do not suppose that there are six persons now in the kingdom who have been fortunate enough to obtain it                                       there remains after this system concerning property and defence to say something concerning the exercise of religion winch is carried on in all persuasions but especially in the romish by persons appointed for that purpose the law of king william and queen anne ordered all popish parsons exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction all orders of monks and friars and all priests not then actually in parishes and to be registered to be banished the kingdom and if they should return from exile to be hanged drawn and quartered twenty pounds reward is given for apprehending them penalty on harboring and concealing  as all the priests then in being and registered are long since dead and as these laws are made perpetual every popish priest is liable to the law                                       the reader has now before him a tolerably complete view of the popery laws relative to property by descent or acquisition to education to defence and to the free exercise of religion which may be necessary to enable him to form some judgment of the spirit of the whole system and of the subsequent reflections that are to be made upon it     chapter iii  part i   the system which we have just reviewed and the manner in which religious influence on the public is made to operate upon the laws concerning property in ireland is in its nature very singular and differs i apprehend essentially and perhaps to its disadvantage from any scheme of religious persecution now existing in any other country in europe or which has prevailed in any time or nation with which history has made us acquainted i believe it will not be difficult to show that it is unjust impolitic and inefficacious that it has the most unhappy influence on the prosperity the morals and the safety of that country that this influence is not accidental but has flowed as the necessary and direct consequence of the laws themselves first on account of the object which they affect and next by the quality of the greatest part of the instruments they employ upon all these points first upon the general and then on the particular this question will be considered with as much order as can be followed in a matter of itself as involved and intricate as it is important                                       the first and most capital consideration with regard to this as to every object is the extent of it and here it is necessary to premise this system of penalty and incapacity has for its object no small sect or obscure party but a very numerous body of mena body which comprehends at least two thirds of that whole nation it amounts to 2800000 souls a number sufficient for the materials constituent of a great people now it is well worthy of a serious and dispassionate examination whether such a system respecting such an object be in reality agreeable to any sound principles of legislation or any authorized definition of law for if our reasons or practices differ from the general informed sense of mankind it is very moderate to say that they are at least suspicious  this consideration of the magnitude of the object ought to attend us through the whole inquiry if it does not always affect the reason it is always decisive on the importance of the question it not only makes in itself a more leading point but complicates itself with every other part of the matter giving every error minute in itself a character and significance from its application it is therefore not to be wondered at if we perpetually recur to it in the course of this essay  in the making of a new law it is undoubtedly the duty of the legislator to see that no injustice be done even to an individual for there is then nothing to be unsettled and the matter is under his hands to mould it as he pleases and if he finds it untractable in the working he may abandon it without incurring any new inconvenience but in the question concerning the repeal of an old one the work is of more difficulty because laws like houses lean on one another and the operation is delicate and should be necessary the objection in such a case ought not to arise from the natural infirmity of human institutions but from substantial faults which contradict the nature and end of law itselffaults not arising from the imperfection but from the misapplication and abuse of our reason as no legislators can regard the minima of equity a law may in some instances be a just subject of censure without being at all an object of repeal but if its transgressions against common right and the ends of just government should be considerable in their nature and spreading in their effects as this objection goes to the root and principle of the law it renders it void in its obligatory quality on the mind and therefore determines it as the proper object of abrogation and repeal so far as regards its civil existence the objection here is as we observed by no means on account of the imperfection of the law it is on account of its erroneous principle for if this be fundamentally wrong the more perfect the law is made the worse it becomes it cannot be said to have the properties of genuine law even in its imperfections and defects the true weakness and opprobrium of our best general constitutions is that they cannot provide beneficially for every particular case and thus fill adequately to their intentions the circle of universal justice but where the principle is faulty the erroneous part of the law is the beneficial and justice only finds refuge in those holes and corners which had escaped the sagacity and inquisition of the legislator the happiness or misery of multitudes can never be a thing indifferent a law against the majority of the people is in substance a law against the people itself its extent determines its invalidity it even changes its character as it enlarges its operation it is not particular injustice but general oppression and can no longer be considered as a private hardship which might be borne but spreads and grows up into the unfortunate importance of a national calamity  now as a law directed against the mass of the nation has not the nature of a reasonable institution so neither has it the authority for in all forms of government the people is the true legislator and whether the immediate and instrumental cause of the law be a single person or many the remote and efficient cause is the consent of the people either actual or implied and such consent is absolutely essential to its validity to the solid establishment of every law two things are essentially requisite first a proper and sufficient human power to declare and modify the matter of the law and next such a fit and equitable constitution as they have a right to declare and render binding with regard to the first requisite the human authority it is their judgment they give up not their right the people indeed are presumed to consent to whatever the legislature ordains for their benefit and they are to acquiesce in it though they do not clearly see into the propriety of the means by which they are conducted to that desirable end this they owe as an act of homage and just deference to a reason which the necessity of government has made superior to their own but though the means and indeed the nature of a public advantage may not always be evident to the understanding of the subject no one is so gross and stupid as not to distinguish between a benefit and an injury no one can imagine then an exclusion of a great body of men not from favors privileges and trusts but from the common advantages of society can ever be a thing intended for their good or can ever be ratified by any implied consent of theirs if therefore at least an implied human consent is necessary to the existence of a law such a constitution cannot in propriety be a law at all  but if we could suppose that such a ratification was made not virtually but actually by the people not representatively but even collectively still it would be null and void they have no right to make a law prejudicial to the whole community even though the delinquents in making such an act should be themselves the chief sufferers by it because it would bemade against the principle of a superior law which it is not in the power of any community or of the whole race of man to alteri mean the will of him who gave us our nature and in giving impressed an invariable law upon it it would be hard to point out any error more truly subversive of all the order and beauty of all the peace and happiness of human society than the position that any body of men have a right to make what laws they pleaseor that laws can derive any authority from their institution merely and independent of the quality of the subjectmatter no arguments of policy reason of state or preservation of the constitution can be pleaded in favor of such a practice they may indeed impeach the frame of that constitution but can never touch this immovable principle this seems to be indeed the doctrine which hobbes broached in the last century and which was then so frequently and so ably refuted cicero exclaims with the utmost indignation and contempt against such a notion22 he considers it not only as unworthy of a philosopher but of an illiterate peasant that of all things this was the most truly absurd to fancy that the rule of justice was to be taken from the constitutions of commonwealths or that laws derived their authority from the statutes of the people the edicts of princes or the decrees of judges if it be admitted that it is not the blackletter and the kings arms that makes the law we are to look for it elsewhere  in reality there are two and only two foundations of law and they are both of them conditions without which nothing can give it any force i mean equity and utility with respect to the former it grows out of the great rule of equality which is grounded upon our common nature and which philo with propriety and beauty calls the mother of justice all human laws are properly speaking only declaratory they may alter the mode and application but have no power over the substance of original justice the other foundation of law which is utility must be understood not of partial or limited but of general and public utility connected in the same manner with and derived directly from our rational nature for any other utility may be the utility of a robber but cannot be that of a citizenthe interest of the domestic enemy and not that of a member of the commonwealth this present equality can never be the foundation of statutes which create an artificial difference between men as the laws before us do in order to induce a consequential inequality in the distribution of justice law is a mode of human action respecting society and must be governed by the same rules of equity which govern every private action and so tully considers it in his offices as the only utility agreeable to that nature unum debet esse omnibus propositum ut eadem sit utilitas uniuscujusque et universorum quam si ad se quisque rapiat dissolvetur omnis humana consortio  if any proposition can be clear in itself it is this that a law which shuts out from all secure and valuable property the bulk of the people cannot be made for the utility of the party so excluded this therefore is not the utility which tully mentions but if it were true as it is not that the real interest of any part of the community could be separated from the happiness of the rest still it would afford no just foundation for a statute providing exclusively for that interest at the expense of the other because it would be repugnant to the essence of law which requires that it be made as much as possible for the benefit of the whole if this principle be denied or evaded what ground have we left to reason on we must at once make a total change in all our ideas and look for a new definition of law where to find it i confess myself at a loss if we resort to the fountains of jurisprudence they will not supply us with any that is for our purpose jus says paulus pluribus modis dicitur uno modo cum id quod semper æquum et bonum est jus dicitur ut est jus naturalethis sense of the word will not be thought i imagine very applicable to our penal lawsaltero modo quod omnibus aut pluribus in unaquaque civitate utile est ut est jus civile perhaps this latter will be as insufficient and would rather seem a censure and condemnation of the popery acts than a definition that includes them and there is no other to be found in the whole digest neither are there any modern writers whose ideas of law are at all narrower  it would be far more easy to heap up authorities on this article than to excuse the prolixity and tediousness of producing any at all in proof of a point which though too often practically denied is in its theory almost selfevident for suarez handling this very question utrum de ratione et substantia legis esse ut propter commune bonum feratur does not hesitate a moment finding no ground in reason or authority to render the affirmative in the least degree disputable in quæstione ergo proposita says he nulla est inter authores controversia sed omnium commune est axioma de substantia et ratione legis esse ut pro communi bono feratur ita ut propter illud præcipue tradatur having observed in another place contra omnem rectitudinem est bonum commune ad privatum ordinare seu totum ad partem propter ipsum referre partiality and law are contradictory terms neither the merits nor the ill deserts neither the wealth and importance nor the indigence and obscurity of the one part or of the other can make any alteration in this fundamental truth on any other scheme i defy any man living to settle a correct standard which may discriminate between equitable rule and the most direct tyranny for if we can once prevail upon ourselves to depart from the strictness and integrity of this principle in favor even of a considerable party the argument will hold for one that is less so and thus we shall go on narrowing the bottom of public right until step by step we arrive though after no very long or very forced deduction at what one of our poets calls the enormous faiththe faith of the many created for the advantage of a single person i cannot see a glimmering of distinction to evade it nor is it possible to allege any reason for the proscription of so large a part of the kingdom which would not hold equally to support under parallel circumstances the proscription of the whole  i am sensible that these principles in their abstract light will not be very strenuously opposed reason is never inconvenient but when it comes to be applied mere general truths interfere very little with the passions they can until they are roused by a troublesome application rest in great tranquillity side by side with tempers and proceedings the most directly opposite to them men want to be reminded who do not want to be taught because those original ideas of rectitude to which the mind is compelled to assent when they are proposed are not always as present to it as they ought to be when people are gone if not into a denial at least into a sort of oblivion of those ideas when they know them only as barren speculations and not as practical motives for conduct it will be proper to press as well as to offer them to the understanding and when one is attacked by prejudices which aim to intrude themselves into the place of law what is left for us but to vouch and call to warranty those principles of original justice from whence alone our title to everything valuable in society is derived can it be thought to arise from a superfluous vain parade of displaying general and uncontroverted maxims that we should revert at this time to the first principles of law when we have directly under our consideration a whole body of statutes which i say are so many contradictions which their advocates allow to be so many exceptions from those very principles take them in the most favorable light every exception from the original and fixed rule of equality and justice ought surely to be very well authorized in the reason of their deviation and very rare in their use for if they should grow to be frequent in what would they differ from an abrogation of the rule itself by becoming thus frequent they might even go further and establishing themselves into a principle convert the rule into the exception it cannot be dissembled that this is not at all remote from the case before us where the great body of the people are excluded from all valuable propertywhere the greatest and most ordinary benefits of society are conferred as privileges and not enjoyed on the footing of common rights  the clandestine manner in which those in power carry on such designs is a sufficient argument of the sense they inwardly entertain of the true nature of their proceedings seldom is the title or preamble of the law of the same import with the body and enacting part but they generally place some other color uppermost which differs from that which is afterwards to appear or at least one that is several shades fainter thus the penal laws in question are not called laws to oblige men baptized and educated in popery to renounce their religion or their property but are called laws to prevent the growth of popery as if their purpose was only to prevent conversions to that sect and not to persecute a million of people already engaged in it but of all the instances of this sort of legislative artifice and of the principles that produced it i never met with any which made a stronger impression on me than that of louis the fourteenth in the revocation of the edict of nantes that monarch had when he made that revocation as few measures to keep with public opinion as any man in the exercise of the most unresisted authority at home in a career of uninterrupted victory abroad and in a course of flattery equal to the circumstances of his greatness in both these particulars he might be supposed to have as little need as disposition to render any sort of account to the world of his procedure towards his subjects but the persecution of so vast a body of men as the huguenots was too strong a measure even for the law of pride and power it was too glaring a contradiction even to those principles upon which persecution itself is supported shocked at the naked attempt he had recourse for a palliation of his conduct to an unkingly denial of the fact which made against him in the preamble therefore to his act of revocation he sets forth that the edict of nantes was no longer necessary as the object of it the protestants of his kingdom were then reduced to a very small number the refugees in holland cried out against this misrepresentation they asserted i believe with truth that this revocation had driven two hundred thousand of them out of their country and that they could readily demonstrate there still remained six hundred thousand protestants in france if this were the fact as it was undoubtedly no argument of policy could have been strong enough to excuse a measure by which eight hundred thousand men were despoiled at one stroke of so many of their rights and privileges louis the fourteenth confessed by this sort of apology that if the number had been large the revocation had been unjust but after all is it not most evident that this act of injustice which let loose on that monarch such a torrent of invective and reproach and which threw so dark a cloud over all the splendor of a most illustrious reign falls far short of the case in ireland the privileges which the protestants of that kingdom enjoyed antecedent to this revocation were far greater than the roman catholics of ireland ever aspired to under a contrary establishment the number of their sufferers if considered absolutely is not half of ours if considered relatively to the body of each community it is not perhaps a twentieth part and then the penalties and incapacities which grew from that revocation are not so grievous in their nature nor so certain in their execution nor so ruinous by a great deal to the civil prosperity of the state as those which we have established for a perpetual law in our unhappy country it cannot be thought to arise from affectation that i call it so what other name can be given to a country which contains so many hundred thousands of human creatures reduced to a state of the most abject servitude  in putting this parallel i take it for granted that we can stand for this short time very clear of our party distinctions if it were enough by the use of an odious and unpopular word to determine the question it would be no longer a subject of rational disquisition since that very prejudice which gives these odious names and which is the party charged for doing so and for the consequences of it would then become the judge also but i flatter myself that not a few will be found who do not think that the names of protestant and papist can make any change in the nature of essential justice such men will not allow that to be proper treatment to the one of these denominations which would be cruelty to the other and which converts its very crime into the instrument of its defence they will hardly persuade themselves that what was bad policy in france can be good in ireland or that what was intolerable injustice in an arbitrary monarch becomes only by being more extended and more violent an equitable procedure in a country professing to be governed by law it is however impossible not to observe with some concern that there are many also of a different dispositiona number of persons whose minds are so formed that they find the communion of religion to be a close and an endearing tie and their country to be no bond at allto whom common altars are a better relation than common habitations and a common civil interestwhose hearts are touched with the distresses of foreigners and are abundantly awake to all the tenderness of human feeling on such an occasion even at the moment that they are inflicting the very same distresses or worse on their fellowcitizens without the least sting of compassion or remorse to commiserate the distresses of all men suffering innocently perhaps meritoriously is generous and very agreeable to the better part of our naturea disposition that ought by all means to be cherished but to transfer humanity from its natural basis our legitimate and homebred connectionsto lose all feeling for those who have grown up by our sides in our eyes the benefit of whose cares and labors we have partaken from our birth and meretriciously to hunt abroad after foreign affections is such a disarrangement of the whole system of our duties that i do not know whether benevolence so displaced is not almost the same thing as destroyed or what effect bigotry could have produced that is more fatal to society this no one could help observing who has seen our doors kindly and bountifully thrown open to foreign sufferers for conscience whilst through the same ports were issuing fugitives of our own driven from their country for a cause which to an indifferent person would seem to be exactly similar whilst we stood by without any sense of the impropriety of this extraordinary scene accusing and practising injustice for my part there is no circumstance in all the contradictions of our most mysterious nature that appears to be more humiliating than the use we are disposed to make of those sad examples which seem purposely marked for our correction and improvement every instance of fury and bigotry in other men one should think would naturally fill us with an horror of that disposition the effect however is directly contrary we are inspired it is true with a very sufficient hatred for the party but with no detestation at all of the proceeding nay we are apt to urge our dislike of such measures as a reason for imitating themand by an almost incredible absurdity because some powers have destroyed their country by their persecuting spirit to argue that we ought to retaliate on them by destroying our own such are the effects and such i fear has been the intention of those numberless books which are daily printed and industriously spread of the persecutions in other countries and other religious persuasionsthese observations which are a digression but hardly i think can be considered as a departure from the subject have detained us some time we will now come more directly to our purpose  it has been shown i hope with sufficient evidence that a constitution against the interest of the many is rather of the nature of a grievance than of a law that of all grievances it is the most weighty and important that it is made without due authority against all the acknowledged principles of jurisprudence against the opinions of all the great lights in that science and that such is the tacit sense even of those who act in the most contrary manner these points are indeed so evident that i apprehend the abettors of the penal system will ground their defence on an admission and not on a denial of them they will lay it down as a principle that the protestant religion is a thing beneficial for the whole community as well in its civil interests as in those of a superior order from thence they will argue that the end being essentially beneficial the means become instrumentally so that these penalties and incapacities are not final causes of the law but only a discipline to bring over a deluded people to their real interest and therefore though they may be harsh in their operation they will be pleasant in their effects and be they what they will they cannot be considered as a very extraordinary hardship as it is in the power of the sufferer to free himself when he pleases and that only by converting to a better religion which it is his duty to embrace even though it were attended with all those penalties from whence in reality it delivers him if he suffers it is his own fault volenti non fit injuria  i shall be very short without being i think the less satisfactory in my answer to these topics because they never can be urged from a conviction of their validity and are indeed only the usual and impotent struggles of those who are unwilling to abandon a practice which they are unable to defend first then i observe that if the principle of their final and beneficial intention be admitted as a just ground for such proceedings there never was in the blamable sense of the word nor ever can be such a thing as a religious persecution in the world such an intention is pretended by all menwho all not only insist that their religion has the sanction of heaven but is likewise and for that reason the best and most convenient to human society all religious persecution mr bayle well observes is grounded upon a miserable petitio principii you are wrong i am right you must come over to me or you must suffer let me add that the great inlet by which a color for oppression has entered into the world is by one mans pretending to determine concerning the happiness of another and by claiming a right to use what means he thinks proper in order to bring him to a sense of it it is the ordinary and trite sophism of oppression but there is not yet such a convenient ductility in the human understanding as to make us capable of being persuaded that men can possibly mean the ultimate good of the whole society by rendering miserable for a century together the greater part of itor that any one has such a reversionary benevolence as seriously to intend the remote good of a late posterity who can give up the present enjoyment which every honest man must have in the happiness of his contemporaries everybody is satisfied that a conservation and secure enjoyment of our natural rights is the great and ultimate purpose of civil society and that therefore all forms whatsoever of government are only good as they are subservient to that purpose to which they are entirely subordinate now to aim at the establishment of any form of government by sacrificing what is the substance of it to take away or at least to suspend the rights of nature in order to an approved system for the protection of them and for the sake of that about which men must dispute forever to postpone those things about which they have no controversy at all and this not in minute and subordinate but large and principal objects is a procedure as preposterous and absurd in argument as it is oppressive and cruel in its effect for the protestant religion nor i speak it with reverence i am sure the truth of our common christianity is not so clear as this propositionthat all men at least the majority of men in the society ought to enjoy the common advantages of it you fall therefore into a double error first you incur a certain mischief for an advantage which is comparatively problematical even though you were sure of obtaining it secondly whatever the proposed advantage may be were it of a certain nature the attainment of it is by no means certain and such deep gaming for stakes so valuable ought not to be admitted the risk is of too much consequence to society if no other country furnished examples of this risk yet our laws and our country are enough fully to demonstrate the fact ireland after almost a century of persecution is at this hour full of penalties and full of papists this is a point which would lead us a great way but it is only just touched here having much to say upon it in its proper place so that you have incurred a certain and an immediate inconvenience for a remote and for a doubly uncertain benefitthus far as to the argument which would sanctify the injustice of these laws by the benefits which are proposed to arise from them and as to that liberty which by a new political chemistry was to be extracted out of a system of oppression  now as to the other point that the objects of these laws suffer voluntarily this seems to me to be an insult rather than an argument for besides that it totally annihilates every characteristic and therefore every faulty idea of persecution just as the former does it supposes what is false in fact that it is in a mans moral power to change his religion whenever his convenience requires it if he be beforehand satisfied that your opinion is better than his he will voluntarily come over to you and without compulsion and then your law would be unnecessary but if he is not so convinced he must know that it is his duty in this point to sacrifice his interest here to his opinion of his eternal happiness else he could have in reality no religion at all in the former case therefore as your law would be unnecessary in the latter it would be persecuting that is it would put your penalty and his ideas of duty in the opposite scales which is or i know not what is the precise idea of persecution if then you require a renunciation of his conscience as a preliminary to his admission to the rights of society you annex morally speaking an impossible condition to it in this case in the language of reason and jurisprudence the condition would be void and the gift absolute as the practice runs it is to establish the condition and to withhold the benefit the suffering is then not voluntary and i never heard any other argument drawn from the nature of laws and the good of human society urged in favor of those proscriptive statutes except those which have just been mentioned  footnotes  22 cicero de legibus lib l 1415 et 16o rem dignam in qua non modo docti verum etiam agrestes erubescant jam vero illud stultissimum existimare omnia justa esse quæ scita sint in populorum institutis aut legibus etc quod si populorum jussis si principum decretis si sententiis judicum jura constituerentur jus esset latrocinari jus adulterare jus testamenta falsa supponere si hæc suffragiis aut scitis multitudinis probarentur     chapter iii  part ii   the second head upon which i propose to consider those statutes with regard to their object and which is the next in importance to the magnitude and of almost equal concern in the inquiry into the justice of these laws is its possession it is proper to recollect that this religion which is so persecuted in its members is the old religion of the country and the once established religion of the statethe very same which had for centuries received the countenance and sanction of the laws and from which it would at one time have been highly penal to have dissented in proportion as mankind has become enlightened the idea of religious persecution under any circumstances has been almost universally exploded by all good and thinking men the only faint shadow of difficulty which remains is concerning the introduction of new opinions experience has shown that if it has been favorable to the cause of truth it has not been always conducive to the peace of society though a new religious sect should even be totally free in itself from any tumultuous and disorderly zeal which however is rarely the case it has a tendency to create a resistance from the establishment in possession productive of great disorders and thus becomes innocently indeed but yet very certainly the cause of the bitterest dissensions in the commonwealth to a mind not thoroughly saturated with the tolerating maxims of the gospel a preventive persecution on such principles might come recommended by strong and apparently no immoral motives of policy whilst yet the contagion was recent and had laid hold but on a few persons the truth is these politics are rotten and hollow at bottom as all that are founded upon any however minute a degree of positive injustice must ever be but they are specious and sufficiently so to delude a man of sense and of integrity but it is quite otherwise with the attempt to eradicate by violence a widespreading and established religious opinion if the people are in an error to inform them is not only fair but charitable to drive them is a strain of the most manifest injustice if not the right the presumption at least is ever on the side of possession are they mistaken if it does not fully justify them it is a great alleviation of guilt which may be mingled with their misfortune that the error is none of their forgingthat they received it on as good a footing as they can receive your laws and your legislative authority because it was handed down to them from their ancestors the opinion may be erroneous but the principle is undoubtedly right and you punish them for acting upon a principle which of all others is perhaps the most necessary for preserving society an implicit admiration and adherence to the establishments of their forefathers  if indeed the legislative authority was on all hands admitted to be the ground of religious persuasion i should readily allow that dissent would be rebellion in this case it would make no difference whether the opinion was sucked in with the milk or imbibed yesterday because the same legislative authority which had settled could destroy it with all the power of a creator over his creature but this doctrine is universally disowned and for a very plain reason religion to have any force on mens understandings indeed to exist at all must be supposed paramount to laws and independent for its substance upon any human institutionelse it would be the absurdest thing in the world an acknowledged cheat religion therefore is not believed because the laws have established it but it is established because the leading part of the community have previously believed it to be true as no water can rise higher than its spring no establishment can have more authority than it derives from its principle and the power of the government can with no appearance of reason go further coercively than to bind and hold down those who have once consented to their opinions the consent is the origin of the whole if they attempt to proceed further they disown the foundation upon which their own establishment was built and they claim a religious assent upon mere human authority which has been just now shown to be absurd and preposterous and which they in fact confess to be so  however we are warranted to go thus far the people often actually do and perhaps they cannot in general do better take their religion not on the coercive which is impossible but on the influencing authority of their governors as wise and informed men but if they once take a religion on the word of the state they cannot in common sense do so a second time unless they have some concurrent reason for it the prejudice in favor of your wisdom is shook by your change you confess that you have been wrong and yet you would pretend to dictate by your sole authority whereas you disengage the mind by embarrassing it for why should i prefer your opinion of today to your persuasion of yesterday if we must resort to prepossessions for the ground of opinion it is in the nature of man rather to defer to the wisdom of times past whose weakness is not before his eyes than to the present of whose imbecility he has daily experience veneration of antiquity is congenial to the human mind when therefore an establishment would persecute an opinion in possession it sets against it all the powerful prejudices of human nature it even sets its own authority when it is of most weight against itself in that very circumstance in which it must necessarily have the least and it opposes the stable prejudice of time against a new opinion founded on mutability a consideration that must render compulsion in such a case the more grievous as there is no security that when the mind is settled in the new opinion it may not be obliged to give place to one that is still newer or even to a return of the old but when an ancient establishment begins early to persecute an innovation it stands upon quite other grounds and it has all the prejudices and presumptions on its side it puts its own authority not only of compulsion but prepossession the veneration of past age as well as the activity of the present time against the opinion only of a private man or set of men if there be no reason there is at least some consistency in its proceedings commanding to constancy it does nothing but that of which it sets an example itself but an opinion at once new and persecuting is a monster because in the very instant in which it takes a liberty of change it does not leave to you even a liberty of perseverance  is then no improvement to be brought into society undoubtedly but not by compulsionbut by encouragementbut by countenance favor privileges which are powerful and are lawful instruments the coercive authority of the state is limited to what is necessary for its existence to this belongs the whole order of criminal law it considers as crimes that is the object of punishment trespasses against those rules for which society was instituted the law punishes delinquents not because they are not good men but because they are intolerably wicked it does bear and must with the vices and the follies of men until they actually strike at the root of order this it does in things actually moral in all matters of speculative improvement the case is stronger even where the matter is properly of human cognizance but to consider an averseness to improvement the not arriving at perfection as a crime is against all tolerably correct jurisprudence for if the resistance to improvement should be great and any way general they would in effect give up the necessary and substantial part in favor of the perfection and the finishing  but say the abettors of our penal laws this old possessed superstition is such in its principles that society on its general principles cannot subsist along with it could a man think such an objection possible if he had not actually heard it madean objection contradicted not by hypothetical reasonings but the clear evidence of the most decisive facts society not only exists but flourishes at this hour with this superstition in many countries under every form of governmentin some established in some tolerated in others upon an equal footing and was there no civil society at all in these kingdoms before the reformation to say it was not as well constituted as it ought to be is saying nothing at all to the purpose for that assertion evidently regards improvement not existence it certainly did then exist and it as certainly then was at least as much to the advantage of a very great part of society as what we have brought in the place of it which is indeed a great blessing to those who have profited of the change but to all the rest as we have wrought that is by blending general persecution with partial reformation it is the very reverse we found the people heretics and idolaters we have by way of improving their condition rendered them slaves and beggars they remain in all the misfortune of their old errors and all the superadded misery of their recent punishment they were happy enough in their opinion at least before the change what benefits society then had they partook of them all they are now excluded from those benefits and so far as civil society comprehends them and as we have managed the matter our persecutions are so far from being necessary to its existence that our very reformation is made in a degree noxious if this be improvement truly i know not what can be called a depravation of society  but as those who argue in this manner are perpetually shifting the question having begun with objecting in order to give a fair and public color to their scheme to a toleration of those opinions as subversive of society in general they will surely end by abandoning the broad part of the argument and attempting to show that a toleration of them is inconsistent with the established government among us now though this position be in reality as untenable as the other it is not altogether such an absurdity on the face of it all i shall here observe is that those who lay it down little consider what a wound they are giving to that establishment for which they pretend so much zeal however as this is a consideration not of general justice but of particular and national policy and as i have reserved a place expressly where it will undergo a thorough discussion i shall not here embarrass myself with itbeing resolved to preserve all the order in my power in the examination of this important melancholy subject  however before we pass from this point concerning possession it will be a relaxation of the mind not wholly foreign to our purpose to take a short review of the extraordinary policy which has been held with regard to religion in that kingdom from the time our ancestors took possession of it the most able antiquaries are of opinion and archbishop usher whom i reckon amongst the first of them has i think shown that a religion not very remote from the present protestant persuasion was that of the irish before the union of that kingdom to the crown of england if this was not directly the fact this at least seems very probable that papal authority was much lower in ireland than in other countries this union was made under the authority of an arbitrary grant of pope adrian in order that the church of ireland should be reduced to the same servitude with those that were nearer to his see it is not very wonderful that an ambitious monarch should make use of any pretence in his way to so considerable an object what is extraordinary is that for a very long time even quite down to the reformation and in their most solemn acts the kings of england founded their title wholly on this grant they called for obedience from the people of ireland not on principles of subjection but as vassals and mesne lords between them and the popes and they omitted no measure of force or policy to establish that papal authority with all the distinguishing articles of religion connected with it and to make it take deep root in the minds of the people not to crowd instances unnecessary i shall select two one of which is in print the other on recordthe one a treaty the other an act of parliament the first is the submission of the irish chiefs to richard the second mentioned by sir john davies in this pact they bind themselves for the future to preserve peace and allegiance to the kings of england under certain pecuniary penalties but what is remarkable these fines were all covenanted to be paid into the apostolical chamber supposing the pope as the superior power whose peace was broken and whose majesty was violated in disobeying his governor by this time so far as regarded england the kings had extremely abridged the papal power in many material particulars they had passed the statute of provisors the statute of præmunireand indeed struck out of the papal authority all things at least that seemed to infringe on their temporal independence in ireland however their proceeding was directly the reverse there they thought it expedient to exalt it at least as high as ever for so late as the reign of edward the fourth the following short but very explicit act of parliament was passed      iv ed cap 3      an act whereby letters patent of pardon from the king to     those that sue to rome for certain benefices is void rot     parl      item at the request of the commons it is ordeyned and     established by authority of the said parliament that all     maner letters patents of the king of pardons or pardon     granted by the king or hereafter to be granted to any     provisor that claim any title by the bulls of the pope to any     maner benefices where at the time of the impetrating of the     said bulls of provision the benefice is full of an     incumbent that then the said letters patents of pardon or     pardons be void in law and of none effect  when by every expedient of force and policy by a war of some centuries by extirpating a number of the old and by bringing in a number of new people full of those opinions and intending to propagate them they had fully compassed their object they suddenly took another turncommenced an opposite persecution made heavy laws carried on mighty wars inflicted and suffered the worst evils extirpated the mass of the old brought in new inhabitants and they continue at this day an oppressive system and may for four hundred years to come to eradicate opinions which by the same violent means they had been four hundred years endeavoring by every means to establish they compelled the people to submit by the forfeiture of all their civil rights to the popes authority in its most extravagant and unbounded sense as a giver of kingdoms and now they refuse even to tolerate them in the most moderate and chastised sentiments concerning it no country i believe since the world began has suffered so much on account of religion or has been so variously harassed both for popery and for protestantism  it will now be seen that even if these laws could be supposed agreeable to those of nature in these particulars on another and almost as strong a principle they are yet unjust as being contrary to positive compact and the public faith most solemnly plighted on the surrender of limerick and some other irish garrisons in the war of the revolution the lords justices of ireland and the commanderinchief of the kings forces signed a capitulation with the irish which was afterwards ratified by the king himself by inspeximus under the great seal of england it contains some public articles relative to the whole body of the roman catholics in that kingdom and some with regard to the security of the greater part of the inhabitants of five counties what the latter were or in what manner they were observed is at this day of much less public concern the former are twothe first and the ninth the first is of this tenorthe roman catholics of this kingdom ireland shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion as are consistent with the laws of ireland or as they did enjoy in the reign of king charles the second and their majesties as soon as affairs will permit them to summon a parliament in this kingdom will endeavor to procure the said roman catholics such farther security in that particular as may preserve them from any disturbance upon the account of their said religion the ninth article is to this effectthe oath to be administered to such roman catholics as submit to their majesties government shall be the oath abovesaid and no otherviz the oath of allegiance made by act of parliament in england in the first year of their then majesties as required by the second of the articles of limerick compare this latter article with the penal laws as they are stated in the second chapter and judge whether they seem to be the public acts of the same power and observe whether other oaths are tendered to them and under what penalties compare the former with the same laws from the beginning to the end and judge whether the roman catholics have been preserved agreeably to the sense of the article from any disturbance upon account of their religionor rather whether on that account there is a single right of nature or benefit of society which has not been either totally taken away or considerably impaired  but it is said that the legislature was not bound by this article as it has never been ratified in parliament i do admit that it never had that sanction and that the parliament was under no obligation to ratify these articles by any express act of theirs but still i am at a loss how they came to be the less valid on the principles of our constitution by being without that sanction they certainly bound the king and his successors the words of the article do this or they do nothing and so far as the crown had a share in passing those acts the public faith was unquestionably broken in ireland such a breach on the part of the crown was much more unpardonable in administration than it would have been here they have in ireland a way of preventing any bill even from approaching the royal presence in matters of far less importance than the honor and faith of the crown and the wellbeing of a great body of the people for besides that they might have opposed the very first suggestion of it in the house of commons it could not be framed into a bill without the approbation of the council in ireland it could not be returned to them again without the approbation of the king and council here they might have met it again in its second passage through that house of parliament in which it was originally suggested as well as in the other if it had escaped them through all these mazes it was again to come before the lord lieutenant who might have sunk it by a refusal of the royal assent the constitution of ireland has interposed all those checks to the passing of any constitutional act however insignificant in its own nature but did the administration in that reign avail themselves of any one of those opportunities they never gave the act of the eleventh of queen anne the least degree of opposition in any one stage of its progress what is rather the fact many of the queens servants encouraged it recommended it were in reality the true authors of its passing in parliament instead of recommending and using their utmost endeavor to establish a law directly opposite in its tendency as they were bound to do by the express letter of the very first article of the treaty of limerick to say nothing further of the ministry who in this instance most shamefully betrayed the faith of government may it not be a matter of some degree of doubt whether the parliament who do not claim a right of dissolving the force of moral obligation did not make themselves a party in this breach of contract by presenting a bill to the crown in direct violation of those articles so solemnly and so recently executed which by the constitution they had full authority to execute  it may be further objected that when the irish requested the ratification of parliament to those articles they did in effect themselves entertain a doubt concerning their validity without such a ratification to this i answer that the collateral security was meant to bind the crown and to hold it firm to its engagements they did not therefore call it a perfecting of the security but an additional security which it could not have been if the first had been void for the parliament could not bind itself more than the crown had bound itself and if all had made but one security neither of them could be called additional with propriety or common sense but let us suppose that they did apprehend there might have been something wanting in this security without the sanction of parliament they were however evidently mistaken and this surplusage of theirs did not weaken the validity of the single contract upon the known principle of law non solent quæ abundant vitiare scripturas for nothing is more evident than that the crown was bound and that no act can be made without the royal assent but the constitution will warrant us in going a great deal further and in affirming that a treaty executed by the crown and contradictory of no preceding law is full as binding on the whole body of the nation as if it had twenty times received the sanction of parliament because the very same constitution which has given to the houses of parliament their definite authority has also left in the crown the trust of making peace as a consequence and much the best consequence of the prerogative of making war if the peace was ill made my lord galmoy coningsby and porter who signed it were responsible because they were subject to the community but its own contracts are not subject to it it is subject to them and the compact of the king acting constitutionally was the compact of the nation  observe what monstrous consequences would result from a contrary position a foreign enemy has entered or a strong domestic one has arisen in the nation in such events the circumstances may be and often have been such that a parliament cannot sit this was precisely the case in that rebellion in ireland it will be admitted also that their power may be so great as to make it very prudent to treat with them in order to save effusion of blood perhaps to save the nation now could such a treaty be at all made if your enemies or rebels were fully persuaded that in these times of confusion there was no authority in the state which could hold out to them an inviolable pledge for their future security but that there lurked in the constitution a dormant but irresistible power who would not think itself bound by the ordinary subsisting and contracting authority but might rescind its acts and obligations at pleasure this would be a doctrine made to perpetuate and exasperate war and on that principle it directly impugns the law of nations which is built upon this principle that war should be softened as much as possible and that it should cease as soon as possible between contending parties and communities the king has a power to pardon individuals if the king holds out his faith to a robber to come in on a promise of pardon of life and estate and in all respects of a full indemnity shall the parliament say that he must nevertheless be executed that his estate must be forfeited or that he shall be abridged of any of the privileges which he before held as a subject nobody will affirm it in such a case the breach of faith would not only be on the part of the king who assented to such an act but on the part of the parliament who made it as the king represents the whole contracting capacity of the nation so far as his prerogative unlimited as i said before by any precedent law can extend he acts as the national procurator on all such occasions what is true of a robber is true of a rebel and what is true of one robber or rebel is as true and it is a much more important truth of one hundred thousand  to urge this part of the argument further is indeed i fear not necessary for two reasons first that it seems tolerably evident in itself and next that there is but too much ground to apprehend that the actual ratification of parliament would in the then temper of parties have proved but a very slight and trivial security of this there is a very strong example in the history of those very articles for though the parliament omitted in the reign of king william to ratify the first and most general of them they did actually confirm the second and more limited that which related to the security of the inhabitants of those five counties which were in arms when the treaty was made     chapter iv   in the foregoing book we considered these laws in a very simple point of view and in a very general onemerely as a system of hardship imposed on the body of the community and from thence and from some other arguments inferred the general injustice of such a procedure in this we shall be obliged to be more minute and the matter will become more complex as we undertake to demonstrate the mischievous and impolitic consequences which the particular mode of this oppressive system and the instruments which it employs operating as we said on this extensive object produce on the national prosperity quiet and security  the stock of materials by which any nation is rendered flourishing and prosperous are its industry its knowledge or skill its morals its execution of justice its courage and the national union in directing these powers to one point and making them all centre in the public benefit other than these i do not know and scarcely can conceive any means by which a community may flourish  if we show that these penal laws of ireland destroy not one only but every one of these materials of public prosperity it will not be difficult to perceive that great britain whilst they subsist never can draw from that country all the advantages to which the bounty of nature has entitled it  to begin with the first great instrument of national happiness and strength its industry i must observe that although these penal laws do indeed inflict many hardships on those who are obnoxious to them yet their chief their most extensive and most certain operation is upon property those civil constitutions which promote industry are such as facilitate the acquisition secure the holding enable the fixing and suffer the alienation of property every law which obstructs it in any part of this distribution is in proportion to the force and extent of the obstruction a discouragement to industry for a law against property is a law against industrythe latter having always the former and nothing else for its object now as to the acquisition of landed property which is the foundation and support of all the other kinds the laws have disabled three fourths of the inhabitants of ireland from acquiring any estate of inheritance for life or years or any charge whatsoever on which two thirds of the improved yearly value is not reserved for thirty years  this confinement of landed property to one set of hands and preventing its free circulation through the community is a most leading article of ill policy because it is one of the most capital discouragements to all that industry which may be employed on the lasting improvement of the soil or is any way conversant about land a tenure of thirty years is evidently no tenure upon which to build to plant to raise inclosures to change the nature of the ground to make any new experiment which might improve agriculture or to do anything more than what may answer the immediate and momentary calls of rent to the landlord and leave subsistence to the tenant and his family the desire of acquisition is always a passion of long views confine a man to momentary possession and you at once cut off that laudable avarice which every wise state has cherished as one of the first principles of its greatness allow a man but a temporary possession lay it down as a maxim that he never can have any other and you immediately and infallibly turn him to temporary enjoyments and these enjoyments are never the pleasures of labor and free industry whose quality it is to famish the present hours and squander all upon prospect and futurity they are on the contrary those of a thoughtless loitering and dissipated life the people must be inevitably disposed to such pernicious habits merely from the short duration of their tenure which the law has allowed but it is not enough that industry is checked by the confinement of its views it is further discouraged by the limitation of its own direct object profit this is a regulation extremely worthy of our attention as it is not a consequential but a direct discouragement to meliorationas directly as if the law had said in express terms thou shalt not improve  but we have an additional argument to demonstrate the ill policy of denying the occupiers of land any solid property in it ireland is a country wholly unplanted the farms have neither dwellinghouses nor good offices nor are the lands almost anywhere provided with fences and communications in a word in a very unimproved state the landowner there never takes upon him as it is usual in this kingdom to supply all these conveniences and to set down his tenant in what may be called a completely furnished farm if the tenant will not do it it is never done this circumstance shows how miserably and peculiarly impolitic it has been in ireland to tie down the body of the tenantry to short and unprofitable tenures a finished and furnished house will be taken for any term however short if the repair lies on the owner the shorter the better but no one will take one not only unfurnished but half built but upon a term which on calculation will answer with profit all his charges it is on this principle that the romans established their emphyteusis or feefarm for though they extended the ordinary term of their location only to nine years yet they encouraged a more permanent letting to farm with the condition of improvement as well as of annual payment on the part of the tenant where the land had lain rough and neglectedand therefore invented this species of engrafted holding in the later times when property came to be worse distributed by falling into a few hands  this denial of landed property to the gross of the people has this further evil effect in preventing the improvement of land that it prevents any of the property acquired in trade to be regorged as it were upon the land they must have observed very little who have not remarked the bold and liberal spirit of improvement which persons bred to trade have often exerted on their landpurchases that they usually come to them with a more abundant command of ready money than most landed men possess and that they have in general a much better idea by long habits of calculative dealings of the propriety of expending in order to acquire besides such men often bring their spirit of commerce into their estates with them and make manufactures take a root where the mere landed gentry had perhaps no capital perhaps no inclination and most frequently not sufficient knowledge to effect anything of the kind by these means what beautiful and useful spots have there not been made about trading and manufacturing towns and how has agriculture had reason to bless that happy alliance with commerce and how miserable must that nation be whose frame of polity has disjoined the landing and the trading interests                                       the great prop of this whole system is not pretended to be its justice or its utility but the supposed danger to the state which gave rise to it originally and which they apprehend would return if this system were overturned whilst say they the papists of this kingdom were possessed of landed property and of the influence consequent to such property their allegiance to the crown of great britain was ever insecure the public peace was ever liable to be broken and protestants never could be a moment secure either of their properties or of their lives indulgence only made them arrogant and power daring confidence only excited and enabled them to exert their inherent treachery and the times which they generally selected for their most wicked and desperate rebellions were those in which they enjoyed the greatest ease and the most perfect tranquillity  such are the arguments that are used both publicly and privately in every discussion upon this point they are generally full of passion and of error and built upon facts which in themselves are most false it cannot i confess be denied that those miserable performances which go about under the names of histories of ireland do indeed represent those events after this manner and they would persuade us contrary to the known order of nature that indulgence and moderation in governors is the natural incitement in subjects to rebel but there is an interior history of ireland the genuine voice of its records and monuments which speaks a very different language from these histories from temple and from clarendon these restore nature to its just rights and policy to its proper order for they even now show to those who have been at the pains to examine them and they may show one day to all the world that these rebellions were not produced by toleration but by persecutionthat they arose not from just and mild government but from the most unparalleled oppression these records will be far from giving the least countenance to a doctrine so repugnant to humanity and good sense as that the security of any establishment civil or religious can ever depend upon the misery of those who live under it or that its danger can arise from their quiet and prosperity god forbid that the history of this or any country should give such encouragement to the folly or vices of those who govern if it can be shown that the great rebellions of ireland have arisen from attempts to reduce the natives to the state to which they are now reduced it will show that an attempt to continue them in that state will rather be disadvantageous to the public peace than any kind of security to it these things have in some measure begun to appear already and as far as regards the argument drawn from former rebellions it will fall readily to the ground but for my part i think the real danger to every state is to render its subjects justly discontented nor is there in polities or science any more effectual secret for their security than to establish in their people a firm opinion that no change can be for their advantage it is true that bigotry and fanaticism may for a time draw great multitudes of people from a knowledge of their true and substantial interest but upon this i have to remark three things first that such a temper can never become universal or last for a long time the principle of religion is seldom lasting the majority of men are in no persuasion bigots they are not willing to sacrifice on every vain imagination that superstition or enthusiasm holds forth or that even zeal and piety recommend the certain possession of their temporal happiness and if such a spirit has been at any time roused in a society after it has had its paroxysm it commonly subsides and is quiet and is even the weaker for the violence of its first exertion security and ease are its mortal enemies but secondly if anything can tend to revive and keep it up it is to keep alive the passions of men by ill usage this is enough to irritate even those who have not a spark of bigotry in their constitution to the most desperate enterprises it certainly will inflame darken and render more dangerous the spirit of bigotry in those who are possessed by it lastly by rooting out any sect you are never secure against the effects of fanaticism it may arise on the side of the most favored opinions and many are the instances wherein the established religion of a state has grown ferocious and turned upon its keeper and has often torn to pieces the civil establishment that had cherished it and which it was designed to support franceenglandholland  but there may be danger of wishing a change even where no religious motive can operate and every enemy to such a state comes as a friend to the subject and where other countries are under terror they begin to hope  this argument ad verecundiam has as much force as any such have but i think it fares but very indifferently with those who make use of it for they would get but little to be proved abettors of tyranny at the expense of putting me to an inconvenient acknowledgment for if i were to confess that there are circumstances in which it would be better to establish such a religion                                       with regard to the popes interest this foreign chief of their religion cannot be more formidable to us than to other protestant countries to conquer that country for himself is a wild chimera to encourage revolt in favor of foreign princes is an exploded idea in the politics of that court perhaps it would be full as dangerous to have the people under the conduct of factious pastors of their own as under a foreign ecclesiastical court                                       in the second year of the reign of queen elizabeth were enacted several limitations in the acquisition or the retaining of property which had so far as regarded any general principles hitherto remained untouched under all changes  these bills met no opposition either in the irish parliament or in the english council except from private agents who were little attended to and they passed into laws with the highest and most general applauses as all such things are in the beginning not as a system of persecution but as masterpieces of the most subtle and refined politics and to say the truth these laws at first view have rather an appearance of a plan of vexatious litigation and crooked lawchicanery than of a direct and sanguinary attack upon the rights of private conscience because they did not affect life at least with regard to the laity and making the catholic opinions rather the subject of civil regulations than of criminal prosecutions to those who are not lawyers and read these laws they only appear to be a species of jargon for the execution of criminal law has always a certain appearance of violence being exercised directly on the persons of the supposed offenders and commonly executed in the face of the public such executions are apt to excite sentiments of pity for the sufferers and indignation against those who are employed in such crueltiesbeing seen as single acts of cruelty rather than as ill general principles of government but the operation of the laws in question being such as common feeling brings home to every mans bosom they operate in a sort of comparative silence and obscurity and though their cruelty is exceedingly great it is never seen in a single exertion and always escapes commiseration being scarce known except to those who view them in a general which is always a cold and phlegmatic light the first of these laws being made with so general a satisfaction as the chief governors found that such things were extremely acceptable to the leading people in that country they were willing enough to gratify them with the ruin of their fellowcitizens they were not sorry to divert their attention from other inquiries and to keep them fixed to this as if this had been the only real object of their national politics and for many years there was no speech from the throne which did not with great appearance of seriousness recommend the passing of such laws and scarce a session went over without in effect passing some of them until they have by degrees grown to be the most considerable head in the irish statutebook at the same time giving a temporary and occasional mitigation to the severity of some of the harshest of those laws they appeared in some sort the protectors of those whom they were in reality destroying by the establishment of general constitutions against them at length however the policy of this expedient is worn out the passions of men are cooled those laws begin to disclose themselves and to produce effects very different from those which were promised in making them for crooked counsels are ever unwise and nothing can be more absurd and dangerous than to tamper with the natural foundations of society in hopes of keeping it up by certain contrivances                                          a  letter  to  william smith esq  on the subject of  catholic emancipation  january 29 1795   letter23   my dear siryour letter is to myself infinitely obliging with regard to you i can find no fault with it except that of a tone of humility and disqualification which neither your rank nor the place you are in nor the profession you belong to nor your very extraordinary learning and talents will in propriety demand or perhaps admit these dispositions will be still less proper if you should feel them in the extent your modesty leads you to express them you have certainly given by far too strong a proof of selfdiffidence by asking the opinion of a man circumstanced as i am on the important subject of your letter you are far more capable of forming just conceptions upon it than i can be however since you are pleased to command me to lay before you my thoughts as materials upon which your better judgment may operate i shall obey you and submit them with great deference to your melioration or rejection  but first permit me to put myself in the right i owe you an answer to your former letter it did not desire one but it deserved it if not for an answer it called for an acknowledgment it was a new favor and indeed i should be worse than insensible if i did not consider the honors you have heaped upon me with no sparing hand with becoming gratitude but your letter arrived to me at a time when the closing of my long and last business in life a business extremely complex and full of difficulties and vexations of all sorts occupied me in a manner which those who have not seen the interior as well as exterior of it cannot easily imagine i confess that in the crisis of that rude conflict i neglected many things that well deserved my best attentionnone that deserved it better or have caused me more regret in the neglect than your letter the instant that business was over and the house had passed its judgment on the conduct of the managers i lost no time to execute what for years i had resolved on it was to quit my public station and to seek that tranquillity in my very advanced age to which after a very tempestuous life i thought myself entitled but god has thought fit and i unfeignedly acknowledge his justice to dispose of things otherwise so heavy a calamity has fallen upon me as to disable me for business and to disqualify me for repose the existence i have i do not know that i can call life accordingly i do not meddle with any one measure of government though for what reasons i know not you seem to suppose me deeply in the secret of affairs i only know so far as your side of the water is concerned that your present excellent lord lieutenant the best man in every relation that i have ever been acquainted with has perfectly pure intentions with regard to ireland and of course that he wishes cordially well to those who form the great mass of its inhabitants and who as they are well or ill managed must form an important part of its strength or weakness if with regard to that great object he has carried over any readymade system i assure you it is perfectly unknown to me i am very much retired from the world and live in much ignorance this i hope will form my humble apology if i should err in the notions i entertain of the question which is soon to become the subject of your deliberations at the same time accept it as an apology for my neglects  you need make no apology for your attachment to the religious description you belong to it proves as in you it is sincere your attachment to the great points in which the leading divisions are agreed when the lesser in which they differ are so dear to you i shall never call any religious opinions which appear important to serious and pious minds things of no consideration nothing is so fatal to religion as indifference which is at least half infidelity as long as men hold charity and justice to be essential integral parts of religion there can be little danger from a strong attachment to particular tenets in faith this i am perfectly sure is your case but i am not equally sure that either zeal for the tenets of faith or the smallest degree of charity or justice have much influenced the gentlemen who under pretexts of zeal have resisted the enfranchisement of their country my dear son who was a person of discernment as well as clear and acute in his expressions said in a letter of his which i have seen that in order to grace their cause and to draw some respect to their persons they pretend to be bigots but here i take it we have not much to do with the theological tenets on the one side of the question or the other the point itself is practically decided that religion is owned by the state except in a settled maintenance it is protected a great deal of the rubbish which as a nuisance long obstructed the way is removed one impediment remained longer as a matter to justify the proscription of the body of our country after the rest had been abandoned as untenable ground but the business of the pope that mixed person of polities and religion has long ceased to be a bugbear for some time past he has ceased to be even a colorable pretext this was well known when the catholics of these kingdoms for our amusement were obliged on oath to disclaim him in his political capacitywhich implied an allowance for them to recognize him in some sort of ecclesiastical superiority it was a compromise of the old dispute  for my part i confess i wish that we had been less eager in this point i dont think indeed that much mischief will happen from it if things are otherwise properly managed too nice an inquisition ought not to be made into opinions that are dying away of themselves had we lived an hundred and fifty years ago i should have been as earnest and anxious as anybody for this sort of abjuration but living at the time in which i live and obliged to speculate forward instead of backward i must fairly say i could well endure the existence of every sort of collateral aid which opinion might in the now state of things afford to authority i must see much more danger than in my life i have seen or than others will venture seriously to affirm that they see in the pope aforesaid though a foreign power and with his long tail of et ceteras before i should be active in weakening any hold which government might think it prudent to resort to in the management of that large part of the kings subjects i do not choose to direct all my precautions to the part where the danger does not press and to leave myself open and unguarded where i am not only really but visibly attacked  my whole politics at present centre in one point and to this the merit or demerit of every measure with me is referablethat is what will most promote or depress the cause of jacobinism what is jacobinism it is an attempt hitherto but too successful to eradicate prejudice out of the minds of men for the purpose of putting all power and authority into the hands of the persons capable of occasionally enlightening the minds of the people for this purpose the jacobins have resolved to destroy the whole frame and fabric of the old societies of the world and to regenerate them after their fashion to obtain an army for this purpose they everywhere engage the poor by holding out to them as a bribe the spoils of the rich this i take to be a fair description of the principles and leading maxims of the enlightened of our day who are commonly called jacobins  as the grand prejudice and that which holds all the other prejudices together the first last and middle object of their hostility is religion with that they are at inexpiable war they make no distinction of sects a christian as such is to them an enemy what then is left to a real christian christian as a believer and as a statesman but to make a league between all the grand divisions of that name to protect and to cherish them all and by no means to proscribe in any manner more or less any member of our common party the divisions which formerly prevailed in the church with all their overdone zeal only purified and ventilated our common faith because there was no common enemy arrayed and embattled to take advantage of their dissensions but now nothing but inevitable ruin will be the consequence of our quarrels i think we may dispute rail persecute and provoke the catholics out of their prejudices but it is not in ours they will take refuge if anything is one more than another out of the power of man it is to create a prejudice somebody has said that a king may make a nobleman but he cannot make a gentleman  all the principal religions in europe stand upon one common bottom the support that the whole or the favored parts may have in the secret dispensations of providence it is impossible to tell but humanly speaking they are all prescriptive religions they have all stood long enough to make prescription and its chain of legitimate prejudices their main stay the people who compose the four grand divisions of christianity have now their religion as an habit and upon authority and not on disputationas all men who have their religion derived from their parents and the fruits of education must have it however the one more than the other may be able to reconcile his faith to his own reason or to that of other men depend upon it they must all be supported or they must all fall in the crash of a common ruin the catholics are the far more numerous part of the christians in your country and how can christianity that is now the point in issue be supported under the persecution or even under the discountenance of the greater number of christians it is a great truth and which in one of the debates i stated as strongly as i could to the house of commons in the last session that if the catholic religion is destroyed by the infidels it is a most contemptible and absurd idea that this or any protestant church can survive that event therefore my humble and decided opinion is that all the three religions prevalent more or less in various parts of these islands ought all in subordination to the legal establishments as they stand in the several countries to be all countenanced protected and cherished and that in ireland particularly the roman catholic religion should be upheld in high respect and veneration and should be in its place provided with all the means of making it a blessing to the people who profess itthat it ought to be cherished as a good though not as the most preferable good if a choice was now to be made and not tolerated as an inevitable evil if this be my opinion as to the catholic religion as a sect you must see that i must be to the last degree averse to put a man upon that account upon a bad footing with relation to the privileges which the fundamental laws of this country give him as a subject i am the more serious on the positive encouragement to be given to this religion always however as secondary because the serious and earnest belief and practice of it by its professors forms as things stand the most effectual barrier if not the sole barrier against jacobinism the catholics form the great body of the lower ranks of your community and no small part of those classes of the middling that come nearest to them you know that the seduction of that part of mankind from the principles of religion morality subordination and social order is the great object of the jacobins let them grow lax skeptical careless and indifferent with regard to religion and so sure as we have an existence it is not a zealous anglican or scottish church principle but direct jacobinism which will enter into that breach two hundred years dreadfully spent in experiments to force that people to change the form of their religion have proved fruitless you have now your choice for full four fifths of your people of the catholic religion or jacobinism if things appear to you to stand on this alternative i think you will not be long in making your option  you have made as you naturally do a very able analysis of powers and have separated as the things are separable civil from political powers you start too a question whether the civil can be secured without some share in the political for my part as abstract questions i should find some difficulty in an attempt to resolve them but as applied to the state of ireland to the form of our commonwealth to the parties that divide us and to the dispositions of the leading men in those parties i cannot hesitate to lay before you my opinion that whilst any kind of discouragements and disqualifications remain on the catholics an handle will be made by a factious power utterly to defeat the benefits of any civil rights they may apparently possess i need not go to very remote times for my examples it was within the course of about a twelvemonth that after parliament had been led into a step quite unparalleled in its records after they had resisted all concession and even hearing with an obstinacy equal to anything that could have actuated a party domination in the second or eighth of queen anne after the strange adventure of the grand juries and after parliament had listened to the sovereign pleading for the emancipation of his subjectsit was after all this that such a grudging and discontent was expressed as must justly have alarmed as it did extremely alarm the whole of the catholic body and i remember but one period in my whole life i mean the savage period between 1781 and 1767 in which they have been more harshly or contumeliously treated than since the last partial enlargement and thus i am convinced it will be by paroxysms as long as any stigma remains on them and whilst they are considered as no better than half citizens if they are kept such for any length of time they will be made whole jacobins against this grand and dreadful evil of our time i do not love to cheat myself or others i do not know any solid security whatsoever but i am quite certain that what will come nearest to it is to interest as many as you can in the present order of things religiously civilly politically by all the ties and principles by which mankind are held this is like to be effectual policy i am sure it is honorable policy and it is better to fail if fail we must in the paths of direct and manly than of low and crooked wisdom  as to the capacity of sitting in parliament after all the capacities for voting for the army for the navy for the professions for civil offices it is a dispute de lana caprina in my poor opinionat least on the part of those who oppose it in the first place this admission to office and this exclusion from parliament on the principle of an exclusion from political power is the very reverse of the principle of the english test act if i were to form a judgment from experience rather than theory i should doubt much whether the capacity for or even the possession of a seat in parliament did really convey much of power to be properly called political i have sat there with some observation for nineandtwenty years or thereabouts the power of a member of parliament is uncertain and indirect and if power rather than splendor and fame were the object i should think that any of the principal clerks in office to say nothing of their superiors several of whom are disqualified by law for seats in parliament possess far more power than nine tenths of the members of the house of commons i might say this of men who seemed from their fortunes their weight in their country and their talents to be persons of figure thereand persons too not in opposition to the prevailing party in government but be they what they will on a fair canvass of the several prevalent parliamentary interests in ireland i cannot out of the three hundred members of whom the irish parliament is composed discover that above three or at the utmost four catholics would be returned to the house of commons but suppose they should amount to thirty that is to a tenth part a thing i hold impossible for a long series of years and never very likely to happen what is this to those who are to balance them in the one house and the clear and settled majority in the other for i think it absolutely impossible that in the course of many years above four or five peers should be created of that communion in fact the exclusion of them seems to me only to mark jealousy and suspicion and not to provide security in any waybut i return to the old ground the danger is not there these are things long since done away the grand controversy is no longer between you and them  forgive this length my pen has insensibly run on you are yourself to blame if you are much fatigued i congratulate you on the auspicious opening of your session surely great britain and ireland ought to join in wreathing a neverfading garland for the head of grattan adieu my dear sir good nights to youi never can have any  yours always most sincerely  edmund burke  jan 29th 1795 twelve at night  footnotes  23 william smith esq to whom this letter is addressed was then a member of the irish parliament he is now 1812 one of the barons of the court of exchequer in ireland     second letter  to  sir hercules langrishe  on the  catholic question  may 26 1795   my dear sirif i am not as early as i ought to be in my acknowledgments for your very kind letter pray do me the justice to attribute my failure to its natural and but too real cause a want of the most ordinary power of exertion owing to the impressions made upon an old and infirm constitution by private misfortune and by public calamity it is true i make occasional efforts to rouse myself to something betterbut i soon relapse into that state of languor which must be the habit of my body and understanding to the end of my short and cheerless existence in this world  i am sincerely grateful for your kindness in connecting the interest you take in the sentiments of an old friend with the able part you take in the service of your country it is an instance among many of that happy temper which has always given a character of amenity to your virtues and a goodnatured direction to your talents  your speech on the catholic question i read with much satisfaction it is solid it is convincing it is eloquent and it ought on the spot to have produced that effect which its reason and that contained in the other excellent speeches on the same side of the question cannot possibly fail though with less pleasant consequences to produce hereafter what a sad thing it is that the grand instructor time has not yet been able to teach the grand lesson of his own value and that in every question of moral and political prudence it is the choice of the moment which renders the measure serviceable or useless noxious or salutary  in the catholic question i considered only one point was it at the time and in the circumstances a measure which tended to promote the concord of the citizens i have no difficulty in saying it wasand as little in saying that the present concord of the citizens was worth buying at a critical season by granting a few capacities which probably no one man now living is likely to be served or hurt by when any man tells you and me that if these places were left in the discretion of a protestant crown and these memberships in the discretion of protestant electors or patrons we should have a popish official system and a popish representation capable of overturning the establishment he only insults our understandings when any man tells this to catholics he insults their understandings and he galls their feelings it is not the question of the places and seats it is the real hostile disposition and the pretended fears that leave stings in the minds of the people i really thought that in the total of the late circumstances with regard to persons to things to principles and to measures was to be found a conjuncture favorable to the introduction and to the perpetuation of a general harmony producing a general strength which to that hour ireland was never so happy as to enjoy my sanguine hopes are blasted and i must consign my feelings on that terrible disappointment to the same patience in which i have been obliged to bury the vexation i suffered on the defeat of the other great just and honorable causes in which i have had some share and which have given more of dignity than of peace and advantage to a long laborious life though perhaps a want of success might be urged as a reason for making me doubt of the justice of the part i have taken yet until i have other lights than one side of the debate has furnished me i must see things and feel them too as i see and feel them i think i can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of protestant ascendency as they affect irelandor of indianism as they affect these countries and as they affect asiaor of jacobinism as they affect all europe and the state of human society itself the last is the greatest evil but it readily combines with the others and flows from them whatever breeds discontent at this time will produce that great mastermischief most infallibly whatever tends to persuade the people that the few called by whatever name you please religious or political are of opinion that their interest is not compatible with that of the many is a great point gained to jacobinism whatever tends to irritate the talents of a country which have at all times and at these particularly a mighty influence on the public mind is of infinite service to that formidable cause unless where heaven has mingled uncommon ingredients of virtue in the compositionquos meliore luto finxit præcordia titantalents naturally gravitate to jacobinism whatever illhumors are afloat in the state they will be sure to discharge themselves in a mingled torrent in the cloaca maxima of jacobinism therefore people ought well to look about them first the physicians are to take care that they do nothing to irritate this epidemical distemper it is a foolish thing to have the better of the patient in a dispute the complaint or its cause ought to be removed and wise and lenient arts ought to precede the measures of vigor they ought to be the ultima not the prima not the tota ratio of a wise government god forbid that on a worthy occasion authority should want the means of force or the disposition to use it but where a prudent and enlarged policy does not precede it and attend it too where the hearts of the better sort of people do not go with the hands of the soldiery you may call your constitution what you will in effect it will consist of three parts orders if you please cavalry infantry and artilleryand of nothing else or better i agree with you in your dislike of the discourses in francis street but i like as little some of those in college green i am even less pleased with the temper that predominated in the latter as better things might have been expected in the regular family mansion of public discretion than in a new and hasty assembly of unexperienced men congregated under circumstances of no small irritation after people have taken your tests prescribed by yourselves as proofs of their allegiance to be marked as enemies traitors or at best as suspected and dangerous persons and that they are not to be believed on their oaths we are not to be surprised if they fall into a passion and talk as men in a passion do intemperately and idly  the worst of the matter is this you are partly leading partly driving into jacobinism that description of your people whose religious principles church polity and habitual discipline might make them an invincible dike against that inundation this you have a thousand mattocks and pickaxes lifted up to demolish you make a sad story of the pope o seri studiorum it will not be difficult to get many called catholics to laugh at this fundamental part of their religion never doubt it you have succeeded in part and you may succeed completely but in the present state of mens minds and affairs do not flatter yourselves that they will piously look to the head of our church in the place of that pope whom you make them forswear and out of all reverence to whom you bully and rail and buffoon them perhaps you may succeed in the same manner with all the other tenets of doctrine and usages of discipline amongst the catholics but what security have you that in the temper and on the principles on which they have made this change they will stop at the exact stickingplaces you have marked in your articles you have no security for anything but that they will become what are called francojacobins and reject the whole together no converts now will be made in a considerable number from one of our sects to the other upon a really religious principle controversy moves in another direction  next to religion property is the great point of jacobin attack here many of the debaters in your majority and their writers have given the jacobins all the assistance their hearts can wish when the catholics desire places and seats you tell them that this is only a pretext though protestants might suppose it just possible for men to like good places and snug boroughs for their own merits but that their real view is to strip protestants of their property to my certain knowledge till those jacobin lectures were opened in the house of commons they never dreamt of any such thing but now the great professors may stimulate them to inquire on the new principles into the foundation of that property and of all property if you treat men as robbers why robbers sooner or later they will become  a third point of jacobin attack is on old traditionary constitutions you are apprehensive for yours which leans from its perpendicular and does not stand firm on its theory i like parliamentary reforms as little as any man who has boroughs to sell for money or for peerages in ireland but it passes my comprehension in what manner it is that men can be reconciled to the practical merits of a constitution the theory of which is in litigation by being practically excluded from any of its advantages let us put ourselves in the place of these people and try an experiment of the effects of such a procedure on our own minds unquestionably we should be perfectly satisfied when we were told that houses of parliament instead of being places of refuge for popular liberty were citadels for keeping us in order as a conquered people these things play the jacobin game to a nicety  indeed my dear sir there is not a single particular in the francisstreet declamations which has not to your and to my certain knowledge been taught by the jealous ascendants sometimes by doctrine sometimes by example always by provocation remember the whole of 1781 and 1782 in parliament and out of parliament at this very day and in the worst acts and designs observe the tenor of the objections with which the collegegreen orators of the ascendency reproach the catholics you have observed no doubt how much they rely on the affair of jackson is it not pleasant to hear catholics reproached for a supposed connectionwith whomwith protestant clergymen with protestant gentlemen with mr jackson with mr rowan c c but egomet mî ignosco conspiracies and treasons are privileged pleasures not to be profaned by the impure and unhallowed touch of papists indeed all this will do perhaps well enough with detachments of dismounted cavalry and fencibles from england but let us not say to catholics by way of argument that they are to be kept in a degraded state because some of them are no better than many of us protestants the thing i most disliked in some of their speeches those i mean of the catholics was what is called the spirit of liberality so much and so diligently taught by the ascendants by which they are made to abandon their own particular interests and to merge them in the general discontents of the country it gave me no pleasure to hear of the dissolution of the committee there were in it a majority to my knowledge of very sober wellintentioned men and there were none in it but such who if not continually goaded and irritated might be made useful to the tranquillity of the country it is right always to have a few of every description through whom you may quietly operate on the many both for the interests of the description and for the general interest  excuse me my dear friend if i have a little tried your patience you have brought this trouble on yourself by your thinking of a man forgot and who has no objection to be forgot by the world these things we discussed together four or five and thirty years ago we were then and at bottom ever since of the same opinion on the justice and policy of the whole and of every part of the penal system you and i and everybody must now and then ply and bend to the occasion and take what can be got but very sure i am that whilst there remains in the law any principle whatever which can furnish to certain politicians an excuse for raising an opinion of their own importance as necessary to keep their fellowsubjects in order the obnoxious people will be fretted harassed insulted provoked to discontent and disorder and practically excluded from the partial advantages from which the letter of the law does not exclude them  adieu my dear sir  and believe me very truly yours  edmund burke  beaconsfield may 26 1795     a  letter  to  richard burke esq  on  protestant ascendency in ireland  1793   my dear sonwe are all again assembled in town to finish the last but the most laborious of the tasks which have been imposed upon me during my parliamentary service we are as well as at our time of life we can expect to be we have indeed some moments of anxiety about you you are engaged in an undertaking similar in its principle to mine you are engaged in the relief of an oppressed people in that service you must necessarily excite the same sort of passions in those who have exercised and who wish to continue that oppression that i have had to struggle with in this long labor as your father has done you must make enemies of many of the rich of the proud and of the powerful i and you began in the same way i must confess that if our place was of our choice i could wish it had been your lot to begin the career of your life with an endeavor to render some more moderate and less invidious service to the public but being engaged in a great and critical work i have not the least hesitation about your having hitherto done your duty as becomes you if i had not an assurance not to be shaken from the character of your mind i should be satisfied on that point by the cry that is raised against you if you had behaved as they call it discreetly that is faintly and treacherously in the execution of your trust you would have had for a while the good word of all sorts of men even of many of those whose cause you had betrayedand whilst your favor lasted you might have coined that false reputation into a true and solid interest to yourself this you are well apprised of and you do not refuse to travel that beaten road from an ignorance but from a contempt of the objects it leads to  when you choose an arduous and slippery path god forbid that any weak feelings of my declining age which calls for soothings and supports and which can have none but from you should make me wish that you should abandon what you are about or should trifle with it in this house we submit though with troubled minds to that order which has connected all great duties with toils and with perils which has conducted the road to glory through the regions of obloquy and reproach and which will never suffer the disparaging alliance of spurious false and fugitive praise with genuine and permanent reputation we know that the power which has settled that order and subjected you to it by placing you in the situation you are in is able to bring you out of it with credit and with safety his will be done all must come right you may open the way with pain and under reproach others will pursue it with ease and with applause  i am sorry to find that pride and passion and that sort of zeal for religion which never shows any wonderful heat but when it afflicts and mortifies our neighbor will not let the ruling description perceive that the privilege for which your clients contend is very nearly as much for the benefit of those who refuse it as those who ask it i am not to examine into the charges that are daily made on the administration of ireland i am not qualified to say how much in them is cold truth and how much rhetorical exaggeration allowing some foundation to the complaint it is to no purpose that these people allege that their government is a job in its administration i am sure it is a job in its constitution nor is it possible a scheme of polity which in total exclusion of the body of the community confines with little or no regard to their rank or condition in life to a certain set of favored citizens the rights which formerly belonged to the whole should not by the operation of the same selfish and narrow principles teach the persons who administer in that government to prefer their own particular but wellunderstood private interest to the false and illcalculated private interest of the monopolizing company they belong to eminent characters to be sure overrule places and circumstances i have nothing to say to that virtue which shoots up in full force by the native vigor of the seminal principle in spite of the adverse soil and climate that it grows in but speaking of things in their ordinary course in a country of monopoly there can be no patriotism there may be a party spirit but public spirit there can be none as to a spirit of liberty still less can it exist or anything like it a liberty made up of penalties a liberty made up of incapacities a liberty made up of exclusion and proscription continued for ages of four fifths perhaps of the inhabitants of all ranks and fortunes in what does such liberty differ from the description of the most shocking kind of servitude  but it will be said in that country some people are free why this is the very description of despotism partial freedom is privilege and prerogative and not liberty liberty such as deserves the name is an honest equitable diffusive and impartial principle it is a great and enlarged virtue and not a sordid selfish and illiberal vice it is the portion of the mass of the citizens and not the haughty license of some potent individual or some predominant faction  if anything ought to be despotic in a country it is its government because there is no cause of constant operation to make its yoke unequal but the dominion of a party must continually steadily and by its very essence lean upon the prostrate description a constitution formed so as to enable a party to overrule its very government and to overpower the people too answers the purposes neither of government nor of freedom it compels that power which ought and often would be disposed equally to protect the subjects to fail in its trust to counteract its purposes and to become no better than the instrument of the wrongs of a faction some degree of influence must exist in all governments but a government which has no interest to please the body of the people and can neither support them nor with safety call for their support nor is of power to sway the domineering faction can only exist by corruption and taught by that monopolizing party which usurps the title and qualities of the public to consider the body of the people as out of the constitution they will consider those who are in it in the light in which they choose to consider themselves the whole relation of government and of freedom will be a battle or a traffic  this system in its real nature and under its proper appellations is odious and unnatural especially when a constitution is admitted which not only as all constitutions do profess has a regard to the good of the multitude but in its theory makes profession of their power also but of late this scheme of theirs has been newchristenedhonestum nomen imponitur vitio a word has been lately struck in the mint of the castle of dublin thence it was conveyed to the tholsel or cityhall where having passed the touch of the corporation so respectably stamped and vouched it soon became current in parliament and was carried back by the speaker of the house of commons in great pomp as an offering of homage from whence it came the word is ascendency it is not absolutely new but the sense in which i have hitherto seen it used was to signify an influence obtained over the minds of some other person by love and reverence or by superior management and dexterity it had therefore to this its promotion no more than a moral not a civil or political use but i admit it is capable of being so applied and if the lord mayor of dublin and the speaker of the irish parliament who recommend the preservation of the protestant ascendency mean to employ the word in that sensethat is if they understand by it the preservation of the influence of that description of gentlemen over the catholics by means of an authority derived from their wisdom and virtue and from an opinion they raise in that people of a pious regard and affection for their freedom and happinessit is impossible not to commend their adoption of so apt a term into the family of politics it may be truly said to enrich the language even if the lord mayor and speaker mean to insinuate that this influence is to be obtained and held by flattering their people by managing them by skilfully adapting themselves to the humors and passions of those whom they would govern he must be a very untoward critic who would cavil even at this use of the word though such cajoleries would perhaps be more prudently practised than professed these are all meanings laudable or at least tolerable but when we look a little more narrowly and compare it with the plan to which it owes its present technical application i find it has strayed far from its original sense it goes much further than the privilege allowed by horace it is more than parce detortum this protestant ascendency means nothing less than an influence obtained by virtue by love or even by artifice and seductionfull as little an influence derived from the means by which ministers have obtained an influence which might be called without straining an ascendency in public assemblies in england that is by a liberal distribution of places and pensions and other graces of government this last is wide indeed of the signification of the word new ascendency is the old mastership it is neither more nor less than the resolution of one set of people in ireland to consider themselves as the sole citizens in the commonwealth and to keep a dominion over the rest by reducing them to absolute slavery under a military power and thus fortified in their power to divide the public estate which is the result of general contribution as a military booty solely amongst themselves  the poor word ascendency so soft and melodious in its sound so lenitive and emollient in its first usage is now employed to cover to the world the most rigid and perhaps not the most wise of all plans of policy the word is large enough in its comprehension i cannot conceive what mode of oppression in civil life or what mode of religious persecution may not come within the methods of preserving an ascendency in plain old english as they apply it it signifies pride and dominion on the one part of the relation and on the other subserviency and contemptand it signifies nothing else the old words are as fit to be set to music as the new but use has long since affixed to them their true signification and they sound as the other will harshly and odiously to the moral and intelligent ears of mankind  this ascendency by being a protestant ascendency does not better it from the combination of a note or two more in this antiharmonic scale if protestant ascendency means the proscription from citizenship of by far the major part of the people of any country then protestant ascendency is a bad thing and it ought to have no existence but there is a deeper evil by the use that is so frequently made of the term and the policy which is engrafted on it the name protestant becomes nothing more or better than the name of a persecuting faction with a relation of some sort of theological hostility to others but without any sort of ascertained tenets of its own upon the ground of which it persecutes other men for the patrons of this protestant ascendency neither do nor can by anything positive define or describe what they mean by the word protestant it is defined as cowley defines wit not by what it is but by what it is not it is not the christian religion as professed in the churches holding communion with rome the majority of christians that is all which in the latitude of the term is known about its signification this makes such persecutors ten times worse than any of that description that hitherto have been known in the world the old persecutors whether pagan or christian whether arian or orthodox whether catholics anglicans or calvinists actually were or at least had the decorum to pretend to be strong dogmatists they pretended that their religious maxims were clear and ascertained and so useful that they were bound for the eternal benefit of mankind to defend or diffuse them though by any sacrifices of the temporal good of those who were the objects of their system of experiment  the bottom of this theory of persecution is false it is not permitted to us to sacrifice the temporal good of any body of men to our own ideas of the truth and falsehood of any religious opinions by making men miserable in this life they counteract one of the great ends of charity which is in as much as in us lies to make men happy in every period of their existence and most in what most depends upon us but give to these old persecutors their mistaken principle in their reasoning they are consistent and in their tempers they may be even kind and goodnatured but whenever a faction would render millions of mankind miserable some millions of the race coexistent with themselves and many millions in their succession without knowing or so much as pretending to ascertain the doctrines of their own school in which there is much of the lash and nothing of the lesson the errors which the persons in such a faction fall into are not those that are natural to human imbecility nor is the least mixture of mistaken kindness to mankind an ingredient in the severities they inflict the whole is nothing but pure and perfect malice it is indeed a perfection in that kind belonging to beings of an higher order than man and to them we ought to leave it  this kind of persecutors without zeal without charity know well enough that religion to pass by all questions of the truth or falsehood of any of its particular systems a matter i abandon to the theologians on all sides is a source of great comfort to us mortals in this our short but tedious journey through the world they know that to enjoy this consolation men must believe their religion upon some principle or other whether of education habit theory or authority when men are driven from any of those principles on which they have received religion without embracing with the same assurance and cordiality some other system a dreadful void is left in their minds and a terrible shook is given to their morals they lose their guide their comfort their hope none but the most cruel and hardhearted of men who had banished all natural tenderness from their minds such as those beings of iron the atheists could bring themselves to any persecution like this strange it is but so it is that men driven by force from their habits in one mode of religion have by contrary habits under the same force often quietly settled in another they suborn their reason to declare in favor of their necessity man and his conscience cannot always be at war if the first races have not been able to make a pacification between the conscience and the convenience their descendants come generally to submit to the violence of the laws without violence to their minds as things stood formerly they possessed a positive scheme of direction and of consolation in this men may acquiesce the harsh methods in use with the old class of persecutors were to make converts not apostates only if they perversely hated other sects and factions they loved their own inordinately but in this protestant persecution there is anything but benevolence at work what do the irish statutes they do not make a conformity to the established religion and to its doctrines and practices the condition of getting out of servitude no such thing let three millions of people but abandon all that they and their ancestors have been taught to believe sacred and to forswear it publicly in terms the most degrading scurrilous and indecent for men of integrity and virtue and to abuse the whole of their former lives and to slander the education they have received and nothing more is required of them there is no system of folly or impiety or blasphemy or atheism into which they may not throw themselves and which they may not profess openly and as a system consistently with the enjoyment of all the privileges of a free citizen in the happiest constitution in the world  some of the unhappy assertors of this strange scheme say they are not persecutors on account of religion in the first place they say what is not true for what else do they disfranchise the people if the man gets rid of a religion through which their malice operates he gets rid of all their penalties and incapacities at once they never afterwards inquire about him i speak here of their pretexts and not of the true spirit of the transaction in which religious bigotry i apprehend has little share every man has his taste but i think if i were so miserable and undone as to be guilty of premeditated and continued violence towards any set of men i had rather that my conduct was supposed to arise from wild conceits concerning their religious advantages than from low and ungenerous motives relative to my own selfish interest i had rather be thought insane in my charity than rational in my malice this much my dear son i have to say of this protestant persecutionthat is a persecution of religion itself  a very great part of the mischiefs that vex the world arises from words people soon forget the meaning but the impression and the passion remain the word protestant is the charm that looks up in the dungeon of servitude three millions of your people it is not amiss to consider this spell of potency this abracadabra that is hung about the necks of the unhappy not to heal but to communicate disease we sometimes hear of a protestant religion frequently of a protestant interest we hear of the latter the most frequently because it has a positive meaning the other has none we hear of it the most frequently because it has a word in the phrase which well or ill understood has animated to persecution and oppression at all times infinitely more than all the dogmas in dispute between religious factions these are indeed well formed to perplex and torment the intellect but not half so well calculated to inflame the passions and animosities of men  i do readily admit that a great deal of the wars seditions and troubles of the world did formerly turn upon the contention between interests that went by the names of protestant and catholic but i imagined that at this time no one was weak enough to believe or impudent enough to pretend that questions of popish and protestant opinions or interest are the things by which men are at present menaced with crusades by foreign invasion or with seditions which shake the foundations of the state at home it is long since all this combination of things has vanished from the view of intelligent observers the existence of quite another system of opinions and interests is now plain to the grossest sense are these the questions that raise a flame in the minds of men at this day if ever the church and the constitution of england should fall in these islands and they will fall together it is not presbyterian discipline nor popish hierarchy that will rise upon their ruins it will not be the church of rome nor the church of scotland not the church of luther nor the church of calvin on the contrary all these churches are menaced and menaced alike it is the new fanatical religion now in the heat of its first ferment of the rights of man which rejects all establishments all discipline all ecclesiastical and in truth all civil order which will triumph and which will lay prostrate your church which will destroy your distinctions and which will put all your properties to auction and disperse you over the earth if the present establishment should fall it is this religion which will triumph in ireland and in england as it has triumphed in france this religion which laughs at creeds and dogmas and confessions of faith may be fomented equally amongst all descriptions and all sectsamongst nominal catholics and amongst nominal churchmen and amongst those dissenters who know little and care less about a presbytery or any of its discipline or any of its doctrine against this new this growing this exterminatory system all these churches have a common concern to defend themselves how the enthusiasts of this rising sect rejoice to see you of the old churches play their game and stir and rake the cinders of animosities sunk in their ashes in order to keep up the execution of their plan for your common ruin  i suppress all that is in my mind about the blindness of those of our clergy who will shut their eyes to a thing which glares in such manifest day if some wretches amongst an indigent and disorderly part of the populace raise a riot about tithes there are of these gentlemen ready to cry out that this is an overt act of a treasonable conspiracy here the bulls and the pardons and the crusade and the pope and the thunders of the vatican are everywhere at work there is a plot to bring in a foreign power to destroy the church alas it is not about popes but about potatoes that the minds of this unhappy people are agitated it is not from the spirit of zeal but the spirit of whiskey that these wretches act is it then not conceived possible that a poor clown can be unwilling after paying three pounds rent to a gentleman in a brown coat to pay fourteen shillings to one in a black coat for his acre of potatoes and tumultuously to desire some modification of the charge without being supposed to have no other motive than a frantic zeal for being thus doubletaxed to another set of landholders and another set of priests have men no selfinterest no avarice no repugnance to public imposts have they no sturdy and restive minds no undisciplined habits is there nothing in the whole mob of irregular passions which might precipitate some of the common people in some places to quarrel with a legal because they feel it to be a burdensome imposition according to these gentlemen no offence can be committed by papists but from zeal to their religion to make room for the vices of papists they clear the house of all the vices of men some of the common people not one however in ten thousand commit disorders well punish them as you do and as you ought to punish them for their violence against the just property of each individual clergyman as each individual suffers support the injured rector or the injured impropriator in the enjoyment of the estate of which whether on the best plan or not the laws have put him in possession let the crime and the punishment stand upon their own bottom but now we ought all of us clergymen most particularly to avoid assigning another cause of quarrel in order to infuse a new source of bitterness into a dispute which personal feelings on both sides will of themselves make bitter enough and thereby involve in it by religious descriptions men who have individually no share whatsoever in those irregular acts let us not make the malignant fictions of our own imaginations heated with factious controversies reasons for keeping men that are neither guilty nor justly suspected of crime in a servitude equally dishonorable and unsafe to religion and to the state when men are constantly accused but know themselves not to be guilty they must naturally abhor their accusers there is no character when malignantly taken up and deliberately pursued which more naturally excites indignation and abhorrence in mankind especially in that part of mankind which suffers from it  i do not pretend to take pride in an extravagant attachment to any sect some gentlemen in ireland affect that sort of glory it is to their taste their piety i take it for granted justifies the fervor of their zeal and may palliate the excess of it being myself no more than a common layman commonly informed in controversies leading only a very common life and having only a common citizens interest in the church or in the state yet to you i will say in justice to my own sentiments that not one of those zealots for a protestant interest wishes more sincerely than i do perhaps not half so sincerely for the support of the established church in both these kingdoms it is a great link towards holding fast the connection of religion with the state and for keeping these two islands in their present critical independence of constitution in a close connection of opinion and affection i wish it well as the religion of the greater number of the primary landproprietors of the kingdom with whom all establishments of church and stats for strong political reasons ought in my opinion to be firmly connected i wish it well because it is more closely combined than any other of the church systems with the crown which is the stay of the mixed constitutionbecause it is as things now stand the sole connecting political principle between the constitutions of the two independent kingdoms i have another and infinitely a stronger reason for wishing it well it is that in the present time i consider it as one of the main pillars of the christian religion itself the body and substance of every religion i regard much more than any of the forms and dogmas of the particular sects its fall would leave a great void which nothing else of which i can form any distinct idea might fill i respect the catholic hierarchy and the presbyterian republic but i know that the hope or the fear of establishing either of them is in these kingdoms equally chimerical even if i preferred one or the other of them to the establishment which certainly i do not  these are some of my reasons for wishing the support of the church of ireland as by law established these reasons are founded as well on the absolute as on the relative situation of that kingdom but is it because i love the church and the king and the privileges of parliament that i am to be ready for any violence or any injustice or any absurdity in the means of supporting any of these powers or all of them together instead of prating about protestant ascendencies protestant parliaments ought in my opinion to think at last of becoming patriot parliaments  the legislature of ireland like all legislatures ought to frame its laws to suit the people and the circumstances of the country and not any longer to make it their whole business to force the nature the temper and the inveterate habits of a nation to a conformity to speculative systems concerning any kind of laws ireland has an established government and a religion legally established which are to be preserved it has a people who are to be preserved too and to be led by reason principle sentiment and interest to acquiesce in that government ireland is a country under peculiar circumstances the people of ireland are a very mixed people and the quantities of the several ingredients in the mixture are very much disproportioned to each other are we to govern this mixed body as if it were composed of the most simple elements comprehending the whole in one system of benevolent legislation or are we not rather to provide for the several parts according to the various and diversified necessities of the heterogeneous nature of the mass would not common reason and common honesty dictate to us the policy of regulating the people in the several descriptions of which they are composed according to the natural ranks and classes of an orderly civil society under a common protecting sovereign and under a form of constitution favorable at once to authority and to freedomsuch as the british constitution boasts to be and such as it is to those who enjoy it  you have an ecclesiastical establishment which though the religion of the prince and of most of the first class of landed proprietors is not the religion of the major part of the inhabitants and which consequently does not answer to them any one purpose of a religious establishment this is a state of things which no man in his senses can call perfectly happy but it is the state of ireland two hundred years of experiment show it to be unalterable many a fierce struggle has passed between the parties the result is you cannot make the people protestants and they cannot shake off a protestant government this is what experience teaches and what all men of sense of all descriptions know today the question is this are we to make the best of this situation which we cannot alter the question is shall the condition of the body of the people be alleviated in other things on account of their necessary suffering from their being subject to the burdens of two religious establishments from one of which they do not partake the least living or dying either of instruction or of consolationor shall it be aggravated by stripping the people thus loaded of everything which might support and indemnify them in this state so as to leave them naked of every sort of right and of every name of franchise to outlaw them from the constitution and to cut off perhaps three millions of plebeian subjects without reference to property or any other qualification from all connection with the popular representation of the kingdom  as to religion it has nothing at all to do with the proceeding liberty is not sacrificed to a zeal for religion but a zeal for religion is pretended and assumed to destroy liberty the catholic religion is completely free it has no establishmentbut it is recognized permitted and in a degree protected by the laws if a man is satisfied to be a slave he may be a papist with perfect impunity he may say mass or hear it as he pleases but he must consider himself as an outlaw from the british constitution if the constitutional liberty of the subject were not the thing aimed at the direct reverse course would be taken the franchise would have been permitted and the mass exterminated but the conscience of a man left and a tenderness for it hypocritically pretended is to make it a trap to catch his liberty  so much is this the design that the violent partisans of this scheme fairly take up all the maxims and arguments as well as the practices by which tyranny has fortified itself at all times trusting wholly in their strength and power and upon this they reckon as always ready to strike wherever they wish to direct the storm they abandon all pretext of the general good of the community they say that if the people under any given modification obtain the smallest portion or particle of constitutional freedom it will be impossible for them to hold their property they tell us that they act only on the defensive they inform the public of europe that their estates are made up of forfeitures and confiscations from the natives that if the body of people obtain votes any number of votes however small it will be a step to the choice of members of their own religion that the house of commons in spite of the influence of nineteen parts in twenty of the landed interest now in their hands will be composed in the whole or in far the major part of papists that this popish house of commons will instantly pass a law to confiscate all their estates which it will not be in their power to save even by entering into that popish party themselves because there are prior claimants to be satisfied that as to the house of lords though neither papists nor protestants have a share in electing them the body of the peerage will be so obliging and disinterested as to fall in with this exterminatory scheme which is to forfeit all their estates the largest part of the kingdom and to crown all that his majesty will give his cheerful assent to this causeless act of attainder of his innocent and faithful protestant subjects that they will be or are to be left without house or land to the dreadful resource of living by their wits out of which they are already frightened by the apprehension of this spoliation with which they are threatened that therefore they cannot so much as listen to any arguments drawn from equity or from national or constitutional policy the sword is at their throats beggary and famine at their door see what it is to have a good lookout and to see danger at the end of a sufficiently long perspective  this is indeed to speak plain though to speak nothing very new the same thing has been said in all times and in all languages the language of tyranny has been invariable the general good is inconsistent with my personal safety justice and liberty seem so alarming to these gentlemen that they are not ashamed even to slander their own titles to calumniate and call in doubt their right to their own estates and to consider themselves as novel disseizors usurpers and intruders rather than lose a pretext for becoming oppressors of their fellowcitizens whom they not i choose to describe themselves as having robbed  instead of putting themselves in this odious point of light one would think they would wish to let time draw his oblivious veil over the unpleasant modes by which lordships and demesnes have been acquired in theirs and almost in all other countries upon earth it might be imagined that when the sufferer if a sufferer exists had forgot the wrong they would be pleased to forget it toothat they would permit the sacred name of possession to stand in the place of the melancholy and unpleasant title of grantees of confiscation which though firm and valid in law surely merits the name that a great roman jurist gave to a title at least as valid in his nation as confiscation would be either in his or in ours tristis et luctuosa successio  such is the situation of every man who comes in upon the ruin of another his succeeding under this circumstance is tristis et luctuosa successio if it had been the fate of any gentleman to profit by the confiscation of his neighbor one would think he would be more disposed to give him a valuable interest under him in his land or to allow him a pension as i understand one worthy person has done without fear or apprehension that his benevolence to a ruined family would be construed into a recognition of the forfeited title the public of england the other day acted in this manner towards lord newburgh a catholic though the estate had been vested by law in the greatest of the public charities they have given him a pension from his confiscation they have gone further in other cases on the last rebellion in 1745 in scotland several forfeitures were incurred they had been disposed of by parliament to certain laudable uses parliament reversed the method which they had adopted in lord newburghs case and in my opinion did better they gave the forfeited estates to the successors of the forfeiting proprietors chargeable in part with the uses is this or anything like this asked in favor of any human creature in ireland it is bounty it is charitywise bounty and politic charity but no man can claim it as a right here no such thing is claimed as right or begged as charity the demand has an object as distant from all considerations of this sort as any two extremes can be the people desire the privileges inseparably annexed since magna charta to the freehold which they have by descent or obtain as the fruits of their industry they call for no mans estate they desire not to be dispossessed of their own  but this melancholy and invidious title is a favorite and like favorites always of the least merit with those who possess every other title upon earth along with it for this purpose they revive the bitter memory of every dissension which has torn to pieces their miserable country for ages after what has passed in 1782 one would not think that decorum to say nothing of policy would permit them to call up by magic charms the grounds reasons and principles of those terrible confiscatory and exterminatory periods they would not set men upon calling from the quiet sleep of death any samuel to ask him by what act of arbitrary monarchs by what inquisitions of corrupted tribunals and tortured jurors by what fictitious tenures invented to dispossess whole unoffending tribes and their chieftains they would not conjure up the ghosts from the ruins of castles and churches to tell for what attempt to struggle for the independence of an irish legislature and to raise armies of volunteers without regular commissions from the crown in support of that independence the estates of the old irish nobility and gentry had been confiscated they would not wantonly call on those phantoms to tell by what english acts of parliament forced upon two reluctant kings the lands of their country were put up to a mean and scandalous auction in every goldsmiths shop in london or chopped to pieces and out into rations to pay the mercenary soldiery of a regicide usurper they would not be so fond of titles under cromwell who if he avenged an irish rebellion against the sovereign authority of the parliament of england had himself rebelled against the very parliament whose sovereignty he asserted full as much as the irish nation which he was sent to subdue and confiscate could rebel against that parliament or could rebel against the king against whom both he and the parliament which he served and which he betrayed had both of them rebelled  the gentlemen who hold the language of the day know perfectly well that the irish in 1641 pretended at least that they did not rise against the king nor in fact did they whatever constructions law might put upon their act but full surely they rebelled against the authority of the parliament of england and they openly professed so to do admitting i have now no time to discuss the matter the enormous and unpardonable magnitude of this their crime they rued it in their persons and in those of their children and their grandchildren even to the fifth and sixth generations admitting then the enormity of this unnatural rebellion in favor of the independence of ireland will it follow that it must be avenged forever will it follow that it must be avenged on thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of those whom they can never trace by the labors of the most subtle metaphysician of the traduction of crimes or the most inquisitive genealogist of proscription to the descendant of any one concerned in that nefarious irish rebellion against the parliament of england  if however you could find out those pedigrees of guilt i do not think the difference would be essential history records many things which ought to make us hate evil actions but neither history nor morals nor policy can teach us to punish innocent men on that account what lesson does the iniquity of prevalent factions read to us it ought to lesson us into an abhorrence of the abuse of our own power in our own day when we hate its excesses so much in other persons and in other times to that school true statesmen ought to be satisfied to leave mankind they ought not to call from the dead all the discussions and litigations which formerly inflamed the furious factions which had torn their country to pieces they ought not to rake into the hideous and abominable things which were done in the turbulent fury of an injured robbed and persecuted people and which were afterwards cruelly revenged in the execution and as outrageously and shamefully exaggerated in the representation in order an hundred and fifty years after to find some color for justifying them in the eternal proscription and civil excommunication of a whole people  let us come to a later period of those confiscations with the memory of which the gentlemen who triumph in the acts of 1782 are so much delighted the irish again rebelled against the english parliament in 1688 and the english parliament again put up to sale the greatest part of their estates i do not presume to defend the irish for this rebellion nor to blame the english parliament for this confiscation the irish it is true did not revolt from king jamess power he threw himself upon their fidelity and they supported him to the best of their feeble power be the crime of that obstinate adherence to an abdicated sovereign against a prince whom the parliaments of ireland and scotland had recognized what it may i do not mean to justify this rebellion more than the former it might however admit some palliation in them in generous minds some small degree of compassion might be excited for an error where they were misled as cicero says to a conqueror quadam specie et similitudine pacis not without a mistaken appearance of duty and for which the guilty have suffered by exile abroad and slavery at home to the extent of their folly or their offence the best calculators compute that ireland lost two hundred thousand of her inhabitants in that struggle if the principle of the english and scottish resistance at the revolution is to be justified as sure i am it is the submission of ireland must be somewhat extenuated for if the irish resisted king william they resisted him on the very same principle that the english and scotch resisted king james the irish catholics must have been the very worst and the most truly unnatural of rebels if they had not supported a prince whom they had seen attacked not for any designs against their religion or their liberties but for an extreme partiality for their sect and who far from trespassing on their liberties and properties secured both them and the independence of their country in much the same manner that we have seen the same things done at the period of 1782i trust the last revolution in ireland  that the irish parliament of king james did in some particulars though feebly imitate the rigor which had been used towards the irish is true enough blamable enough they were for what they had done though under the greatest possible provocation i shall never praise confiscations or counterconfiscations as long as i live when they happen by necessity i shall think the necessity lamentable and odious i shall think that anything done under it ought not to pass into precedent or to be adopted by choice or to produce any of those shocking retaliations which never suffer dissensions to subside least of all would i fix the transitory spirit of civil fury by perpetuating and methodizing it in tyrannic government if it were permitted to argue with power might one not ask these gentlemen whether it would not be more natural instead of wantonly mooting these questions concerning their property as if it were an exercise in law to found it on the solid rock of prescriptionthe soundest the most general and the most recognized title between man and man that is known in municipal or in public jurisprudencea title in which not arbitrary institutions but the eternal order of things gives judgment a title which is not the creature but the master of positive law a title which though not fixed in its term is rooted in its principle in the law of nature itself and is indeed the original ground of all known property for all property in soil will always be traced back to that source and will rest there the miserable natives of ireland who ninetynine in an hundred are tormented with quite other cares and are bowed down to labor for the bread of the hour are not as gentlemen pretend plodding with antiquaries for titles of centuries ago to the estates of the great lords and squires for whom they labor but if they were thinking of the titles which gentlemen labor to beat into their heads where can they bottom their own claims but in a presumption and a proof that these lands had at some time been possessed by their ancestors these gentlemen for they have lawyers amongst them know as well as i that in england we have had always a prescription or limitation as all nations have against each other the crown was excepted but that exception is destroyed and we have lately established a sixty years possession as against the crown all titles terminate in prescriptionin which differently from time in the fabulous instances the son devours the father and the last prescription eats up all the former                                          a  letter  on  the affairs of ireland  1797   dear sirin the reduced state of body and in the dejected state of mind in which i find myself at this very advanced period of my life it is a great consolation to me to know that a cause i ever have had so very near my heart is taken up by a man of your activity and talents  it is very true that your late friend my ever dear and honored son was in the highest degree solicitous about the final event of a business which he also had pursued for a long time with infinite zeal and no small degree of success it was not above half an hour before he left me forever that he spoke with considerable earnestness on this very subject if i had needed any incentives to do my best for freeing the body of my country from the grievances under which they labor this alone would certainly call forth all my endeavors  the person who succeeded to the government of ireland about the time of that afflicting event had been all along of my sentiments and yours upon this subject and far from needing to be stimulated by me that incomparable person and those in whom he strictly confided even went before me in their resolution to pursue the great end of government the satisfaction and concord of the people with whose welfare they were charged i cannot bear to think on the causes by which this great plan of policy so manifestly beneficial to both kingdoms has been defeated  your mistake with regard to me lies in supposing that i did not when his removal was in agitation strongly and personally represent to several of his majestys ministers to whom i could have the most ready access the true state of ireland and the mischiefs which sooner or later must arise from subjecting the mass of the people to the capricious and interested domination of an exceeding small faction and its dependencies  that representation was made the last time or very nearly the last time that i have ever had the honor of seeing those ministers i am so far from having any credit with them on this or any other public matters that i have reason to be certain if it were known that any person in office in ireland from the highest to the lowest were influenced by my opinions and disposed to act upon them such an one would be instantly turned out of his employment yon have formed to my person a flattering yet in truth a very erroneous opinion of my power with those who direct the public measures i never have been directly or indirectly consulted about anything that is done the judgment of the eminent and able persons who conduct public affairs is undoubtedly superior to mine but selfpartiality induces almost every man to defer something to his own nothing is more notorious than that i have the misfortune of thinking that no one capital measure relative to political arrangements and still less that a new military plan for the defence of either kingdom in this arduous war has been taken upon any other principle than such as must conduct us to inevitable ruin  in the state of my mind so discordant with the tone of ministers and still more discordant with the tone of opposition you may judge what degree of weight i am likely to have with either of the parties who divide this kingdomeven though i were endowed with strength of body or were possessed of any active situation in the government which might give success to my endeavors but the fact is since the day of my unspeakable calamity except in the attentions of a very few old and compassionate friends i am totally out of all social intercourse my health has gone down very rapidly and i have been brought hither with very faint hopes of life and enfeebled to such a degree as those who had known me some time ago could scarcely think credible since i came hither my sufferings have been greatly aggravated and my little strength still further reduced so that though i am told the symptoms of my disorder begin to carry a more favorable aspect i pass the far larger part of the twentyfour hours indeed almost the whole either in my bed or lying upon the couch from which i dictate this had you been apprised of this circumstance you could not have expected anything as you seem to do from my active exertions i could do nothing if i was still stronger not even si meus adforet hector  there is no hope for the body of the people of ireland as long as those who are in power with you shall make it the great object of their policy to propagate an opinion on this side of the water that the mass of their countrymen are not to be trusted by their government and that the only hold which england has upon ireland consists in preserving a certain very small number of gentlemen in full possession of a monopoly of that kingdom this system has disgusted many others besides catholics and dissenters  as to those who on your side are in the opposition to government they are composed of persons several of whom i love and revere they have been irritated by a treatment too much for the ordinary patience of mankind to bear into the adoption of schemes which however argumentatively specious would go practically to the inevitable ruin of the kingdom the opposition always connects the emancipation of the catholics with these schemes of reformation indeed it makes the former only a member of the latter project the gentlemen who enforce that opposition are in my opinion playing the game of their adversaries with all their might and there is no third party in ireland nor in england neither to separate things that are in themselves so distincti mean the admitting people to the benefits of the constitution and a change in the form of the constitution itself  as every one knows that a great part of the constitution of the irish house of commons was formed about the year 1614 expressly for bringing that house into a state of dependence and that the new representative was at that time seated and installed by force and violence nothing can be more impolitic than for those who wish the house to stand on its present basis as for one i most sincerely do to make it appear to have kept too much the principle of its first institution and to continue to be as little a virtual as it is an actual representative of the commons it is the degeneracy of such an institution so vicious in its principle that is to be wished for if men have the real benefit of a sympathetic representation none but those who are heated and intoxicated with theory will look for any other this sort of representation my dear sir must wholly depend not on the force with which it is upheld but upon the prudence of those who have influence upon it indeed without some such prudence in the use of authority i do not know at least in the present time how any power can long continue  if it be true that both parties are carrying things to extremities in different ways the object which you and i have in common that is to say the union and concord of our country on the basis of the actual representation without risking those evils which any change in the form of our legislature must inevitably bring on can never be obtained on the part of the catholics that is to say of the body of the people of the kingdom it is a terrible alternative either to submit to the yoke of declared and insulting enemies or to seek a remedy in plunging themselves into the horrors and crimes of that jacobinism which unfortunately is not disagreeable to the principles and inclinations of i am afraid the majority of what we call the protestants of ireland the protestant part of that kingdom is represented by the government itself to be by whole counties in nothing less than open rebellion i am sure that it is everywhere teeming with dangerous conspiracy  i believe it will be found that though the principles of the catholics and the incessant endeavors of their clergy have kept them from being generally infected with the systems of this time yet whenever their situation brings them nearer into contact with the jacobin protestants they are more or less infected with their doctrines  it is a matter for melancholy reflection but i am fully convinced that many persons in ireland would be glad that the catholics should become more and more infected with the jacobin madness in order to furnish new arguments for fortifying them in their monopoly on any other ground it is impossible to account for the late language of your men in power if statesmen let me suppose for argument upon the most solid political principles conceive themselves obliged to resist the wishes of the far more numerous and as things stand not the worse part of the community one would think they would naturally put their refusal as much as possible upon temporary grounds and that they would act towards them in the most conciliatory manner and would talk to them in the most gentle and soothing language for refusal in itself is not a very gracious thing and unfortunately men are very quickly irritated out of their principles nothing is more discouraging to the loyalty of any description of men than to represent to them that their humiliation and subjection make a principal part in the fundamental and invariable policy which regards the conjunction of these two kingdoms this is not the way to give them a warm interest in that conjunction  my poor opinion is that the closest connection between great britain and ireland is essential to the wellbeing i had almost said to the very being of the two kingdoms for that purpose i humbly conceive that the whole of the superior and what i should call imperial politics ought to have its residence here and that ireland locally civilly and commercially independent ought politically to look up to great britain in all matters of peace or of warin all those points to be guided by herand in a word with her to live and to die at bottom ireland has no other choicei mean no other rational choice  i think indeed that great britain would be ruined by the separation of ireland but as there are degrees even in ruin it would fall the most heavily on ireland by such a separation ireland would be the most completely undone country in the worldthe most wretched the most distracted and in the end the most desolate part of the habitable globe little do many people in ireland consider how much of its prosperity has been owing to and still depends upon its intimate connection with this kingdom but more sensible of this great truth than perhaps any other man i have never conceived or can conceive that the connection is strengthened by making the major part of the inhabitants of your country believe that their ease and their satisfaction and their equalization with the rest of their fellowsubjects of ireland are things adverse to the principles of that connectionor that their subjection to a small monopolizing junto composed of one of the smallest of their own internal factions is the very condition upon which the harmony of the two kingdoms essentially depends i was sorry to hear that this principle or something not unlike it was publicly and fully avowed by persons of great rank and authority in the house of lords in ireland  as to a participation on the part of the catholics in the privileges and capacities which are withheld without meaning wholly to depreciate their importance if i had the honor of being an irish catholic i should be content to expect satisfaction upon that subject with patience until the minds of my adversaries few but powerful were come to a proper temper because if the catholics did enjoy without fraud chicane or partiality some fair portion of those advantages which the law even as now the law is leaves open to them and if the rod were not shaken over them at every turn their present condition would be tolerable as compared with their former condition it would be happy but the most favorable laws can do very little towards the happiness of a people when the disposition of the ruling power is adverse to them men do not live upon blotted paper the favorable or the hostile mind of the ruling power is of far more importance to mankind for good or evil than the blackletter of any statute late acts of parliament whilst they fixed at least a temporary bar to the hopes and progress of the larger description of the nation opened to them certain subordinate objects of equality but it is impossible that the people should imagine that any fair measure of advantage is intended to them when they hear the laws by which they were admitted to this limited qualification publicly reprobated as excessive and inconsiderate they must think that there is a hankering after the old penal and persecuting code their alarm must be great when that declaration is made by a person in very high and important office in the house of commons and as the very first specimen and auspice of a new government  all this is very unfortunate i have the honor of an old acquaintance and entertain in common with you a very high esteem for the few english persons who are concerned in the government of ireland but i am not ignorant of the relation these transitory ministers bear to the more settled irish part of your administration it is a delicate topic upon which i wish to say but little though my reflections upon it are many and serious there is a great cry against english influence i am quite sure that it is irish influence that dreads the english habits  great disorders have long prevailed in ireland it is not long since that the catholics were the suffering party from those disorders i am sure they were not protected as the case required their sufferings became a matter of discussion in parliament it produced the most infuriated declamation against them that i have ever read an inquiry was moved into the facts the declamation was at least tolerated if not approved the inquiry was absolutely rejected in that case what is left for those who are abandoned by government but to join with the persons who are capable of injuring them or protecting them as they oppose or concur in their designs this will produce a very fatal kind of union amongst the people but it is an union which an unequal administration of justice tends necessarily to produce  if anything could astonish one at this time it is the war that the rulers in ireland think it proper to carry on against the person whom they call the pope and against all his adherents whenever they think they have the power of manifesting their hostility without in the least derogating from the talents of your theological politicians or from the military abilities of your commanders who act on the same principles in ireland and without derogating from the zeal of either it appears to me that the protestant directory of paris as statesmen and the protestant hero buonaparte as a general have done more to destroy the said pope and all his adherents in all their capacities than the junto in ireland have ever been able to effect you must submit your fasces to theirs and at best be contented to follow with songs of gratulation or invectives according to your humor the triumphal car of those great conquerors had that true protestant hoche with an army not infected with the slightest tincture of popery made good his landing in ireland he would have saved you from a great deal of the trouble which is taken to keep under a description of your fellowcitizens obnoxious to you from their religion it would not have a months existence supposing his success this is the alliance which under the appearance of hostility we act as if we wished to promote all is well provided we are safe from popery  it was not necessary for you my dear sir to explain yourself to me in justification of your good wishes to your fellowcitizens concerning your total alienation from the principles of the catholics i am more concerned in what we agree than in what we differ you know the impossibility of our forming any judgment upon the opinions religious moral or political of those who in the largest sense are called protestantsat least as these opinions and tenets form a qualification for holding any civil judicial military or even ecclesiastical situation i have no doubt of the orthodox opinion of many both of the clergy and laity professing the established religion in ireland and of many even amongst the dissenters relative to the great points of the christian faith but that orthodoxy concerns them only as individuals as a qualification for employment we all know that in ireland it is not necessary that they should profess any religion at all so that the war that we make is upon certain theological tenets about which scholastic disputes are carried on æquo marte by controvertists on their side as able and as learned and perhaps as wellintentioned as those are who fight the battle on the other part to them i would leave those controversies i would turn my mind to what is more within its competence and has been more my study though for a man of the world i have thought of those thingsi mean the moral civil and political good of the countries we belong to and in which god has appointed your station and mine let every man be as pious as he pleases and in the way that he pleases but it is agreeable neither to piety nor to policy to give exclusively all manner of civil privileges and advantages to a negative religion such is the protestant without a certain creed and at the same time to deny those privileges to men whom we know to agree to an iota in every one positive doctrine which all of us who profess the religion authoritatively taught in england hold ourselves according to our faculties bound to believe the catholics of ireland as i have said have the whole of our positive religion our difference is only a negation of certain tenets of theirs if we strip ourselves of that part of catholicism we abjure christianity if we drive them from that holding without engaging them in some other positive religion which you know by our qualifying laws we do not what do we better than to hold out to them terrors on the one side and bounties on the other in favor of that which for anything we know to the contrary may be pure atheism  you are well aware that when a man renounces the roman religion there is no civil inconvenience or incapacity whatsoever which shall hinder him from joining any new or old sect of dissenters or of forming a sect of his own invention upon the most antichristian principles let mr thomas paine obtain a pardon as on change of ministry he may there is nothing to hinder him from setting up a church of his own in the very midst of you he is a naturalborn british subject his french citizenship does not disqualify him at least upon a peace this protestant apostle is as much above all suspicion of popery as the greatest and most zealous of your sanhedrim in ireland can possibly be on purchasing a qualification which his friends of the directory are not so poor as to be unable to effect he may sit in parliament and there is no doubt that there is not one of your tests against popery that he will not take as fairly and as much ex animo as the best of your zealot statesmen i push this point no further and only adduce this example a pretty strong one and fully in point to show what i take to be the madness and folly of driving men under the existing circumstances from any positive religion whatever into the irreligion of the times and its sure concomitant principles of anarchy  when religion is brought into a question of civil and political arrangement it must be considered more politically than theologically at least by us who are nothing more than mere laymen in that light the case of the catholics of ireland is peculiarly hard whether they be laity or clergy if any of them take part like the gentleman you mention with some of the most accredited protestants of the country in projects which cannot be more abhorrent to your nature and disposition than they are to minein that case however few these catholic factions who are united with factious protestants may be and very few they are now whatever shortly they may become on their account the whole body is considered as of suspected fidelity to the crown and as wholly undeserving of its favor but if on the contrary in those districts of the kingdom where their numbers are the greatest where they make in a manner the whole body of the people as out of cities in three fourths of the kingdom they do these catholics show every mark of loyalty and zeal in support of the government which at best looks on them with an evil eye then their very loyalty is turned against their claims they are represented as a contented and happy people and that it is unnecessary to do anything more in their favor thus the factious disposition of a few among the catholics and the loyalty of the whole mass are equally assigned as reasons for not putting them on a par with those protestants who are asserted by the government itself which frowns upon papists to be in a state of nothing short of actual rebellion and in a strong disposition to make common cause with the worst foreign enemy that these countries have ever had to deal with what in the end can come of all this  as to the irish catholic clergy their condition is likewise most critical if they endeavor by their influence to keep a dissatisfied laity in quiet they are in danger of losing the little credit they possess by being considered as the instruments of a government adverse to the civil interests of their flock if they let things take their course they will be represented as colluding with sedition or at least tacitly encouraging it if they remonstrate against persecution they propagate rebellion whilst government publicly avows hostility to that people as a part of a regular system there is no road they can take which does not lead to their ruin  if nothing can be done on your side of the water i promise you that nothing will be done here whether in reality or only in appearance i cannot positively determine but you will be left to yourselves by the ruling powers here it is thus ostensibly and aboveboard and in part i believe the disposition is real as to the people at large in this country i am sure they have no disposition to intermeddle in your affairs they mean you no ill whatever and they are too ignorant of the state of your affairs to be able to do you any good whatever opinion they have on your subject is very faint and indistinct and if there is anything like a formed notion even that amounts to no more than a sort of humming that remains on their ears of the burden of the old song about popery poor souls they are to be pitied who think of nothing but dangers long passed by and but little of the perils that actually surround them                                       i have been long but it is almost a necessary consequence of dictating and that by snatches as a relief from pain gives me the means of expressing my sentiments they can have little weight as coming from me and i have not power enough of mind or body to bring them out with their natural force but i do not wish to have it concealed that i am of the same opinion to my last breath which i entertained when my faculties were at the best and i have not held back from men in power in this kingdom to whom i have very good wishes any part of my sentiments on this melancholy subject so long as i had means of access to persons of their consideration  i have the honor to be c     end of vol vi
