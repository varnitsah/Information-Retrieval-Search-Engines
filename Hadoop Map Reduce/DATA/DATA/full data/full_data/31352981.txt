the midshipman  the first day of term cannot be considered a cheerful occasion as the boys arrive on the previous evening they have so much to tell each other are so full of what they have been doing that the chatter and laughter are as great as upon the night preceding the breakingup in the morning however all this is changed as they take their places at their desks and open their books a dull heavy feeling takes possession of the boys and the full consciousness that they are at the beginning of another half years work weighs heavily on their minds  it is true enough that the half year will have its play too its matches with their rivalry and excitement but at present it is the long routine of lessons which is most prominent in the minds of the lads who are sitting on the long benches of the kings school canterbury  as a whole however these have not great reason for sadness not more than a third of them are boarders and the rest who have in truth for the last week begun to be tired of their holidays will when they once get out of school and begin to choose sides for football be really glad that the term has again commenced  so your brother is not coming back again archer one of the boys said to a lad of some fifteen years old a merry curlyhaired fellow somewhat short for his age but squareshouldered and sturdy  no he is expecting in another six months to get his commission and is going up to town to study with a coach my father has lodged the money for him and hopes to get him gazetted to his old regiment the 33d  what is he going to a coach for there is no examination is there and if there was i should think he could pass it he has been in the sixth for the last year  oh he is all right enough archer said but my father is sending him to an army man to get up military drawing and fortification dad says it is of no use his going on grinding here at greek and latin and that he had much better spend the time till he gets his commission in learning something that may be of use to him i wish i had done with latin and greek too im sure theyll never be of any use to me and i hate them  at this moment the conversation between the boys was abruptly broken off by archer being called up by the class master  archer he said looking up from the papers on the desk before him these verses are disgraceful of all in the holiday tasks sent in yours appears to me to be the worst  im very sorry sir jack archer said i really tried hard to do them but somehow or other the quantities never will come right  i dont know what you call trying hard archer but its utterly impossible if you had taken the trouble to look the words out in the gradus that you could have made such mistakes as those here  i dont know sir jack answered i can do exercises and translations and all that sort of thing well enough but i always break down with verses and i dont see what good they are except for fellows who want to write latin verses for tombstones  that has nothing to do with it the master said and i am not going to discuss the utility of verses with you i shall report you to dr wallace and if you will not work in your holidays you will have to do so in your playhours  jack retired to his seat and for the next ten minutes indulged in a diatribe against classical learning in general and hexameters and pentameters in particular  presently one of the sixth form came down to where jack was sitting  archer dr wallace wants you  oh lord jack groaned now im in for it i havent seen marshall get out of his seat i suppose he has written a report about those beastly verses  the greeting of dr wallace was however of a different nature from that which he had anticipated  archer he said i have just received a note from your father you are to go home at once  jack archer opened his eyes in astonishment it was but an hour and a half since he had started from harbledown a mile or so distant from the school his father had said nothing at breakfast and what on earth could he want him home again for  with a mechanical yes sir he returned to his place gathered up his books hastily together fastening them with a strap and was soon on his way home at a rapid trot he overtook ere long the servant who had brought the notean old soldier who had been major archers servant in the army  what is the matter jones is any one ill at home  no sir no one is ill as i knows of the major called me into his study and told me to take a note to dr wallace and of course i asked the master no questions  no jack said i dont suppose you did jones i dont suppose youd ask any questions if you were told to take a letter straight to the man in the moon i wonder what it can mean  and continuing his run he soon left the steadygoing old soldier far behind up high street under the great gate along through the wide straggling street beyond into the open country and then across through the fields to harbledown jack never paused till hot and panting he entered the gate  his father and his elder brother who had seen him coming across the fields were standing in the porch  hurrah jack the latter shouted youre going to be first out after all  going to be first out jack gasped what on earth do you mean harry  come into the parlor jack his father said and you shall hear all about it  here his mother and two sisters were sitting  my dear boy the former said rising and throwing her arms round his neck this is sudden indeed  what is sudden mother what is sudden jack asked what is it all about and noticing a tear on his mothers cheek he went on it cant be those beastly verses is it the subject most upon his mind being prominent but no it couldnt be that even if wallace took it into his head to make a row about them there would not be time but what is it mother  sit down jack his father said you know my boy you have always said that you would like to go to sea i had no interest that way but six months ago i wrote to my nephew charles who is as you know a first lieutenant in the navy and asked him if he thought he could get you a midshipmans berth he wrote back to say that he was at present on half pay and feared it would be a long time before he was afloat again as there were but few ships in commission and he had not much interest but if he were appointed he might be able to get you a berth on board the ship as that didnt seem very hopeful i thought it better to say nothing to you about it however this morning just after you had started for school the postman brought a letter from him saying that owing to the threatening state of affairs in the east a number of ships were being rapidly put in commission and that he had been appointed to the falcon and had seen the captain and as the latter who happened to be an old friend of his had no one in particular whom he wished to oblige he had kindly asked the admiralty for a midshipmans appointment for you this he had of course obtained the falcon is being fitted out with all haste and you are to join at once so i shall take you to portsmouth tomorrow  jack was too much delighted and surprised to be able to speak at first but after a minute or two he recovered his breath uttered a loud hurrah of delight and then gave vent to his feelings by exuberantly kissing his mother and sisters  this is glorious he said only to think that i who have just been blown up for my verses am a midshipman in her majestys service i can hardly believe that it is true oh father i have so wished to go to sea but i have never said much about it because i thought you did not like it and now to think of my getting it when i had quite given up all hope and just at a time too when there seems to be a chance of a row what is it all about father i have heard you say something about a dispute with russia but i never gave much attention to it  the cause of the dispute is trumpery enough and in itself wholly insufficient to cause a war between two great nations it began by a squabble about the holy places at jerusalem as to the rights of the greek and latin pilgrims respectively  but what have we got to do with either the latin or the greek pilgrims jack asked i should have thought that we were quite bothered enough with latin and greek verses without having anything to do with pilgrims besides i didnt know there were any latins now and the greeks aint much  major archer smiled  the latin pilgrims are the members of the countries which profess the roman catholic religion while the greeks are those who profess the religion of the greek church that is to say in the present case principally russians there have for years been squabbles swelling sometimes into serious tumults between the pilgrims of these creeds the matter being generally complicated by the interference of the turkish authorities with them the russian government has been endeavoring to obtain from turkey the protectorate of all christians in her dominions which france as the leading catholic country naturally objects to all this however is only a pretext the real fact is that russia who has for centuries been casting a longing eye upon turkey thinks that the time has arrived when she can carry out her ambitious designs it has always been our policy upon the other hand to sustain turkey we have large interests in the mediterranean and a considerable trade with the levant and were russia to extend her dominion to constantinople our position would be seriously menaced moreover and this perhaps is the principal point it is absolutely necessary for us in the future to be dominant in the east of the mediterranean egypt is rapidly becoming our highway to india and many men think that in the future our trade with that great dependency will flow down the valley of the euphrates consequently it is necessary to prevent russia at any cost obtaining a footing south of the black sea  and do you think father that there will really be a war  im inclined to think that there will be jack although this is not the popular opinion we have so long in england been talking about the iniquity of war that i believe that the emperor nicholas has persuaded himself that we will not fight at any price in this i am sure that he is wholly mistaken so long as there was no probability of war the people of england have quietly permitted the cheeseparing politicians who govern us to cut down the army and navy to a point when we can hardly be said to have an army at all but i am convinced that the people of england are at heart as warlike as of old few nations have done more fighting than we and roughly speaking the wars have always been popular if the people at large once become convinced that the honor and interest of england are at stake they will go to war and the politicians in power will have to follow the popular current or give way to men who will do so at present however the general idea is that a demonstration upon the part of england and france will be sufficient to prevent russia from taking any further steps i think myself that russia has gone too far to draw back russia is a country where the czars are nominally allpowerful but where in point of fact they are as much bound as other sovereigns to follow the wishes of the country the conquest of constantinople has long been the dream of every russian and now that the czar has held out hopes that this dream is about to be realized he will scarcely like to draw back  but surely father harry archer said russia cannot think herself a match for england and france united  i dont know that my boy russia has an enormous population far larger than that of england and france united every man from the highest to the lowest is at the disposal of the czar and there is scarcely any limit to the force which he is capable of putting into the field russia has not fought since the days of napoleon and in those days the russian troops showed themselves to be as good as any in europe at borodino and smolensko they were barely defeated after inflicting enormous losses on the emperors army and as in the end they annihilated the largest army even napoleon had ever got together they may well think that fighting close to their own borders while england and france have to take their troops across europe they will be more than a match for us and now jack we must go down to the town there is much to do and to think about the principal part of your outfit i shall of course get at portsmouth where the tailors are accustomed to work at high pressure but your underclothes we can get here now my dear if you will go upstairs and look through jacks things and let me know exactly how he stands i will go down with him to the town and get anything he requires  and will you be able to spare me for a quarterofanhour father i should like to be outside the school when they come out at one oclock to say goodbye to them wont they be surprised and jolly envious oh no i should think not they would give their ears some of them i know to be in my place i should like to say goodbye too to old marshall his face will be a picture when he finds that he is not going to drop on me for those verses after all  it was a day of bustle and business and jack until the very moment when he was embracing his weeping mother and sisters while his father stood at the door in front of which was the ponychaise which was waiting to take him down to the station could hardly realize that it was all true that his schooldays were over and that he was really a midshipman in her majestys service  harry had already gone to the station on foot as the back seat in the ponychaise was occupied by jacks luggage and the last words that he said as he shook hands with his brother were  i shouldnt be surprised old boy if we were to meet in the east before long if anything comes of it they will have to increase the strength of the army as well as of the navy and it will be bad luck indeed if the 33d is left behind  on arriving at portsmouth major archer took up his quarters at the famous george inn and leaving their luggage there was soon on his way down to the hard half a century had gone by since portsmouth had exhibited such a scene of life and bustle large numbers of extra hands had been taken on at the dockyards and the fitters and riggers labored night and day hastening on the vessels just put into commission the bakeries were at work turning out biscuits as fast as they could be made and the stores were crammed to repletion with commissariat and other stores in addition to the ships of war several large merchant steamers taken up as transports lay alongside the wharves and an unusual force of military were concentrated in the town ready for departure by the hard were a number of boats from the various menofwar lying in the harbor or off spithead whose officers were ashore upon various duties huge dockyard barges piled with casks and stores were being towed alongside the ships of war and the bustle and life of the scene were delightful indeed to jack accustomed only to the quiet sleepiness of a cathedral town like canterbury inquiring which was the falcon a paddle steamer moored in the stream was pointed out to them by a boatman  oh dear jack said she looks small in comparison with those big menofwar  she is none the worse jack for that his father said if there should be fighting it will scarcely be at sea the russian fleet will not venture to engage the fleets of england and france united and you are likely to see much more active work in a vessel like the falcon than in one of those floating castles hullo charles is that you he broke off lying his hand upon the shoulder of a naval officer who was pushing his way though the crowd of boatmen and sailors to a manofwar gig which with many others was lying by the hard  hullo uncle is that you he replied i am glad to see you i was expecting you here in a day or so i thought you would run down with the youngster well jack how are you why it must be eight years since i saw you you were quite a little chap then well are you thinking of thrashing the russians  the boy is half out of his mind with pleasure charles major archer said and he and all of us are greatly obliged to you for your kindness in getting him his berth i think you will find him active and intelligent though i fear he has not shone greatly at school especially he said smiling in his latin verses  he will make none the worse sailor for that charles hethcote said with a laugh but i must be going on board i have a message from the admiral to the captain and every moment is precious for things are terribly behindhand the dockyard people are wellnigh out of their wits with the pressure put upon them and we are ordered to be ready to sail in a week how its all to be done goodness only knows you need not come on board jack i will tell the captain that you have arrived and he would not thank me for bringing any live lumber on board just at present you had better get him his outfit uncle at once and then he can report himself in full trim tomorrow  giving the major the address of the tailor who could be trusted to supply jacks uniform without loss of time and accepting an invitation to dine at the george that evening if he could possibly get away from the ship lieutenant hethcote stepped into the gig and made his way to the falcon  major archer and jack first paid a visit to the tailor where all the articles necessary for the outfit were ordered and promised for next day they then visited the dockyard and jack was immensely impressed at the magnitude of the preparations which were being made for the war then they strolled down the ramparts and stood for some time watching the batches of recruits being drilled and then as the short winter day was drawing to a close they returned to the george     chapter ii   an adventure at gib  it was on the 1st of february 1854 that the falcon sailed from portsmouth for the east and ten days later she dropped her anchor at gibraltar harbor jack archer was by this time thoroughly at home in the weeks hard work during the preparation for sea at portsmouth he had learned as much of the names of the ropes and the various parts of the ship as he would have done in a couple of months at sea and had become acquainted with his new shipmates so great had been the pressure of work that he had escaped much of the practical joking to which a newcomer on board ship as at school is generally subject  he had for comrades four midshipmen one of these simmons had already nearly served his time and was looking forward to the war as giving him a sure promotion two others delafield and hawtry had already served for two or three years at sea although only a year or so older than jack while the fourth herbert coveney was a year younger and was like jack a new hand there were also in the berth two masters mates young men of from twenty to twoandtwenty with all of these jack with his high spirits goodtempered face merry laugh soon became a favorite  during the first two days at sea he had suffered the usual agonies from seasickness but before reaching gibraltar he had got his sealegs and was regularly doing duty being on the watch of the second lieutenant mr pierson  the wind which had blown strongly across the bay of biscay and down the coast of portugal moderated as the falcon steamed past cape st vincent with its picturesque monastery and the straits were calm as a millpond as she slowly made her way along the spanish coast and passed tarifa up to the time when she dropped her anchor in the bay of gibraltar the only incident which had happened on the way was that as they steamed up the straits they passed close by a homewardbound p and o steamer whose passengers crowded the sides and cheered and waved their handkerchiefs to the eastwardbound ship  the falcon was not a fast vessel seldom making under favorable circumstances more than eight knots an hour she carried sixteen guns twelve of which were eighteenpounders it had been intended that the falcon should only stay a few hours at gibraltar proceeding immediately she had taken in a fresh supply of coal the engineers however reported several defects in her machinery which would take three or four days to put in order  jack was pleased at the delay as he was anxious to set his foot for the first time ashore in a foreign country and to visit the famous fortifications of the rock the first day he did not ask for leave as he did not wish to presume upon his being the first lieutenants relation  charles hethcote differed widely from the typical first lieutenant of fiction a being as stiff as a ramrod and as dangerous to approach as a polar bear he was indeed a bright cheery fellow and although he was obliged to surround himself with a certain amount of official stiffness he was a great favorite among officers and crew  it was not till the third day of his stay that jack his seniors having all been ashore asked for leave which was at once granted young coveney too had landed on the previous day and hawtry whom jack was inclined to like most of his shipmates now accompanied him they had leave for the whole day and as soon as breakfast was over they went ashore  what a rum old place hawtry said as they wandered along the principal street it looks as spanish as ever who would have thought that it had been an english town for goodness knows how long  i wish i had paid a little more attention to history jack said it makes one feel like a fool not to know such things as that when one comes to a famous place like this look at that tall fellow with the two little donkeys poor little brutes they can scarcely stagger under their loads there is a pretty girl with that black thing over her head a mantilla dont they call it there is a woman with oranges lets get some now i suppose the first thing is to climb up to the top of the rock  with their pockets full of oranges the boys started on their climb which was accomplished in capital time from the flagstaff they enjoyed the magnificent view of the african coast across the straits of spain stretching away to their right of the broad expanse of the blue mediterranean and of the bay with its ships and the falcon dwarfed to the dimensions of a toy vessel at their feet then they came down paid a flying visit to the various fortifications and to the galleries whence the guns peer out threateningly across the low sandy spit known as the neutral ground  when all this was finished it was only natural that they should go to the principal hotel and eat a prodigious luncheon and then hawtry proposed that they should sally out for a ramble into spain  they had been disappointed in the oranges which they found in no way better than those which they had bought in england but they thought that if they could pick them off the trees they must somehow have a superior flavor accordingly they sallied out by the land gate passed unquestioned through the line of british sentries and were soon in the little village inside the spanish lines  its awfully hot hawtry said mopping his forehead who would have thought that it would have been so hot as this in any place in europe in the middle of february just fancy what it must be here in july look there is a fellow with two mules i expect he would let them i vote we go for a ride its too hot for walking altogether  i say old boy he said approaching a tall and powerfullybuilt man who was smoking a cigar and leaning lazily against one of his mules you let mules we hire them eh  the spaniard opened his eyes somewhat but made no reply and continued to smoke tranquilly  oh nonsense hawtry said look here  and he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out some silver then he made signs of mounting one of the mules and waved his hand over the surrounding country to signify that he wanted a general ride  the spaniard nodded held up five fingers and touched one of the mules and did the same with the other  he wants five shillings a head hawtry said  i dont know jack said doubtfully i dont suppose he knows much about shillings it may be five dollars or five anything else wed better show him five shillings and come to an understanding that that is what he means before we get on  the spaniard on being shown the five shillings shook his head and pointing to a dollar which they had obtained in change on shore signified that these were the coins he desired  oh nonsense hawtry said indignantly you dont suppose were such fools as to give you a pound apiece for two or three hours ride on those mules of yours come on jack we wont put up with being swindled like that  so saying the two lads turned away and started on their walk  while they were speaking to the spaniard he had been joined by one of his countrymen and when they turned away these entered into a rapid conversation together the result was that before the boys had gone thirty yards the spaniard with the mules called them back again and intimated that he accepted their terms  they were about to jump up at once but the man signed to them to stop and his companion in a minute or two had brought out two rough rugs which were secured with some cords over the wooden saddles  thats an improvement jack said i was just wondering how we were going to sit on those things which are not saddles at all but only things for boxes and barrels to be fastened to  i wonder which way wed better go hawtry said as he climbed up with some difficulty aided by the spaniard on to one of the mules my goodness jack this is horribly uncomfortable i never can stand this hi there help me down it would be better a hundred times to ride barebacked  accordingly the saddles were taken off the rugs folded and secured on the animals backs by a rope passed round them and then the boys again took their seats  i hope the brutes are quiet jack said for i am nothing of a rider at the best of times and one feels an awful height at the top of these great mules with ones legs dangling without stirrups  if you find yourself going jack hawtry said the best thing is to catch hold of his ears come on lets get out of this all the village is staring at us  the mules upon the reins being jerked and boys heels briskly applied to their ribs moved on at a fast walk  we shall have to stop under a tree and cut a stick presently hawtry said it will not do to get down for i should never be able to climb up again mind we must take our bearings carefully else we shall never get back again we have neither chart nor compass hallo here comes the mules master  they had by this time gone two or three hundred yards from the village and behind them at a brisk trot seated on a diminutive donkey was the spaniard  perhaps its best he should come jack said there will be no fear of being lost then and if one of us gets capsized he can help him up again  upon the spaniard coming up to them he gave a sharp shout to the mules at the same time striking the donkey on which he rode with a stick instantly the mules recognizing the signal started into a sharp trot the first effect of which was to tumble hawtry from his seat into the road jack with difficulty saving himself by clutching wildly at the mane  confound it hawtry exclaimed furiously as he regained his feet to the spaniard why didnt you say what you were going to be up to starting the ship ahead at full speed without notice i believe ive broken some of my ribs dont you laugh too soon jack it will be your turn next  the spaniard helped hawtry to regain his seat and they were soon clattering along the dusty road at a brisk rate the boys quickly getting accustomed to the pace which indeed was smooth and easy for hours they rode on sometimes trotting sometimes walking taking no heed whither they were going and enjoying the novelty of the ride the high cactus hedges the strange vegetation little villages here and there sometimes embowered in orange trees and paying no heed to time  presently jack exclaimed  i say hawtry it must be getting late we have been winding and turning about and i have not an idea how far we are now from gib we must be through the gates by gunfire you know  they stopped and by pantomime explained to the spaniard that they wanted to get back again as soon as possible  he nodded made a circle with his arm and as they understood explained that they were making a circuit and would arrive ere long at their startingplace  for another hour and a half they rode along chatting gayly  i say jack hawtry exclaimed suddenly why theres the sun pretty nearly down and here we are among the hills in a lonelier looking place than we have come to yet i dont believe were anywhere near gib i say old fellow it strikes me were getting into a beastly mess what on earths to be done  they checked their mules and looked at each other  what can the spaniards game be hawtry weve had a good five shillings worth  let us take our own bearings hawtry said the sun now is nearly on our left well of course that is somewhere about westsouwest so we must be going northward i dont think that can be right im sure it cant look here you fellow there is the sun setting thereand he pointed to itgibraltar must lie somewhere over there and thats the way we mean to go  the spaniard looked surly then he pointed to the road ahead and indicated that it bent round the next spur of the hill and made a detour in the direction in which hawtry indicated that gibraltar must lie  what on earth shall we do jack if this fellow means mischief we are in an awkward fix i dont suppose he intends to attack us because we with our dirks would be a match for him with that long knife of his but if he means anything he has probably got some other fellows with him  then hadnt we better go in for him at once jack said before he gets any one to help him  hawtry laughed  we can hardly jump off our mules and attack him without any specific reason we might get the worst of it and even if we didnt how should we get back again and how should we account for having killed our muledriver no whatever we are in for we must go through with it now jack let us look as though we trusted him  so saying they continued on the road by which they had previously travelled  i dont believe hawtry said after a short silence that they can have any idea of cutting our throats midshipmen are not in the habit of carrying much money about with them but i have heard of guerillas carrying people off to the mountains and getting ransoms there we are at the place where that fellow said the road turned it doesnt turn now i vote we both get off our mules and decline to go a step farther  all right jack said i shall know a good deal better what i am doing on my feet than i shall perched up here  the two boys at once slid off their mules to the ground  there is no turning there hawtry said turning to the hill you have deceived us and we wont go a foot farther and turning the lads started to walk back along the road they had come  the spaniard leapt from his donkey and with angry gesticulation endeavored to arrest them finding that they heeded not his orders he put his hand on his knife but in a moment the boys dirks flashed in the air  now my lad hawtry said two can play at that game and if you draw that knife well let daylight into you  the spaniard hesitated then drew back and gave a loud shrill whistle which was the boys fancied answered in the distance  come on jack we must run for it we can leave this lumbering spaniard behind i have no doubt and sheathing their dirks the boys set off at full speed  the spaniard appeared inclined to follow them but distrusting his powers he paused gave a long shrill whistle twice repeated and then mounted his donkey and driving the mules before him he followed the boys at a hand gallop  they had however a good start and maintained their advantage  i dont think jack said we have passed a village for the last hour when we get to one wed better rush into a house and ask for shelter these fellows will hardly dare to touch us there  had the race been simply between the boys and their immediate pursuer it is probable that they would have won it for they were light active and in good condition while the animals behind them had already been travelling for five hours at a rate considerably above the speed to which they were accustomed the road however was an exceedingly winding one which gave time to the confederates of the muledriver to make a short cut and as the boys turned a sharp corner they saw three men barring the road in front  its all up jack hawtry said pausing in his run its no use making any resistance we should only get our throats cut straight off  jack agreed and they walked up to the men in front just as the muleteer came galloping up with his troupe  what do you want with us hawtry said advancing to the men  there was a volley of maledictions at the run they had given them the boys were seized by the collar their dirks watches and money roughly taken from them their arms tied to their sides by the ropes taken from the mules and they were motioned to accompany their captors these at once left the road and struck up the hill the muleteer proceeding along the road with the animals  with their arms tied the boys found it hard work to keep up with their captors who strode along with long steps the sun had by this time sunk and presently they heard the distant boom of the sunset gun from gibraltar  that gun must be fifteen miles away hawtry said what fools we have been jack to be sure  in one of the three men who accompanied them they recognized the peasant who had spoken to the muleteer when he refused to accept their first offer and they had no doubt that he had arranged with the man to lead them to a certain spot to which he had proceeded direct while their guide had conducted them by a circuitous route  they walked for four hours without a pause ever ascending among the hills until they at last reached a sort of plateau upon which some six or eight men were gathered round a fire upon three sides the hill rose abruptly on the fourth the ground sloped away and in front seemingly almost at their feet some 2000 feet below them stretched away the waters of the mediterranean sparkling in the moonlight  they have got something to eat that smells nice jack said as they approached the fire i hope to goodness they are going to give us some i feel awfully peckish  the men gathered round the fire rose at the approach of the newcomers and an animated conversation took place then the boys were motioned to sit down and the rest threw themselves round the fire some meat which was roasting on a rough spit over it was taken off and one of the men undid the cords which tied their arms and a share of the meat was given them  this is stunning jack said what on earth is it it does not taste to me like mutton or beef or pork or veal  i fancy its kid hawtry said well it is evident they have no idea of cutting our throats if they had been going to do that they would have done it a quarter of a mile after we left the road i suppose they are going to try to get a ransom for us where its coming from as far as im concerned i dont know for my father is a clergyman and has as much as he can do to make ends meet for there are eight of us and im the eldest  its an awful fix altogether jack said and anyhow we shall lose our ship and get into a frightful row and if somebody wont pay our ransom i suppose they will knock us on the head finally the best thing you know will be for us to make our escape  but how on earth are we to do that hawtry said there are ten of them and i see a lot of guns piled there  oh i daresay we shall see some chance jack said cheerfully we must think it over jack easy peter simple and all those fellows used to get into worse scrapes than this and they always managed to get out of them somehow so why shouldnt we the best thing is just to think what one of them would have done if he had been in our place i wish to goodness that we had mesty prowling about somewhere he would get us out in no time  hawtry answered with a grunt and devoted himself to his kid presently jack spoke again  look here hawtry i vote that to begin with we both pretend to be in an awful funk if they think that we are only two frightened boys they wont keep as sharp a watch over us as if they thought we were determined fellows likely to attempt our escape there is the sea down there in front of us and there are sure to be villages on the coast therefore we shall know which way to go if we once manage to escape and if we can get down there we can either claim the protection of the head man in the village or we can take a boat and make off to sea  when the meal was over one of the men who appeared to be the leader rose and come to the boys pointing to himself he said pedro to another sancho to a third garcia  he wants to know our names jack said and pointing to his companion he said hawtry and to himself archer  the spaniard nodded and resumed his seat when an animated conversation took place jack in the meantime began to enact the part which he had arranged turning over upon his face and at times making a loud sobbing noise  hawtry after hesitating for some time seconded his efforts by burying his face in his hands and appearing also to give way to violent grief     chapter iii   the escape  shortly after the meal was over the brigands rose the boys were again bound and were laid down on the ground near the fire one of the brigands then took his seat beside them and the others rolling themselves in their cloaks were soon asleep at the fire the boys tired as they were by the long and fatiguing day through which they had passed were some time getting off to sleep indeed with their arms bound by their side the only way of doing so was by lying flat upon their backs  with the early dawn they were awake  i expect they are getting up steam on board the falcon hawtry said and no doubt there is a nice row over our being missing id give a good sum if i had it to give to be back on her decks again  the band was soon astir but for some hours nothing was done they were evidently waiting for the arrival of some one as one or other of the bandits went frequently to the edge of the plateau and looked down  at last one of them announced to his comrades that the person expected was in sight and shortly afterwards the muleteer of the previous day appeared over his shoulder hung a heavy skin of wine in his hand he carried a large basket in which were several loaves of coarse bread his arrival was hailed with a shout a fresh supply of meat had been placed on the fire immediately his coming was reported and in a short time the meal was prepared the meat being washed down by horns of the rough wine of the country  the lads had been again unbound when the band awoke and were as before invited to share the meal they continued to maintain their forlorn and downcast attitude the rascally guide of the day before gave the company an account of the proceedings and roars of laughter were excited by his tragic imitation of the defiant way in which the boys had drawn their dirks a proceeding which was rendered the more ludicrous from its contrast with their present forlorn attitude  but mind he continued they can run like hares going up a hill no doubt any of you would soon overtake them but along a straight road i would back them against the best of us  there is no fear of their trying that the chief said pointing to the rifles they would soon be stopped if they tried it on however they are not likely to make any such mad attempt they are after all only young boys and their spirit has speedily evaporated  however as a measure of precaution he ordered that the man who was acting as sentry over the boys should always keep his rifle in hand  the meal over the muleteer produced from his pocket some writingpaper and a pencil the chief then wrote on a piece of paper the figures 5000 followed by the word dollars then he said to the boys capitan giving them a pencil and a sheet of notepaper he pointed to the figures he had written down then to the sun marked with his hand its course twice through the sky and then drew it significantly across his throat  well hawtry said thats clear enough we are to write to the captain to say that unless 5000 dollars are paid in two days we are to have our throats cut well i may as well write  dear captain stuartwe are in an awful mess we took some mules in the spanish lines for a ride yesterday and the fellow who owned them steered us into the middle of a lot of brigands they were too strong for us to show fight and here we are as far as we can make out they say that unless 5000 dollars are paid in two days we are to have our throats cut we dont expect that you will get this note as by this time the falcon was to have sailed in that case we suppose it will be all up with us we intend to try to slip our anchors and make a bolt for it we are awfully sorry that we have got into this scrape  to this epistle the boys both signed their names and as the muleteer had not provided himself with envelopes the letter was roughly folded and directed  captain stuart hms falcon  another letter embodying the same in the form of a demand was then written after much consultation by the brigands with postscript stating that if the bearer were in any way molested the prisoners would at once be put to death the youngest of the party a peasant of some twenty years old was then selected and to him the letters were given with full instructions as to his conduct  during the next two days the boys maintained their appearance of extreme despondency they lay on the ground with their faces buried in their arms and at times strolled listlessly about they could see that this conduct had lulled to rest any suspicion of their captors that they might attempt an escape the sentry no longer kept in their immediate vicinity and although he retained his gun in his hand did so as a mere form the others went about their business several of them absenting themselves for hours together and at one time but three men including the guard remained at the encampment  the boys kept every faculty on the alert and were ready to seize the first opportunity however slight which might offer itself they agreed that however much their guard might be reduced it would be unsafe to make the attempt in the daytime as they were wholly ignorant of the way down to the sea and the shouts of their pursuers would be sure to attract the attention of any of the party who might have gone in that direction  as to the two days assigned for payment they did not anticipate that the crisis would arrive at the end of that time as they felt sure that the falcon would have sailed before the messenger could have arrived in which case fresh negotiations would probably be set on foot  so it proved on the evening of the day after his departure the messenger returned and the news that he brought was greeted with an outburst of ejaculations of anger and disappointment on the part of the brigands they crowded round the boys shook their fists at them cuffed and kicked them when they had somewhat recovered their equanimity they made signs that the ship had departed  by using the word governor they made the boys understand that a fresh letter must be written to that officer  this was done at once and another of the party started immediately with it  late on into the night the boys talked in low voices as to their best plan of attempting an escape although free in the daytime they were tightly bound at night and the guards who were changed every two hours never for a moment relaxed their vigilance finally they concluded that their only chance was to endeavor to slip away on the following evening just as it became dusk when all the party generally reassembled and were busy cooking their food or relating what had happened during the day  immediately in front of the encampment the slope was extremely steep the brigands in going or coming always turned to the right or left and kept along the brow for some distance to points where as the boys supposed the slope became more gradual and paths existed by which they could make their way down to the shore  at one time the boys thought of rolling down the steep slope and taking their chance but this they agreed would be a last resource as it was probable that the slope ended in an absolute precipice  i have an idea jack said suddenly in the middle of the day  what is it jack  you see that heap of rugs in which they wrap themselves when they go to sleep now i vote that when it gets dusk we stand for some time at the edge looking down into the sea then when we see our guard chatting with one of the men who have just arrived and the others busy round the fire we will quietly move back towards it if our guard notices us at all he wont pay any special attention as we are going that way we will steal up to the rear of the blankets within a few feet of where they are standing and will crawl quietly under them when we are missed they are sure to suppose that we have either made down the slope or along the brow and will at once set off in pursuit the betting is theyll all go but if only one or two are left we may take them by surprise at any rate it seems our best chance  hawtry agreed and it was decided that they should attempt to put the plan into execution that evening  late in the afternoon the brigands as usual came dropping in in twos and threes one brought in a kid and two others exhibited to their admiring friends a purse containing some ten or twelve dollars in silver they related amid the uproarious laughter of their comrades the manner in which they had threatened the worthy farmer its late possessor into surrendering the proceeds of his days marketing without resistance it was already dusk jack and hawtry had a minute before been standing near the edge of the slope the guard was chatting with the last comer and keeping one ear open to the narrative told by the fire  suddenly he glanced round and perceived that the figures he had as he believed scarcely taken his eye off were missing  madre de dios he exclaimed where are the prisoners  at his exclamation all round the fire started into activity a hasty glance round the encampment showed that their captives were not within its circle with an exclamation of fury the captain seized his gun and with the buttend struck the sentry to the ground then in furious tones he ordered every man off in instant pursuit snatching up their arms some hurried off one way some another shouting threats of vengeance as they went  as their voices receded there was a slight movement among the rugs and the boys heads peered out from below their hidingplace the encampment was deserted save that on the ground lay the form of the prostrate sentinel while the captain stood gun in hand on the edge of the slope peering down into the gathering darkness  the boys rose stealthily to their feet and keeping along by the side of the hill so as to be out of the direct line of sight should the brigand turn towards the fire they noiselessly approached him  he did not look round until they were within five paces and it was then too late he turned and threw up his gun but before he could level it they both threw themselves upon him  taken wholly by surprise he staggered backwards he was but a pace from the edge of the steep declivity and in another moment he fell backward his gun exploding in the air as he went the boys heard his body as it rolled and crashed through the slight brushwood on the slope fainter and fainter became the sound and then it suddenly ceased  as long as it continued the boys stood motionless and were turning to go when there was the crack of a rifle and a ball whizzed between them leaping round they saw the guard whom they had supposed to be insensible had risen to his feet throwing down the rifle which he had just discharged and drawing his long knife he rushed at them  dodge him hawtry dodge him get hold of the rifle i will get a stick from the fire  the boys separated one going each way the spaniard still bewildered by the stunning blow he had received hesitated a moment and then rushed at jack who darted round the fire hawtry seized the rifle and with the buttend attacked the spaniard who turned to defend himself jack snatched up a heavy brand from the fire and coming behind the spaniard who was waiting knife in hand for an opportunity to rush in between the sweeping blows which hawtry was dealing at him with the buttend of the rifle smote him with all his force across the side of the head  with a scream of agony the spaniard fell prostrate and jack snatching up his knife while hawtry still retained the rifle they darted off at full speed along the brow  presently they heard footsteps of men hastily returning and drawing aside threw themselves down among some low bushes the men were talking eagerly they had heard the two reports of the guns and had no doubt that the captain had discovered the fugitives  when the spaniards had passed the boys rose to their feet and continued their flight at the top of their speed the men had come from below and the boys soon discovered traces of a path descending the slope this they at once took proceeding with caution now for the descent was an extremely steep one and the path little more than a goat track fortunately the moon was shining brightly and by its light they were enabled to follow its windings  after half an hours descent they found themselves in a rough road along the face of the hill this they doubted not was the road from one of the coast villages into the interior they now went more cautiously for the road was extremely rough with large stones lying here and there upon it and a heavy fall or a sprained ankle would be disastrous they had no fear of pursuit once or twice they fancied that they heard shouts far above them but they considered it likely that the band would be too far paralyzed by the loss of their captain to again take up the pursuit  three hours later they stood by the sea shore near a tiny fishing village composed of three or four houses only they held a consultation as to whether it would be better to rouse the villagers and explain the circumstances but they had become suspicious of spaniards and thought it likely that there would be a close relationship between the people here and the band in their neighborhood no lights were visible in the village and it was probable that the inhabitants were already in bed  they sat down for another hour to avoid the chance of their being surprised by any straggler then proceeding to the shore they launched a small boat hawtry stepped the mast and hoisted the sail and they were soon making their way off the land the wind was light and their progress slow for a time they kept straight out to sea and then turned the boats head towards gibraltar  the wind presently died quite away and lowering the sails they got out the oars and set to work beyond trying once or twice upon the stour jack had had no experience in rowing and his clumsiness excited considerable indignation on the part of hawtry the boat was heavy and their progress in consequence very slow they calculated that they must have twentyfive miles to row as the point at which they were captured was hawtry had judged by the sound of the gun fully fifteen miles distant from it and they had walked another ten before arriving at the brigands encampment  all night they rowed until the moon sank this being as they were aware about three oclock they then lay down in the boat for a nap and when they awoke it was daylight they found that the wind had got up and was blowing steadily off shore and that they were now distant some five miles from land the rock of gibraltar rising steeply from the sea some ten miles from them in a straight line  hawtry at once set the sail again and the boat was soon slipping fast through the water  what a nuisance hawtry said the wind is hauling farther round and we shall not make into the rock this tack this tub of a boat makes no end of leeway we shall have to make right across towards the african shore and then tack back again  they were as hawtry anticipated fully three miles to leeward of europa point as they passed the rock the wind was now blowing strongly from the west  upon my word hawtry said i question whether we shall ever be able to make the rock in this beast of a boat she wont sail anywhere near the wind and makes awful leeway hurrah theres a big steamer coming out we will hail her  hawtry now steered the boat till he had placed her as near as possible in the line which the steamer was pursuing and then lowered the sail and waited for her to come up  when she came within a quarter of a mile the sail was again hoisted and hawtry so steered the boat that for a moment jack thought he would put her under the bows of the steamer this however had the effect which hawtry had intended of drawing attention to them  the steamer passed within thirty feet of them hawtry lowered the sail and standing up shouted  throw us a rope  a number of persons had been attracted to the side and one of the officers seeing two young midshipmen in the boat at once threw a rope to them while the officer on duty ordered the engines to be stopped in another two minutes the boat was hauled alongside the two lads scrambled up the rope the boat was cast adrift and the steamer was again ploughing her way eastward  the boys found that they were on board the transport ripon having the coldstream guards on board the first detachment of the army on its way east  considerable excitement was caused by the sudden and unexpected boarding of the ship by the two young officers and great curiosity was expressed as to how they had got into such a position as hawtry said however that they had been twentyfour hours without food they were at once taken to the saloon where breakfast was on the point of being served no questions were put to them until they had satisfied their hunger then they told the story of their adventures which caused quite an excitement among the officers  the ripon had sailed from southampton docks on the 23d of february in company with the manilla and orinoco  the next four days passed pleasantly the boys being made a good deal of by the officers of the coldstream guards but they were not sorry when on saturday evening the lights of malta were seen and soon after midnight they dropped anchor in valetta harbor the next morning they were delighted at seeing the falcon lying a few cables length distant and bidding goodbye to their new friends they hailed a shore boat and were soon alongside the falcon the first lieutenant was on deck  young gentlemen he said sternly you have committed a very serious offence and are liable to be tried by courtmartial for having deserted your ship i expected better things of you both go below immediately and consider yourselves under arrest i shall report your coming on board to the captain  the boys saluted without a word and went below to the midshipmens berth where the tale of their adventures was soon related to their comrades who were at first inclined to believe that the whole story was an invention got up to screen themselves for breaking leave however they soon saw that the boys were in earnest and the truth of the story as to their being picked up at sea by the ripon could of course at once be tested  presently they were summoned to the captains cabin and there hawtry again recited the story  the captain told them that they had erred greatly in going away in such a reckless manner without taking proper precautions to secure their return before gunfire but he said they had already been punished so severely for their thoughtlessness that he should overlook the offence and that he complimented them on the courage and coolness they had displayed in extricating themselves from the dangerous position into which they had fallen  he then invited them to breakfast at which meal the first lieutenant was also present and here they gave much fuller details of their escape than hawtry had done in his first narration of it  at ten oclock when the boys were below they heard a loud cheering and found that the orinoco with the grenadiers had just come into harbor and were being cheered by their comrades on board the ripon and by the blue jackets of the menofwar  all through the day the harbor was alive with boats before nightfall the coldstreams were all ashore and by monday evening the last of the grenadiers had also disembarked     chapter iv   gallipoli  every day brought fresh troops to malta until the brigade of guards and eleven regiments of infantry of the line were gathered there the streets of valetta were like a fair crowded with soldiery chattering with the vendors of oranges dates olives and apples cigars too are nowhere cheaper than in malta and as unfortunately spirits were equally low in price the british soldier small as was his daily rate of pay found but little difficulty in intoxicating himself  in a few days the french began to put in an appearance and the crowd in the streets was even more lively and picturesque than before all this time the great topic of discussion was whether matters would or would not come to the arbitration of war  during their stay jack archer and his comrades enjoyed themselves heartily but it was by no means all play the sailors had an immense deal to do in moving stores preparing fittings and getting matters ready for the forward despatch of the troops should war be finally decided upon  a month after the arrival at malta the doubt was put an end to for upon the 28th of march war was formally declared and on the 29th the french sailed for gallipoli followed the next day by sir george brown with the advance party of the light division  the same day the falcon steamed out of harbor and although the stay at malta had been enjoyed all hands were delighted at the advance towards the scene of future action  gallipoli stands near the upper end of the dardanelles and is an important military position  it looks a nice little town delafield said on returning after his first visit in the captains gig to his comrades but i cant say much for it when you see it at close quarters one got tired of malta but malta was a paradise to this place the confusion seems to be tremendous but those jolly old turks are sitting at their doors smoking like so many old owls and do not seem to interest themselves in the slightest  and did you see any lovely houris simmonds asked laughing  that i did not delafield said i saw some bundles looking like rolls of dirty white sheets ready for the wash with a pair of big yellow shoes underneath them and i believe that they were women i did not see any of their faces i didnt want to for im sure no decently pretty woman would allow herself to be made such an object as that  the same work of unloading and transporting goods to the shore which had gone on at malta was continued here every day fresh troops arrived english and french and the whole of the undulating plain round gallipoli was dotted with their camps by the end of the month 22000 french and some 10000 english were gathered there  after the days work was done the midshipmen often got leave ashore and enjoyed the scene of bustle and confusion which reigned there enormous numbers of pack animals and bullockcarts were at work and even at this early period of the campaign the immense superiority of the french arrangements over the english was manifest this was but natural as the french like other european nations had been in the habit in time of peace of regarding the army as a machine which might be required for war and had therefore kept the commissariat transport and other arrangements in a state of efficiency in england upon the other hand the army had been entirely neglected and had been made the subject of miserable petty economy in all its branches and the consequence was that war found us wholly unprepared except that we possessed an army of seasoned soldiers such as in the nature of things under the new regulations england will never see again  on going ashore the midshipmen would sometimes ramble away to the camp sometimes stroll through the town and amuse themselves by chaffing the grave turkish shopkeepers by watching the english and french soldiers staggering along with drunken gravity sometimes with their arms round each others necks or by kissing their hands airily to the veiled figures of whom they got dim glimpses through the closelylatticed windows the upper part of the town was inhabited principally by greeks whose sympathies were for the most part with the russians and who were as quarrelsome and turbulent as the turks were placid and goodnatured  one evening hawtry and jack had obtained leave to be out later than usual as they had been asked to dine with some of the officers of the coldstreams whom they had met on board the ripon the meal was a rough one for the country had been completely eaten up by this immense accession of strangers still the caterer had succeeded in procuring some tough fowls in addition to the ration beef and as these were washed down by champagne there was no reason to grumble  the boys spent a merry evening and started at halfpast ten for the town this was already quiet and for the most part asleep when they reached it a few officers who had been dining with the various generals who had their headquarters there or with friends on board ship were the sole people in the streets although from some of the closed windows of the drinkingshops in the greek quarter came sounds of singing and noise for every one was earning high wages and the place was full of maltese alexandrians smyrniotes and indeed the riffraff of all the mediterranean cities who had flocked to the scene of action to make money as petty traders hucksters campfollowers muledrivers or commissariatlaborers  as they were passing through a dark and silent street they suddenly heard a sound of shouting and the clash of weapons the fall of heavy bodies and the tramping of feet then a window was dashed open a voice shouted help and then the strife continued as before  come on archer hawtry exclaimed there are some of our fellows in a row with these greeks  the door was fastened but the boys burst in a window next to it leapt into the room groped their way to the door and then finding the stairs hurried up on the landing a dim oil light was burning but it needed no light to indicate the room in which the struggle was still proceeding the door stood ajar and the boys with drawn dirks dashed into the room  it was a large one in the centre was a table on which were strewn several packs of cards some chairs lay on the ground the oil from an overturned lamp was forming a great black stain on the green tablecloth in the corner by the window three officers with drawn swords were defending themselves against the attacks of some twenty greeks armed with knives in the confusion none had noticed the entry of the boys  pick up a chair jack hawtry said recoiling from the idea of rushing with his dirk upon unprepared men  the two lads each seized one of the strong but light chairs scattered on the floor and with a sudden hurrah flung themselves upon the greeks two or three of these were knocked down and the rest taken by surprise by the sudden attack recoiled and the boys were speedily by the side of the assailed officers  the greeks drew back but seeing how slight was the reinforcement again advanced to the attack three of their number lay upon the ground and several of the others were bleeding freely upon the other hand one of the officers leant against the wall badly wounded while both of the others had received nasty cuts they would before this have been overpowered had they not hastily pulled a small table and a chair or two so as to form a sort of barricade across the angle and so prevented the greeks from closing upon them one of the officers was an englishman the others were french all were quite young men there was scarcely time for the exchange of a word before the greeks were upon them again  the boys had again drawn their dirks but these formed but a poor weapon against the chairs with which several of the greeks seeing the inferiority of their knives had now armed themselves hawtry received a crashing blow on the head which sent him staggering back against the wall and jack one on his arm which rendered it useless  this will never do the english officer shouted let us make a rush at the scoundrels and fight our way to the door its our only chance  wait a moment jack said a thought striking him stooping down behind the others he pulled out a matchbox from his pocket struck a light and applied it to the muslin curtains which hung before the window in a moment a broad sheet of flame leaped up the greeks uttered a shout of terror and surprise  now jack shouted all together  in a moment the five dashed down the table and flung themselves upon the greeks these taken by surprise and paralyzed by the great sheet of flame which was already licking the wooden ceiling recoiled some were cut down as they stood others were hurled aside two or three fell before the dirks of the midshipmen and in a few seconds the little party had burst through the crowd of their assailants and had gained the door of the room here the englishman and one of the french officers turned and made a stand in order to give the midshipmen time to assist their badlywounded comrade down the narrow stairs and to open the door of the house as they flung this open jack shouted up that the way was free and then half carrying the wounded frenchman they hurried down the street uttering shouts for assistance the lattice work of the window had already caught fire and a sheet of flame lit up the street before they had gone fifty yards they heard a noise behind them as the two officers followed by the greeks issued from the house  fortunately at this moment a party of english officers who had been dining at the generals ran up at full speed attracted by the shouts of the boys and the glare of fire upon seeing this accession of strength the greeks at once desisted from the attack and made off by this time the windows of the various houses were opening and shouts of affright arose at the sight of the conflagration for the houses were for the most part constructed of wood and once begun there was no saying where a fire would end  what is all this about gentlemen one of the officers a colonel asked give me your names for there must be an inquiry into the matter i see you are all wounded and tis best to get back to camp at once i fear this will be a serious matter  in five minutes the street was full of people and the flames had obtained entire possession of the house and were rushing high into the air the wind was blowing briskly and it was evident that the safety of the whole quarter of the town was menaced the french officer succeeded in getting four maltese to carry his comrade to the camp a door was taken off its hinges and they were soon upon their way  jack and hawtry who had only received one or two slight slashes of knives remained to see what came of it the turkish guards were speedily on the spot but these could do nothing beyond trying to prevent the rabble from commencing a general pillage from every house the people were throwing out their goods of all descriptions every minute the fire spread and six or seven houses were already in flames when but a quarter of an hour after the outbreak of the fire a heavy tramp was heard and a battalion of french infantry from their nearest camp came up at a double there was no water no means whatever of extinguishing the flames but the active little frenchmen did not lose a minute at the word of command they broke their ranks and swarmed into the houses and in a minute a perfect avalanche of goods was thrown from the windows some stood along outside the houses others climbed upon their shoulders on these again others took their places and so on until living ladders were formed up which a score of men climbed the roofs these set to work with axe and hatchet tearing off the tiles and hacking down rafters while their comrades in the houses hewed away at floors and staircases in less than a quarter of an hour four houses on either side of those in flames were completely gutted and the fire thus cut off speedily burnt itself out fifteen houses having been consumed  by this time large numbers of troops together with sailors from the fleet had arrived but the work was fortunately done and had it not been for the early appearance of the french battalion and the energetic measures which they adopted a great portion of the greek quarter would have been destroyed  among those who had landed was a strong party of seamen from the falcon under mr hethcote the boys joined these and returned with them on board ship they reported to the lieutenant the share which they had had in the affair  it is an unpleasant business he said but i do not blame you for going to the assistance of those attacked when you heard an englishman call for help still mr archer it is clear that you have pretty nearly burnt down the town of gallipoli and i dont know the light in which the admiral and sir george brown may view the affair as you say that no one took any notice of you at the time that the names of the military officers were taken it is possible that no inquiry will be made about you i shall of course report the matter to captain stuart and he must act as he thinks fit but in the meantime i should advise you to say nothing of the share which you have had in the matter to any one you must have those gashes you have got plastered up but i will speak to the surgeon do you know the name of the english officer concerned  yes sir he was lieutenant tewson of the grenadier guards we only exchanged a few words before he went away but he begged us to go and see him  i should advise you to keep away from him altogether until the matter has blown over mr hethcote said did you give him your names  no sir we had no time  all the better mr hethcote said it will of course come out in the course of the inquiry that two midshipmen were concerned and it is just as well that he cannot give your names i expect the ship to be ordered up to constantinople in a day or two and i hope we may be off before any inquiries are made one can never say how these bigwigs may take things sir george brown is a tremendous martinet and he may consider that it would have been far better that five officers who chose to go to a gamblinghouse should be killed than that gallipoli full as it is of valuable stores and munitions of war should run the risk of being destroyed by fire there now go off to the surgeon and get your faces strapped up and then ask him to come to me at once if you two young gentlemen go on as you have begun you are not likely to live to obtain eminence in your profession it is but two months since we left england and we have not yet seen an enemy yet you have had two as narrow escapes for your lives as one could wish to have  very severe was the crossquestioning which the lads had to undergo in the midshipmens berth as to the manner in which they came by their cut faces and they were obliged to take refuge under the strict order of the first lieutenant that they were to say nothing about it  fortunately the next day the falcon received orders to proceed to the bosphorus and got up her anchor and steamed up the dardanelles before dark presently mr hethcote came up to jack who was on duty on the quarterdeck  i tell you what jack he said quietly it is very lucky for you that we are away the french officer died during the night i hear that his lungs were pierced sir george brown is said to be furious and threatens to try tewson by courtmartial for entering a gamblinghouse in spite of strict orders to the contrary of course it is well known that scores of other officers have done the same but it is only when a thing is found out that there is a row about it tewson had been dining on board a french ship and was going home with the two french officers who were also there none of them had been in a gamblinghouse before but it seems they had heard of this place which was one of the most notorious dens in the town and agreed to look in for a few minutes to see what it was like they began to play and had an extraordinary run of luck winning something like four hundred pounds the bank was broken and the greeks wanted them to stop till some more money was procured this they would not do and the greeks then attacked them tewson has strong interest and the affair will probably in his case blow over the greeks have made a complaint against them for wilfully setting fire to the house and this is the most serious part of the affair i am told that both tewson and the french officer deny having done so they say that it was done in order to effect a diversion by two officers who came in to their assistance in the middle of the fight and both declare that they do not know who they were or anything about them as they only saw them for a minute in the middle of the confusion some one has said that two young naval officers were seen just at the beginning of the fire and no doubt inquiries will be set on foot but now that we are fairly off they will find out nothing at gallipoli and its likely that it will all blow over the authorities have plenty to think about at present without troubling themselves very much in following up a clue of this kind  in all the world there is no more lovely scene than that which greeted jack archers eyes as he went on deck the following morning  the falcon was anchored about midchannel on the left was constantinople with its embattled wall its palaces its green foliage down to the waters edge its domes and minarets rising thickly separated from it by the golden horn crossed by a bridge of boats are pera and galatta street rising above street straight over the bows of the ship was the bosphorus with its wooded banks dotted with villas and palaces to the right was scutari with the great barrack standing on the edge of a cliff some fifty feet in height little did those who looked at the great square pile of building dream that ere many months it would be crowded from top to bottom with british sick and wounded and that even its ample corridors would prove wholly insufficient to contain them the water itself was thronged with shipping of all nations menofwar merchant steamers crowded with stores troopships thronged with redcoats great barges laden to the waters edge slowly made their way between the ships and the shore the boats of the shipping filled with soldiers rowed in the same direction menofwar boats with their regular steady swing went hither and thither while among all crossed and recrossed from constantinople to scutari the light caicques with their one or two whiteshirted rowers no boats in the world are more elegant in appearance none except those built specially for racing can vie with them in speed the passenger sits comfortably on a cushion in the bottom of the boat and smokes the long pipe which the boatman as a matter of course fills and hands to him as he takes his seat while the boatmen themselves generally albanians and singularly handsome and athletic men lay themselves down to their work with a vigor and a heartiness which would astound the boatmen of an english wateringplace  a scene so varied so beautiful and so busy could not be equalled elsewhere     chapter v   a brush with the enemy  two days later jack obtained leave to go on shore he hesitated for a moment whether to choose the right or left bank the plateau of scutari was covered with the tents of the british army which were daily being added to as scarce an hour passed without a transport coming in laden with troops after a little hesitation however jack determined to land at constantinople the camps at scutari would differ but little from those at gallipoli while in the turkish capital were innumerable wonders to be investigated hailing a caicque which was passing he took his seat with young coveney who had also got leave ashore and accepted with dignity the offer of a long pipe this however by no means answered his expectations the mouthpiece being formed of a large piece of amber of a bulbous shape and too large to be put into the mouth it was consequently necessary to suck the smoke through the end a practice very difficult at first to those accustomed to hold a pipe between the teeth  in ten minutes the boat landed them at pera close to the bridge of boats across the golden horn for a time the lads made no motion to advance so astonished were they at the crowd which surged across the bridge turkish english and french soldiers turks in turbans and fezes turkish women wrapped up to the eyes in white or blue clothes hamals or porters staggered past under weights which seemed to the boys stupendous pachas and other dignitaries riding on gaylytrapped little horses carriages with three or four veiled figures inside and black guards standing on the steps carried the ladies of one harem to visit those of another the lads observed that for the most part these dames instead of completely hiding their faces with thick wrappings as did their sisters in the streets covered them merely with a fold of thin muslin permitting their features to be plainly seen these ladies evidently took a lively interest in what was going on and in no way took it amiss when some english or french officer stared unceremoniously at their pretty faces although their black guards gesticulated angrily on these occasions and were clearly far more indignant concerning the admiration which their mistresses excited than were those ladies themselves  at last the boys moved forward across the bridge and jack presently found himself next to two young english officers proceeding in the same direction one of these turned sharply round as jack addressed his companion  hallo jack  hallo harry what you here i had no idea you had got your commission yet how are you old fellow and how are they all at home  every one is all right jack i thought you would have known all about it i was gazetted three days after you started and was ordered to join at once we wrote to tell you it  i have never had a letter since i left home jack said i suppose they are all knocking about somewhere every one is complaining about the post well this is jolly and i see you are in the 33d too the regiment you wanted to get into when did you arrive  we came in two days ago in the himalaya we are encamped with the rest of the light division who have come up sir george brown commands us and will be here from gallipoli in a day or two with the rest of the division  the boys now introduced their respective friends to each other and the four wandered together through constantinople visited the bazaars fixed upon lots of pretty things as presents to be bought and taken home at the end of the war and then crossed the bridge again to pera and had dinner at missouris the principal hotel there and the great rendezvous of the officers of the british army and navy then they took a boat and rowed across to scutari where harry did the honors of the camp and at sundown jack and his messmate returned on board the falcon  the next three weeks passed pleasantly jack spending all his time when he could get leave with his brother and the latter often coming off for an hour or two to the falcon early in may the news arrived that the russians had advanced through the dobrudscha and had commenced the siege of silistria a few hours later the falcon and several other ships of war were on their way up the dardanelles convoying numerous storeships bound to varna shortly afterwards the generals of the allied armies determined that varna should be the base for the campaign against the russians and accordingly towards the end of may the troops were again embarked  varna is a seaport surrounded by an undulating country of parklike appearance and the troops were upon their arrival delighted with their new quarters here some 22000 english and 50000 french were encamped together with 8000 or 10000 turks a few days after their arrival jack obtained leave for a day on shore and rowed out to alladyn nine miles and a half from varna where the light division consisting of the 7th 19th 23d 33d 77th and 88th regiments was encamped close by was a freshwater lake and the undulated ground was finely wooded with clumps of forest timber and covered with short crisp grass no more charming site for a camp could be conceived game abounded and the officers who had brought guns with them found for a time capital sport everyone was in the highest spirits and the hopes that the campaign would soon open in earnest were general in this however they were destined to be disappointed for on the 24th of june the news came that the turks had unaided beaten off the russians with such heavy loss in their attack upon silistria that the latter had broken up the siege and were retreating northward  a weary delay then occurred while the english and french home authorities and the english and french generals in the field were settling the point at which the attack should be made upon russia the delay was a disastrous one for it allowed an enemy more dangerous than the russians to make his insidious approaches the heat was very great water bad indeed almost undrinkable the climate was notoriously an unhealthy one and fruit of all kinds together with cucumbers and melons extremely cheap and the soldiers consequently consumed very large quantities of these  through june and up to the middle of july however no very evil consequences were apparent on the 21st of july two divisions of french troops under general canrobert marched into the dobrudscha in search of some bodies of russians who were said to be there on the night of the 28th cholera broke out and before morning in one division no less than 600 men lay dead the other divisions although situated at considerable distances were simultaneously attacked with equal violence and three days later the expedition returned having lost over 7000 men scarcely less sudden or less fatal was the attack among the english lines and for some time the english camps were ravaged by cholera  jack was extremely anxious about his brother for the light division suffered even more severely than did the others but he was not able to go himself to see as to the state of things for the naval officers were not allowed to go on shore more than was absolutely necessary and as the camp of the light division had been moved some ten miles farther away on to the slopes of the balkans it would have been impossible to go and return in one day such precautions as were taken however were insufficient to keep the cholera from on board ship in a short time the fleet was attacked with a severity almost equal to that on shore and although the fleet put out to sea the flagship in two days lost seventy men  fortunately the falcon had left varna before the outbreak extended to the ships the crimea had now been definitely determined upon as the point of assault turkish vessels with heavy siege guns were on their way to varna and the falcon was ordered to cross to the crimea and report upon the advantages of several places for the landing of the allied army the mission was an exciting one as beside the chance of a brush with shore batteries there was the possibility that they might run against some of the russian menofwar who still held that part of the black sea and whose headquarters were at sebastopol the great fortress which was the main object of the expedition to the crimea  the falcon started at night and in the morning of the second day the hills of the crimea were visible in the distance the fires were then banked up and she layto with nightfall she steamed on until within a mile or two of the coast and here again anchored with the early dawn steam was turned on and the falcon steamed along as close to the shore as she dare go the lead being constantly kept going as but little was known of the depth of water on these shores presently they came to a bay with a smooth beach the ground rose but gradually behind and a small village stood close to the shore  this looks a good place captain stuart said to the first lieutenant we will anchor here and lower the boats you mr hethcote with three boats had better land at that village get any information that you can and see that there are no troops about if attacked by a small force you will of course repel it if by a strong one fall back to your boats and i will cover your retreat with the guns of the ship the other two boats will be employed in sounding let the master have charge of these and make out as far as he can a perfect chart of the bay  in a few minutes the boats were lowered and the men in the highest glee took their places jack was in the gig with the first lieutenant the order was given and the boats started together towards the shore they had not gone fifty yards before there was a roar of cannon succeeded by the whistle of shot two masked batteries one upon each side of the bay and mounting each six guns had opened upon them the cutter commanded by the second lieutenant was smashed by a round shot and instantly sunk a ball struck close to the strokeoar of the gig deluging its occupants with water and ricochetting over the gunwale of the boat between the strokeoar and mr hethcote two shot hulled the falcon and others whistled through her rigging  pick up the crew of the cutter mr hethcote and return on board at once captain stuart shouted the engines of the falcon at once began to move and the captain interposed the ship between the nearest battery and the boats and a few seconds later her heavy guns which had previously been got ready for action opened upon the forts in two minutes the boats were alongside with all hands save one of the cutters crew who had been cut in two by the round shot the men leaving the boats towing alongside rushed to the guns and the heavy fire of the falcon speedily silenced her opponents then as his object was to reconnoitre not to fight captain stuart steamed out to sea he was determined however to obtain further information respecting the bay which appeared to him one adapted for the purpose of landing  i will keep off till nightfall mr hethcote we will then run in as close as we dare showing no lights and i will then ask you to take a boat with muffled oars to row to the village make your way among the houses as quietly as possible and seize a couple of fishermen and bring them off with you our interpreter will be able to find out from them at any rate general details as to the depth of water and the nature of the anchorage  who shall i take with me sir  the regular gigs crew and mr simmonds he has passed and it may give him a chance of promotion i think by the way you may as well take the launch also it carries a gun do not let the men from it land but keep her lying a few yards off shore to cover your retreat if necessary mr pascoe will command it  there was a deep but quiet excitement among the men when at nightfall the vessels head was again turned towards shore and the crews of the gig and launch told to hold themselves in readiness cutlasses were sharpened and pistols cleaned not less was the excitement in the midshipmens berth where it was known that simmonds was to go in the gig but no one knew who was to accompany the launch however jack turned out to be the lucky one mr pascoe being probably glad to please the first lieutenant by selecting his relation although that officer would not himself have shown favoritism on his behalf  it was about eleven oclock when the falcon approached her former position or rather to a point a mile seaward of it as nearly as the master could bring her for the night was extremely dark and the land scarcely visible not a light was shown not a voice raised on board and the only sound heard was the gentle splash of the paddles as they revolved at their slowest rate of speed the falls had been greased the rowlocks muffled and the crew took their places in perfect silence  you understand mr hethcote were captain stuarts last words that you are not to attempt a landing if there is the slightest opposition  very quietly the boats left the falcons side they rowed abreast and close to each other in order that the first lieutenant could give orders to mr pascoe in a low tone the men were ordered to row quietly and to avoid any splashing or throwing up of water it was a longer row than they had expected and it was evident that the master deceived by the uncertain light had brought the vessel up at a point considerably farther from the shore than he had intended as they got well in the bay they could see no lights in the village ahead but an occasional gleam near the points at either side showed that the men in the batteries were awake and active as the boat neared the shore the men rowed according to the first lieutenants orders more and more gently and at last when the line of beach ahead became distinctly visible the order was given to lie upon their oars all listened intently and then mr hethcote put on his helm so that the boat which had still some way on it drifted even closer to the launch  do you hear anything mr pascoe  i dont know sir i dont seem to make out any distinct sound but there certainly appears to be some sort of murmur in the air  so i think too  again they listened  i dont know sir jack whispered in mr pascoes ear but i fancy that at times i see a faint light right along behind those trees it is very faint but sometimes their outline seems clearer than at others  mr pascoe repeated in a low voice to mr hethcote what jack had remarked  i fancied so once or twice myself he said there he added suddenly that is the neigh of a horse however there may be horses anywhere now we will paddle slowly on lay within a boats length of the shore mr pascoe keep the gun trained on the village and let the men hold their arms in readiness  in another minute the gigs bow grated on the beach quietly lads the first lieutenant said step into the water without splashing then follow me as quickly as you can  the beach was a sandy one and the footsteps of the sailors were almost noiseless as they stole towards the village the place seemed hushed in quiet but just as they entered the little street a figure standing in the shade of a house rather larger than the rest stepped forward and challenged bringing as he did so his musket to the present an instant later he fired just as the words a russian sentry broke from the first lieutenants lips almost simultaneously three or four other shots were fired at points along the beach a rocket whizzed high in the air from each side of the bay a bugle sounded the alarm voices of command were heard and as if by enchantment a chaos of sounds followed the deep silence which had before reigned and from every house armed men poured out  steady lads steady mr hethcote shouted fall back steadily keep together dont fire a shot till you get to the boat then give them a volley and jump on board now retire at the double  for a moment the russians as they poured from the houses paused in ignorance of the direction of their foes but a shout from the sentry indicated this and a scattering fire was opened this however was at once checked by the shout of the officer to dash forward with all speed after the enemy as the mass of russians rushed from the village the howitzer in the bows of the launch poured a volley of grape into them and checked their advance however from along the bushes on either side fresh assailants poured out  jump on board lads jump on board mr hethcote shouted and each sailor discharging his musket at the enemy leapt into his place give them a volley mr pascoe get your head round and row dont let the men waste time in firing  the volley from the launch again momentarily checked the enemy and just as she got round another discharge from the gun further arrested them the boats were not however thirty yards from the shore before this was lined with dark figures who opened a tremendous fire of musketry  row lads row mr pascoe shouted to his men we shall be out of their sight in another hundred yards     chapter vi   the alma  desperately the men bent to their oars and the heavy boat surged through the water around them swept a storm of musket balls and although the darkness and their haste rendered the fire of the russians wild and uncertain many of the shot took effect with a sigh mr pascoe fell against jack who was sitting next to him just at the moment when jack himself experienced a sensation as if a hot iron had passed across his arm several of the men dropped their oars and fell back but the boats still held rapidly on their way and in two or three minutes were safe from anything but random shot at this moment however three field pieces opened with grape and the iron hail tore up the water near them fortunately they were now almost out of sight and although the forts threw up rockets to light the bay and joined their fire to that of the field guns the boat escaped untouched  thank god we are out of that mr hethcote said as the fire ceased and the boats headed for a light hung up to direct then  have you many hurt mr pascoe  im afraid sir mr pascoe is either killed or badly wounded he is lying against me and gives no answer when i speak to him  any one else hurt mr hethcote asked in a moment  the men exchanged a few words among themselves  there are five down in the bottom of the boat sir and six or seven of us have been hit more or less  its a bad business mr hethcote said i have two killed and three wounded here are you hit yourself mr archer  ive got a queer sensation in my arm sir and dont seem able to use it so i suppose i am but i dont think its much  pull away lads mr hethcote said shortly show a light there in the bow to the steamer  the light was answered by a sharp whistle and they heard the beat of the paddles of the falcon as she came down towards them and five minutes later the boats were hoisted to the davits no casualties i hope mr hethcote captain stuart said as the first lieutenant stepped on board you seem to have got into a nest of hornets  yes indeed sir there was a strong garrison in the village and we have suffered i fear heavily some eight or ten killed and as many wounded  dear me dear me captain stuart said this is an unfortunate circumstance indeed mr manders do you get the wounded on board and carried below will you step into my cabin mr hethcote and give me full details of this unfortunate affair  upon mustering the men it was found that the total casualties in the two boats of the falcon amounted to lieutenant pascoe killed midshipman archer wounded ten seamen killed and nine wounded jacks wound was more severe than he had at first thought the ball had gone through the upper part of the arm and had grazed and badly bruised the bone in its passage the doctor said he would probably be some weeks before he would have his arm out of a sling the falcon spent another week in examining the crimean coast and then ran across again to varna here everything was being pushed forward for the start over six hundred vessels were assembled with a tonnage vastly exceeding that of any fleet that had ever sailed the seas twentyseven thousand english and twentythree thousand french were to be carried in this huge flotilla for although the french army was considerably larger than the english the means of seatransport of the latter were vastly superior and they were able to take across the whole of their army in a single trip whereas the french could convey but half of their force unfortunately between lord raglan the english commanderinchief and marshal saint arnaud the french commander there was little concert or agreement the french whose arrangements were far better and whose movements were prompter than our own were always complaining of british procrastination while the english general went quietly on his own way and certainly tried sorely the patience of our allies even when the whole of the allied armies were embarked nothing had been settled beyond the fact that they were going to invade the crimea and the enormous fleet of menofwar and transports steamers with sailing vessels in tow extending in lines farther than the eye could reach and covering many square miles of the sea sailed eastward without any fixed destination the consequence was as might be expected a lamentable waste of time halts were called councils were held reconnaissances sent forward and the vast fleet steamed aimlessly north south east and west until when at last a landingplace was fixed upon near eupatoria and the disembarkation was effected fourteen precious days had been wasted over a journey which is generally performed in twentyfour hours and which even the slowly moving transports might have easily accomplished in three days  the consequence was the russians had time to march round large bodies of troops from the other side and the object of the expeditionthe capture of sebastopol by a coup de mainwas altogether thwarted no more imposing sight was ever seen than that witnessed by the bands of cossacks on the low shores of the crimea when the allied fleets anchored a few miles south of eupatoria the front extended nine miles in length and behind this came line after line of transports until the very topmasts of those in the rear scarce appeared above the horizon the place selected for the landingplace was known as the old fort a low strip of bush and shingle forming a causeway between the sea and a stagnant freshwater lake known as lake saki  at eight oclock in the morning of the 14th of september the french admiral fired a gun and in a little more than an hour six thousand of their troops were ashore while the landing of the english did not commence till an hour after the boats of the menofwar and transports had already been told off for the ships carrying the light division which was to be the first to land and in a wonderfully short time the sea between the first line of ships and the shore was covered with a multitude of boats crowded with soldiers the boats of the falcon were employed with the rest and as three weeks had elapsed since jack had received his wound he was able to take his share of duty although his arm was still in a sling the ship to which the falcons boats were told off lay next to that which had carried the 33d and as he rowed past he exchanged a shout and a wave of the hand with harry who was standing at the top of the companionladder seeing the men of his company take their seats in the boats it was a day of tremendous work each man and officer carried three days provisions and no tents or other unnecessary stores were to be landed the artillery however had to be got ashore and the work of landing the guns on the shingly beach was a laborious one indeed the horses in vain tugged and strained and the sailors leaped over into the water and worked breast high at the wheels and so succeeded in getting them ashore jack had asked permission from captain stuart to spend the night on shore with his brother and just as he was going off from the ship for the last time simmonds who had obtained his acting commission in place of mr pascoe said archer i should advise you to take a tarpaulin and a couple of bottles of rum they will be useful before morning i can tell you for we are going to have a nasty night  indeed the rain was already coming down steadily and the wind was rising few of those who took part in it will ever forget their first night in the crimea the wind blew pitilessly the rain poured down in torrents and twentyseven thousand englishmen lay without shelter in the muddy fields drenched to the skin jack had no trouble in finding his brothers regiment which was in the advance some two or three miles from the landingplace harry was delighted to see him and the sight of the tarpaulin and bottles did not decrease the warmth of his welcome jack was already acquainted with most of the officers of the 33d  hallo archer a young ensign said if i had been in your place i should have remained snugly on board ship a nice night we are in for  so long as the daylight lasted the officers stood in groups and chatted of the prospects of the campaign there was nothing to dono possibility of seeing to the comforts of their men the place where the regiment was encamped was absolutely bare and there were no means of procuring any shelter whatever  how big is that tarpaulin jack  about twelve feet square jack said and pretty heavy i found it i can tell you  what had we better do with it asked harry i cant lie down under that you know with the colonel sitting out exposed to this rain  the best thing jack said after a minutes consideration would be to make a sort of tent of it if we could put it up at a slant some six feet high in front with its back to the wind it would shelter a lot of fellows we might hang some of the blankets at the sides  the captain and lieutenant of harrys company were taken into consultation and with the aid of half a dozen soldiers some muskets bound together and some ramrods a penthouse shelter was made some sods were laid on the lower edge to keep it down each side was closed with two blankets some cords from one of the baggage carts were used as guy ropes to the corners and a very snug shelter was constructed this harry invited the colonel and officers to use and although the space was limited the greater portion of them managed to sit down in it those who could not find room taking up their places in front where the tent afforded a considerable shelter from the wind and rain no one thought of sleeping pipes were lighted and jacks two bottles of rum afforded a tot to each the night could scarcely be called a comfortable one even with these aids but it was luxurious indeed in comparison with that passed by those exposed to the full force of the wind  the next morning jack said goodbye to his brother and the officers of the regiment to whom he presented the tarpaulin for future use and this was folded up and smuggled into an ammunition cart it was not of course jacks to give being government property but he would be able to pay the regulation price for it on his return half an hour later jack was on the beach where a high surf was beating all day the work of landing cavalry and artillery went on under the greatest difficulties many of the boats were staved and rendered useless and several chargers drowned it was evident that the weather was breaking up and the ten days of lovely weather which had been wasted at sea were more bitterly regretted than ever no tents were landed and the troops remained wet to the skin with the additional mortification of seeing their french allies snugly housed under canvas while even the 4000 turks had managed to bring their tents with them the natural result was that sickness again attacked the troops and hundreds were prostrated before three days later they met the enemy on the alma the french were ready to march on the 17th but it was not until two days later that the british were ready then at nine oclock in the morning the army advanced the following is the list of the british force the light division under sir george brown2d battalion rifle brigade 7th fusiliers 19th regiment 23d fusiliers under brigadier majorgeneral codrington 33d regiment 77th regiment 88th regiment under brigadiergeneral butler first division under the duke of cambridgethe grenadier coldstream and scots fusilier guards under majorgeneral bentinck the 42d 79th and 93d highlanders under brigadiergeneral sir c campbell the second division under sir de lacy evansthe 30th 55th and 95th under brigadiergeneral pennefather the 41st 47th and 49th under brigadiergeneral adams the third division under sir r englandthe 1st 28th and 38th under brigadiergeneral sir john campbell the 44th 50th and 68th regiments under brigadiergeneral eyre six companies of the fourth were also attached to this division the fourth division under sir george cathcart consisted of the 20th 21st 2d battalion rifle brigade 63d 46th and 57th the last two regiments however had not arrived the cavalry division under lord lucan consisted of the light cavalry brigade under lord cardigan composed of the 4th light dragoons the 8th hussars 11th hussars 13th dragoons and 17th lancers and the heavy cavalry brigade under brigadiergeneral scarlett consisting of the scots greys 4th dragoon guards 5th dragoon guards and 6th dragoons of these the scots greys had not yet arrived  it was a splendid sight as the allied army got in motion on the extreme right and in advance next the sea was the first division of the french army behind them also by the sea was the second division under general canrobert on the left of which marched the third division under prince napoleon the fourth division and the turks formed the rearguard next to the third french division was the second british with the third in its rear in support next to the second division was the light division with the duke of cambridges division in the rear in support the light cavalry brigade covered the advance and left flank while along the coast parallel with the march of the troops steamed the allied fleet prepared if necessary to assist the army with their guns all were in high spirits that the months of weary delay were at last over and that they were about to meet the enemy the troops saluted the hares which leaped out at their feet at every footstep as the broad array swept along with shouts of laughter and yells and during the halts numbers of the frightened creatures were knocked over and slung behind the knapsacks to furnish a meal at the nights bivouac the smoke of burning villages and farmhouses ahead announced that the enemy were aware of our progress  presently on an eminence across a wide plain masses of the enemys cavalry were visible five hundred of the light cavalry pushed on in front and an equal number of cossacks advanced to meet them lord cardigan was about to give the order to charge when masses of heavy cavalry made their appearance suddenly one of these extended and a battery of russian artillery opened fire upon the cavalry our artillery came to the front and after a quarter of an hours duel the russians fell back and soon after the army halted for the night at a stream called the boulyanak six miles from the alma where the russians as was now known were prepared to give battle the weather had now cleared again and all ranks were in high spirits as they sat round the bivouac fires  how savage they will be on board ship harry archer said to captain lancaster to see us fighting a big battle without their having a hand in it i almost wonder that they have not landed a body of marines and bluejackets the fleets could spare 4000 or 5000 men and their help might be useful do you think the russians will fight  all soldiers will fight captain lancaster said when theyve got a strong position it needs a very different sort of courage to lie down on the crest of a hill and fire at an enemy struggling up it in full view to that which is necessary to make the assault they have too all the advantage of knowing the ground while we know absolutely nothing about it i dont believe that the generals have any more idea than we have it seems a happygolucky way of fighting altogether however i have no doubt that we shall lick them somehow it seems though a pity to take troops direct at a position which the enemy have chosen and fortified when by a flank march which in an undulating country like this could be performed without the slightest difficulty we could turn the position and force them to retreat without losing a man  such was the opinion of many other officers at the time such has been the opinion of every military critic since had the army made a flank march the enemy must either have retired at once or have been liable to an attack upon their right flank when if beaten they would have been driven down to the seashore under the guns of the ships and killed or captured to a man unfortunately however owing to the jealousies between the two generals the illness of marshal arnaud and the incapacity of lord raglan there was neither plan nor concert the armies simply fought as they marched each general of division doing his best and leading his men at that portion of the enemys position which happened to be opposite to him the sole understanding arrived at was that the armies were to march at six in the morning that general bosquets division which was next to the sea was covered by guns of the ships to first carry the enemys position there and that when he had obtained a footing upon the plateau a general attack was to be made even this plan simple as it was was not fully carried out as lord raglan did not move his troops till nine in the morning three precious hours were therefore wasted and a pursuit after the battle which would have turned the defeat into a rout was therefore prevented and sebastopol saved to cost tens of thousands of lives before it fell the russian position on the alma was along a crest of hills on their left by the sea these rose precipitously offering great difficulties for an assault further inland however the slope became easy and towards the right centre and right against which the english attack was directed the hill was simply a slope broken into natural terraces on which were many walls and vineyards near the sea the river ran between low banks but inland the bank was much steeper the south side rising some thirty or forty feet and enabling its defenders to sweep the ground across which the assailants must advance while on their left the russian forces were not advanced in front of the hill which formed their position on the lower ground they occupied the vineyards and inclosures down to the river and their guns were placed in batteries on the steps of the slope enabling them to search with their fire the whole hillside as well as the flat ground beyond the river  the attack as intended was begun by general bosquet bonats brigade crossed the river by a bar of sand across the mouth where the water was only waistdeep while dautemarres brigade crossed by a bridge and both brigades swarmed up the precipitous cliffs which offered great difficulties even to infantry they achieved their object without encountering any resistance whatever the guns of the fleet having driven back the russian regiment appointed to defend this post the enemy brought up three batteries of artillery to regain the crest but the french with tremendous exertions succeeded in getting up a battery of guns and with their aid maintained the position they had gained  when the sound of bosquets guns showed that his part of the programme was carried into effect the second and third divisions of the french army crossed the alma and were soon fiercely engaged with the enemy canroberts division for a time made little way as the river was too deep for the passage of the guns and these were forced to make a detour around a white stone tower some 800 yards on their left dense masses of russian infantry were drawn up and these opened so tremendous a fire upon the french that for a time their advance was checked one of the brigades from the fourth division which was in reserve advanced to their support and joining with some of the regiments of canroberts division and aided by troops whom general bosquet had sent to their aid a great rush was made upon the dense body of russians who swept by the grape of the french artillery were unable to stand the impetuous attack and were forced to retire in confusion the french pressed forward and at this point also of the field the day was won  in the mean time the british army had been also engaged long before they came in sight of the point which they were to attack they heard the roar of cannon on their right and knew that bosquets division were engaged as the troops marched over the crest of the rounded slopes they caught glimpses of the distant fight they could see masses of russian infantry threatening the french gathered on the height watch the puffs of smoke as the guns on either side sent their messengers of death and the white smoke which hung over the fleet as the vessels of war threw their shells far over the heads of the french into the russian masses soon they heard the louder roar which proclaimed that the main body of the french army were in action and burning with impatience to begin the men strode along to take their share in the fight until within a few hundred yards of the river the troops could see nothing of it nor the village on its banks for the ground dipped sharply before they reached the brow twelve russian guns placed on rising ground some 300 yards beyond the river opened upon them  people may say what they like harry archer said to his captain but a cannonball makes a horribly unpleasant row it wouldnt be half as bad if they would but come silently  as he spoke a round shot struck down two men a few files to his right they were the first who fell in the 33d  steady lads steady shouted the officers and as regularly as if on fieldday the english troops advanced the rifles under major northcote were ahead and dashing through the vineyards under a rain of fire crossed the river scaled the bank and pushed forward to the top of the next slope it was on the plateau beyond that the russian main body were posted and for a time the rifles had hard work to maintain themselves in the meantime the light division were advancing in open order sometimes lying down sometimes advancing until they gained the vineyards here the regular order which they had so far maintained was lost as the ground was broken up by hedges stone walls vines and trees the 19th 7th 23d and 33d were then led at a run right to the river by general codrington their course being marked by killed and wounded and crossing they sheltered themselves under the high bank such was the state of confusion in which they arrived there that a momentary pause was necessary to enable the men of the various regiments to gather together and the enemy taking advantage of this brought down three battalions of infantry who advanced close to the bank and as the four regiments dashed up it met them with a tremendous fire as hotly it was answered and the russians retired while their batteries again opened fire  there was but little order in the british ranks as they struggled forward up the hill even under this tremendous fire the men paused to pick grapes and all the exertions of their officers could not maintain the regular line of advance from a rising ground a russian regiment kept up a destructive fire upon them and the guns in the batteries on their flank fired incessantly the slaughter was tremendous but the regiments held on their way unflinchingly in a few minutes the 7th had lost a third of their men and half the 23d were down not less was the storm of fire around the 33d confused bewildered and stunned by the dreadful din harry archer struggled on with his company his voice was hoarse with shouting though he himself could scarce hear the words he uttered his lips were parched with excitement and the acrid smell of gunpowder man after man had fallen beside him but he was yet untouched there was no thought of fear or danger now his whole soul seemed absorbed in the one thought of getting into the battery small as were the numbers who still struggled on their determined advance began to disquiet the russians for the first time a doubt as to victory entered their minds when the day began they felt assured of it their generals had told them that they would annihilate their foes their priests had blessed them and assured them of the protection and succor of the saints but the british were still coming on and would not be denied the infantry behind the battery began to retire the artillery left unprotected limbered up in haste and although three times as numerous as the men of the light division the russians still firing heavily retired up the hill while with a shout of triumph the broken groups of the 23d the 19th and 33d burst into the battery capturing a gun which the russians had been unable to withdraw     chapter vii   before sebastopol  not long were the light division to enjoy the position they had won breathless exhausted bleeding they were but a handful and the russians looking down upon them and seeing that they were unsupported again advanced in heavy masses and the light division fell back  had their division had the whole of their strength they might have been enabled to hold the position they had won but just as they crossed the river there was an unfounded alarm of a cavalry attack on the flank and the 77th and 88th were halted to repel this and took no share in the advance by the rest of the division  as the shattered regiments fell back before the russians in a state of disorder they saw advancing up the slope behind them the brigade of guards in as regular order as if on parade for a moment the splendid formation was broken as the disordered troops came down upon them but opening their files they allowed the light division to pass through them and then closing up again moved forward in splendid order the highland brigade keeping pace with them on their left while the regiments of the light division reformed in their rear and followed after  steadily under a storm of fire the guards advanced grape canister round shot shell and shot swept through them but they kept forward till nigh crossing bayonets with the russian infantry  at this moment however two british guns mounted on a knoll opened upon the russians the victorious french threatened their flank the russian gunners limbered up and retired and their infantry suddenly fell back  on the right of the light division general sir de lacy evans had also been fighting sternly the second division had advanced side by side with that of prince napoleon the resistance which he encountered was obstinate but more skilled in actual warfare than his brother generals he covered his advance with the fire of eighteen guns and so bore forward suffering far less than the division on his left he had however very heavy fighting before he gained the river the village had been set on fire by the russians and the smoke and flames greatly incommoded the men as they fought their way through it the 95th however dashed across the bridge under a storm of missiles while the 55th and 30th waded through the river and step by step won their way up the hill then the firing ceased and the battle of alma was won  the force under the russians consisted of some 37000 men of whom 3500 were cavalry they had eighty guns besides two light batteries of horse artillery inferior in number as they were the discrepancy was more than outbalanced by the advantage of position and had the troops on both sides been of equally good material the honor of the day should have rested with the defenders  the british loss consisted of 26 officers killed and 73 wounded 327 men killed and 1557 wounded the french had only 3 officers killed and 54 wounded 253 men killed and 1033 wounded the turks were not engaged the russians lost 45 officers killed and 101 wounded 1762 men killed and 2720 wounded the allied army had 126 guns against 96 of the russians but the former owing to the nature of the ground played but a small part in the fight  the whole of the loss fell upon a comparatively small number of the english regiments and as the french had 9000 men in reserve who had not fired a shot there was no season why the greater portion of the army with all the cavalry should not at once have followed on the track of the beaten russians had they done so the war in the crimea would have been over in three days that time however elapsed before a move was made the reason assigned was the necessity of caring for the wounded and burying the dead but this might have been committed to the hands of sailors and marines of whom 5000 might have been landed at night in which case the whole allied army could have marched at day break  it was a sad sight when the four regiments of the light division mustered after their work was done hitherto in the confusion and fierce excitement of the fight men marked not who stood and who fell but now as the diminished regiments paraded mere skeletons of the fine corps which had marched gayly from their campingground of the night before the terrible extent of their losses was manifest tears rolled down the cheeks of strong men who had never flinched in the storm of fire as they saw how many of their comrades were absent and the glory of the victory was dimmed indeed by the sorrow for the dead  i wanted to see a battle harry archer said to captain lancaster who like him had gone through the fight without a scratch but this is more than i bargained for to think of half ones friends and comrades gone and all in about two hours fighting it has been a deadly affair indeed  yes as far as we are concerned archer but not for the whole army i heard doctor alexander say just now that the casualties were about 1500 and that out of 27000 men is a mere nothing to the proportion in many battles the french have i hear lost rather less  i thought in a battle harry said one would see something of the general affair but i certainly did not in fact from the time when we dashed up the river bank till the capture of the battery i saw nothing i knew there were some of our men by the side of me and that we were all pushing forward but beyond that i knew absolutely nothing it was something like going through a tremendous thunder shower with ones head down only a thousand times more so  after parade the men scattered in groups some went down to the river to fill their canteens others strolled through the vineyards picking grapes and in spite of the fact that in many places the dead lay thickly together a careless laugh was sometimes heard the regiments which had not been engaged were at work bringing in the wounded and doctor alexander and his assistants were busy at the ghastly task of amputating limbs and extracting balls  the next day a few officers from the fleet came up among these was hawtry who was charged with a special mission from jack who could not again ask for leave to inquire after his brother the wounded were sent down in arabas and litters to the ships a painful journey of three miles the french wounded fared better as they had wellappointed hospital vans seven hundred and fifty russian wounded were collected and laid together and were given in charge of the inhabitants of a tartar village near dr thomson of the 44th regiment with a servant volunteering to remain in charge of them with the certain risk of capture when the russian troops returned after our departure  on the morning of the 23d the army started continuing its march along the road to sebastopol the way being marked not only by debris thrown away by the retreating russians but by the cottages and pretty villas having been sacked by the cossacks as they retired  the troops halted for the night at katcha where the french were reinforced by 8000 men who were landed from transports just arrived and the english by the scots greys and the 57th as it was found that the enemy had batteries along the northwest of the harbor of sebastopol which would cause delay and trouble to invest while the army engaged in the operation would have to draw all its provisions and stores from the harbor at the mouth of the katcha river it was determined to march round sebastopol and to invest it on the southern side where the russians not expecting it would have made but slight preparations for a resistance  towards the seaface sebastopol was of immense strength mounting seventeen guns at the telegraph battery 104 at fort constantine eighty at fort saint michael forty at battery no 4 and some fifty others in smaller batteries all these were on the north side of the harbor on the southern side were the quarantine fort with fiftyone guns fort alexander with sixtyfour the arsenal battery with fifty fort saint nicholas with 192 and fort paul with eighty in addition to these tremendous defences booms had been fixed across the mouth of the harbor and a threedecker three twodeckers and two frigates sunk in a line forming a formidable barrier against the entry of hostile ships besides all this the whole of the russian black sea fleet were in harbor and prepared to take part in the defence against an attack by sea upon the other hand sebastopol was naturally weak on the land side it lay in a hollow and guns from the upper ground could everywhere search it  at the time when the allied armies arrived before it the only defences were an old loopholed wall a battery of fourteen guns and six mortars and one or two batteries which were as yet scarcely commenced  the march from the katcha to the south side was performed without interruption and on the 26th six days after the battle of alma the allied army reached their new position according to arrangements the british occupied the harbor of balaklava while the french took possession of kamiesch and kaznatch as bases for the supply of their armies at the mouth of balaklava harbor are the ruins of a genoese fort standing 200 feet above the sea this was supposed to be unoccupied as the staff however were entering the town they were astonished by four shells falling close to them  the agamemnon which was lying outside at once opened fire and the fort immediately hung out a flag of truce the garrison consisted only of the commandant and sixty men the officer on being asked why he should have opened fire when he knew that the place could not be held replied that he did so as he had not been summoned to surrender and felt bound in honor to fire until he did so  the british ships at once entered the harbor and the disembarkation of the stores and siegetrain commenced the harbor of balaklava was but illsuited for the requirements of a large army it was some half mile in length and a few hundred yards broad and looked like a little inland lake for the rocks rose precipitously at its mouth and the passage through them made a bend so that the outlet was not visible from a ship once fairly inside the coast is steep and bold the rocky cliff rising sheer up from the waters edge to heights varying from 400 to 2000 feet a vessel coasting along it would not notice the narrow passage or dreamon enteringthat a harbor lay hidden behind on either side of the harbor inside the hills rose steeply on the left hand so steeply that that side was useless for the purposes of shipping on the right hand there was a breadth of flat ground between the water and the hill and here and upon the lower slopes stood the village of balaklava the valley extended for some distance beyond the head of the harbor most of the ground being occupied with vineyards beyond was the wide rolling plain upon which the battles of balaklava and inkerman were to be fought taken completely by surprise the inhabitants of balaklava had made no attempt to escape but upon the arrival of the british general a deputation received him with presents of fruit and flowers  by this time the fleet had come round and the sailors were soon hard at work assisting to unload the transports and get the stores and siege materials on shore it was reported that a marine battery was to be formed and there was eager excitement on board as to the officers who would be selected each of the menofwar contributed their quota and lieutenant hethcote found that he had been told off as second in command and that he was to take a midshipman and twenty men of the falcon  the matter as to the midshipman was settled by captain stuart  you may as well take archer he said you wont like to ask for him because hes your cousin but i asked for his berth you know and dont mind doing a little bit of favoritism this once  and so to jacks intense delight he found that he was to form a portion of the landing party  these were in all 200 in number and their work was in the first place to assist to get the heavy siege guns from the wharf to the front  it is necessary that the position occupied by the allies should be perfectly comprehended in order to understand the battles and operations which subsequently took place it may be described as a triangle with one bulging side the apex of the triangle were the heights on the seashore known as the marine heights  here at a point some 800 feet above the sea where a ravine broke the line of cliffs was the camp of the marines in a position almost impregnable against any enemys force following the seashore on the landslopes of the hills down towards balaklava lay the highland brigade guarding the approach from the plains from the marine heights to the mouth of balaklava valley at the mouth of which were the camps of the cavalry and not far off a sailors camp with heavy guns and 800 men  this side of the triangle continued along over the undulating ground and some three miles farther reached the right flank of the position of the allies above sebastopol which formed the base of our imaginary triangle  this position was a plateau of which one side sloped down to sebastopol the end broke steeply off down into the valley of inkerman while behind the slopes were more gradual to the left it fell away gradually towards the sea this formed the third side of the triangle but between balaklava and sebastopol the land made a wide bulge outwards and in this bulge lay the french harbor of kamiesch  from the marine heights to the crest looking down upon sebastopol was a distance of some seven miles from the right of our position above inkerman valley to kamiesch was about five miles  a glance at the map will enable this explanation to be understood  at the commencement of the siege the british were posted on the right of the allies this no doubt was the post of honor but it threw upon them an enormous increase of work in addition to defending balaklava it was upon them that the brunt of any assault by a russian army acting in the field would fall they would have an equal share of the trenchwork and had five miles to bring up their siege guns and stores whereas the french harbor was close to their camp  it was tremendous work getting up the guns but soldiers and sailors willingly toiled away pushing and hauling and aiding the teams principally composed of bullocks which had been brought up from constantinople and other turkish ports long lines of arabas laden with provisions and stores crawled slowly along between balaklava and the front strings of mules and horses laden with tents and driven by men of every nationality bordering the mediterranean followed the same line  parties of soldiers in fatigue suits went down to sebastopol to assist unloading the ships and bringing up stores parties of officers on ponies brought from varna or other ports on the black sea cantered down to make purchases of little luxuries on board the ships in the harbor or from the levantines who had set up little shops near it all was life and gayety  it is all very well mr archer growled dick simpson an old boatswain as the men paused after helping to drag a heavy gun up one of the slopes in this here weather but it wont be no laughing matter when the winter comes on why these here fields would be just a sheet of mud why bless you last winter i was a staying with a brother of mine what farms a bit of land down in norfolk and after a weeks rain they couldnt put the horses on to the fields this here sile looks just similar only richer and deeper and how they means to get these big carts laden up through it beats me altogether  yes dick jack archer answered but they expect to take the place before the winter comes on  they expects the old tar repeated scornfully for my part i dont think nothing of these soldier chaps why i was up here with the first party as come the day after we got here and there warnt nothing in the world to prevent our walking into it here weve got 50000 men enough sir to have pushed those rotten old walls down with their hands and here we be adigging and ashovelling on the hillside nigh a mile from the place and the russians are adigging and ashovelling just as hard at their side i see em last night after we got back to camp it seems to me as if these here generals wanted to give em time to make the place so strong as we cannot take it before they begins why it stands to reason that the rooshians whove got their guns all stored close at hand their soldiers and their sailors handy and no trouble as to provisions and stores can run up works and arm them just about three times as fast as we can and where shall we be at the end of three months we shall be just ashivering and ashaking and astarving with cold and short of grub on that ere hill and the rooshians will be comfortable in the town alaughing at us dont tell me mr archer my opinion is these ere soldiers are no better than fools they dont seem to have no common sense  i hope its not as bad as all that dick jack laughed but it certainly does seem as if we were purposely giving the russians time to strengthen themselves but youll see when we go at them we shall make short work of them  well i hope so mr archer dick simpson said shaking his head ominously but im dubious about it  by this time the oxen and men had recovered their breath and they again set to at their tiresome work although the weather was fine and the position of the camps high and healthy the cholera which had ravaged their ranks at varna still followed them and during the three first weeks in the crimea the allies lost as many men from this cause as they had done in the battle of alma  by the 4th of october forty pieces of heavy artillery had been brought up to the front and the work of the trenches began in earnest  on the morning of the 10th the russian batteries for the first time opened a heavy fire upon us but the distance was too great for much harm to be done on the 11th the russians made their first sortie which was easily repulsed  on the 17th of october the bombardment commenced the french and english had 117 guns in position the russians 130 the fire commenced at halfpast six by 840 a french magazine at the extreme right blew up killing and wounding 100 men while the french fire at this part was crushed by that of the russians opposed to them all day however the cannonade continued unabating on both sides the menofwar aiding the land forces by engaging the forts  during the night the russians having plenty of guns at hand and labor in abundance mounted a larger number of guns and their superiority was so marked that the bombardment was gradually discontinued and even the most sanguine began to acknowledge that an enormous mistake had been made in not attacking upon our arrival and that it was impossible to say how long the siege would last ammunition too was already running short  for the next day or two however our guns continued their fire but the french had been so completely overpowered by the heavy russian metal that they were unable to assist us the sailors had had their full share of work during the bombardment captain peel who commanded the party was just the man to get the greatest possible amount of work from them always in high spirits taking his full share in all the work and exposing himself recklessly in the heaviest fire he was almost idolized by his men  jack archer lived in a tent with five other midshipmen and was attended upon by one of the foretop men who not having been told off for the party had begged permission to go in that capacity  tom hammond was the most willing of servants but his abilities were by no means equal to his goodwill his ideas of cooking were of the vaguest kind the salt junk was either scarcely warm through or was boiled into a soup the preserved potatoes were sometimes burned from his neglect of putting sufficient water or he had forgotten to soak them beforehand and they resembled bits of gravel rather than vegetables sometimes the boys laughed sometimes they stormed and tom was more than once obliged to beat a rapid retreat to escape a volley of boots and other missiles  at first the tent was pitched in the usual way on the ground but one of the boys in a ramble through the camp had seen an officers tent prepared in a way which added greatly to its comfort and this they at once adopted tom hammond was set to dig a hole of eighteen inches smaller diameter than the circle of the tent it was three feet in depth with perpendicular sides at nine inches from the edge a trench a foot deep was dug in the centre was an old flour barrel filled with earth upon this stood the tentpole the tent was brought down so as to extend six inches into the ditch the nineinch rim of earth standing inside serving as a shelf on which to put odds and ends a wall of sods two feet high was erected round the outside of the little ditch thus a comfortable habitation was formed the additional three feet of height added greatly to the size of the tent as the occupants could now stand near the edges instead of in the centre only it was much warmer than before at night and all draught was excluded by the tent overlapping the ditch and by the wall outside a short ladder at the entrance enabled them to get in and out  tom hammond had grumbled at first at the labor which this freak of his masters entailed but as the work went on and he saw how snug and comfortable was the result he took a pride in it and the time was not far off when its utility was to become manifest indeed later on in the winter the greater portion of the tents were got up in this manner  the camp of the light division was not far from that of the sailors and the two brothers were often together fortunately both of them had so far escaped the illnesses which had already decimated the army     chapter viii   balaklava  on the morning of the 25th harry ran into jacks tent  wake up jack there is a row down near balaklava the russians are coming on in force youre off duty are you not so am i we only came out of the trenches half an hour ago hurry on your things and come along  jack was only a minute or two getting into his clothes the other midshipmen off duty also hurrying up tom hammond brought in four cups of hot coffee which they drank hastily and then munching their hard biscuits as they went the party of four hurried off  on reaching the edge of the plateau the whole scene was visible on four knolls in the plain redoubts had been erected and these were garrisoned by the turks some two miles out ran the little river called the tchernaya which runs through the valley of inkerman into the head of the harbor of sebastopol and upon this a body of russian troops had been for some time encamped large bodies of the enemy were known to be gathered on the mackenzie heights a range of hills which bounded the plain upon the opposite side these had been strongly reinforced and at daybreak the russian army having gathered at the tchernaya advanced upon the turkish redoubts the scene when the boys reached the edge of the plateau was a stirring one great bodies of infantry were marching across the undulating plain strong regiments of cavalry swept hither and thither and two batteries of light guns had already opened on the redoubts lines of british infantry could be seen drawn up at the foot of the slopes from balaklava to the marine heights where the marines were getting the guns in a position to command the plain solid bodies of british cavalry were drawn up near the mouth of the valley the drums and bugles were sounding all over the plateau behind the group and the troops were already forming up and staffofficers were dashing about with orders  there goes my regimental call harry said i must go back again jack  i shall push on jack said come along you fellows were too far off to see much of it here let us get down as near balaklava as we can  so saying the midshipmen set off at a run for a few minutes the guns of no 1 redoubt the farthest out of all replied to the russian fire and then the turks menaced by overwhelming forces and beyond the possibility of any assistance left their guns and bolted across the plain towards the second redoubt few of them however reached it for the russian cavalry swooped down on them and nearly all were sabred as they ran as soon as the russians obtained possession of the redoubt they turned its guns upon the british and the 93d highlanders who were drawn up in front of the entrance to the balaklava valley were forced to fall back our cavalry which were formed up in a slight dip of the ground were invisible to the enemy as the russians advanced the turks in the second redoubt fled towards the third but the russian cavalry were too quick for them and but few escaped the guns were turned by the russians upon the third redoubt and untaught by the fate of their comrades that it was safer to stand than to run the turks here also bolted and ran for the town again did the russian cavalry sweep down the naval guns from the marine heights the french and turkish batteries on the road up to the camp in vain spoke out and sent their shot and shell far out on the plain the distance was too great and many of the turks were cut down the rest reaching our lines where they formed up behind the 93d  by this time the whole sweep from the sebastopol plateau to balaklava was alive with spectators the british infantry were drawn up ready to defend their position or to march down and take part in a general battle heavy columns of the french were marching from their distant camps while groups of generals and mounted officers watched the progress of the fight lord raglan and general canrobert who now commanded the french marshal st arnaud having gone on board ship a day or two after the battle of the alma where he died two days later had taken up their position on some rising ground above kadikoi a village which lay near the mouth of the balaklava valley  as the russian cavalry on the left of their advance crowned the slope they saw the highlanders drawn up in line across the plain they halted till joined by numbers of other squadrons then they dashed at the highlanders as they came sweeping in magnificent array the turks fired a volley and bolted the highlanders stood firm and immovable when the russians came within 600 yards a long flash of fire ran along the british front the distance however was too great and the russians came steadily on although the shot from the british batteries were plunging thick among them  when within 250 yards of the highlanders another flash of fire swept out along the line and this time so great was the effect that the russian squadrons recoiled and in another minute were galloping back towards their main body while a cheer ran along the heights from the marine battery to sebastopol  lord raglan now sent orders to lord lucan to advance and the heavy brigade moved forward just as a large body of russian cavalry came over the brow in front of them the british trumpets rang out the charge and the scots greys and inniskillings who formed the first line of the heavy brigade dashed at the enemy gathering speed as they went these two splendid regiments rode at the heavy masses of russian cavalry faster and faster grew their speed till with a mighty shout they flung themselves upon the foe for a moment all seemed wild confusion to the spectators redcoats and black were inextricably mixed together and over them like a play of rapid lightning was the flash of steel as the swords rose and fell presently the redcoats were seen emerging from the rear having cut their way through the surging mass the flanks of the russian column however were lapping them in and it seemed that the little body would be annihilated when the 4th and 5th dragoon guards forming the second line of the heavy brigade burst upon them like a torrent smitten as if by a thunderbolt the russian cavalry men and horses rolled over before the stroke and the column shattered and broken into fragments galloped away to the shelter of their infantry while a roar of triumph arose from long lines of the allies  by this time the french infantry had arrived upon the ground and balaklava was safe then came the episode by which the battle of balaklava is best known the famous charge of the six hundred an order was sent from lord raglan to lord lucan to advance the light cavalry farther captain nolan who bore the order was himself a light cavalry officer of great enterprise and distinction and who had an unlimited faith in the powers of british light cavalry excited probably by the sight of the glorious feat achieved by the heavies and burning to see it emulated by his comrades of the light regiments he so gave the order to lord lucan that the latter conceived it to be his duty to charge the order was simply to advance but when lord lucan asked him how far are we to advance he replied pointing to the russians there are the enemy and there are the guns  lord lucan conceiving that his orders were absolute ordered lord cardigan to advance upon the guns lord cardigan saw at once the desperate nature of the enterprise the guns were a mile and a half distant backed by the whole russian army the line to be ridden over was swept not only by the fire of the guns he was about to charge but by those of other batteries on the flank no support was possible for the heavy cavalry were at this time far away executing a movement which had been ordered lastly even if successful the charge could be attended with no great results as it would be impossible either to hold or carry away the guns  the enterprise was indeed a desperate one lord cardigan gave the order and the light brigade numbering in all but the strength of a single regiment set out at a trot towards the distant russians as they approached they quickened their speed and the spectators saw with feelings of mixed horror and admiration the enterprise on which they had embarked when at the distance of 1200 yards from the russians thirty pieces of artillery opened fire upon them men and horses rolled over before the iron shower but the squadrons closed up their gaps and rode straight forward with sabres flashing in the sun leaving the plain behind them dotted with killed and wounded  again as they neared the battery the iron shower swept through their ranks then with a mighty shout they dashed upon the guns brief was the struggle here the russian gunners were cut down and gathering together boot to boot the british cavalry rode straight at a russian line of infantry which formed up 100 yards behind the guns poured a volley into them there was no pause but straight and with the shock of an avalanche they hurled themselves at the russians there was a yell a crash the clash of sabre on bayonet the shout of the victor the scream of the dying and the british horsemen burst through the russian line their work was done they were conquerors but alone in an army of enemies turning now they swept back again through the guns on their homeward way the flank batteries belched their fire upon them the rattle of musketry sounded round them a regiment of cavalry was hurled upon their flanks but these weak as they were they dashed aside and wounded and bleeding the remnant of the gallant band rode on until met by the heavy brigade advancing to assist them and cover their retreat  our infantry now made a forward movement the russians fell back and at halfpast eleven the battle of balaklava was over while the british charge was going on 200 of the french cavalry made a brilliant charge on the left and carried a battery but had to retreat with a loss of two captains and fifty men killed and wounded our loss in all was thirteen officers killed or taken and twentyseven officers wounded 162 men killed or taken and 224 men wounded there were 394 horses killed or missing and 126 horses wounded the russians carried off some ten guns from the redoubts which they captured in the morning  jack and his friends returned at the conclusion of the fight to camp where as they had rather expected they met with a severe reprimand for their absence being told that upon such an occasion whether off duty or not their duty was to remain in camp captain peel indeed was nearly sending them back to their ships again but after a very severe reprimand he allowed them to remain the boys went back to their tent somewhat crestfallen but agreed that such a sight as they had witnessed was worth anything  october ended and the batteries of besieged and besiegers continued to play the russians causing much annoyance by the heavy shell which they threw up from their mortars the battery worked by the bluejackets suffering particularly the russians had now 240 guns in their new works a number far superior to those of the allies as yet no damage whatever had been inflicted on the enemys works each day their faces were pitted with shot each night the russians repaired the damages in the mean time the russians had received very large reinforcements two of the imperial grand dukes had also arrived and they were preparing for an attempt to sweep the allies into the sea the weather had set in wet the soldiers were weakened by their incessant work in the trenches by wet and exposure and the strength of many of the regiments was greatly reduced by disease all hopes of capturing the fortress and returning to constantinople to winter were now at an end and the roads having become mere quagmires the supplies of food and of fuel were growing scanty on the 3d jack had been sent down to balaklava with a despatch from captain peel to admiral lyons mr hethcote lent him his pony and having delivered his message in the guardship in the harbor whence it would be taken out to the agamemnon jack went on board some of the transports and discharged a number of commissions with which he had been intrusted by his comrades so numerous were they that he was obliged to get a couple of sacks which were completely filled with hams bottled stout fresh bread potted meats brandy matches and tobacco he had too succeeded in purchasing several waterproof sheets and tarpaulins and these being fastened on the top of the sacks were placed upon the ponys back and taking his bridle jack started through the mud for his long tramp back to camp for it was quite out of the question that the pony could carry him in addition to these burdens not a little laughter was excited on his arrival and there was quite a rush of the various officers to procure their share of jacks purchases for no officer had been down to balaklava for a fortnight and the stores of luxuries were completely exhausted  next night jack and his messmates gave a grand entertainment harry and two other lieutenants of the 33dfor the battle of the alma had made so many death vacancies in the regiment that he had obtained his promotionwere there and two young officers of the 30th who were cousins of one of jacks tentmates it certainly was a close pack tom hammond had obtained some planks and laying these on the flour barrel had contrived a sort of circular table round which the parties sat with their backs to the wall on boxes empty preserved potato tins rum kegs and portmanteaus there was no room for tom to enter the tent so the full dishes were handed in through the entrance and the empty ones passed out each guest of course brought his own plate knife fork spoon and drinking tin as for a change of plates no one dreamed of such a thing  outside the night set in wet and gloomy but four tallow candles stuck in bottles threw a grand illumination  the first course was peasoup it smelt good but it had a suspicious appearance globules of grease floated upon its surface all fell to with a will but with the first spoonful there was a general explosion  what on earth is this jack harry exclaimed  what the deuce is it another said it is filthy  while one of the young officers of the 30th exclaimed to his cousin confound it ned you havent brought us here to poison us have you  this explosion was followed by a simultaneous shout for tom by his six angry masters  the topman put his head in at the slit  what the deuce have you been doing to this soup roared the indignant chorus  soup your honors nothing  nothing dont tell me you ruffian exclaimed allison the oldest of the midshipmen its poison what have you been doing to it  well your honor the only way i can account for it is that a while ago i took off the lid to see if it was boiling nicely when a bit of tallow candle i had in my fingers slipped and fell into it i couldnt get it out though i scalded my fingers in trying and it just melted away in no time i skimmed the fat off the top your honors and didnt think it would make no matter  the shout of laughter which greeted the explanation was loud and general  youre a scoundrel tom allison said and i shall have to ask mr hethcote to disrate you and get some one here who is not a born idiot here take this horrible mess away pour the contents of your plates back into the pot boys and put the plates together you must wash them tom or the tallow will taste in everything we have  the things were passed out of the tent and after five minutes the plates were returned and with them a great tin piled up with irish stew the contents of five tins a cheer rose as the smell of the food greeted their nostrils  hurrah this is something like i dont think theres any mistake this time  nor was there the stew was unanimously voted to be perfect and tom was again called to the tentdoor and solemnly forgiven  then came fried rashers of ham eaten with hard biscuit then came the great triumph of the banqueta great plumpudding which had been sent out from england in a tin ready cooked and which had only required an hours boiling to warm it through  in order to eat this in what the midshipmen called proper style a tin pannikin half filled with brandy was held over the candles and the brandy being then ignited was poured over the pudding not a scrap of this was left when the party had finished and the table being cleared pipes were brought out and lighted the drinkingcups refilled with grog and the party setto to enjoy a long evening  it is a beastly night the one sitting next to the door said peering out into the darkness it is a fine rain or rather a scotch mist so thick i can hardly see the next tent it will be as much as you fellows will be able to do to find your way back to your camps  now allison said let us make ourselves comfortable it is only seven oclock yet and youve got three hours before lights out its my duty as president of the mess to call upon some one for a song but as im a good fellow i will set the example myself upon the present occasion we cant do better than begin with the red white and blue and mind a good chorus every one any one shirking the chorus will have no share of the next round of grog and any one who does not sing when called upon or who attempts to make any base explanations or excuses will have to drink his tin full of salt and water  without further delay allison began his song one very popular at that time there was no occasion for him to use his authority as president in the infliction of fines for every one in turn when called upon did his best and the choruses were heard over the whole of the naval camp  hullo whats all this noise about said a cheery voice presently as a head was put through the opening of the tent  the midshipmen all jumped to their feet  we are having a jollification sir allison said on the things archer brought up from balaklava yesterday are we making too much noise sir  not a bit lads the first lieutenant said its cheerful to hear you it isnt much enjoyment that we get on this bleak plateau well goodnight you mustnt keep it up after lights out you know  thats something like a first lieutenant allison said when mr hethcote had retired most of them look as if theyd swallowed a ramrod and treat middies as if they were the dust of the earth im quite sure that a man who is genial and nice gets his work done ever so much better than do those standoff fellows i see in your camp he said to the officers colonels and majors standing and chatting to the young officers just as pleasantly and freely as a party of gentlemen on shore why the captain of a ship should hold himself as if he were a little god is a thing i have never been able to make out im sure you fellows obey orders on parade none the less promptly and readily because the colonel has been chatting with you in the messroom half an hour before but dont let us waste time archer its your turn for a song  and so merrily the hours passed away until it was time to break up and put out the lights and as the young fellows laughed and sung while the mist and rain came down pitilessly outside they little thought what was preparing for the morrow or dreamed that the churches in sebastopol were crowded with russian soldiers praying the saints to give them victory on the morrow and to aid them to drive the enemies of the czar into the sea     chapter ix   inkerman  it was soon after five in the morning when the pickets of the second division keeping such watch as they were able in the misty light while the rain fell steadily and thickly dimly perceived a gray mass moving up the hill from the road at the end of the harbor although this point was greatly exposed to attack nothing had been done to strengthen the position a few lines of earthworks a dozen guns in batteries would have made the place secure from a sudden attack but not a sod had been turned and the steep hillside lay bare and open to the advance of an enemy  although taken by surprise and wholly ignorant of the strength of the force opposed to them the pickets stood their ground but before the heavy masses of men clambering up the hill they could do nothing and were forced to fall back contesting every foot  almost simultaneously the pickets of the light division were also driven in and general codrington who happened to be making his rounds at the front at once sent a hurried messenger to the camp with the report that the russians were attacking in force the second division was that encamped nearest to the threatened spot general pennefather who as sir de lacy evans was ill on board ship was in command called the men who had just turned out of their tents and were beginning as best they could to light their fires of soaked wood to stand to their arms and hurried forward general adams brigade consisting of the 41st 47th and 49th to the brow of the hill to check the advance of the enemy by the road from the valley while with his own brigade consisting of the 30th 55th and 95th he took post on their flank already however the russians had got their guns on to the high ground and these opened a tremendous fire on the british troops  sir george cathcart brought up such portions of the 20th 21st 46th 57th 63d and 68th regiments as were not employed in the trenches and occupied the ground to the right of the second division general codrington with part of the 7th 23d and 33d took post to cover the extreme of our right attack general bullers brigade was to support the second division on the left while jeffreys brigade with the 80th regiment was pushed forward into the brushwood the third division under sir r england was held in reserve the duke of cambridge with the guards advanced on the right of the second division to the edge of the plateau overlooking the valley of the tchernaya sir george cathcarts division being on his right  there was no manoeuvring each general led his men forward through the mist and darkness against an enemy whose strength was unknown and whose position was only indicated by the flash of his guns and the steady roll of his musketry it was a desperate strife between individual regiments and companies scattered and broken in the thick brushwood and the dense columns of grayclad russians who advanced from the mist to meet them few orders were given or needed each regiment was to hold the ground on which it stood or die there  sir george cathcart led his men down a ravine in front of him but the russians were already on the hillside above and poured a terrible fire into the 63d turning he cheered them on and led them back up the hill surrounded and enormously outnumbered the regiments suffered terribly on their way back sir george cathcart and many of his officers and vast numbers of the men being killed the 88th were surrounded and would have been cut to pieces when four companies of the 77th charged the russians and broke a way of retreat for their comrades  the guards were sorely pressed a heavy russian column bore down upon them and bayonet to bayonet the men strove fiercely with their foes the ammunition failed but they still clung to a small unarmed battery called the sandbag battery in front of their portion and with volleys of stones tried to check their foes fourteen officers and half the men were down and yet they held the post till another russian column appeared in their rear then they fell back but reinforced by a wing of the 20th they still opposed a resolute front to the russians  not less were the second division pressed storms of shot and bullets swept through them column after column of greyclad russians surged up the hill and flung themselves upon them but though suffering terribly the second division still held their ground the 41st was wellnigh cut to pieces the 95th could muster but sixtyfour bayonets when the fight was over and the whole division when paraded when the day was done numbered but 800 men  but this could not last as fast as one assault was repulsed fresh columns of the enemy came up the hill to the attack our ammunition was failing the men exhausted with the struggle and the day was wellnigh lost when at nine oclock the french streamed over the brow of the hill on our right in great force and fell upon the flank of the russians even now the battle was not won the russians brought up their reserves and the fight still raged along the line for another three hours the struggle went on and then finding that even the overwhelming numbers and the courage with which their men fought availed not to shake the defence the russian generals gave up the attack and the battle of inkerman was at an end  on the russian side some 35000 men were actually engaged with reserves of 15000 more in their rear while the british who for three hours withstood them numbered but 8500 bayonets seven thousand five hundred of the french took part in the fight fortyfour british officers were killed 102 wounded 616 men killed 1878 wounded the french had fourteen officers killed and thirtyfour wounded 118 men killed 1299 wounded these losses heavy as they were were yet small by the side of those of the russians terrible indeed was the destruction which the fire of our men inflicted upon the dense masses of the enemy the russians admitted that they lost 247 officers killed and wounded 4076 men killed 10162 wounded in this battle the british had thirtyeight the french eighteen guns engaged the russians had 106 guns in position  jack archer and his comrades were still in bed when the first dropping shots followed by a heavy roll of musketry announced that the russians were upon them accustomed to the roar or guns they slept on till tom hammond rushed into the tent  get up gentlemen get up the russian army has climbed up the hill and is attacking us like old boots the bugles are sounding the alarm all over the camps  in an instant the lads were out of bed and their dressing took them scarce a minute  i cant see ten yards before me jack said as he rushed out by jove aint they going it  every minute added to the din till the musketry grew into one tremendous roar above which the almost unbroken roll of the cannon could scarce by heard along the whole face of the trenches the batteries of the allies joined in the din for it was expected that the russians would seize the opportunity to attack them also  in a short time the fusillade of musketry broke out far to the left and showed that the russians were there attacking the french lines the noise was tremendous and all in camp were oppressed by the sound which told of a mighty conflict raging but of which they could see absolutely nothing  this is awful jack said here they are pounding away at each other and we as much out of it as if we were a thousand miles away dont i wish captain peel would march us all down to help  but in view of the possible sortie it would have been dangerous to detach troops from their places on the trenches and batteries and the sailors had nothing to do but to wait fuming over their forced inaction while a great battle was raging close at hand overhead the russian balls sang in swift succession sometimes knocking down a tent sometimes throwing masses of earth into the air sometimes bursting with a sharp detonation above them and all this time the rain fell and the mist hung like a veil around them presently a mounted officer rode into the sailors camp  where am i he said i have lost my way  this is the marine camp captain peel said stepping forward to him as he drew rein how is the battle going sir  very badly im afraid we are outnumbered by five to one our men are fighting like heroes but they are being fairly borne down by numbers the russians have got a tremendous force of artillery on to the hills which we thought inaccessible to guns there has been gross carelessness on our part and we are paying for it now i am looking for the third division camp where is it  straight ahead sir but i think they have all gone forward we heard them tramping past in the mist  i am ordered to send every man forward every musket is of value how many men have you here in case you are wanted  we have only fifty captain peel said the rest are all in the battery and i dare not move forward without absolute orders as we may be wanted to reinforce them if the enemy makes a sortie  the officer rode on and the sailors stood in groups behind the line of piled muskets ready for an instant advance if called upon  another halfhour passed and the roll of fire continued unabated  it is certainly nearer than it was captain peel said to mr hethcote no orders have come but i will go forward myself and see what is doing even our help small as it is may be useful at some critical point i will take two of the midshipmen with me and will send you back news of what is doing  mr allison and mr archer you will accompany captain peel mr hethcote said  and the two youngsters delighted at being chosen prepared to start at once  if they send up for reinforcements from the battery mr hethcote you will move the men down at once without waiting for me take every man down even those on duty as cooks there is no saying how hard we may be pressed  followed by the young midshipmen captain peel strode away through the mist which was now heavy with gunpowdersmoke they passed through the camp of the second division which was absolutely deserted except that there was a bustle round the hospital marquèes to which a string of wounded some carried on stretchers some making their way painfully on foot was flowing in  many of the tents had been struck down by the russian shot black heaps showed where others had been fired by the shell dimly ahead when the mist lifted could be seen bodies of men while on a distant crest were the long lines of russian guns whose fire swept the british regiments  i suppose these regiments are in reserve jack said as he passed some of sir r englands division lying down in readiness to move to the front when required most of the battalions having already gone forward to support the troops who were most pressed  presently captain peel paused on a knoll close to a body of mounted officers  theres lord raglan allison said nudging jack thats the headquarter staff  at that moment a shell whizzed through the air and exploded in the centre of the group  captain gordons horse was killed and a portion of the shell carried away the leg of general strangeway the old general never moved but said quietly  will any one be kind enough to lift me off my horse  he was laid down on the ground and presently carried to the rear where an hour afterwards he died  jack and his comrades who were but a few yards away felt strange and sick for it was the first they had seen of battle close at hand lord raglan with his staff moved slowly forward captain peel asked if he should bring up his sailors but was told to hold them in reserve as the force in the trenches had already been fearfully weakened  stay here captain peel said to the midshipmen i shall go forward a little but do you remain where you are until i return just lie down behind the crest you will get no honor if you are hit here  the lads were not sorry to obey for a perfect hail of bullets was whistling through the air the mist had lifted still farther and they could obtain a sight of the whole line along which the struggle was raging scarce a quarter of a mile in front of them sometimes the remnants of a regiment would fall back from the front when a fresh battalion from the reserves came up to fill its place then forming again would readvance into the thick belt of smoke which marked where the conflict was thickest sometimes above the roll of musketry would come the sharp rattle which told of a volley by the british rifles  well was it that two out of the three divisions were armed with minies for these created terrible havoc among the russians whose smoothbores were no match for these newlyinvented weapons  with beating hearts the boys watched the conflict and could mark that the british fire grew feebler and in some places ceased altogether while the wild yells of the russians rose louder as they pressed forward exultingly believing that victory lay within their grasp  things look very bad jack allison said ammunition is evidently failing and it is impossible for our fellows to hold out much longer against such terrible odds what on earth are the french doing all this time our fellows have been fighting singlehanded for the last three hours what in the world can they be up to  and regardless of the storm of bullets he leaped to his feet and looked round  hurrah jack here they come column after column ten more minutes and theyll be up hurry up you lubbers he shouted in his excitement every minute is precious and youve wasted time enough surely by jove theyre only just in time there are the guards falling back dont you see their bearskins  they are only just in time jack agreed as he stood beside his comrade another quarter of an hour and they would have had to begin the battle afresh for there would have been none of our fellows left hurrah hurrah he cried as with a tremendous volley and a ringing shout the french fell upon the flank of the russians  the lads had fancied that before that onslaught the russians must have given way at once but no fresh columns of troops topped the hill fresh batteries took the place of those which had suffered most heavily by the fire of our guns and the fight raged as fiercely as ever still the boys had no fear of the final result the french were fairly engaged now and from their distant camps fresh columns of troops could be seen streaming across the plateau  upon our allies now fell the brunt of the fight and the british wearied and exhausted were able to take a short breathingtime then with pouches refilled and spirits heightened they joined in the fray again and as the fight went on the cheers of the british and the shouts of the french rose louder while the answering yell of the russians grew fainter and less frequent then the thunder of musketry sensibly diminished the russian artillerymen were seen to be withdrawing their guns and slowly and sullenly the infantry fell back from the ground which they had striven so hard to win  it was a heavy defeat and had cost them 15000 men but at least it had for the time saved sebastopol for with diminished forces the british generals saw that all hopes of carrying the place by assault before the winter were at an end and that it would need all their effort to hold their lines through the months of frost and snow which were before them  when the battle was over captain peel returned to the point where he had left the midshipmen and these followed him back to the camp where however they were not to stay for every disposable man was at once ordered out to proceed with stretchers to the front to bring in wounded  terrible was the sight indeed in many places the dead lay thickly piled on the ground and the manner in which englishmen russians and frenchmen lay mixed together showed how the tide of battle had ebbed and flowed and how each patch of ground had been taken and retaken again and again here russians and grenadiers lay stretched side by side sometimes with their bayonets still locked in each others bodies here where the shot and shell swept most fiercely lay the dead whose very nationality was scarcely distinguishable so torn and mutilated were they  here a french zouave shot through the legs was sitting up supporting on his breast the head of his dying officer a little way off a private of the 88th whose arm had been carried away besought the searchers to fill and light his pipe for him and to take the musket out of the hand of a wounded russian near who he said had three times tried to get it up to fire at him as he lay  in other cases russians and englishmen had already laid aside their enmity and were exchanging drinks from their waterbottles  around the sandbag battery which the guards had held the dead lay thicker than elsewhere on the plateau while down in the ravine where cathcart had led his men the bodies of the 63d lay heaped together the sailors had before starting fill their bottles with grog and this they administered to friend and foe indiscriminately saving many a life ebbing fast with the flow of blood the lads moved here and there searching for the wounded among the dead awed and sobered by the fearful spectacle more than one dying message was breathed into their ears more than one ring or watch given to them to send to dear ones at home all through the short winter day they worked aided by strong parties of the french who had not been engaged and it was a satisfaction to know that when night fell the greater portion of the wounded british and french had been carried off the field as for the russians those who fell on the plateau received equal care with the allies but far down among the bushes that covered the hillside lay hundreds of wounded wretches whom no succor that day at least could be afforded  the next day the work of bringing in the russian wounded was continued and strong fatigue parties were at work digging great pits in which the dead were laid those of each nationality being kept separate  the british camps on the night after inkerman afforded a strong contrast to the scene which they presented the night before no merry laugh arose from the men crouched round the fires no song sounded through the walls of the tents there was none of the joy and triumph of victory the losses which had been suffered were so tremendous as to overpower all other feeling of the regiments absolutely engaged fully onehalf had fallen and the men and officers chatted in hushed voices over the good fellows who had gone and of the chances of those who lay maimed and bleeding in the hospital tents  to his great relief jack had heard early in the afternoon that the 33d had not been hotly engaged and that his brother was unwounded the two young officers of the 30th who had a few hours before been spending the evening so merrily in the tent had both fallen as had many of the friends in the brigade of guards whose acquaintance he had made on board the ripon and in the regiments which being encamped near by the sailors he had come to know  midshipmen are not given to moralizing but it was not in human nature that the lads as they gathered in their tent that evening should not talk over the sudden change which so few hours had wrought the future of the siege too was discussed and it was agreed that they were fixed where they were for the winter  the prospect was a dreary one for if they had had so many discomforts to endure hitherto what would it be during the next four months on that bleak plateau for themselves however they were indifferent in this respect as it was already known the party on shore would be shortly relieved     chapter x   the great storm  two days after the battle of inkerman the party of sailors who manned the batteries before sebastopol were relieved by a fresh set from on board the menofwar some of those who had been away at the front returned on board ship while others among whom was jack archer were ordered to join the camp at the marine heights above balaklava to fill the places of some men invalided on board ship  the change was in some respects an agreeable one in others the reverse the position was very high and exposed to wind but on the other hand the men being able to obtain materials at balaklava had constructed warm shelters the ravines below were well wooded and they were consequently enabled to keep up cheerful fires whereas at the front the supply of fuel barely sufficed to cook the food and was almost useless for any purposes of warmth there was far less privation here for balaklava lay within twenty minutes walk and stores of all kinds could be bought on board the ships there was too an entire absence of the heavy and continuous work in the wet trenches the great drawback to the position was indeed the absence of excitement and change and the quiet seemed almost preternatural after the almost continual boom of cannon at the front  jack was pleased to find his chum hawtry on duty at the height  this is a grand view hawtry he said as he stood at the edge of the cliff the morning after his arrival  below at his feet lay a great fleet of transports to the left the cliffs stretched away wild and precipitous rising to heights far greater than the point at which they stood some 600 feet above the sea on his right the hill sloped gradually down to the old genoese castle and then sharply to the harbor in which lay several menofwar in balaklava lines of wooden huts had been erected for a hospital and their feltcovered roofs contrasted with the red tiles of the tartar houses and with the white walls and tower of the church along the valley at the foot of the harbor long lines of arabas and packanimals looking like mere specks from the point where the lads were standing could be seen making their way to the front while seven miles distant on the plateau above sebastopol rose like countless white dots the tents of the allied army turning still farther round they saw the undulating plain across which the light cavalry had charged upon the russian guns while standing boldly against the sky was the lofty tableland extending from above the village of inkerman right across the line of sight to the point known as mackenzie heights from a farm belonging to an englishman situated there on these heights were encamped a large body of russian troops  its a splendid view dick jack archer said but he added turning to look at the fleet of transports again i shouldnt like to be on board one of those ships if it came on to blow it must be a rocky bottom and no holdingground  thats what every one is saying jack no one can make out why they dont let them all go inside of course they could not all unload at once but there is room for them to shelter if laid in tiers as they would be in a crowded port yes if we get a storm and they say in the black sea they do have terrific gales during the winter i fear we shall have a terrible business here  two days later they had a taste of what a storm in the black sea was on the afternoon of friday the 10th the wind got up blowing straight into the bay very rapidly the sea rose as dusk came on the sailors on the marine heights gathered on the edge of the cliff and looked anxiously down upon the sea already great waves were tumbling in dashing against the foot of the cliff and sending clouds of spray halfway up to the old castle 200 feet above them the ships were laboring heavily tugging and straining on their cables from the funnels of the steamers volumes of black smoke were pouring showing that they were getting up steam to keep the screws or paddles going and relieve the strain upon their anchors  i wouldnt be aboard one of them craft an old sailor said not for enough money to find me in grog and bacca for the rest of my life if the gale gets stronger half them ships will be ashore afore morning and if they do god help those on board  happily the storm did not increase in violence and when morning broke it was found that although many of the vessels had dragged their anchors and some damage had been done by collisions none had gone ashore the knowledge however of how heavy a sea got up in a gale of even moderate force and how frightfully dangerous was the position of the vessels would it might be thought have served as a lesson but unhappily it did not do so the naval officer who was in charge of the harbor was obstinate and again refused the request of the masters of many of the transports that the shipping might all be allowed to enter the harbor he refused and upon him is the responsibility of the terrible loss of life which ensued on the 14th the wind again began to rise and the sailors as night came on looked over the sea  we are going to have a bad night of it again the officer in command of the post said as he gazed seaward it looks as wild a night as ever i saw look how fast the scud is flying overhead last weeks gale was a stiff one but unless im mistaken it will be nothing to that which is upon us  louder and louder roared the wind till men could scarce keep their feet outside shelter the tents shook and rocked men could hardly hear each others voices above the storm and even in the darkness of night the sheets of foam could be seen dashing up to the very walls of the castle  jack archer and dick hawtry who with two other midshipmen occupied a tent sat listening awestruck to the fury of the gale there was a gust fiercer than usual accompanied by a crack like the sound of a pistol followed by a stifled shout  theres a tent down hawtry exclaimed and i shouldnt wonder  he did not finish for at the moment the pole of their own tent broke asunder like a pipe and in an instant the four were buried beneath the folds of the canvas with much shouting and laughter they struggled to the entrance and made their way out half the tents were already levelled to the ground and ten minutes later not one remained standing the midshipmen crowded into the turf huts which some of the officers had had erected scarcely had they entered when there was the boom of a heavy gun  i thought so dick hawtry said theres the first of them how many more will there be before morning  the door opened and a sailor put in his head  gentlemen the captain says you are to turn out hes going to take a party down to the castle with ropes  in a few minutes a hundred men mustered and moved down the hill so fierce was the gale that during the squalls it was impossible to keep themselves on their feet and all had to lie down till the fury of the gust had passed it was pitch dark and they groped rather than made their way along fast now one after another came the sound of the signal guns  there must be a dozen of them adrift dick shouted into his friends ear during one of the lulls god help them all what will become of them a ship would be dashed to pieces like an eggshell against these cliffs  when they reached the lowest point of the cliff the party were halted and told to lie down and keep themselves in readiness in case their services should be required the officers struggled forward to the edge and tried to see what was going on down in the bay below but little could be seen save the mighty sheets of spray as the waves struck the cliffs here and there in the wild waters they fancied occasionally that they could see the dark forms of the ships but even of this they could not have been certain save for the twinkling lights which rose and fell and dashed to and fro like fireflies in their flight now and then the flash of a cannon momentarily showed some ship laboring in the trough of the mountainous sea  i believe that is the black prince jack shouted to his friend that big steamer which has been lying there the last week if it is shes ever so much nearer to shore than she was  suddenly a blue light threw its glare on the sea it came from almost under their feet  good heavens dick there is a vessel on the rocks already and look a dozen more close in  the example was followed and several other blue lights were burned showing plainly the terrible nature of the scene the vessels were wallowing in the tremendous waves many had cut away their masts to relieve the strain on their anchors the paddles and screws of the steamers were working at full speed for the lines of white foam behind them could be plainly seen but even this availed them but little for almost every ship lay nearer to the line of cliffs than she did when night fell several were close to the foot of the rocks and the lookerson noticed that some which had lain near the shore were missing on the decks of the ships could be seen numbers of persons holding on to ropes and bulwarks sometimes from the deck of a vessel a rocket soared up the wind catching it as it rose and carrying it far inland  by the captains orders several blue lights which the party had brought down were burned to show those on board that their position was perceived but beyond this nothing could be done presently even above the noise of the gale a tremendous crash was heard and they fancied that they heard a wild shout come faintly up  can nothing be done jack shouted to his friend  nothing sir an old sailor said close by they are all doomed there were over thirty ships there this morning for i counted them and i doubt if one will live out the night  by this time the sailors unable to lie inactive had joined the officers and all were scattered in groups along the cliff  is there no possible way of getting down near the water jack said  i dont think so sir but if it were daylight we might make a shift to try  let us try anyhow jack said  oh there is another as another crash was heard above the gale  anything is better than standing here i dont think the cliff goes quite sheer down everywhere let us try dick it would be a relief to be doing something  all right jack let you and i stick together do you lads he said turning to three or four sailors who were standing by keep close to us and lend a hand at the point where they were standing it was clearly impossible to get down for the rock sloped straight from their feet farther to the left however it went down more gradually and here the boys began to try to descend  there is a sort of hollow here jack shouted a sort of ravine this is our best place  cautiously step by step holding on to such bushes as grew among the rocks pausing sometimes flattened against the rocks by the force of the gust and drenched every moment by the sheets of spray the boys made their way down till they paused at a spot where the rock fell away sheer under their feet they could go no farther at the moment they heard a wild scream a vessel appeared through the darkness below and crashed with a tremendous thud against the rocks the masts which were so close that the boys seemed almost able to jump upon them as they reached nearly to the level on which they were standing instantly going over the side peering over they could see the black mass in the midst of the surging white waters at their feet the sailors had paused some way up the ascent appalled by the difficulties which the boys lighter and more active had accomplished  go up to the top again hawtry said climbing back to them bring down one of those spars we brought down a block a long rope and a short one to serve as a guy get halfadozen more hands youd better fix a rope at the top firmly and use it to steady you as you return theres a ship ashore just underneath us and i think we can get down  in a few minutes the sailors descended again carrying with them a spar some twenty feet long with immense difficulty this was lowered to the spot which the boys had reached one of the sailors had brought down a lantern and by its light a block was lashed to the end and a long rope roved through it then a shorter rope was fastened to the end as a guy and the spar lowered out till it sloped well over the edge the lower edge was wedged in between two rocks and others piled round it  now dick said i will go down  youll never get down alive sir one of the sailor said the wind will dash you against the cliff ill try sir if you like im heavier  let me go down with you jack said the two of us are heavier than a man and we shall have four legs to keep us off the cliff besides we can help each other down below  all right dick said fasten us to the rope hardy make two loops so that we shall hang face to face and yet be separate and give me a short rope of two or three fathoms long so that we can rope ourselves together and one hold on in case the other is washed off his feet when we get down look here hardy do you lie down and look over the edge and when you hear me yell let them hoist away now for it  the boys were slung as dick had ordered lower away steadily dick said stop lowering if we yell  in another minute the lads were swinging in space some ten feet out from the face of the cliff for the first few yards they descended steadily and then as the rope lengthened the gusts of wind flung them violently against the face of the cliff  fend her off with your legs jack thats the way by jove thats a ducking he said as a mighty rush of spray enveloped them as a mountainous sea struck the rock below i think we shall do it theres something black down below i think some part of her still holds together slowly he shouted up in one of the pauses of the gale and hardys response of aye aye sir came down to them  it was a desperate three minutes but at the end of that time bruised bleeding halfstunned by the blows halfdrowned by the sheets of water which flew over them the lads feet touched the rocks these formed a sloping shelf of some thirty feet wide at the foot of the cliff  the wreck which had appeared immediately under them was forty feet away and appeared a vague misshapen black mass they had been seen for they had waved the lantern from the edge of the cliff before starting and they had several times shouted as they descended and as they neared the ground they were delighted at hearing by an answering shout that their labors had not been in vain and that some one still survived  throw us a rope dick shouted at the top of his voice and in a moment they heard a rope fall close to them groping about in the darkness they found it just as a wave burst below them and dashing high over their heads drove them against the rock and then floated them off their feet the rope from above held them however lower away dick yelled as he regained his feet and then aided by the rope from the ship they scrambled along and were hauled on to the wreck before the next great sea came  ive broken my arm dick jack said but never mind me now how many are there alive  there were sixteen men huddled together under the remains of the bulwark the greater portion of the ship was gone altogether and only some forty feet of her stern remained high on the rocky ledge on which she had been cast the survivors were for the most part too exhausted to move but those who still retained some strength and vigor at once set to work in pairs they were fastened in the slings and hauled up direct from the deck of the vessel another rope being fastened to them and held by those on the wreck by which means they were guided and saved somewhat from being dashed against the cliff in the ascent  when those below felt by the rope no longer passing between their hands that the slings had reached the top they waited for a minute to allow those in them to be taken out and then hauling upon the rope pulled the slings down again for a fresh party so slowly and painfully the whole party were two by two taken up from the wreck  several times while the operation was being performed great crashes were heard followed by loud shouts and screams as vessel after vessel drove ashore to the right or left of them but jack and his friend who consulted together agreed that by no possibility could these be aided as it was only just at the point where the wreck lay that the rocks at the foot of the cliff were high enough to be above all but exceptionally high waves and any one adventuring many yards either to the right or left would have been dashed to pieces against the cliff by the first wave  the midshipmen were the last to leave the ship dick had in vain begged his messmate to go up in one of the preceding batches as the last pair would necessarily be deprived of the assistance from the lower rope which had so materially aided the rest jack however refused to hear of it when the slings came down to them for the last time they put them on and stood on the wreck watching till a great wave came when it had passed they slipped down the side of the ship by a rope and hurried over the rocks till immediately under the spar whose position was indicated by a lantern held there then in answer to their shout the rope tightened and they again swung in the air  the wind blew no more fiercely than before indeed it was scarce possible it could do so but they were now both utterly exhausted during the hour and a half which they had stood upon the remains of the wreck they had been every minute or two deluged with water sometimes indeed the sea had swept clean over them and had it not been that they had lashed themselves with ropes they must have been swept away  every great wave had swept away some plank or beam of the wreck and when they left it scarce a fragment of the deck remained attached to the rudderpost terrible was the buffeting they received as they ascended and time after time they were dashed with immense force against the face of the cliff  to jack the noise and confusion seemed to increase a strange singing sounded in his ears and as the slings reached the top and a burst of cheering broke from the seamen there all consciousness left him  the officer in command of the party was himself at the spot he and many others having made their way down when the news spread that a rescue was being attempted dick too was unable to stand and both were carried by the sailors to the top of the slope here a cup of strong rumandwater was given to dick while some pure spirits poured down his throat soon recalled jack to consciousness the latter upon opening his eyes would have got up but this his officer would not allow and he was placed on a stretcher and carried by four tars up to the heights where he was laid in one of the sod huts and his arm which was badly fractured set by the surgeon  the sixteen rescued men had as they gained the top been at once taken down into balaklava the sole survivors of the crews of over twenty ships which had gone to pieces in that terrible hurricane  of the fleet of transports and merchantmen which trim and in good order had lain in the bay the afternoon before some halfdozen only had weathered the hurricane the city of london alone had succeeded in steaming out to sea when the gale began the jason and a few others had ridden to their anchors through the night the rest of the fleet had been destroyed victims to the incompetence and pigheadedness of the naval officer in charge of the harbor that there was ample room for all within it was proved by the fact that later on a far larger number of ships than that which was present on the day of the gale lay comfortably within it  the largest ship lost was the prince with whom nearly 300 men went down even inside the harbor vessels dragged their anchors and drifted ashore so terrible was the gale which indeed was declared by old sailors and by the inhabitants of the town to be the most violent that they ever experienced enormous quantities of stores of all kinds which would have been of immense service to the troops in the winter were lost in the gale and even in the camps on shore the destruction was very great     chapter xi   taken prisoners  that arm of yours always seems to be getting itself damaged jack hawtry said next morning as he came into the hut you put it in the way of a bullet last time and now youve got it smashed up how do you feel altogether  i am awfully bruised dick black and blue all over and so stiff i can hardly move  thats just my case dick said though as you see i can move the doctors been feeling me all over this morning and he said it was lucky i was a boy and my bones were soft for if i had been a man i should have been smashed up all over as to my elbows and my knees and all the projecting parts of me i havent got a bit of skin on them and my uniform is cut absolutely to ribbons however old boy we did a good nights work we saved sixteen lives we got no end of credit and the chief says he shall send a report in to the admiral so we shall be mentioned in despatches and it will help us for promotion when we have passed the bay is a wonderful sight the shores are strewn with floating timber bales of stores compressed hay and all sorts of things fellows who have been down to the town told me that lots of the houses have been damaged roofs blown away and those gingerbreadlooking balconies smashed off as for the camps even with a glass there is not a single tent to be seen standing on the plateau the gale has made a clean sweep of them what a night the soldiers must have had i am put on the sick list for a few days so i shall be able to be with you thats good news isnt it  wonderfully good jack laughed as if i havent enough of your jaw at other times and how long do you suppose i shall be before i am out  not for some little time jack the doctor says youve got four ribs broken as well as your arm  have i jack said surprised i know he hurt me preciously while he was feeling me about this morning but he didnt say anything about broken ribs  a broken rib is a much less serious business than a broken arm and in ten days jack was up and about again feeling generally stiff and sore and with his arm in a sling the surgeon had talked of sending him on board ship but jack begged so hard for leave to remain with the party ashore that his request was granted  winter had now set in in earnest the weather was cold and wet sometimes it cleared up overhead and the country was covered with snow a month after the accident jack was fit for duty again seeing what chums the lads were the officer in command had placed them in the same watch for here on land the same routine was observed as on board ship the duties were not severe the guns were kept bright and polished the arms and accoutrements were as clean as if at sea each day the tars went through a certain amount of drill and fatigue parties went daily down to the harbor to bring up stores but beyond this there was little to do one of the occupations of the men was chopping wood for fuel the sides of the ravine immediately below the battery had long since been cleared of their brushwood and each day the parties in search of fuel had to go farther away upon the day after jack returned to duty he and hawtry were told off with a party of seamen to go down to cut firewood each man carried his rifle in addition to his chopper for although they had never been disturbed at this occupation the russians were known not to be far away the sailors were soon at work hacking down the undergrowth and lopping off branches of trees some were making them up into faggots as fast as the others cut them and all were laughing and jesting at their work  suddenly there was a shout and looking up they saw that a party of russians had made their way noiselessly over the snowclad ground and were actually between them and the heights at the same moment a volley of musketry was poured in from the other side and three or four men fell  form up form up hawtry shouted well together lads we must make a rush at those beggars ahead dont fire till i tell you then give them a volley and go at them with the buttend of your muskets then let every one who gets through make a bolt for it  the sailors some twenty strong threw themselves together and headed by the midshipmen made a rush at the russians these opened fire upon them and several dropped but the remainder went on at the double until within twenty yards of the enemy when pouring in a volley and clubbing their muskets they rushed upon them  for a moment there was a sharp mèlèe several of the sailors were shot or bayoneted but the rest using the buttends of their muskets with tremendous execution fought their way through their opponents jack had shot down two men with his revolver and having got through was taking his place at the rear of the menthe proper place for an officer in retreatwhen he saw hawtry fall a russian ran up to bayonet him as he lay when jack running back shot him through the head in a moment he was surrounded and while in the act of shooting down an assailant in front he was struck on the back of the head with the butt of a musket and fell stunned across the body of his friend when he recovered consciousness he found that he was being carried along by four russians he could hear the boom of cannon and the rattle of musketry and knew that the defenders on the heights were angrily firing at the retreating party who had so successfully surprised them as soon as his bearers perceived that jack had opened his eyes they let him drop hauled him to his feet and then holding him by his collar made him run along with them  when they had mounted the other side of the slope and were out of fire of the guns the party halted and jack hearing his own name called looked round and saw hawtry in the snow where his captors had dropped him  hullo dick old fellow jack shouted joyfully so there you are i was afraid they had killed you  im worth a lot of dead men yet jack ive been hit in the leg and went down worse luck and that rascally russian would have skewered me if you hadnt shot him you saved my life old fellow and made a good fight for me and i shall never forget it but it has cost you your liberty  thats no great odds jack said it cant be much worse stopping a few months in a russian prison than spending the winter upon the heights besides with two of us together we shall be as right as possible and maybe when your leg gets all right again well manage to give them the slip  the russian officer in command of the party which was about 200 strong now made signs to the boys that they were to proceed  dick pointed to his leg and the officer examined the wound it was a slight one the ball having passed through the calf missing the bone  he was however unable to walk a litter was formed of two muskets with a greatcoat laid between them and dick being seated on this was taken up by four men and jack taking his place beside him the procession started they halted some four miles off at a village in a valley beyond the tchernaya  the next day the boys were placed on ponies and under the escort of an officer and six troopers conducted to sebastopol here they were taken before a russian general who by means of an interpreter closely examined them as to the force condition and position of the army  the lads however evaded all questions by stating that they belonged to the fleet and were only on duty on the heights above balaklava and were in entire ignorance of the force of the army and the intentions of its general as to the fleet they could tell nothing which the russians did not already know  the examination over they were conducted to one of the casemates of fort st nicholas here for a fortnight they remained seeing no one except the soldier who brought them their food the casemate was some thirty feet long by eighteen wide and a sixtyeightpounder stood looking out seaward there the boys could occasionally see the ships of war of the allies as they cruised to and fro  it was very cold for the opening was of course unglazed they had each a heap of straw and two blankets and these in the daytime they used as shawls for they had no fire and it was freezing sharply  dicks leg had been examined and dressed by a surgeon upon his first arrival but as the wound was not serious and the surgeons were worked night and day with the enormous number of wounded at inkerman and in the various sorties with which the town was crowded he did not again come near his patient the wound however healed rapidly  as jack remarked the scanty rations of black bread and tough meatthe latter the produce of some of the innumerable bullocks which arrived at sebastopol with convoys too exhausted and broken down for further servicewere not calculated to cause any feverish excitement to the blood nor had it been so would the temperature have permitted the fever to rise to any undue height  their guards were kind to them so far as was in their power and upon their using the word tobacco and making signs that they wanted to smoke furnished them with pipes and with tobacco which although much lighter and very different in quality from that supplied on board ship was yet very smokable and much mitigated the dulness from which the boys suffered a few days after their captivity the boys heard the church bells of sebastopol ringing merrily  i wonder what all this is about dick said not for a victory ill be bound  why bless me jack exclaimed if it isnt christmas day and we had forgotten all about it now that is hard monstrously hard the fellows on the heights will just be enjoying themselves today i know they were talking about getting some currants and raisins from on board ship and there will be plumduff and all sorts of things i wonder how theyre all getting on at home theyre sure to be thinking often enough of us but it will never enter their minds that here we are cooped up in this beastly hole  the day however did not pass unnoticed for a russian officer who spoke english called upon them and said that he came at the request of the governor himself to express to them his regret that their quarters were so uncomfortable and their fare so bad but he said we cannot help ourselves every barrack in the town is crowded every hospital every private house even filled with wounded we have fifty or sixty thousand troops and near twenty thousand sick and wounded your people are very good not to fire at the town for if they did i do not know what the poor fellows would do for today the governor has sent you down a dinner from his own table together with a few bottles of wine and spiritsand what you will not prize less for i see you smoke a box of cigars it is very cold here i will see that you have some more blankets  two soldiers came in with baskets the one with tincovered dishes the other with wines these were set out on the ground and the boys after sending a message expressing their cordial thanks to the general for his thoughtfulness sat down when alone in the highest spirits to their unexpected feast  this is a glorious spread jack i wonder what all these dishes are i dont recognize any of them however this is soup there is no doubt about that so lets fall to on that to begin with but first of all get out the cork of one of those champagne bottles now fill up your tin jack and lets drink god bless all at home and a merry christmas to them well have our other toasts after dinner i couldnt begin till we drank that now set to  the dishes were not as cold as might have been expected for each had been enveloped in flannel before placing it in the basket the soup was pronounced excellent and the unknown meats primebetter than anything they had tasted since they left england there were sweets too which they made a clean sweep of then they called their guard to whom they gave the remains of their dinner together with a strong pannikin of water and spirits to his extreme delight  then making themselves snug in the straw wrapping themselves well in their blankets fencing in their candle so that it was sheltered from the draughts they opened a bottle of brandy drank a variety of toasts not forgetting the health of the governor who they agreed was a brick they sang a song or two then blew out the light and thoroughly warm and comfortable were asleep in a minute or two  a few days later an officer came in signed to them to make their blankets into a bundle and to follow him  the boys slipped four bottles of spirits which they had still remaining and also the stock of cigars into the rolls then holding the bundles on their shoulders they followed him  dick although still weak on his legs was now able to walk  presently they came to a large party of men some of whom had their arms in slings some were bandaged on the head some lay in stretchers on the ground  it is a convoy of wounded jack said i suppose were going to be taken into the interior  an officer evidently in charge saluted the boys as they came up and said something in russian  they returned the salute he was a pleasantlooking fellow with lightblue eyes and yellowish moustache and beard he looked at them and then gave orders to a soldier who entered the building and returned with two peasants cloaks lined with sheepskin similar to the one he himself wore  these were handed to them and the midshipmen expressed their warmest gratitude to him their meaning if not their words being clearly intelligible  these are splendid jack said theyve got hoods too to go over the head this is something like comfort i wish our poor fellows up above there had each got one it must be awful up on the plateau now fancy twelve hours in the trenches and then twelve hours in the tents with no fires and nothing but those thin greatcoats and scarcely anything to eat now theres a move  a strong party of soldiers came down lifted the stretchers and in a few minutes the whole convoy were at the waters edge other similar parties were already there and alongside were a number of flat barges upon these the invalids walked or were carried and the barges were then taken in tow by ships boats and rowed across the harbor to the north side  i hope to goodness jack said looking up at the heights behind them along which the lines of entrenchments were clearly visible against the white snow that our fellows wont take it into their heads to have a shot at us from our battery we often amused ourselves by sending a shell from one of the big lancaster guns down at the ships in the harbor but i never dreamed that i was likely to be a cockshy myself  the usual duel was going on between the batteries and the puffs of white smoke rose from the dark line of trenches and drifted up unbroken across the deep blue of the still wintry sky  but happily the passage of the flotilla of boats attracted no attention and they soon arrived at the shore close to the work known as battery no 4  here they were landed those who could not walk were lifted into carts of which some hundreds stood ranged alongside the rest fell in on foot and the procession started the boys to their satisfaction found that the officer who had given them the coats was in charge of a portion of the train and as they started he stopped to speak a word or two to them to which they replied in the most intelligible manner they could by offering him a cigar which a flash of pleasure in his face at once showed to be a welcome present  it took some time to get the long convoy in motion for it consisted of some 700 or 800 carts and about 5000 sick and wounded of whom fully threefourths were unable to walk it mounted to the plateau north of the harbor wound along near the great north fort and then across undulating land parallel with the sea they stopped for the night on the katcha where the allied army had turned off for their flank march to the southern side  the boys during the march were allowed to walk as they liked but two soldiers with loaded muskets kept near them they discussed the chances of trying to make their escape but agreed that although they might be able to slip away from the convoy the probability of their making their way through the russian troops to their own lines at balaklava or sebastopol was so slight that the attempt would be almost madness their figures would be everywhere conspicuous on the snow their footsteps could be followed they had no food and were ignorant of the language and country altogether they determined to abandon any idea of escaping for the present  there were but a dozen soldiers with the convoy the officers being medical men in charge of the wounded a halt was made in a sheltered spot near the river and close to the village of mamaschia which was entirely deserted by its inhabitants  the worst cases of sickness were carried into the houses and the rest prepared to make themselves as comfortable as they could in or under the wagons stores of forage were piled by the village for the use of the convoys going up and down and the drivers speedily spread a portion of this before their beasts  the guard and such men as were able to get about went off among the orchards that surrounded the village to cut fuel the boys special guard remained by them when the doctor whom they regarded as their friend came up to them he brought with him another officer as interpreter who said in broken french  voulezvous donner votre parole pas essayez echapper  jack was as ignorant of french as of russian but dick knew a little he turned to jack and translated the question  tell him we will give our words not to try and escape during the march or till we tell him to the contrary this was almost beyond dick  nous donnons notre parole pour le prèsent he said pour la marche vous comprenez si nous changons notrei wonder what mind is he grumbled to himselfintention nous vous dirons  this was intelligible although not good french and their friend having shaken hands with them as if to seal the bargain told the soldiers that they need no longer keep a watch on the prisoners and then beckoned them to accompany him the boys had at starting placed their bundles upon a cart to which they had kept close during the march putting these on their shoulders they accompanied their friend to a cart which was drawn up three or four feet from the wall of a house they set to work at once and with the aid of some sticks and blankets of which there was a good supply in the wagon made a roof covering the space between it and the house hung others at the end and side and had soon a snug tent erected  one of the soldiers brought a large truss of straw and another a bundle of firewood the blanket at the end of the tent sheltered from the wind was drawn aside and a great fire speedily blazed up at the entrance the straw was shaken out to form a soft seat just inside the tent all three produced their pipes and lit them while the doctors servant prepared over the fire a sort of soup with the rations this turned out to be by no means bad and when after it the boys produced one of their bottles of brandy and three cigars the russian doctor patted them on the back and evidently told them that they were firstrate fellows  for halfanhour he smoked his cigar and sipped his tin of brandy and water then explaining by signs that he must go and look after his wounded left them  the boys chatted for another halfhour and then stowing their brandy carefully away they shook up the straw into a big bed and wrapping themselves in their sheepskins were soon soundly asleep but it was long after midnight before the doctor returned from his heavy work of dressing wounds and administering medicine and stretched himself on the straw beside them     chapter xii   prisoners on parole  day after day the convoy made its way northward without any incident of importance happening the midshipmen were glad to find that thanks to their sheepskin cloaks and pointed hoods they passed through the towns without attracting any attention whatever  the convoy lessened in length as it proceeded the animals broke down in great numbers and died by the road under the task of dragging the heavy wagons through the deep snow  at a town of some size where they halted for two days relief was afforded by the wheels being taken off the wagons and rough runners affixed the wheels being placed on the carts as that they could be put on again in case of a thaw  famine however did more that fatigue in destroying the animals for although good exertions had been made to form depots of forage along the roads these were exhausted faster than they could be collected by the enormous trains which laden with provisions and warlike stores were making their way to sebastopol from the interior of russia there was no lack of food for the men for ample stores of black bread were carried and a supply of meat was always obtainable at the end of the days journey by the carcase of some bullock which had fallen and then been shot during the days march  but though the train diminished in length its occupants diminished even more rapidly every morning before starting a burying party were busy interring the bodies of those who had died during the previous days march or in the night  when the halt was made at a village the papa or priest of the place performed a funeral mass when as was more common they encamped in the open the grave was filled in a rough cross was erected over it and the convoy proceeded on its march  the midshipmen found the journey dreary and uninteresting in the extreme  after  leaving the crimea the country became a dead flat which though bright in summer with a wide expanse of waving grain was inexpressibly mournful and monotonous as it lay under its wide covering of snow here and there far across the plain could be seen the low flatroofed huts of a russian village or the massivelybuilt abode of some rich landed proprietor  scarce a tree broke the monotony of the wide plain and the creaking of the carts and the shouts of the drivers seemed strangely loud as they rose in the dense silence of the plain  from the first day of starting the midshipmen set themselves to learn something of the language the idea was jacks and he pointed out to hawtry who was rather disinclined to take the trouble that it would in the first place give them something to think about and be an amusement on the line of march in the second it would render their captivity less dull and lastly it would facilitate their escape if they should determine to make the attempt  as they walked therefore alongside their friend the doctor they asked him the names of every object around them and soon learned the russian words for all common objects the verbs were more difficult but thanks occasionally to the doctor who spoke french joining them at their encampment at night they soon learned the sentences most commonly in use  as they had nothing else to do or to think about their progress was rapid and by the end of a month they were able to make themselves understood in conversations upon simple matters  they had been much disappointed when upon leaving the crimea the convoy had kept on north instead of turning west for they had hoped that odessa would have been their place of captivity  it was a large and flourishing town with a considerable foreign population and being on the sea might have offered them opportunities for escape the russians however had fears that the allied fleets might make an attack upon the place and for this reason such few prisoners as fell into their hands were sent inland  the journeys each day averaged from twelve to fifteen miles twelve however being the more ordinary distance the sky was generally clear and bright for when the morning was rough and the snow fell the convoy remained in its haltingplace  the cold was by no means excessive during the day and although the snow was deep and heavy there was no difficulty in keeping up with the convoy as the pace of the bullocks was little over a mile and a half an hour at night they were snug enough for the doctor had adapted an empty wagon as their sleepingplace and this with a deep bed of straw at the bottom blankets hung at the sides and others laid over the top constituted as comfortable a shelter as could be desired  at last after a months travelling the doctor pointed to a town rising over the plain and signified that this was their haltingplace  it was a town of some seven or eight thousand inhabitants and the mosquelike domes of the churches shining brightly in the sun and the greenpainted roofs and bright colors of many of the houses gave it a gay and cheerful appearance  the convoy made its way through the streets to large barracks now converted into a hospital when the sick had been taken into the wards the doctor proceeded with the midshipmen to the residence of the governor  the boys had laid aside the sheepskin cloaks which had proved so invaluable during their journey and as they walked through the streets in their midshipmans uniform attracted a good deal of attention  they were at once shown in to the governor an officer of some fiveandthirty years old with a fierce and disagreeable expression of countenance he was a member of a high russian family but as a punishment for various breaches of discipline arising from his quarrelsome disposition and misconduct he had been appointed governor to this little town instead of going with his regiment to the front  saluting him the doctor delivered to him an order for the safe guardianship of the two english officers  ah he said as he perused the document and glanced at the midshipmen if these are british officers i can scarcely understand the trouble they are giving us they are mere boys i thought their uniform was red the soldiers who were brought here a month ago were all in red  these are young naval officers the doctor said i understand that some of the sailors are serving on shore and these were captured i am told when out with a party of their men cutting fuel  a wonderful capture truly the governor said sneeringly two boys scarce out of the nursery  it cost us some men the doctor said calmly for i hear from the officer who brought them in that we lost altogether fifteen men and the sailors would all have got away had it not been that one of these young officers was shot in the leg and the other stood by him and shot several men with his revolver before he was captured  a perfect st george the commandant sneered well sir your duty is done and i will see to them are they on parole  they gave me their parole not to try to escape during the journey and have expressed their willingness to renew it  it matters little one way or the other the governor said unless they could fly they could not make their way through the country there sir that will do  the doctor bowed shook hands with the boys and without a word went out touching his lips with his fingers to them as he turned his back to the governor a movement which the lads understood at once as a hint that it would be as well to say nothing which might show that they had any knowledge of russian  the governor rang a handbell and a sergeant entered the governor wrote a few words on a piece of paper  take these prisoners to count preskoffs he said and deliver this order to him  the sergeant motioned the lads to follow him with a bow to the governor which he passed unacknowledged they followed the soldier  a disagreeable brute that jack said a little work in the trenches would do him good and take some of his cockiness out of him that was a good idea of the doctor not saying goodbye in russian i dont suppose we shall run against that fellow again but it we did he might make it so disagreeable that we might be driven to show him a clean pair of heels  he didnt ask for our parole dick said so we shall be justified in making a bolt if we see a chance  passing through the streets the sergeant led them through the town and out into the country beyond  where on earth is he taking us to jack wondered i would bet that he has quartered us on this count preskoff from pure spite i wonder what sort of chap he is  after half an hours walking they approached a large chateau surrounded by smaller buildings  hes a swell evidently dick said we ought to have comfortable quarters here  they entered a large courtyard across one side of which stood the house and the sergeant proceeding to the main entrance rang the bell it was opened by a tall man dressed in full russian costume  i have a message for the count from the commandant the sergeant said  the count is absent the servant answered but the countess is in  i will speak to her  leaving them standing in the hall the man ascended a wide staircase and in a minute or two returned and motioned to the sergeant to follow him  they ascended the stairs and entered a large and handsome room in which sat a lady of some forty years old with three younger ones of from sixteen to twenty years old  countess preskoff was a very handsome woman and her daughters had inherited her beauty  the sergeant advanced and handed to her the order she glanced at it and an expression of displeasure passed across her face  the commandants orders shall be obeyed she said coldly and the sergeant saluting retired  the countess turned to her daughters  the commandant has quartered two prisoners english officers upon us she said of course he has done it to annoy us i suppose these are they and she rose and approached the lads who were standing by the door why they are boys she said in surprise and will do for playfellows for you olga poor little fellows how cruel to send such boys to fight  then she came up to the boys and bade them welcome with an air of kindness which they both felt  katinka she said turning to her eldest daughter you speak french and perhaps they do also assure them that we will do our best to make them comfortable come here my dears  then she formally pointing to each of them uttered their names  katinka paulina olga  dick in reply pointed to his companion  jack archerand to himselfdick hawtry  the girls smiled and held out their hands  mamma says the eldest said in french that she is glad to see you and will do all in her power to make you comfortable  youre very good dick said i can speak very little french and cannot understand it at all unless you speak quite slow i wish now i hadnt been so lazy at school but we both speak a few words of russian and i hope that we shall soon be able to talk to you in your own language  bad as dicks french was the girls understood it and an animated conversation in a mixed jargon of french and russian began the girls inquired how they had come there and how they had been taken and upon hearing they had been in sebastopol inquired more anxiously as to the real state of things there for the official bulletins were always announcing victories and they could not understand how it was that the allies although always beaten were still in front of sebastopol when such huge numbers of troops had gone south to carry out the czars orders to drive them into the sea  the lads combined knowledge of french and russian proved quite insufficient to satisfy their curiosity but there was so much laughing over their wonderful blunders and difficulty in finding words to explain themselves that at the end of half an hour the boys were perfectly at home with their hostesses  you will like to see your rooms the countess said and touching a handbell she gave some orders to a servant who bowing led the way along a corridor and showed the boys two handsomelyfurnished rooms opening out of each other and then left them returning in a minute or two with hot water and towels  were in clover here jack said and no mistake the captains state cabin is a den by the side of our quarters and aint they jolly girls  and pretty too i believe you and the countess too i call her a stunner he exclaimed enthusiastically as stately as a queen but as friendly and kind as possible i dont think we ought to go to war with people like this  oh nonsense jack said weve seen thousands of russians now and dont think much of them and tisnt likely were going to let russia gobble up turkey just because theres a nice countess with three jolly daughters living here  dick laughed  no i suppose not he said but jack what on earth are we going to do about clothes these uniforms are getting seedy though it is lucky that we had on our best when we were caught owing to our having had the others torn to pieces the night of the wreck but as for other things we have got nothing but what we have on we washed our flannel shirts and stockings as well as we could whenever we halted but we cant well do that here and as for money we havent a hapenny between us its awful you know  at this moment there was a knock at the door and the servant entered bringing in a quantity of linen and underclothing of all kinds which he laid down on the bed with the words  with the countesss compliments  hurrah shouted dick the countess is a brick this is something like now for a big wash jack and a clean white shirt we shant know ourselves here is a brush too we shall be able to make our uniforms presentable  it was nearly an hour before the boys again joined the ladies looking it must be owned a great deal more like british officers and gentlemen than when they left the room they were both goodlooking lads and the russian girls were struck with their bright and cheerful faces  dick hastened to express their warm thanks to the countess for the welcome supply of clothes and said that jack and himself were ashamed indeed at not only trespassing on their hospitality but being obliged to rely upon their wardrobe  as dick had carefully thought out this little speech translated it into french and said it over halfadozen times he was able to make himself understood utterly defective as were his grammar and pronunciation  katinka explained that the clothes had belonged to her brother who was now a lieutenant in a regiment stationed in poland and that they had long been outgrown he being now as she signified by holding up her hand over six feet in height  a quarter of an hour later the dinner was announced and the countess in a stately way took dicks arm and jack not without blushing offered his to the eldest of the girls the dinner was in the boys eyes magnificent several domestics stood behind the chairs and anticipated their wants the girls continued their russian lessons by telling them the names of everything on the table and making them repeat them after them and there was so much laughter and merriment that long as the meal was it was by no means formal or ceremonious they learnt that the count preskoff was absent at some estates in the north of russia and that he was not likely to return for some little time  after dinner dick asked katinka to tell the countess that they did not wish to be troublesome and that they would be out and about the place and would not intrude upon them except when they wished to have them the countess replied through her daughter that they would be always glad to have them in the room  you will really be a great amusement to us we were very dull before and instead of being a trouble as count smerskoff no doubt intended when he quartered you upon us you will make a very pleasant break it is dreadfully dull here now she said there is no longer any gayety many of our neighbors are away and nobody talks of anything but that horrid war count smerskoff is almost the only person we see and and she shrugged her pretty shoulders hes worse than nothing and now mamma says would you like to ride or to go out in a sledge if you would like some shooting there is plenty in the neighborhood but of course for that you will want a whole day and it must be arranged beforehand i wish my brother orloff had been at home he could have looked after you nicely  delighted at the prospect the boys said that they should like a drive and a few minutes later descending to the courtyard they found a sledge with three horses at the door  what a stunning turnout jack exclaimed delighted we shall fancy we are princes dick and get spoiled altogether for a midshipmans berth  the sledge was of graceful form painted deep blue the seats were covered with furs while an apron of silver foxskin was wrapped round their legs the driver sat perched up on a high seat in front he was a tall stately figure with an immense beard on his head was the cap of black sheepskin which may be considered the national headdress he wore a long furlined coat of dark blue fitting somewhat tightly and reaching to his ankles it was bound by a scarlet sash round his waist it had a great fur collar and cuffs his feet were encased in untanned leather boots reaching above the knees  the horses were harnessed in a manner quite different to anything the lads had before seen they were three abreast the middle one was in shafts those on either side ran free in traces and by dint as the boys supposed of long training each carried his head curved round outwards so that he seemed to be looking halfbackwards giving them a most peculiar effect exactly similar to that which may be seen in ancient greek basreliefs and sculptures of horses in ancient chariots this mode of harnessing and training the horses is peculiarly russian and is rigidly adhered to by all the old russian families over each horse was a blue netting reaching almost to the ground its object being to prevent snow or dirt being thrown up in the faces of those sitting in the low sledge  cracking his whip with a report as loud as that of a pistol the driver set the horses in motion and in a minute the sledge was darting across the plain at a tremendous pace the centre horse trotting the flankers going at a canter each keeping the leg next to the horse in the shafts in front the light snow rose in a cloud from the runners as the sledge darted along and as the wind blew keenly in their faces and their spirits rose the boys declared to each other that sledging was the most glorious fun they had ever had  they had been furnished with furlined coats whose turnedup collars reached far above their ears and both felt as warm as toast in spite of the fact that the thermometer was down at zero  the country here differed in its appearance from that over which they had been travelling and great forests extended to within two or three miles of the town  i suppose dick said thats where the shooting is for i cant fancy any birds being fools enough to stop out on these plains and if they did there would be no chance of getting a shot at them how pretty those sledgebells are to be sure i wonder they dont have them in england  ive seen wagons down in the country with them jack said and very pretty the bells sounded on a still night but the bells were not so cleartoned as these  from one shaft to another in a bow high over the horses necks extended an arch of light wood and from this hung a score of little bells which tinkled merrily as the sledge glided along  its a delicious motion jack said no bumping or jolting and yet even when one shuts ones eyes he feels that he is going at a tremendous pace  the boys were amused at the driver who frequently cracked his whip but never touched the horses to whom however he was constantly talking addressing them in encouraging tones which as jack said they seemed to understand just like christians  after an hourandahalfs drive in which they must have traversed some eighteen miles they returned to the chateau the servant at the door relieved them of their warm cloaks and of the loose furlined boots with which they had also been furnished and then evidently in accordance with orders conducted them upstairs to the room where the countess and two of her daughters were working while the third was reading aloud it was already getting dusk and lighted lamps burned on the tables and the room heated by a great stove in the corner felt pleasantly warm and comfortable     chapter xiii   a nominal imprisonment  the evening passed pleasantly there was some music and the three girls and their mother sang together and jack who had learnt partsinging at home for his family were very musical and every night were accustomed to sing glees and catches also at their request joined in taking the part which their brother when at home had been accustomed to fill  in the course of the evening the boys explained that they had said nothing to the commandant about their having picked up a little russian as they had thought that it was better to allow him to remain in ignorance of it as they had had some idea of making their escape  why you foolish boys paulina said where would you escape to however perhaps it is as well that you said nothing about it for he only sent you here because he thought it would annoy mamma and if he had thought you had known any russian he might have lodged you somewhere else  we dont want to escape now you know jack said in his broken russian we are much more comfortable here than we should be in the cold before sebastopol  the next few days passed pleasantly sometimes the countess was not present and then the girls would devote themselves to improving the boys russian  sometimes two sledges would come to the door and two of the girls accompanied the boys on their drive on the fourth evening count smerskoff called and a cloud fell upon the atmosphere  the countess received him ceremoniously and maintained the conversation in frigid tones the girls scarcely opened their lips and the midshipmen sat apart as silent as if they understood no word of what was passing  i am sorry countess the commandant said that i was obliged to quarter these two english boys upon you but every house in the town is full of sick and wounded and as they were given over to me as officers though they look to me more like shipboys i could not put them in prison with the twenty or thirty soldiers whom we captured at the victory on the heights above inkerman  it is my duty to receive them the countess said very coldly and it therefore matters little whether it is pleasant or otherwise fortunately one of them speaks a few words of french and my daughters can therefore communicate with them so you have twenty or thirty english prisoners in the jail where are all the rest for of course in such a great victory we must have taken some thousands of prisoners  the count glanced angrily at her  they have no doubt been sent to odessa and other places he said you do not doubt countess surely that a great victory was gained by the soldiers of his majesty  doubt the countess said in a tone of slight surprise have i not read the official bulletins describing the victory only we poor women of course are altogether ignorant of war and cannot understand how it is that when they are always beaten these enemies of the czar are still in front of sebastopol  it may be said the count that the archdukes are only waiting until all the reinforcements arrive to drive them into the sea or capture them to the last man  no doubt it is that said the countess blandly but from the number of sick and wounded who arrive here to say nothing of those taken to odessa and the other towns among which as you say the prisoners are distributed it is to be wished that the reinforcements may soon be up so as to bring the fighting to an end  the enemy are suffering much more than we are the governor said and before the spring comes we may find that there are none left to conquer if the soldiers of the czar accustomed to the climate as they are feel the cold although they have warm barracks to sleep in what must be the case with the enemy on the bleak heights i hear that the english newspapers are full of accounts of the terrible sufferings of their troops they are dying like sheep  poor creatures the countess said gravely they are our fellowbeings you know count smerskoff although they are our enemies and one cannot but feel some pity for them  i feel no pity for the dogs the count said fiercely how dare they set foot on the soil of holy russia  hating them as you do the countess said it must be annoying for you indeed count to occupy even so exalted a position as that of governor of this town instead of fighting against the english and french  the count muttered something between his teeth which was certainly not a blessing then turning to katinka he changed the subject by asking her if she would favor him with some music  without a word the girl seated herself at the piano and played when she had finished the piece she began another without stopping and continued steadily for an hour the countess leaned back in her chair as if she considered that conversation would be out of place while her daughter was playing  count smerskoff sat quietly for a quarter of an hour then he began to fidget in his chair but he stoically sat on until when at the end of an hour katinka showed no signs whatever of leaving off he rose and ceremoniously regretting that his duties prevented him from having the pleasure of hearing the conclusion of the charming little piece which the young countess was playing for in russia all children bear the title of their parents he took his leave  when the door had closed behind him and the sound of his footsteps along the corridor ceased the girls burst into a fit of laughter in which the midshipmen joined heartily  well done katinka olga said clapping her hands that was a splendid idea of yours and you have routed the governor completely oh dear how cross he did look and how he fidgeted about as you played on and on without stopping i thought i must have laughed outright  it was a clever thought the countess said and yet the count cannot complain of want of courtesy he is a disagreeable man and a bad man but he is powerfully connected and it will not do to offend him we have enemies enough heaven knows  the boys at the time could not gather the drift of the conversation but a month later when their knowledge of the language had greatly increased olga when driving in a sledge with jack enlightened him as to the position in which they stood  papa she said is a liberal that is to say he wants all sorts of reform to be carried out if he had his way he would free the serfs and would have the affairs of the nation managed by a parliament as you do in england instead of by the will of the czar only i dont pretend to know anything about it myself but papa has perhaps expressed his opinions too openly and some enemy has carried them to the ears of the czar nicholas is you know though it is treason to say so very autocratic and absolute papa was never in favor because mamma was a pole but these terrible opinions finished it papa was forbidden to appear at court and ordered to live upon his estates and it is even possible she said anxiously that this will not be all you dont know russia or how dreadful it is to be looked upon as disaffected here papa is so good and kind his serfs all love him so much and every one says that no estates in russia are better managed but all this will avail nothing and it is only because we have powerful friends at court that worse things have not happened  unless you are very fond of gayety and society jack said i dont think it can matter much being sent away from st petersburg when you have such a nice place here  oh no the girl said it would not matter at all only you see when any one gets into disgrace there is no saying what may happen an enemy misrepresents some speech some evil report gets to the ears of the czar and the next day papa might be on his way to siberia she dropped her voice as she uttered the dreadful word and all his estates confiscated  what said jack indignantly without any trial or anything i never heard such a shame  the girl nodded  it is dreadful she said and now to make matters worse that odious count smerkoff wants to marry katinka she will be rich as she will inherit large estates in poland of course papa and mamma wont consent and katinka hates him but you see he has got lots of powerful relations at court if it hadnt been for that i hear that he would have been dismissed from the army long since and worst of all he is governor here and can send to headquarters any lying report he likes and do papa dreadful harm  jack did not understand anything like all that olga said but he gleaned enough to understand the drift of her conversation and he and dick chatted over the matter very seriously that night  both agreed that something ought to be done what that something was to be neither could offer the remotest suggestion they were so happy in the family now were so kindly treated by the countess and her daughters that they felt their troubles to be their own and they would have done anything which could benefit them  we must think it over jack dick said as he turned into bed its awful to think of all these nice people being at the mercy of a brute like that the idea of his wanting to marry the pretty katinka why hes not good enough to black her boots i wish we had him in the midshipmens berth on board the falcon we would teach him a thing or two  the lads had not availed themselves of the offer of ridinghorses as they were neither of them accustomed to the exercise and did not like the thought of looking ridiculous but they had eagerly accepted the offer to have some wolfshooting  one night everything having been prepared they took their seats in a sledge drawn by two of the fastest horses in the stables of the countess a whole battery of guns was placed in the seat with them the sledge was larger than that which they were accustomed to use and held four besides the driver two woodmenexperienced hunterstook their places on the seat facing the midshipmen a portion of the carcase of a horse which had broken its leg and been shot the previous day was fastened behind the sledge  a drive of an hour took them far into the heart of the forest although the coachman drove much slower than usual in order that the horses might be perfectly fresh when required presently the woodmen told the driver that they had gone far enough and the sledge was turned the horses facing homeward the great lump of meat was then unfastened from behind the sledge and a rope some forty yards long attached to it the other end being fastened to the sledge the horses were next moved forward until the rope was tight  they were then stopped rugs were laid across their backs to keep them warm and the party awaited the result  the young moon was shining in the sky and dark objects showed clearly over the white snow for a considerable distance half an hour passed without a word being spoken and without a sound breaking the silence that reigned in the forest presently a low whimpering was heard and the boys fancied that they could see dark forms moving among the trees the horses became restless and excited and it was as much as the man standing at their heads could do to quiet them  the coachman sat looking back whip in hand ready for an instant start  all at once a number of dark objects leaped from among the trees on to the broad line of snow which marked the road  jump in ivan the coachman exclaimed here they come keep a sharp lookout on both sides we can leave those fellows behind standing still the only danger is from a fresh pack coming from ahead  the peasant leaped into the car and in an instant the horses dashed off at a speed which would have taken them far away from the wolves had not their driver reined them in and quieted them with his voice  they soon steadied down into a long sweeping gallop the coachman at times looking back and regulating their speed so as to keep the bait gliding along just ahead of the wolves  the peasant now gave the signal to the midshipmen who with their guns cocked were standing up with one knee on the seat to steady themselves ready to fire and the two barrels at once rang out  one of the leading wolves who was but a few yards from the bait dropped and rolled over while a sharp whimpering cry told that another was wounded  the boys had an idea that the wolves would stop to devour their fallen comrade but the smell of the meat was it appeared more tempting for without a pause they still came on again and again the lads fired the woodmen handing them spare guns and loading as fast as they discharged them  suddenly the driver gave an exclamation and far ahead on the white road the boys looking round could see a dark mass the peasant with a stroke of his knife cut the rope which held the bait  the coachman drove forward with increased speed for fifty yards or so and then suddenly drew up the horses the peasants in an instant leaped out each with a rug in his hand and running to the horses heads at once blindfolded the animals by wrapping these around them then the men jumped into the sledge again  a hundred and fifty yards behind their late pursuers in a mass were growling snarling and fighting over the meat but already many finding themselves unable to obtain a share had set off in pursuit of the prize ahead which promised to be ample for all  to these however the peasants paid no attention but each taking a doublebarrel gun poured heavy charges of shot in above the bullets handing them to the boys they performed the same operation to the other two guns which they intended this time to use themselves  standing on the seat the men prepared to fire at the wolves directly ahead signing to the boys to lean over one on each side and take those on the flanks of the horses all this was done in a very few seconds as the sledge glided steadily along towards the fastapproaching foes when these came within fifty yards the horses were sent forward at full gallop in another second or two the four barrels of the woodmen poured their contents into the mass of wolves the boys waited until the horses were fairly among them and then they fired  a hideous chorus of yells arose and the horses at full speed dashed in upon the pack already a lane had been prepared for them and trampling over dead and dying they rushed through in spite of the execution done by the heavy charges of the midshipmens doublebarrel guns several wolves tried to spring into the sledge as it went past and one of them succeeded in leaping upon one of the horses the animal made a wild plunge but in an instant one of the woodmen sprang to the ground and buried his long knife in the beast then as the sledge swept on again he caught at the side and clambered into the car before the wolves who had already turned in pursuit could come up to him  the guns were quickly loaded again and another volley poured into the wolves then the coachman knowing that one of the horses was hurt and both nearly mad with fright let them have their heads and the sledge darted away at a pace which soon left the wolves far in the rear so rapid was the motion indeed that the boys held on to the sides expecting every moment that the sledge would be dashed against the trees which lined the road the coachman however kept the horses straight and quieting them down again brought them to a standstill when the cloths were taken off their heads and the journey to the chateau completed at a steady pace  thats sharp work jack said when the wolves had been fairly left in the rear they call that wolfhunting i call it being hunted by wolves these are fine fellows they were as cool as cucumbers  ive nearly broken my shoulder dick grumbled the gun with those tremendous charges kicked like a horse well its fine fun anyhow but its rather too risky to be often repeated if two or three of those fellows had got hold of the horses heads they would all have been upon us and very short work they would have made of us if they had  ugh jack said with a shudder what teeth they have and what mouths it seemed like a sort of nightmare for a moment with those great open mouths and shining teeth as they leaped towards us as we rushed past i hope i shant dream about them  no fear of that dick said laughing the countess said that some supper should be ready for us when we got back i feel tremendously peckish after the night air and plenty of hot tea and a good tuckin we shall sleep without dreaming i can venture to say  the countess and her daughters had gone to bed long before the return of the sportsmen at breakfast next morning the boys attempted to relate their adventures but their vocabulary being wholly insufficient the coachman was sent for and requested to give a full account of the proceedings this he did and added on his own account that the little lords had been as cool and collected as if they had been wolfhunting all their lives  after breakfast the letterbag arrived and the countess having opened her correspondence said that her husband would return the next day great as was the pleasure of the ladies the boys hardly felt enthusiastic over the news they were so jolly as they were that they feared any change would be for the worse  next day the count arrived and the boys soon felt that they had no cause for apprehension he greeted them with much cordiality and told them that he had heard from the countess that he had to thank them for having made the time of his absence pass so cheerfully and that she had said she did not know how they would have got through the dull time without them the boys after the manner of their kind were bad hands at compliment but they managed to express in their best russian their thanks for the extreme kindness which they had received  the days went on after the counts arrival much as they had done before except that the boys now took to horse exercise accompanying their host as he rode round his estate and visited the various villages upon it  the houses in these villages astonished the boys built of mud of one story only and flatroofed they each occupied a large extent of ground for here whole families lived together as the sons grew up and married instead of going into separate houses and setting up life on their own account they brought their wives home as did their children when their turn came also to marry so that under one roof resided as many as four generations counting some forty or fifty souls altogether  each village had its headman who settled all disputes but against whose decision if it failed to give satisfaction there was an appeal to the master the serfs worked the count told the boys without pay but they had so many days in each month when they cultivated the land which was common to the village they could the count said be sold but in point of fact never were sold except with the land  its a bad system and i wish that they were as free is your laborers are in england  of course our people cannot be sold jack said but after all theres not so much difference in that respect for if an estate changes hands they work for the new owner just as yours do  yes but your laborers cannot be killed or even flogged by their masters with impunity  no i should think not jack exclaimed we should have a revolution in no time if masters were to try that sort of thing  i fear that we shall have one too some day the count said unless the serfs are emancipated the people are terribly ignorant but even among them some sort of enlightenment is going on and as they know better they will refuse to live and to work as mere beasts of burden  will they be better off sir than before dick hawtry asked i have heard my father say that the negroes in the west indian islands are worse off than they were in the days when they were slaves they will not work except just enough to procure themselves means of living and they spend the rest of their lives lying about and smoking  it would no doubt be the same thing here the count said for a time the russian peasant is naturally extremely ignorant and extremely fond of vodka probably at first he would be far worse off than at present he would be content to earn enough to live and to get drunk upon and wide tracts of land would remain untilled but it is of the future we must think and who can doubt that in the future russia with a free people and free institutions with her immense resources and enormous population must become the grandest empire on earth     chapter xiv   a suspected household  cheerful though their hosts were the midshipmen could see that a cloud of anxiety hung over them to be suspected in russia is equivalent to being condemned secret police spies in the very bosom of the household may be sending denunciations the man who meets you and shakes hands with you in the street may have reported on your conduct the letters you write are opened those you should receive stopped in the post at any moment the agent of the authorities may appear and conduct you to a prison which you may leave only for the long journey to siberia  count preskoff did not think that matters had yet reached this point he was in disgrace at court and had enemies who would injure him to the utmost with the emperor but he believed that no steps would be taken until count smerskoff had received his final refusal of katinkas hand he had already once proposed for it but would not consider the answer which her father then gave him as final  i cannot accept your refusal count he had said the marriage would be for the advantage of all parties concerned my family is as you are aware not without influence at court and they would were i the husband of your daughter do all in their power to incline the emperor favorably towards you while were i rejected they would probably view your refusal to accept my offers as a slight to the family and resent it accordingly i cannot but think that when you have given the matter calm consideration you will see the advantages which such an alliance would offer i shall therefore do myself the honor to renew my proposals at some future date  this conversation took place in the beginning of december count preskoff had shortly afterwards left for his estates in the north and he felt sure that upon his return the subject would be renewed and that upon his announcement of his continued determination to refuse his daughters hand to this pressing suitor the latter would use every means in his power to ruin him and that the cloud which had so long threatened would burst over his head  from olga who being about his own age a little under sixteen was his special chum in the family jack gathered a general idea of the situation olga was an adept at pantomimic action and a natural mimic hence although he could only understand a word here and there he obtained an accurate idea of the conversation between her father and the governor and of her fathers calm manner and the gestures and intonations of apparent friendship but veiled menace by putting her ears to a keyhole and hiding behind a curtain she expressed the possibility of there being a spy in the very household who would listen to the unguarded talk of her father and report it to the governor jack determined that he would watch every movement of the domestics and especially observe if he could detect any sign of an understanding between one of them and the governor  it was some four or five days after the count had returned that count smerskoff rode up to the door orders had already been given that if he arrived he should be shown to the counts private study the midshipmen saw him riding up and according to the plan they had agreed upon one stood near the entrance to observe whether any sign of recognition passed between him and any of the servants gathered upon the steps to receive him the other took his place in the hall the interview was not a long one  i am come count preskoff the governor said to renew my request for the hand of your daughter i trust that upon consideration you will have thought it better to overlook the objections you preferred to my suit  upon the contrary the count said calmly i have thought the matter over in every light and am more convinced even than before that such a marriage would not conduce to the happiness of my daughter she herself is wholly repugnant to it and even were it otherwise i should myself most strongly object  on what grounds count the officer said angrily noble as your family is my own is fully equal to it  that i am perfectly willing to allow sir and will frankly own that my objection is a purely personal one the incidents of your past career are notorious you have killed two men in duels which in both cases you forced upon them you have been involved in gambling transactions of such a description that it needed all the influence of your family to save you from public disgrace to such a man it is impossible that i could intrust my daughter  count smerskoff rose to his feet bursting with passion  since you know my reputation count it would have been wiser to abstain from insulting me you shall hear from me before night  it is useless your sending your second to me the count said calmly for i absolutely refuse to meet you i shall publish my refusal and state that the grounds upon which i base it are that you are a notorious ruffian but that if you can find any man of honor to take up your quarrel i shall be prepared to meet him  i will force you to it the soldier said burning with passion i will publicly insult you i will strike you and he drew a step nearer  you will do so at your peril the count said drawing a pistol from his pocket i know your method sir and am prepared for it if you lay a finger upon me if you insult me in public i will shoot you dead where you stand and take the consequences  you shall repent this count smerskoff exclaimed there are lives worse than death and you shall have cause to remember your words of today and turning round he strode from the room  jack was still lounging in the hall as he passed out one of the servants had also remained there and when the governor was seen striding down the staircase the man hastened to open the door jack saw the officer pause for a moment at eight tonight at the cross roads he said and passed out and flinging himself upon his horse rode off among the russian words learned by the midshipmen were all words connected with roads they had been specially desirous of asking questions which might enable them to find their way across country and every word which would be likely to be included in a direction as to route had been learned this was the more easy as on their march there had been but few objects of interest to attract their attention the expressions therefore the road to the right the road to the left the turning by the wood or stream the cross roads and other similar expressions had been learned by heart jacks quick ears consequently gathered the purport of the brief order  i have found the spy he said triumphantly when he joined his comrade outside come for a stroll dick i dont want to be seen talking here  when well away from the house jack repeated the words he had overheard and they determined that they would be present at the interview between the governor and his spy they had a long discussion whether it would be better to invite the count himself to be present but they agreed at last that it would be better not to do so as he might break in upon the interview and possibly only bring matters to a climax at once which they agreed had better be avoided as even if the men fought then and there the fact of the governor being killed by the count would only precipitate the danger which already threatened still they agreed that it was absolutely necessary that the conversation should be thoroughly understood and the few words which they would glean here and there might be insufficient to put them in possession of the full details of the plot  they therefore resolved to take the coachman into their confidence they knew that he was warmly attached to the count and that he could be relied upon in an emergency as they had full permission to take the horses or carriage whenever they pleased they now went to the stable and told the coachman that they should like to go for a drive in the sledge as the weather showed signs of breaking and the snow would probably shortly disappear  the horses were at once put to and in a few minutes they were whirling over the snow they directed the coachman to drive into the forest where they had had the encounter with the wolves and when well in its shelter they stopped the sledge and alighted and requested the coachman to do the same much surprised the unrolled the sheepskin wrappings from his legs and got down from his seat  alexis you love the count your master do you not  yes young lord the russian said earnestly though much surprised at the question his fathers have been the masters of mine for many generations my good lord is always kind and considerate to his serfs i drove his father before him i drove him when he was a boy he has never said a harsh word to me i would give my life for him willingly why do the young lords ask  your master has enemies alexis there are many who think that he is too kind to his serfs they have poisoned the ear of the czar against him they have told him that your master is a dangerous man they have turned the face of the czar from him  the russian nodded it was no secret that the count was banished from the capital  the chief of his enemies jack went on is the governor count smerskoff he wishes to marry the countess katinka and because the count refuses he will try to injure him and to obtain his exile to siberia  i will kill him the coachman said i will slay him in the middle of his soldiers they may kill me but what of that it is for my master  no alexis not now jack said laying his hand upon the arm of the angry russian perhaps later but we will see but i have found out that paul the hall servant is acting as his spy i heard the governor order him to meet him at the cross roads at eight oclock tonight i suppose he means where the road crosses that to town about halfway along we mean to be there but you know we dont understand russian well enough to hear all that is said we want you to be there with us too to hear what they mean to do  i will be there the russian said and if the young lords think it well i will kill them both  no alexis jack said that would never do it might get about that the governor had been killed by order of the count and this would do more harm than if he were alive will you be in the stables at seven oclock we will join you there there are plenty of bushes at the crossroads and we shall be able to hide there without difficulty  the coachman assented and taking their seats they again drove on it must not be supposed that the conversation was conducted as simply and easily as has been narrated for it needed all the efforts of the boys to make the russian understand them and they had to go over and over again many of the sentences using their scanty vocabulary in every way to convey their meaning to their hearer the rest of the afternoon passed slowly the count himself was tranquil and even cheerful although his face wore an air of stern determination the countess looked anxious and careworn the eyes of the three girls were swollen with crying and the lads afterwards learned that katinka had gone down on her knees to her father to implore him to allow her to sacrifice herself for the common good by marrying count smerskoff this however the count had absolutely refused to do and had even insisted upon her promising him that should he be exiled and his estates confiscated she would not afterwards purchase his release by consenting to marry her suitor respecting the grief and anxiety into which the family were plunged the midshipmen kept apart from them all the afternoon only joining them at the evening meal at six oclock as they withdrew saying in answer to the counts invitation that they should stop with them that they were first going for a little walk jack whispered in olgas ear keep up your courage all may not be lost yet  the coachman was waiting for them in the stable and they started at once in an opposite direction to that at which the meeting was to take place in case paul might by any possibility observe their departure taking a long dètour they reached the crossroads and lay down under cover of the brushwood it was nearly half an hour later before they heard footsteps approaching along the road from the chateau on reaching the junction of the roads the man stopped and from their place of concealment they could dimly see his figure  the boys had taken the precaution of abstracting a brace of pistols and two swords from the counts armory the coachman they knew would have his knife this they had done at jacks suggestion that it was possible that their presence might be betrayed by a cough or other accidental noise in which case they knew they would have to fight for their lives a few minutes later they heard the tramp of a horses hoof it approached quickly and the rider halted by the standing figure  is that you paul  it is my lord the serf said bowing  you are alone  no one had approached the place since i came here a quarter of an hour ago  it is time for action the horseman said tomorrow you will come boldly at twelve oclock to my house and demand to see me on important business you will be shown to my room where two officers who i wish to have as witnesses will be present you will then state to me that you wish to make a denunciation of your master count preskoff i shall ask what you have to say and tell you that you are of course aware of the serious consequences to yourself should such statements be proved untrue you will say that you are aware of that but that you are compelled by your love for the czar our father to speak you will then say that you have heard the count using insulting words of the czar in speaking of him to his wife on many occasions and that since his return on one occasion you put your ear to the keyhole and heard him telling her of a great plot for a general rising of the serfs and an overthrow of the government that he said he had prepared the serfs of his estates in the north for the rising that those of his estates here would all follow him that many other nobles had joined in the plot and that on a day which had not yet been agreed upon a rising would take place in twenty places simultaneously and that the revolt once begun he was sure that the serfs weary of the war and its heavy impositions would everywhere join the movement i shall crossquestion you closely but you will stick to your story make it as simple and straightforward as you can say you cannot answer for the exact words but that you will answer that this was the general sense of the conversation you overheard now are you sure you thoroughly understand  i quite understand my lord the man said humbly and for this your excellency has promised me  five hundred roubles and your freedom  but when am i to be paid the man said doubtfully  do you doubt my word slave the horseman said angrily  by no means your excellency but things might happen and after i had told my story and it had been taken down before witnesses your excellencys memory might fail i should prefer the money before i told my story  the horseman was silent a moment  you are an insolent dog to doubt me he said in an angry tone but you shall have the money when you call tomorrow the sergeant of the guard will have instructions to hand you a letter which will contain notes for five hundred roubles  i thought the man said your excellency said gold five hundred roubles in notes are not worth two hundred in gold and you see i shall have much to do to earn the money for i may be sent to st petersburg and crossquestioned i may even be confronted with my master and after it is over and i am freed i must in any case leave this part of the country for my life will not be safe for a day here  very well the count said you shall have a thousand roubles in paper but beware if you fail me or break down in crossexamination you shall end your life in the mines of siberia  so saying without another word he turned and rode back while the serf strode off towards the chateau during this conversation which the boys imperfectly understood they had difficulty in restraining the counts faithful retainer who furious at hearing the details of the plot against his master would have leaped up to attack the speakers had not the boys kept their restraining hands on his shoulder and whispered in his ear be quiet for the counts sake  waiting long enough to be sure that the two men had passed not only out of sight but of the sound of their voices the lads suffered their companion to rise and to indulge his feelings in an explosion of deep oaths then when he was a little calm they obtained from him a repetition of the leading facts of the conversation  the boys consulted among themselves and agreed that it was necessary to acquaint the count with all the facts that they had discovered and to leave him to act as seemed best according to his judgment  they entered the house alone telling the coachman to call in half an hour and to say that the count had given orders that he was to see him to take instructions for the horses in the morning then they joined the family in the drawingroom there all proceeded as usual  katinka at her fathers request played on the piano and a stranger would not have dreamed of the danger which menaced the household when the halfhour had nearly expired jack said to the count  i have told alexis to call upon you for orders for tomorrow would you mind receiving him in your study i have a very particular reason for asking it  but i have no orders to give alexis the count said surprised  no sir but he has something he particularly wishes to say to yousomething really important  very well the court replied smiling you seem to be very mysterious but of course i will do as you wish is he coming soon  in two or three minutes sir i expect him  then the count remarked i suppose i had better go at once and learn what all this mystery is about he isnt coming i hope to break to me the news that one of my favorite horses is dead so saying with a smile he left the room no sooner had he gone than the girls overwhelmed the midshipmen with questions but they told them that they must not be inquisitive that their father would no doubt tell them the secret in due time  if you will allow me countess dick said i will leave this door a little open so that we may hear when alexis goes in the door was placed ajar and a few minutes later the footsteps of two men were heard coming along the corridor paul opened the door is his excellency here he asked alexis wishes to see him  he is in his study the countess answered  the study door was heard to close and when the sound of pauls feet returning along the corridor ceased dick said you will excuse us countess we are going to join the conference  it is too bad katinka exclaimed to keep us in the dark in this way mind if the secret is not something very important and delightful you will be in disgrace and we shall banish you from this room altogether  the lads made a laughing reply and then promising they would soon be back they went to the study alexis was standing silent before his master having explained that he would rather not speak until the young english lords appeared jack began the narrative and said that fearing count smerskoff whom they knew to be his enemy might have suborned one of the servants to act as his spy they had watched him closely and had heard him make an appointment with paul to meet him that evening at the crossroads that they had taken alexis into their confidence and had with him been concealed spectators of the interview that they themselves had been able to gather only the general drift of the conversation but that alexis would give him a full report of it  the counts face had at first expressed only surprise at jacks narration but the expression changed into one of fierce anger as he proceeded without a word he motioned to alexis to continue and the latter detailed word for word the conversation which he had overheard when he had concluded he added your excellency must pardon me for not having killed your enemies upon the spot but the young english lords had told me that it was necessary to lie quiet whatever i heard and besides the governor might have ridden off before i could reach him  the count stood for a minute silent when the narration ceased you did well alexis he said in a stern voice it is for me to judge and sentence i had thought that i at least was safe from treachery among those around me it seems i was wrong and the traitor shall learn that the kind master can be the severe lord who holds the life and death of his serfs in his hand he was silent and remained two or three minutes in deep thought go to the stable alexis you will be joined there soon by ivan and alexander they will have their instructions after that paul will come out seize him and bind him when he enters the stable now go you have done well tell paul as you go out that i wish to see the steward  a minute or two later the steward a whiteheaded old man who had from childhood been in the service of the family entered demetri he said will you tell ivan and alexander to go out into the stable they will find alexis waiting for them order them when paul joins them there to aid alexis in seizing him instantly give them your instructions quietly and without attracting notice above all do not let paul see you speaking to them when you have seen them out find paul and order him to go to the stable and tell alexis that i wish to speak to him when he has gone join me here     chapter xv   a struggle for life  count preskoffs old steward received his orders with scarce a look of surprise singular though they must have seemed to him a russian is accustomed to unquestioning obedience to the orders of his superior and although never before had count preskoff issued such strange and unaccountable commands to the steward the thought never occurred to the latter of questioning them for a moment  when he had left the room the count turned to the midshipmen and his brow relaxed i cannot tell you he said under what obligation you have placed me and my family little did we think that any little kindness we might show to you strangers and prisoners here would be returned by a service of a hundredfold greater value the danger which hangs over us may for the time be averted by your discovery i know my enemy too well to suppose that it is more than postponed but every delay is so much gained i have news today that the czar is alarmingly ill should heaven take him it would be the dawn of a better era for russia his son is a man of very different mould he has fallen into disgrace with his father for his liberal ideas and he is known to think as i do that serfdom is the curse of the empire  but surely dick hawtry said if we draw out a document signed by us and alexis saying that we overheard the plot to obtain false evidence against you the emperor would not believe other false accusations which your enemies might invent  you little know russia the count said i believe that nicholas tyrannical and absolute as he is yet wishes to be just and that were such a document placed in his hands it would open his eyes to the truth but my enemies would take care that it never reached him they are so powerful that few would dare to brave their hostility by presenting it nor indeed surrounded as nicholas is by creatures whose great object is to prevent him from learning the true wishes of his people would it be easy to obtain an opportunity for laying such a document before him even were the attempt made and that successfully such doubts would be thrown upon it that he might well be deceived it would be said that the evidence of alexis a serf devoted to his master was valueless and that you as strangers very imperfectly acquainted with the language might well have misunderstood the conversation count smerskoff would swear that he was only repeating statements which paul had previously made to him and that he only promised money because paul insisted that as a first condition of his informing against me he should receive funds to enable him to leave this part of the country where his life would assuredly be unsafe i will thankfully take such a document from you my friends for it may be useful but i must not trust too much to it now come with me he continued as the steward reappeared you have seen how a russian noble can be kind to his serfs you will now see how he punishes traitors  followed by the steward and the two midshipmen the count proceeded to the stables here by the light of the lantern they saw paul standing bound against the manger his features were ghastly pale and contracted with fear his conscience told him that his treachery had been discovered alexis and the two servants were standing by in the attitude of stolid indifference habitual to the russian peasant  demetri you ivan and alexander will be the court to try this man whom i accuse of being a traitor who has plotted against my life and liberty who would have sent me to the gallows or siberia and seen my wife and children turned beggared and disgraced on the world you will form the court and decide whether he is innocent or guilty if the latter i will pass sentence alexis and these english gentlemen are the witnesses against him  the midshipmen first and then alexis related the conversation they had overheard  you have heard the evidence the count said turning to demetri what is your opinion is this man innocent or guilty  he is guilty the old man said of the basest treachery towards the best and kindest master in russia and he deserves to die  and so say we said the other two together looking with loathing horror at the prisoner for in russia for a serf to conspire against his master was a crime deemed almost equal in atrocity to parricide  you hear paul his master said sternly looking at him you have been found guilty and must die alexis you restrained yourself for my sake from taking the life of this wretch when you heard him plotting against me you will now act as executioner  right willingly the man replied taking down a huge axe which hung by the wall  the wretched prisoner who had hitherto maintained an absolute silence now burst into an agony of cries prayers for mercy and curses seeing in the unmoved countenances of his judges that nothing would avail and that alexis was approaching him he screamed out a demand for a priest before he died  that is reasonable the count said go into the house demetri and ask papa ivanovitch to come hitherfor in the family of every russian noble a priest resides as a matter of course  presently the priest arrived with the steward  papa ivanovitch the count said you are i know devoted to the family in which your father and grandfather were priests before you you can therefore be trusted with our secret a secret which will never go beyond those present you are here to shrive a man about to die  then the count related the incidents of the discovery of the treachery of the prisoner and the priest who shared with the serfs their veneration and affection for their lord could scarcely overcome his repugnance and horror of the prisoner so far as to approach and listen to him  for five minutes all present withdrew from the stable leaving the priest and the prisoner alone together then the door opened and the priest came out  it is finished he said may god pardon the sinner and he moved away rapidly towards the house  alexis spoke a word to his fellowservants and these lifted a heavy log from the woodpile in the courtyard and carried it into the stable then they seized paul and in spite of his screams and struggles laid him with his head across the log alexis raised the heavy axe in the air it flashed in the light of the lantern there was a dull heavy thud and the head of the traitor rolled on the ground  now the count said unmoved put a horse into a cart take picks and shovels and carry the body of this traitor out to the forest and bury it there dig a hole deeply that the wolves may not bring it to light demetri will give each of you tomorrow fifty roubles for your share in this nights work and beware that you never let a syllable concerning it pass your lips even when you are together and alone alexis on you i bestow your freedom if you care to have it and also as a gift to yourself and your heirs after you the little farm that was vacant by the death of nouvakeff last week  so saying followed by the two midshipmen who had been awed but not disapproving spectators of the tragedy he returned to the house and led the way back to his study  you do not disapprove he asked gravely of what i have done it is not i know in accordance with your english ideas nor even in russia may a noble take a serfs life according to law though hundreds are killed in fits of hasty passion or by slow illtreatment and no inquiry is ever made still this was a case of life against life my safety and happiness and that of my dear wife and daughters were concerned and were the lives of fifty serfs at stake i should not hesitate  although the boys felt that the matter if brought before an english court of justice might not be favorably considered their sympathies were so thoroughly with the count that they did not hesitate to say that they thought he could not have acted otherwise than he had done and that the life of the traitor was most justly forfeited  i shall now have a respite for a short time the count said count smerskoff will of course be perturbed and annoyed at the nonappearance of his spy and will after a time quietly set inquiries on foot but i will tell demetri to give it to be understood that paul has asked for leave of absence for a few days to go to a distance to visit a friend who is ill he was always a silent and unsociable fellow and the others will not wonder at his having started without mentioning his intention to any of them  what are we to say to the ladies sir jack asked we must invent some reason for our mysterious absence  yes the count agreed i would not burden them with such a secret as this on any account  i have an idea sir jack said after a pause you know that beautiful pair of ponies which were brought here yesterday for sale the ladies were in raptures over them but you said that the price was preposterous and that the owner wanted as much for them as you had given for your best pair of carriage horses now sir if you were to order alexis to go over at daybreak to the town to purchase them and have them at the door in a ponycarriage by breakfasttime this would seem to explain the whole mystery of the coachmans coming to see you and our private conference  it is a capital plan the count assented admirable and i will carry it out at once it is true i refused to buy them for we have all contributed to the extent of our means to enable the emperor to carry on the war and i am really short of money but of course the purchase of the ponies is not a matter of importance one way or the other  upon the party returning to the drawingroom they were assailed with questions but the count told his daughters that their curiosity must remain unsatisfied until after breakfast on the morrow and with this assurance they were obliged to be satisfied although olga pouted and told jack that he had entirely forfeited her confidence fortunately it was now late and the lads were not called upon long to maintain an appearance of gayety and ease which they were very far from feeling  when they retired to their rooms they had a long talk together both agreed that according to english law the whole proceeding was unjustifiable but their final conclusion was that things in russia were altogether different to what they were in england and that above all things it was a case in which it served him right  nevertheless it was long before they got to sleep and for weeks the scene in the stable was constantly before their eyes and the screams and entreaties of the dying man rang in their ears  the next morning the sight of the ponies delighted the girls and in their pleasure at the purchase they accepted at once the solution of the mystery and never thought of questioning whether the long conference between their father and the midshipmen on the preceding evening was fully accounted for by the gift of the ponies  five days elapsed and then one morning a sergeant rode up with an official letter for the count the latter opened it and read an order from the governor for him to transfer the english prisoners in his charge to the bearer of the letter who would conduct them to the quarters assigned to them most reluctantly the count ascended the stairs and informed the boys of the order which he had received  it is simply done to annoy me he said no doubt he has heard that you ride about the estate with me and are treated as members of the family and he thinks and rightly that it will be a serious annoyance to me if you are transferred elsewhere however i can do no less than obey the order and i can only hope that you will spend most of your time here alexis shall bring the carriage over every morning for you wherever you may be quartered  the girls were as indignant and aggrieved as even the midshipmen could wish to see them but there was no help for it a quarter of an hour later a carriage was at the door a portmanteau well filled with clothes placed behind and with the sergeant trotting alongside the boys left the chateau where they bad been so hospitably entertained promising to come over without fail the next morning  they were conducted to the governors house and taken not to the large room where he conducted his public business and where they had before seen him but to a smaller room fitted up as a private study on the second floor the governor who looked jack thought even more savage and illtempered than usual was seated at a writingtable he signed to the sergeant who accompanied them to retire and pointed to two chairs so he said i am told that you are able to converse fairly in russian although you have chosen to sit silent whenever i have been present as if you did not understand a word of what was being said this is a bad sign and gives weight to the report which has been brought to me that you are meditating an escape  it is a lie sir dick said firmly whoever told it you as to our learning russian we have as you see picked up a little of the language but im not aware of any rule or law by which gentlemen whether prisoners or otherwise are obliged to converse unless it pleases them to do so you never showed any signs of being even aware of our presence in the room and there was therefore no occasion for us to address you  i do not intend to bandy words with you the governor replied savagely i repeat that i am informed you meditate attempting an escape and as this is a breach of honor and a grave offence upon the part of officers on parole i shall at once revoke your privilege and you will be confined in the same prison with common soldiers  in the first place jack said as my friend has told you the report of our thinking of escaping is a lie if we had wanted to escape at any rate from this place we could have done it at any time since we have been here in the second place i deny that we are prisoners on parole we did not give you our promise because you did not ask for it you said to dr bertmann in our hearing that our parole was no matter one way or the other as it would be impossible for us to escape the doctor can of course be found and will i am sure bear out what i say  silence sir shouted the governor i say that you were prisoners on parole and that i have discovered you intended to break that parole you will be committed to prison and treated as men who have forfeited all right to be considered as officers and gentlemen  the boys sat silent looking with contempt at the angry russian the latter believed that he had now cowed them he sat for a few minutes silent in order to allow the prospect of imprisonment and disgrace to produce its full effect then he continued in a milder voice i do not wish to be severe upon such very young officers and will therefore point out a way by which you may avoid the imprisonment and disgrace which your conduct has merited and be enabled still to enjoy your freedom as before  what is it dick asked briefly  it is this the governor said i have here before me and he touched some documents lying on the table a report which i am about to forward to the czar respecting count preskoff the report is not altogether favorable for the count is a man of what are called advanced opinions he has curious ideas as to the treatment of serfs and has no doubt in your hearing expressed himself favorable to their emancipation  the boys were silent  he has i doubt not done so for he is rash and open of speech i have here before me an information sworn to that effect and if you will place your names as witnesses to it i will not only pardon the indiscretion of which you have been guilty but will do all in my power to make your stay pleasant  the boys were speechless with indignation at the infamy of the proposal and doubted not that the document contained far weightier charges than those specified by the governor  who has signed that document jack asked  i do not know that the name can matter to you the governor said but it is one of the servants of the count one paul petrofski  then dick said starting to his feet it is a forgery paul petrofski never signed that document  what do you mean the governor exclaimed leaping to his feet also and laying his hand on his sword while his face grew white with passion do you accuse me of forgery  i repeat dick said his indignation altogether mastering his prudence that it is a forgery you have never seen paul petrofski since i heard you offer him one thousand roubles at the crossroads that night to betray his master  with a short cry which reminded jack of the sharp snarl of the wolves in the night in the forest the russian drew his sword and rushed upon dick the latter threw up his arm to defend himself but the blow fell cutting his arm severely and laying open a great gash on his cheek  the russian raised his arm to repeat the blow when jack sprang upon him from behind seizing him round the waist and pinning his arms to his side  the count struggled furiously but jack was a strongly built english lad of nearly sixteen years old and he not only retained his grasp but lifted his struggling captive from his feet open the window dick he shouted its his life or ours now dick though nearly blinded with blood sprang to the window and threw it up  there was a short desperate struggle as the russian shouting furiously for aid strove with his feet to keep himself away from the window but dick struck these aside with a mighty effort jack pushed his captive forward and in another moment he was thrown through the open window a rush of heavy steps was heard on the stairs in an instant jack darted to the table seized the documents upon it and cast them into the fire in the stove slammed the door and was standing by the window with dick when an officer and several soldiers burst into the room  what is the matter the former exclaimed and where is the governor  the matter is jack said quietly turning round that the governor has drawn his sword and as you see tried to kill my friend in order to prevent his doing so my friend and i have thrown the governor out of the window  thrown the governor out of the window gasped the astonished officer  yes jack said it was painful but we had to do it if you look out i fancy youll see him  the officer ran to the window  good heavens he exclaimed it is true they are lifting him up already he seems to me to be dead you will have to answer for this he said turning to the lads  of course we shall answer for it jack said he brought it on himself his temper as no doubt you are aware was not always under strict control  the officer could not help smiling he had himself often experienced the effects of that want of control of his temper on the part of his superior and was at heart by no means sorry at the prospect of a new governor  his excellencys temper was hasty he said however gentlemen that is no business of mine then turning to the soldiers he continued you will take these officers into custody and remain here in charge of them until you have further orders he then left them to inquire into the state of the governor the soldiers muttered remarks to each other by no means indicative of sorrow for the tyranny of the governor had made him hated by all below him one of them at jacks request at once went out and returned with a jug of cold water and a towel with which jack bathed dicks wounds which were bleeding severely and the midshipman was scarcely able to stand from loss of blood jack vainly attempted to stop the bleeding we must have a surgeon he said turning to the soldiers or as you see my friend will bleed to death no doubt there are plenty of them below will one of you go and ask one of them to come up here telling him how urgent is the need  after a consultation among themselves one of the soldiers retired and in a minute or two returned with a surgeon in whom to his great delight jack recognized doctor bertmann who upon seeing dicks state at once proceeded to attend to him cutting off his coat and shirtsleeve he examined his arm from which the blood was flowing in a stream  one of the small arteries is cut he said it is lucky that aid was at hand or he would have assuredly bled to death the severed artery was speedily found and tied up and then the wound on the face was plastered and bandaged and dick as he lay on the couch for he was far too weak to stand felt comparatively comfortable     chapter xvi   an escape from prison  when he had dressed dicks wounds doctor bertmann said he would go down and see the governor he had already told the lads that he had received fatal injuries and was unconscious and that he might or might not recover his senses before he died it was an hour before he returned accompanied by the other officer both looked grave  im sorry to say my young friend the doctor said to jack for dick had now gone off in a quiet doze that the affair has assumed a very serious aspect the count is dead he recovered consciousness before he died and denounced you both as having made a sudden and altogether unprovoked attack upon him he had he affirmed discovered that you were meditating a breach of your parole and that he had informed you that the privileges extended to you would therefore be withdrawn then he said transported by rage you sprang upon him he drew his sword and attempted to defend himself but the two of you closing with him hurled him through the window in spite of his struggles  the other officer had while the doctor was speaking been examining the writingtable  i do not see the papers he spoke of he said to the doctor  then turning to the sergeants of the guard he asked if any papers upon the table had been touched the sergeant replied that no one had gone near the table since he had entered the room  in that case the officer said his mind cannot have been quite clear although he seemed to speak sensibly enough you heard him order me doctor to fold up a report and attesting statement directed to the minister of the interior and to post them immediately it is clear that there are no such documents here i entered the room with the sergeant almost at the moment when the struggle ended and as no one has touched the table since it is clear that they cannot have been here perhaps i may find them on the table downstairs it is now he said turning to jack my duty to inform you that you are in custody for the deliberate murder of count smerskoff as sworn to by him in his last moments  he was a liar when he was alive jack said and he died with a falsehood on his lips however sir we are at your orders  a stretcher was brought in dick was placed upon it and under a guard the midshipmen were marched to the prison the soldiers with difficulty keeping back the crowd who pressed forward to see the english prisoners who had murdered the governor  doctor bertmann walked with jack to the prison door upon the way he assured jack that he entirely believed his version of the story as he knew the governor to be a thoroughly bad man  singularly enough he said i had intended to see you today i went back to sebastopol on the very day after you arrived here with a regiment marching down and left again with a convoy of wounded after only two days stay there i got here last night and i had intended coming out to call upon you at count preskoffs today you would no doubt like me to see him at once and inform him of what has taken place  jack said that he would be very much obliged if he would do so  i will return this afternoon to see my patient doctor bertmann said as they parted and will then bring you news from the count who will no doubt come to see you himself  the cell to which the boys were conducted was a small one and horribly dirty jack shrugged his shoulders as he looked at it  it is not fit for a pig he said to himself after all russia is not such a pleasant place as i thought it yesterday  when they were left alone jack set to work to cheer up his companion who was weak and inclined to be despondent from the loss of blood which he had suffered  at any rate old boy jack said in reply to dicks assertion of his conviction that they would be shot we shall have the satisfaction that we have procured the safety of our friends at the chateau now that their enemy is gone the count will no doubt be let alone it was dreadful to think what would have become of the countess and the three girls if their father had been sent to siberia and they turned out penniless besides old fellow we are a long way from being dead yet after all it is only the governors word against ours and you may be sure that the count will move heaven and earth to bring matters right  it was dusk before the doctor returned  i have seen the count he said and the ladies and he were greatly distressed at my news it is plain to see that you are prime favorites the young ladies were very niobes the count was most anxious to learn all particulars but i could only tell him that you asserted the governor had attacked you first he drove in at once and made no doubt that he should be allowed to see you in this however he was disappointed and indeed you have had a most fortunate escape the officer second in command here is a relative of the late governor fortunately he was absent this morning and only returned this afternoon like the late count he is of a violent and passionate temper and when he heard the news swore that had he been here he would have instantly had you brought out and shot in the square indeed it was with difficulty that the other officers dissuaded him from doing so upon his return he has ordered that a courtmartial shall assemble tomorrow and that you shall be at once tried and executed  but surely jack said no courtmartial of officers would find us guilty the counts violent temper was notorious and it is against all reason that two unarmed men should make an attack upon one armed with a sword and within call of assistance you yourself know doctor bertmann that the reason which he alleged for the attack is a false one as we were not asked for our parole  i am of course aware of that the doctor said and should attend to give evidence but the case is a doubtful one the officers of our line regiments are for the most part poor and friendless men promotion is almost entirely by favoritism and it would need a very considerable amount of courage and independence to give a verdict in the teeth of their commanding officer in the next place for i have heard them talking it over among themselves there is a sort of feeling that for the honor of the russian army it is almost necessary that you should be found guilty since it would throw discredit upon the whole service were it published to the world that two unarmed young english officers had been attacked with a sword by a russian officer of rank  then things look rather badly for us said jack well it cant be helped you know and the count will no doubt write to our people at home to tell them the truth of the case  oh said the doctor you must not misunderstand me i only said that the new commandant had ordered that you should be tried by courtmartial but that is a very different thing from its being done we must get you out of prison tonight  you speak very confidently jack said laughing but how is it to be done  oh answered the doctor there is no great difficulty on that score it may be taken as certain that as a rule every russian official from the highest to the lowest is accessible to a bribe and that no prisoner with powerful friends outside need give up hope this is a military prison the soldiers at the gate are open to imbibe an unlimited amount of vodka whoever may send it the officer in command of them will be easily accessible to reasons which will induce him to shut his eyes to what is going on your warder here can of course be bought the count is already at work and as his means are ample and although under a cloud at present his connections powerful there is little fear that he will fail in succeeding by the way i have news to tell you do you hear the bells tolling the news has arrived that nicholas is dead alexander our new czar is known to be liberally disposed and were there time the count would go to st petersburg obtain an audience with him and explain the whole circumstances which by the way he has related to me this of course is out of the question and even were there time for him to go and return it would not be possible for him to obtain an audience with the new emperor just at present  i wish it could have been so jack said of course dick and i will be glad enough to avail ourselves of the chances of escape for it would be foolish to insist upon waiting to be tried by a tribunal certain beforehand to condemn us still one doesnt like the thought of making ones escape and so leaving it to be supposed that we were conscious of guilt  oh the doctor said you need not trouble yourself upon that score the governor was hated by every one and no one really doubts that he attacked you first upon the contrary the population are inclined to look upon you as public benefactors there will then be no feeling against you here but even if there were it would make but little difference at present every one in russia is talking and thinking of nothing but the death of the czar and of the changes which may be made by his son and the details of a squabble in an obscure town will attract no attention whatever and will not probably even obtain the honor of a paragraph in the odessa papers the first thing for us to do is to get your friend into a fit state to walk how do you feel he asked bending over dick and feeling his pulse  ever so much better dick said cheerfully since i have heard from you that there is a chance of escape i have been fretting so at the thought that i have got jack into such a wretched mess by my folly in telling the governor that i knew of his treachery if it had been only myself i shouldnt have cared  why my dear dick jack said cheerfully i never dreamt of blaming you and if you hadnt spoken out i have no doubt i should have done so no no old fellow whatever comes of it dont you blame yourself  can you stand do you think the doctor asked  oh i think so dick said and rising he managed to totter across the cell  that is all right the doctor said in a quarter of an hour you shall have a good dinner sent in from a restaurant i have arranged for that it is of course contrary to rule but a few roubles have settled it there will be supper too at eleven oclock there will also be a couple of bottles of firstrate burgundy from the counts cellar you are to eat two good meals and drink a third of a bottle at each of them your wounds are not in themselves serious and the only thing that ails you is loss of blood we must risk a little accession of fever for the sake of giving you strength when you have had your supper you had best both get to sleep if you can for an hour or two whatever arrangements we make will be for about two oclock in the morning and now goodbye for the present keep up your spirits and remember that even should any unexpected accident upset our plans for tonight we will carry them out tomorrow night as the courtmartial will not take place till the afternoon and there will be at least twentyfour probably fortyeight hours between the sentence and its execution  so saying the doctor took his departure leaving the lads far more cheerful and confident than they had been when he entered he seemed indeed to regard the success of the attempt which would be made for their evasion as secured the meal which consisted of some strong and nourishing soup and a dish of wellcooked meat shortly arrived and dick after partaking of it and drinking his prescribed allowance of burgundy announced that he felt a man again and ready for a tussle with the commandant after his meal he dozed quietly for some hours until aroused by the arrival of supper which consisted again of soup with some poached eggs served on vegetables  jack had not tried to sleep but had enjoyed a pipe which the doctor had with tobacco handed to him his own having been confiscated upon his entrance into the prison after supper however he threw himself upon the straw and slept soundly until awakened by a hand being placed on his shoulder he leaped to his feet and saw the warder beside him the man carried a lantern the candle with which the boys had been furnished by the doctors arrangement had burned out jack aroused his comrade and the two followed the warder who led the way along the corridor and down the stairs into the courtyard of the prison  the man did not walk with any particular caution and the lads judged from his movements that he had no fear whatever of interruption the door of the guardroom stood open and by the light of the fire which blazed within they could see the soldiers lying about in a drunken sleep at the gate itself the sentry on duty was sitting on the ground with his back against a wall and his musket beside him in a heavy drunken sleep  the warder unlocked the door the key being already in the lock the three issued out the gate was closed and locked on the outside and the key thrust under the gate the warder then led the way through the streets until he reached a small house near the outskirts the door opened as their footsteps approached and count preskoff came out  my dear boys he exclaimed embracing them as if he had been their father how much you have suffered for the sake of me and mine here he continued turning to the warder is the reward i promised you go straight on to the chateau you will find my coachman with a light carriage ready for starting he will drive you twentyfive miles on your way and you will then only have fifteen to walk before morning to the house of the woodman your brother where i hear you intend to remain hidden for the present you can rely upon my protection after the affair has blown over now come in lads this is the house of a faithful serf of mine who works here on his own account as an artisan and you will be safe from interruption for the next hour or two  upon entering the cottage the midshipmen were surprised to find the countess and her daughters who greeted them no less warmly than the count had done  my husband has told me all that you have done for us the countess said and how you first discovered the plot between the governor and that miserable traitor for our ruin i have blamed him for hiding it from us at first for surely a wife should know of the dangers to which her husband is exposed besides i and my daughters would have remained ignorant of the obligation we owe you  and to think of the way you took us in with the ponies olga laughed papa said that was your invention master jack thats another score against you  i hope dick said that you are running no risks on our account countess i fear that there may be suspicions that the count has been concerned in our escape  the deputycommandant may suspect the count said but he can prove nothing all in the chateau are i believe faithful but even were they not none know of our absence as we did not leave until all were asleep and shall return before daylight alexis will himself drive the warder to his destination he has the best pair of horses and will do the fifty miles in under four hours so that he will be back before any one is stirring the others concerned will hold their tongues for their own sakes the soldiers will not admit that they have been drunk but will declare that no one has passed the gate the lieutenant in charge will hang up the key on its hook in the guardroom and will declare that every time he made his rounds he found the men alert and vigilant it will therefore be supposed that the warder has let you out by a rope or in some other way no doubt there will be a vigilant hueandcry in the morning and the commandant will search every house will keep a sharp watch over the chateau and will scour the country for miles round but it will die away in time i wrote yesterday afternoon to my friends in st petersburg urging them to obtain the appointment of some friend to this post the party of reform will be in the ascendency in the counsels of the emperor and i have every hope that i shall shortly be restored to favor at court a matter by the way which i care for very much more for the sake of my daughters than for myself the countess and i are well content with our life in the country but the girls naturally look forward to the gayeties of life at the capital beside which he added laughing i must be looking for husbands for them and i fear that i should not find satisfactory suitors in this neighborhood  jack could not help glancing at olga for with a midshipmans usual inflammatory tendency he was convinced that he was hopelessly in love with that damsel olga colored and then turned away from which jack could gain no indication favorable or otherwise for his hopes  the count now explained the plans that had been adopted for their escape it would he said seem the natural course to aid you as we have done the warder by driving you far into the country but the descriptions of you are sure to be sent to every place within fifty miles i know no one to whom i could safely entrust you and the doctor says that it is impossible that our friend dick should walk for any distance for the next two or three days the doctor has fortunately received orders today to start at daybreak this morning with a convoy going back to sebastopol no doubt the new commandant had heard that he was prepared to give evidence at the courtmartial contradicting the governors statement that you were prisoners on parole and therefore wished to get him out of the way there are several of my carts which have been requisitioned for the service in the convoy i have here peasants dresses for you these you will put on and when the carts come along from the chateau half an hour before daybreak it is arranged that you will take the places of two of the drivers who will at once return home there will be no loading to do as the carts will be laden with flour for the army before they leave tonight so you will only have to go along with the others and take your places in the convoy after starting the doctor will come along the line and seeing dick limping will order him to take his place in one of the carts under his immediate charge with medicines and bedding for the hospitals one driver more or less in a team of some hundreds of wagons all following each other along a straight road will not be noticed so you will journey south for a week or so until dick has thoroughly recovered his strength you had then we think better make to the west by the odessa road the doctor will take two uniforms there are plenty obtainable in the hospital for you to put on you must of course run the risk of questioning and detection by the way but this cannot be avoided and at least you will be beyond the range of search from here and will be travelling by quite a different road from that which you would naturally take proceeding hence and now tell us all about your affair with the governor we have only so far heard his version of the affair which of course we knew to be false but why he should have attacked you in the way he did we cannot quite understand  dick gave an account of the struggle and the causes which led to it owning himself greatly to blame for his imprudence in acquainting the governor with his knowledge of his secret he also gave full credit to jack for his promptness not only in seizing the governor and so saving a repetition of the blow which would probably have been fatal but also in destroying the report and forged evidence of paul before interruption the lads gained great credit with all for their gallantry and katinka said laughing it is wrong to say so i suppose now he is dead but i should like to have seen the count struggling as jack carried him along like a little ant with a great beetle they all laughed  oh come now jack said there was not so much difference as all that he was not over six feet and i suppose i am only about five inches less and im sure i was not much smaller round the shoulders than he was  and now about your route the count said you must not lose time do you both quite agree with me that it would be next to impossible for you to pass through the lines of our army and to gain your own  quite impossible dick agreed jack and i have talked it over again and again and are of opinion that it could not be done even in russian uniforms we should be liable to be questioned by every officer who met us as to the reason of our being absent from our regiment and should be certain to be found out we thought that it might be possible to get hold of a fishingboat and sail down to join the fleet there would be of course the risk of being blown off the shore or becalmed and it would be difficult to lay in a stock of provisions  besides the count said there is no blockade at odessa and our small warsteamers cruise up and down the coast so that you would be liable to capture no i am sure your best way will be to go by land through poland there are still large bodies of troops to the southwest facing the turks and it would be better for you to keep north of these into poland you can go as wounded soldiers on furlough returning home and being taken for poles your broken russian will appear natural i will give you a letter which the countess has written to the intendant of her estates in poland and he will do everything in his power  i would rather not carry a letter dick said for it would compromise you if we were taken it would be better if i might suggest for the countess to write to him direct saying that when two persons arrive and give some password say for instance the names of your three daughters we shall not forget them he is to give us any help we may require  this was agreed upon and the party chatted until the count said that it was time for them to dress going into another room the boys clad themselves in two peasant costumes with the inseparable sheepskin coat which the russian peasant clings to until the full heat of summer sets in and which is especially during a journey invaluable the count then insisted upon their taking a bundle of rouble notes to the value of 200 l and upon their urging that they could have no possible need of so much money he pointed out that there was no saying what emergencies might occur during their journey and that after passing the frontier they would require a complete outfit and would have to pay the expenses of their journey either to england or the east whichever they might decide upon they rejoined the party in the front room just as a rumble of carts was heard approaching there was a hasty parting father mother and daughters kissed the midshipmen affectionately jack squeezed olgas hand at parting and in another minute they were standing in front of the door  yours will be the last two carts the count said  when these arrived opposite the house the count stepped forward and said a word to the drivers who instantly fell behind while the boys took up their places by the oxen and moved along with the procession of carts     chapter xvii   a journey in disguise  the start was accomplished many hundreds of carts were assembled in the great square a mounted officer and a small guard of soldiers had formed across the road which they were to follow and as soon as daylight had fairly appeared he gave the word and the carts began to file off along the southern road an account being taken of each cart as it passed out by an officer on duty to see that the number which had been requisitioned were all present no question was asked of the boys  as the driver of the first of those belonging to the count reported twelve carts each laden with thirty sacks of flour supplied by count preskoff the officer seeing the number was correct allowed them to pass without further question dick found himself still extremely weak and could not have proceeded many hundred yards if he had not taken a seat on the cart behind his oxen  after two hours travelling there was a halt for a quarter of an hour and the doctor passing along spoke to dick and then walked with him back along the line to the hospital carts which were in the rear here dick took his place among some bales of blankets and another was thrown over him in such a way that his presence there would not be suspected by any one riding past the cart upon the train proceeding jack took charge of the two carts this was an easy task the oxen proceeding steadily along without deviating from the line and requiring no attention whatever beyond an occasional shout and a blow of the stick when they loitered and left a gap in the line  alongside the drivers walked in groups of three or four talking together and thus the fact that one of the wagons was without its driver passed unnoticed alexis had told the counts serfs who accompanied the carts that their master had arranged at the last moment for hired men to take the places of two of their number one of whom had a wife sick at home and the other was engaged to be married shortly he had also told them that it was their masters wish that they should enter into no conversation with the strangers as these were from a northern province and scarcely understood the southern dialect  accustomed to obey every command of their master without hesitation the serfs expressed no wonder even among themselves at an order which must have appeared somewhat strange to them it was the counts pleasure and that was sufficient for them at the end of the day dick rejoined his comrade and assisted him to feed the oxen who required no further attention except the removal of the yoke when they lay down upon the ground and slept in their places dick brought him a supply of cold meat and white bread and a bottle of wine and the lads choosing a place apart from the others enjoyed their meal heartily and then climbing up on to the top of their flour sacks wrapped themselves in their sheepskins and were soon sound asleep  that evening a soldier brought a message to the officer in charge of the escort telling him that the two english prisoners had by the aid of their warder effected their escape bidding him search the convoy and keep a sharp lookout along the road and ordering him to give information to all village and military authorities and instruct them to send messages to all places near warning the authorities there not only to keep a sharp lookout but again to forward on the news so that in a short time it would be known in every village in the province  in the morning before starting the officer in charge of the escort rode along the line examining every wagon carefully asking the names of the drivers and referring to a paper with which he had been furnished by the owners of the carts at starting giving the names of the drivers the head man of the party from count preskoffs responded at once for the twelve men under him and satisfied that the fugitives were not in the convoy the officer gave orders to proceed  this time dick was able to walk two or three miles before dropping back to the hospital wagon the next day he went still farther and by the end of a week announced himself to be as strong as ever and the doctor allowed that he could now be trusted to travel  on this night they had halted at a point where a road running east and west crossed the great road to the crimea before starting the boys had a long chat with their friend the doctor who furnished them with military passes which he had procured from an officer these testified that ivan petrofski and alexis meranof of the 5th polish regiment were proceeding home on sickfurlough  the signature of the colonel was no doubt fictitious but this mattered but little jack inquired whether their absence in the morning would not be likely to be remarked but the doctor said that the head of the party had been informed by demetri that the two strangers would only accompany them for a few days march and had only been hired to satisfy the authorities that the right number of men had been furnished for the want of hands on the estate was now so great owing to the heavy drain of conscripts to fill up the losses caused by the war that the count had been glad to retain the services of the two who had been left behind there was therefore to be no remark concerning the disappearance of the new hands but the others were to take charge of their carts and if possible the authorities were to be kept unacquainted with the fact that their number was incomplete  the peasants dresses were now exchanged for the uniforms of russian soldiers dicks head was wrapped in bandages and his arm placed in a sling jacks leg was also enveloped in bandages the trousers being slit up to the hip and the sides loosely tied together by a piece of string and the doctor gave him a pair of crutches the same as those used in regimental hospitals  now you will do he said surveying them by the light of a lantern many of the soldiers who have joined since the outbreak of the war are mere boys so your age will not be against you only pray for a time give up all idea as to the necessity of washing the dirtier your hands and faces the better especially if the dirt will hide your clear healthy color which is very unlike the sallow complexions almost universal among our peasantry and now goodbye i move about too much to hope to receive any letter from you but as you have of course arranged with count preskoff to send him word when you have safely crossed the frontier i shall hear of you from him  with many deep and hearty thanks for the kindness he had shown them the boys parted from him and setting their faces to the west took the road to odessa jack carried his crutches on his shoulders as also the long strap which when he used them was to pass over his neck and down under his foot keeping it off the ground  they had made many miles before morning and as they had retained their sheepskin cloaks which had been served out to many of the troops they were able to get a comfortable sleep under shelter of a protecting wall five days walking took them to odessa this town was not upon the direct road but they still clung to the hope of getting away by sea  on the journey they had met several bodies of troops and many convoys of provisions and stores whenever they observed the former to be approaching they left the road and sheltered themselves behind bushes or inequalities of the ground at a distance from the road as they knew they would be liable to be questioned as to the state of things at the front they did not however go out of their way for convoys as they passed these with short salutations in reply to the greetings or pitying remarks from the drivers their russian was good enough to pass muster when confined to short sentences of a formal kind their hearts beat when on passing over a rise they saw the blue water stretching out far before them and they again debated the possibility of seizing a boat but the sight of two gunboats steaming slowly along the shore convinced them that the attempt would be an extremely dangerous one  odessa is not a fortress and the boys consequently entered it unquestioned the town was crowded with wounded and sick soldiers and their appearance attracted no attention whatever in the principal streets the lads saw many names of english firms over offices and the majority of the shops appeared to be kept by frenchmen and germans they walked down to the wharves and saw how great must have been the trade carried on before the war now all traffic and business was at an end  the great foreign merchants interested in the corn trade had all left and many of the shops were closed  the harbor was deserted save that a score or two of brigs employed in the coastingtrade in the black sea lay moored by the wharves with hatches battened down and deserted decks a little farther out lay at anchor two or three frigates and some gunboats looking seaward not a single sail broke the line of the horizon  returning into the town they went up some small streets entered a small eatinghouse and asked for food for the stock with which they had started four days before had been exhausted the previous evening the landlord served them and as they were eating he entered into conversation with them  i suppose you have leave out of hospital for the day  no dick said my comrade and i have got leave to go home to poland till our wounds are cured  oh the landlord said you are poles i thought you did not look quite like our men but you speak russian well for poles there is a regiment of your countrymen in the town now and some of them come in sometimes for a glass of brandy they like it better than vodka curious isnt it your true russian thinks that theres nothing better than vodka  rather disturbed at the intelligence that there was a polish regiment in the town the boys hastened through their meal and determined to lay in a stock of bread and meat sufficient for some days consumption and to leave odessa at once just as they had finished however the door opened and a sergeant and two soldiers entered  ah my friend the landlord said to the former i am glad to see you are you come as usual for a glass of brandy real french stuff it is i promise you though for my part i like vodka here are two of your compatriots wounded they have furlough to return home lucky fellows say i there are thousands at sebastopol would be glad to change places with them even at the cost of their wounds  the sergeant strode to the table at which the lads were sitting and drawing a chair up held out his hands to them goodday comrades he said in polish so are you on your way home lucky fellows i would give my stripes to be in your place if only for a fortnight  dick for a moment was stupefied but jack recalled to mind three sentences which the countess had taught him and which might she said prove of use to them did they happen to come across any insurgent bands in poland for vague reports were current in spite of the efforts of the authorities to repress them that the poles were seizing the opportunity of their oppressors being engaged in war again to take up arms the sentences were passwords of a secret association of which the countesss father had been a member and which were widely whispered among patriotic poles the dawn will soon be at hand we must get up in the morning poland will yet be free the sergeant stared at them in astonishment and answering in a low tone in some words which were the boys guessed the countersign to the pass sat down by them but you are not poles he said in a low voice in russian your language is strange i could scarce understand you  no jack said in similar tones we are not poles nor russians we are english and england has always been the friend of poland  that is so the sergeant said heartily landlord he said raising his voice a glass of vodka for each of my friends i fear that my money will not run to brandy and now he said when the landlord had returned to his place what are you doing here can i help you in any way  we are english officers who have escaped and are making our way to poland we expect to find friends there do you know the intendant of the countess preskoff at  do i know him the soldier repeated why i belong to the next village i have seen him hundreds of times and the countess do you know the countess  certainly we do jack said we have been living for six weeks in her chateau it is she who has written to the intendant to aid us  you will be welcome everywhere for her sake she is a kind mistress and greatly beloved it is a pity that she married a russian though they say he is a good fellow tell me can i do anything for you do you want for money  no indeed jack replied the countess has taken care of that  look here the sergeant said i will give you a note to my brother who is a horsedealer at warsaw it may be useful to you he knows every one and if as they say there is trouble in poland he is sure to be in the thick of it and at any rate he will be able to give you advice which may be useful and addresses of safe people in different towns to whom you can go landlord give me some paper and pen and ink my comrades here know friends of mine at home and will carry a letter for me  please be careful dick said as the soldier began to write it is possible we may be searched on the way so do not say anything that a russian official might not read  trust me the sergeant answered laughing we poles have been learning to conceal our feelings for generations trust me to write a letter which my brother will understand at once but which will seem the most innocent thing in the world to any russian official who may read it  in a few minutes the letter was finished and the three left the place together the sergeant telling his comrades that he would return shortly for them he then accompanied the midshipmen and did their shopping for them and bidding him a hearty adieu they were soon on their way out of odessa jack swinging along upon his crutches at a fair pace once fairly away from the town he took his foot from the strap shouldered his crutches and again they trudged along upon their journey  they found their walking powers improve day by day as they went on and were soon able to make thirtyfive miles a day without inconvenience travelling in this way without any interruption or incident save an occasional demand for a view of their passport by some russian official they journeyed across the south of russia and ten days after leaving odessa they entered poland  here they foresaw that their difficulties would be far greater than before and that their characters as polish soldiers on their way home could no longer be sustained they took therefore the first opportunity of purchasing two suits similar to those worn by polish peasants and entering a wood dressed themselves in their new attire and rolling their dirtstained uniforms into a bundle thrust them into a clump of underwood into this jack also joyfully tossed his crutches and strap dick had long been able to dispense with his sling but the wound on his face was scarcely healed and was still angrylooking and irritable  they now trudged steadily along avoiding all conversation as much as possible and making their purchases only in a quiet villages they met many bodies of troops moving about the roads and although they could understand nothing of the language and were wholly ignorant of what was going on they judged from the manner in which these troops marched by the advance guard thrown out in front the strong detachments which accompanied the baggage and the general air of vigilance which marked them that the country was in a troubled state  once convinced of this they took care to conceal themselves whenever they saw troops approaching as they feared that questions might be addressed to them which they might find it difficult to answer there was the less difficulty in their doing this as the country was for the most part thickly wooded the roads sometimes running for miles through forests upon one occasion when just as it was dusk they had gone in among the trees having seen a russian column moving along the road they were astonished at being suddenly seized gagged and carried off through the wood so suddenly had this been done that they had time neither to cry nor struggle  after being carried some distance they were thrown down on the ground and the men who had carried them hurried away just as they did so there was a sudden outburst of musketry mingled with loud yells and shouts then after a moments pause came the rattle of a rolling musketry fire the first jack judged to be the fire of insurgents upon the column the second that of the troops for a while the din of battle went on sharp ringing volleys heavy irregular firing the fierce wild shouts of the insurgents and occasionally the hoarse hurrah of russian soldiery  presently the sounds grew fainter and the lads judged by the direction that the russian column was falling back in retreat ere long the sounds of firing ceased altogether and in scattered knots of three and four men came through the wood to the wide open space in which the midshipmen were lying bound no attention was paid to them for some time until a large body of men were collected then the lads were suddenly raised and carried to a large fire which was nowblazing in the centre of the clearing here the gags were taken from their mouths and the cords unbound and they saw confronting them a young man evidently by his dress and bearing a person of rank and authority and as they judged by the attitude of those standing round the leader of the insurgent band  where do you come from and what are you doing here he asked in polish  the boys shook their heads in token of their ignorance of the language  i thought so he said angrily in russian you are spies russian spies i thought as much when the news came to me that two peasants had entered a village shop to buy goods but had been unable to ask for them except by pointing to them and had given a rouble note and allowed the woman who served them to take her own change you are detected sirs and may prepare for the death you deserve hang them at once he said in polish to those standing near but first search them thoroughly and see if they are the bearers of any documents  the lads in vain endeavored to explain but their voices were drowned in the execrations of the angry peasants fresh from the excitement of the battle and in many cases bleeding from bullet and bayonet wounds for the polish peasants always rush to close quarters concealed in dicks waistband was found a heavy roll of russian notes and the yell which greeted its appearance showed that it was considered confirmatory of the guilt of the prisoners  upon jack was found only the letter which the sergeant had given him to his brother the horsedealer this was taken to the leader and he opened and read it by the light of a blazing brand which one of his followers held beside him stop he shouted after reading the first line or two to the men who were already hurrying the lads towards the nearest tree wait till i have read this through he read it to the end and then beginning afresh again went carefully through it bring the prisoners here he said young men he went on when the lads were again placed before him there may be some mistake here this letter purports to be from a sergeant of the 12th polish regiment to his brother horni varlofski now varlofski is well known to many of us i do not know whether he has a brother a sergeant does any one here know  two or three of the men raised their voices to say that they knew that varlofski the horsedealer had a brother who was drafted into the army as a punishment for having struck a russian sergeant in a brawl  this must be the man then the leader said the letter is written carefully apparently with a view to avoid any suspicion should it be opened and read by any but him for whom it is intended but in fact it contains assurances couched in language which i understand that the bearers are enemies of russia and friends of poland and that every confidence may be placed in them now sirs will you explain to me how you who speak no polish come to be in the middle of the forest dressed as polish peasants and the bearers of a letter such as this  we are english officers dick began who were taken prisoners at sebastopol and have since escaped  he then proceeded to explain the circumstances of their residence at count preskoffs of their recommendation to the intendant of the countesss estates in poland of their acquaintance with the insurgent passwords and their meeting with the sergeant at odessa when they had concluded the young leader held out his hand to them  gentlemen he said i ask your pardon for the roughness with which you have been treated and shall never forgive myself for having without sufficient inquiry condemned you to death it will be a lesson to me never to judge by appearances in future i knew the countess well before her marriage her estates are but a few miles distant from my own and i last saw her some three years since when she was there with her husband and daughters by the way he said carelessly what are their names  dick instantly repeated them  right the pole answered pardon me this last test but one cannot be too particular when the lives of hundreds depend upon a mistake not being made i am satisfied now welcome heartily welcome to our camp     chapter xviii   the polish insurgents  a few words from the leader explained to his followers that the newcomers were friends their money was instantly restored to them and those who a few minutes before were so eager to hurry them to execution were profuse in their apologies and demonstrations of respect the poles regarded england as a friendly power and were eagerly watching the war in the crimea hoping that the strength of russia would be so exhausted there that she would be obliged to weaken her hold on poland so far however great as were the number of troops that russia had poured down to meet the allies she had in no way weakened her hold upon poland indeed even larger numbers of troops than usual were massed in that country the insurrection at present going on was intended rather as a proof to europe that poland yet lived ground down though she was under the heel of russian tyranny than as a movement from which success could be reasonably hoped for  the lads were now able to look round at the wild group which filled the clearing the greater portion were peasants although the dress and bearing of several proclaimed that they belonged to a superior class some of the peasants were armed with guns but these were quite in the minority the greater portion carrying scythe blades fastened to long handles these although clumsy to look at were terrible weapons in a close onslaught and the russian soldiers could seldom be kept firm by their officers when in spite of their fire the polish peasantry rushed among them the poles were in high spirits their own loss had been small and they had inflicted great slaughter upon the head of the russian column and had gained a considerable number of arms a party which had attacked the rear of the column at the same moment when the main body fell upon its head had for a time obtained possession of a wagon with spare ammunition and had succeeded in carrying off the greater part of it  the leader of the party having given orders to his men and seen that the wounded were carried away on stretchers roughly formed of boughs either to their own villages or when these were too distant to a collection of woodcutters huts in the heart of the forest returned and took a seat by the lads near the fire  we have not introduced ourselves yet he said in russian laughing my name is stanislaus chernatony  dick named himself and his comrades  tell me now the pole said how you got here and what are your plans  dick in reply gave him a narrative of their adventures and said that they were making their way to the austrian frontier  it would be absolutely impossible the pole said for you to succeed in making your way in safety every town is full of russian troops who are forever scouring the roads it would be out of the question for any one except a native to succeed in getting through and even a pole would find difficulty so strictly is every one questioned of course their object is to prevent our bands from increasing and to capture any of us who may be returning to our homes we only manage to assemble by marching constantly in the woods by paths known only to villagers you would find it too a matter of extreme difficulty to cross the frontier even should you gain it as there is a perfect cordon of troops posted along the frontier to prevent any one from escaping once in austria you would be safe but you could not cross into prussia even if you succeeded in passing the russian troops stationed along that line for prussia who is as harsh a master to the poles under her rule as is russia acts as policeman for the latter and turns all fugitives back who may cross the frontier at present i fear i can give you no assistance but there is a talk of a union of several of our bands further west and in that case you might travel with us and we might pass you on and see that you had guides for the present i can either lodge you in the village where our wounded are now taken and where it is not likely that the russians will find you at any rate for the present or if you like to join us i need not say how glad we shall be to receive you as comrades england has always been the friend of poland and more than one of your countrymen has fought in the polish ranks as england is at war at present with russia you will be doing as much service by fighting her here as in the crimea here too you will have the satisfaction that you are fighting for an oppressed people struggling for freedom against tremendous odds  the lads asked for twelve hours before giving a final answer and then having shared the poles rough meal they chatted with him for a long time upon the progress and chances of the insurrection the polish leader told them that there were a score of bands like his own in the forests but he admitted that he saw but little hope of final success unless russia were completely crippled in the war with england and france  but he said we in poland do not rise only when we consider success possible we take up arms when we are goaded to it when some act of russian tyranny more gross and brutal than usual goads us to desperation we take up arms to kill and to die you know not the awful persecution to which we poles are exposed whole villages are destroyed and the inhabitants banished to siberia our young men are taken and compelled to serve in the russian army scores are shot down after a mockery of a trial on the pretence of discontent with russian rule women ay and ladies are publicly flogged priests are massacred our churches closed our very language proscribed death is a thousand times preferable to the living torture we undergo and when we at last rise it is vengeance and death that we seek rather than with any thought of finally freeing poland from her oppressors and now he said you will excuse me if i suggest that we follow the example of my comrades and turn off to sleep we have marched fifty miles since yesterday evening and shall be off before daybreak tomorrow  for half an hour after the polish leader had rolled himself in his cloak and gone off to sleep the boys chatted together as to the course they should adopt and finally resolved to throw in their fortunes with those of the polish patriots they saw that it would be impossible for them to make their way on to the frontier alone and considered that their chance of life was no less if captured in action by the russians than if found in a village with a number of wounded insurgents the wrongs of poland were in those days a subject which moved mens hearts in england and the midshipmen rejoiced at the thought of striking a blow in so good a cause  these were the reasons which in talking the matter over they assigned to each other but in reality their love of adventure and excitement in no slight degree influenced them to have taken part in a real polish insurrection to join in guerilla attacks and fierce onslaughts on russian columns to live a wild life in the woods were things that appealed strongly to the imagination of the midshipmen and in the morning they expressed to stanislas chernatony their willingness to join him and fight against the russians until an opportunity occurred for them to cross the frontier and rejoin the forces before the sebastopol  good the pole said i am heartily glad to have two english officers fighting under me the warfare is of a kind very different to that to which you are accustomed but i can guarantee that you shall see that we poles undisciplined badly armed and fighting a hopeless battle can yet die as bravely as your own trained soldiers in the crimea we are now going back to the place we left the day before yesterday and which we regard as our headquarters we had news that the column we attacked was to set out and as so far none of our bands had visited this neighborhood we thought we might take them by surprise we succeeded in doing them much damage but our success was not as great as that which we gained in our last fight when we succeeded in capturing two cannons by the way he said you as marine officers are accustomed to artillery  yes dick replied we are drilled not only with heavy ships guns but with light fieldpieces of which every large vessel carries a few to be used in case of a landing  capital the pole exclaimed we have not a man who has any idea of artillery and i will appoint you to the command of the guns you shall each pick out as many men as you require and train them as artillerymen this will be an invaluable service to us  late at night they reached their haltingplace the guns had been hidden in a thicket every man having marched with his leader to the attack of the column the next morning thirtysix men were chosen eighteen to each gun in order that the places of those who might be killed could be filled at once or should some more pieces be taken men would be available already trained to the work  for four days drill went on without intermission the lads found the polish peasants very intelligent although it was difficult for them to understand why each movement should be performed with mechanical regularity at first too the boys ignorance of polish caused them great difficulty but stanislas wrote down for them the translation of the words of command and the movements were taught by the boys themselves performing them and insisting upon their motions being accurately imitated they worked from morning till night and by the end of the fourth day were satisfied that their men could serve the guns in a workmanlike and regular way  the poles themselves were delighted when they found how swiftly and smoothly the work could be done now that they had mastered it and looked forward with anxiety to try the results upon the russians they had not long to wait in a short time friends from the next garrison town brought the news that considerable bodies of fresh troops had arrived there and that an attack was to be made on the following day by two heavy columns messengers were sent off at once and during the night the insurgents were joined by three other bands raising their numbers to nearly 1500 men stanislas told the lads that he intended to move before daybreak so as to attack one of the columns as soon as it entered the forest and while the other was too far away to arrive at the scene of action until all would be over  i propose he said to fell some trees across the road arranging them so that the guns can fire between them while the trunks will afford the gunners some shelter half the men will be arranged among the trees on either side so that while the guns sweep the column we shall attack it upon either flank i will place a hundred of my best men at the barricade to defend the guns should the column press forward in spite of our efforts but i believe that we shall have an easy victory our recent partial successes have considerably added to our stock of arms and as this is the first time that we have brought cannon into play we may rely upon their effect being considerable  the lads begged that they might go forward with the party charged with felling the trees in order that they might choose the spot and themselves see to the construction of the defence stanislas chose one of his lieutenants who spoke russian and giving him 200 men ordered him to carry out the instructions of the lads they set off an hour before daylight and just as the dawn began arrived at the spot where the struggle was to take place  they selected a point where a rise of six feet afforded a view of the road far in advance and placed the guns just so far behind the trees that while they would sweep the road their muzzles only could be seen by an advancing foe two large trees felled and stripped of their boughs were placed across the road in front of the guns being when placed just high enough for the gunners to look over them a strong party were then set to work to cut sods and with these an earthwork was thrown up across the road four feet high embrasures were left for the guns and these were made very narrow as the fire would be directly in front on either side trees were felled with their boughs outward so as to form a chevauxdefrise extending at an angle on each side of the road for fifty yards in advance of the guns  fifty of the men were to remain in the road in the rear of the guns in readiness to man the earthwork should the russians advance to take it by storm while the rest were to lie down behind the chevauxdefrise and to open fire upon both flanks of the advancing column a few green boughs were scattered on the road in front of the battery and the lads going along the roads by which the russians would advance were pleased to see that at a distance the work was scarcely noticeable just as they had finished their preparations stanislas with the main body arrived and all were greatly pleased at the position which the boys had constructed the guns and ammunition wagons had been dragged along by ropes to which hundreds of the peasants had harnessed themselves  the poles now took up the positions assigned to them for the attack stanislas and his principal officers held a consultation with the midshipmen and it was agreed that the russian column should be allowed to approach near to the guns before these opened fire and that their doing so should be the signal for the general attack upon the column half an hour later a peasant who had been placed near the edge of the wood announced that the russian column was in sight that so far as he could judge from his observations made from a treetop it numbered about 2000 infantry with a battery of artillery  that is just a fair match for us stanislaus said the 500 men extra do not count for much and their superiority of arms will be counterbalanced by our advantages of surprise and to the effect which cannon brought against them for the first time may exercise on the minds of the soldiers  presently along the straight road the black column of the enemy could be seen they were advancing in a heavy mass some forty men abreast and were preceded at a distance of 300 yards by an advance guard of 200 men when distant some 400 yards from them the midshipmen observed the advance guard halt and guessed that an obstacle of some sort or other across the road had been made out a mounted officer rode back from the advance guard to the main body and was there joined by several other mounted men after some conversation a movement was seen in the column a mounted officer rode back and as he did so the column divided leaving a passage in the centre of the road  there was a long pause and then the lads could see the russian guns coming through the line they halted and formed across the road halfway between the main body and the advance guard and unlimbering prepared to open fire upon the unknown obstacle in their front the midshipmen had arranged with stanislas that as it would be difficult for the parties on the flank of the russian column to distinguish between the sound of the enemys guns and their own a white handkerchief should be hoisted on a long pole when they themselves opened fire and a chain of men were placed along back in the wood to repeat the signal down to the spot where the poles were lying ready for attack  the russians opened fire over the heads of their advance guard who lay down in the road the shot for the most part either struck the slope or flew overhead very few striking the upper part of the battery face which was alone exposed to their fire for five minutes the russians continued to fire then deceived by the absolute silence which reigned and supposing the obstacle was an accidental one or that the insurgents had retired the guns were limbered up the advance guard again moved forward and the main column marched on close behind the guns  the whole of the 200 men who had been placed behind the barricade were armed with muskets and each hidden behind the leafy screen rested his piece on a branch and prepared to pour his fire into the column as it advanced it was not until the advance guard was within fifty yards of them that the lads who had themselves trained the guns to sweep the road gave the signal and the silence was broken by the roar of the two guns loaded to the muzzle with grapeshot the effect was tremendous two lanes were literally mown through the ranks of the russian infantry the shot which flew high doing terrible execution among the artillery behind them  the echoes had not died away when a tremendous fire of musketry was opened by the poles hidden behind the abattis more than half of the advance guard fell under that terrible discharge and the artillery crowded behind them fell into confusion  the russian officers strove by voice and example to gather the survivors of the advance guard together but the consternation which the slaughter had caused was heightened by the sound of a tremendous yell far behind followed by a steady roll of musketry showing that the column was hotly engaged there also the artillery attempted to unlimber and to bring their guns to bear again but the confusion that prevailed in the crowded spot rendered this next to impossible and long before it could be accomplished the iron hail again swept through the ranks and two rattling volleys from their invisible foes behind the flanking abattis again flashed out the advance guard were annihilated the artillery in confusion but the general commanding the main column pushed his men on through the frightened horses of the artillery and opening a heavy musketry fire on their unseen foes pressed forward to the assault  the conflict now became a desperate one the midshipmen fired their guns alternately as fast as they could load the poles working as steadily and coolly as if they had been longtrained artillerymen several times the russians advanced to within twenty yards of the defences but each time shattered by the fire of grapeshot and by the storm of bullets from the abattis they recoiled in vain they flung themselves upon the trees and tried to hew a way through them in vain the officers called upon them to gather themselves together and carry the battery at a rush receiving no aid from their own artillery which mingled in the throng of infantry were helpless shaken by the shouts of the assailants and by the battle raging in their rear which told them their retreat was menaced the russians lost heart and began to fall back then retaining only fifty men as a guard to the battery the midshipmen ordered the rest of the defenders of the abattis to move forward among the trees on the flanks of the russians keeping up a constant fire until they joined the main body in their attack on the russian rear  in the battery now they could see little of what was going forward the woods were full of dense smoke the whole russian column as it fell back was maintaining a wild fire at random into the bushes around them  but though the lads could see nothing the road in front afforded them a sure guide for their aim and ceaselessly the guns kept up their fire into the retreating mass of russians  for half an hour the roar of guns continued unabated and then as it died away the triumphant shouts of the pole told them that the victory was won and that the russian column defeated and shattered had retired from the forest and gained the open country beyond then the defenders of the battery raised an answering cheer to their friends in the distance and exhausted with their exertions threw themselves on the ground  of those working the guns but three had been wounded by rifle bullets which had passed through the embrasures  several of the riflemen had fallen shot through the head as they fired over the top of the battery while thirty or forty lay killed and wounded behind the abattis  after a few minutes rest the party advanced and soon joined their friends who saluted them with loud acclamations the victory had been a complete one the whole of the spare ammunition and stores had fallen into the hands of the victors upon overpowering the rearguard had cut the traces and carried off the horses the column had made a sturdy resistance at this point and although the desperate onslaughts of the scythearmed poles had several times broken their ranks and carried slaughter among them they had yet stood firm and it was only the crushing of the head of the column and its subsequent retreat which had at last decided the day  for some hundred yards in front of the guns the ground was covered with russian dead most of the artillery horses had fallen and but two of the guns had been carried off the field the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded left upon the ground amounted to nearly 800 and the wounded were all killed as soon as discovered by the infuriated peasants  of the poles some 250 had been put horsdecombat the delight of the insurgents was unbounded it was by far the most important victory which they had won they had now come into possession of sufficient muskets to arm the whole body and an abundant supply of ammunition and had in all a complete battery of artillery with enough horses taken from the wagons to give two to each gun and leave a sufficient number for the ammunition wagons the two midshipmen received the warmest thanks of the polish leader who attributed his success entirely to the slaughter which the guns had wrought and to the dispositions taken for their defence     chapter xix   to the rescue  a consultation was held on the evening of the battle as was the custom of the polish peasants after a success many wished to return for a while to their homes and families several plans were proposed among the group of officers and the leader asked the young midshipmen for their opinion  dick said that in his ignorance of the circumstances and the geography of the country he could offer none but jack on being appealed to said  it seems to me that you will never do any good if you confine yourselves to beating back a russian column occasionally and then dispersing until they again advance my opinion is that it is absolutely necessary to follow up the victory we have gained and to do something which will induce the whole country to believe that there is a prospect of success we have gained a very fair victory today i propose that while the men are all in high spirits and the russians proportionately depressed we take the offensive and fall upon one of their garrisons hitherto as you say you have always contented yourselves with attacking the columns sent out against you and the russians will be altogether unprepared for an attack on them in their own quarters if we fall suddenly at night upon piaski we ought to succeed in nearly annihilating them there are about 1200 men of the column whom we have fought and about 2000 in the other column which marched out against us this morning but fell back when they heard of the defeat of their comrades it is probable that pretty nearly the whole force in the town came out so that altogether there cannot be above 2500 men if we can fall upon them at night we ought to be able to defeat them easily at any rate before they rally we should inflict tremendous damage upon them  jacks proposition was received with acclamation and it was decided that the attack should take place on the following night the officers therefore went among the men and appealed to them to remain for another fortyeight hours in order that they might annihilate the garrison of piaski  the men assented the more readily that abundant supplies of bread and spirits had been found in the captured wagons the russian commander having deemed it probable that the expedition might extend over a period of some days  the next morning all were instructed in the use of the russian muskets many of the peasants being wholly unacquainted with the management of firearms it was arranged that each peasant should in addition to his gun carry his scythe his favorite weapon for close conflict  when night came on all was ready for the march the bands were to advance separately each under orders of its own leader and were to unite in the marketplace as the clock struck one there were three barracks and a certain proportion were told off for the attack of each three of the guns were hidden in the forest the other three each drawn by four horses accompanied the column the duty assigned to them being to blow in the gates of the several barracks coarse grass was cut and swathed round the wheels and the horses feet were also muffled the peasants were all clad in sandals and there was therefore no fear of the noise of their advance being heard  at nine oclock the column set out for the town which was nine miles distant and upon nearing it separated so as to enter as arranged in different directions each column was preceded at a distance of some hundred yards by four or five men chosen for their activity their duty being to seize and silence any watchmen they might meet in the streets  the town seemed absolutely asleep when the band of stanislas with which for the time were the three cannon entered it a few minutes before one  once the lads thought that they could hear a stifled cry but if so it attracted no attention for the streets were deserted and not a single window opened as they passed the other hands had already arrived in the marketplace when that commanded by stanislas reached it  a few words were exchanged by the leaders a gun told off to each column and the bands started to their respective destinations the contingent of count stanislas to which jack archer was attached with his gun was intended to attack the principal barrack this was built in the form of a large quadrangle and contained some seven or eight hundred infantry and a battery of artillery  as the head of the column entered the street leading to the gate a sentry on the outside challenged no answer was made and a moment later a gun was fired  there was no longer any need for concealment and with a wild cheer the column rushed forward some of the men threw themselves with axes upon the postern gate which the sentry had entered and closed behind him  the gun which was close to the head of the column was brought up and placed in position within a few feet of the gate its muzzle directed towards the lock the explosion tore a hole in the gate but a massive bar still kept this in its place another discharge broke this also and the poles with exulting shouts surged in  as they entered a scattered fire opened upon them from the windows but without pausing the band broke up into parties each under its chief and rushed at the entrances leading to the staircases  then ensued a desperate conflict the russians taken wholly by surprise appalled by the suddenness of the attack and knowing the ferocity with which their assailants fought in some cases offered but slight resistance and leaped by scores from the windows at the back preferring the risk of death or broken limbs to awaiting the rush of their enemies others defended themselves desperately gathering on the top of the stairs barring the doors and resisting foot by foot until every man had been cut down  the absence of their officers who were quartered together in a different part of the barracks proved fatal to the defenders accustomed to act like machines and to move only at the command of their officers they were bewildered at finding themselves under such circumstances without head or direction and in ten minutes after the entry had been effected all resistance had ceased and the barracks remained in the hands of the victorious poles  the instant that his own part of the work was done jack archer with a band of fifty men who had been told off to act under his orders proceeded to the stables the artillery horses were all brought out and harnessed to the guns and wagons and by the time that the resistance had ceased these were ready to depart  the poles taking the muskets of the russian soldiers and lading themselves with blankets and such other articles as they fancied swarmed out into the courtyard in the storerooms of the barracks were found large quantities of uniforms ready for issue to the troops and a number of these count stanislas ordered to be brought out and stowed in an empty wagon  three minutes later the barrack was set on fire in a dozen places then the newlycaptured artillery started at a trot for the forest while the poles moved away to render any assistance which might be necessary to the other columns  the division to which dick hawtry was attached had experienced a success as complete as that which attended the principal column and the flames were already rising in the air as the latter issued into the town  the other barrack was however successfully defending itself it was supposed that some watchman must have conveyed the news of the advance of the insurgents for the instant the column appeared within sight of the barracks a musketry fire was opened upon it by the guard at the gate and two or three minutes later every window bearing upon it was thrown up and the russian infantry opened a heavy fire the gunners in vain attempted to bring up their piece close to the gate the horses had been shot down but scores of willing hands pushed forward the gun but so heavy was the destruction which the russian bullets wrought among them that these also were brought to a standstill and when count stanislas arrived he found that a furious musketry encounter was raging between the poles now scattered all round the barrack and the russians pouring from the upper windows after a hasty consultation with the other leaders it was agreed that as the victory had been complete so far two out of the three barracks carried and burnt 1500 russians killed and a battery of artillery taken it would be a pity to risk a final repulse by an attack upon a building which now that the garrison were prepared for resistance could only be carried with a great loss of life  the horns were accordingly sounded and the assailants drawn off and the column marched through the town now illuminated by the flames of the two burning barracks it was but half an hour since the attack had begun but the appearance of the town had changed as if by magic every house was lit up every window open crowds of people thronged the streets while the windows were filled with women and children all were delirious with delight and cheered shouted and waved their handkerchiefs as the patriot band marched along not a few of the younger men bidding a hasty adieu to their friends joined the ranks of their countrymen and seizing one of the captured muskets prepared to take a part in the strife which had been so well begun  upon gaining the forest a halt was ordered great fires were lit and the companies mustered when it was found that some eighty of those present had received wounds and that forty had fallen all the wounded unable to walk had been carried off as to leave them where they fell would be to expose them to certain death when found by the russians a plentiful supply of spirits had been found in the stores and several barrels brought off an ample allowance was now served out and after an hours carouse in honor of the victory the band fatigued by their exertions went off to sleep  in the morning the gunsnow amounting to two complete batterieswere taken some miles farther into the forest the greater part of the band insisted upon returning to their homes for a few days and their leader finding himself powerless to resist the determination gave them leave to do so all agreed to return at the end of ten days some 400 men remained and from these the count requested the midshipmen to choose a sufficient number to constitute two batteries each eighty strong and to drill them as far as possible in the interval he himself started to visit his estates which lay about eighty miles from their present position here he hoped to raise a further contingent of men and all who went home were bidden to bring back fresh recruits and to spread everywhere the news of the victory  six days elapsed and the band in the forest had already been increased by many hundreds of newcomers whom the news of the successes which had been gained had induced to take up arms and the time of the various leaders was fully occupied in giving some notion of drill and of the use of the musket to the new levies  on the evening of the sixth day a peasant arrived with intelligence which spread dismay in the encampment count stanislas had been captured by the russians having been surprised by a body of russian cavalry who doubtless by means of a spy had obtained news of his return home he had been conveyed to lublin where he would doubtless be at once tried and executed  a council of the leaders was hastily summoned  lublin was a large town garrisoned by some 5000 russian troops and even had the whole of the insurgent bands been collected they would not have been strong enough to attempt a repetition of their late successful surprise especially as after that occurrence the russian troops would be everywhere on the alert  all agreed that the loss of their most successful leader would be a deathblow to the revolt in that part of the country the personal popularity of the young leader was immense and the prestige which he had won by his several successes had excited the greatest confidence among his followers so important was his life considered that the midshipmen urged that at all costs his rescue should be attempted and although the enterprise appeared a desperate one their proposal was finally agreed to  a few men were at once despatched to lublin to find out what was going on and when and where the execution would take place while 500 chosen men prepared to march through the forests to a point within a few miles of the town where the spies were to rejoin them  just as they were starting the idea struck dick that the russian uniforms might be utilized and much to their disgust half the party were ordered to dress themselves in the hated garb the transformation was soon effected and the band set out on their march  upon the third evening they arrived at the indicated spot where several of the spies were already awaiting them these informed them that the trial would take place on the following day and that it was generally supposed that the count would be executed the next morning as there could be no doubt what the finding of the court would be  next day the midshipmen accompanied by several of the leaders all in peasants dress visited the town to learn its general features and make themselves acquainted with the approaches to the great square where it was considered probable the execution would take place they found the whole population moody and depressed the news of the successes of the patriot bands had already spread far and wide and had excited high hopes in every polish breast the fact then that the most successful leader was in the hands of their enemies had spread universal grief and consternation after learning all the particulars they desired the party rejoined their friends in the forest the greatest difficulty existed from the fact that it would be impossible for the rescuing party to carry either muskets or their long scythes some twenty revolvers had fallen into their hands in the two fights and with these the officers had all armed themselves a certain portion of the men cut long sticks like oxgoads made to fit the bayonets others fitted short handles to their scythes while others carried short heavy sticks to which again bayonets were fitted a hundred of those dressed as soldiers were to carry their muskets and under the orders of one of their leaders to march boldly down the street so timing their arrival as to reach the square just at the time at which the execution was to take place while the rest were to mix with the crowd  late at night the news was brought to them that proclamations had been posted through the town saying that the execution would take place at eight in the morning in the grand square orders had been issued it was learnt that 1000 troops should be present and the others were ordered to be in readiness in their barracks in case any sign of popular feeling should be manifested as it was evident therefore that no soldiers in uniform would be loitering in the street it was determined that the 250 men so dressed should march together to the square with their arms  in the morning the insurgents in twos and threes started for the town and joined the townspeople assembling in the great square across the square within thirty or forty paces of one side was formed up a strong battalion of russian infantry the rest of the square being occupied by the townspeople all of whom had attired themselves in mourning in the centre of the square behind the soldiers a scaffold had been erected as by the sentence of the courtmartial the count was to die by hanging  the midshipmen and their friends made their way through the crowd to the front the latter giving way upon a whisper being circulated that an attempt was to be made to rescue the prisoner and the 250 insurgents were soon gathered in a close body in front of the soldiers standing before the scaffold each man had his scythe or bayonet hidden under his long coat the leaders grasping their pistols the men had been ordered to refrain from any expression of excitement and to assume as far as possible a look of quiet grief behind the infantry were a number of mounted officers among whom general borodoff the governor of the town and district was pointed out to the midshipmen and near the general under a strong guard the prisoner was standing all the insurgents with the exception of those forming the first line quietly fitted their scythes and bayonets to the handles and waited the signal  presently there was a movement behind the troops who were drawn up six deep then a man was seen mounting the scaffold followed by the priest behind whom came the prisoner between two warders just at this moment there was a stir in the crowd at the end of the square and over the heads of the people a line of glittering bayonets could be seen coming down the street the general looked in that direction with surprise and immediately gave orders to a mounted officer beside him who passing through the line of soldiers tried to make his way through the crowd this however either from its denseness or an unwillingness to move from the place it had gained made way for him but slowly in spite of his angry shouts to the people to clear a way     chapter xx   in a lions den  upon one side of the lane which the fugitives had entered ran a high wall upon the other was a very large mansion its lower windows were five feet from the ground as the lads ran they saw an open window without a moments hesitation they placed their hands on the sill threw themselves into it and flung down the window there was a scream as they entered followed by an exclamation in english the boys looked round and saw a young lady who had started back in terror to a corner of the room  are you english jack exclaimed in astonishment we are english officers escaping from a russian prison in heavens name do not betray us  as he spoke the russian cavalry came along the lane at full gallop  i am english the young lady said as she recovered from her astonishment i am governess to the younger daughters of the governor you are now in his palace but what has taken place i heard the firing and went to the window to listen  we have been aiding in the rescue of a polish leader who was to have been executed this morning dick said we succeeded in that but were attacked and cut up afterwards and had to scatter i fear that they will suspect we must have entered this place for they were close behind us and there was no other escape possible can you conceal us it seems almost like a miracle finding an english lady here  a great many of the russian nobility have english tutors or governesses and although some went back to england at the beginning of the war the greater number have remained quietly at their work i fear that the whole palace will be searched if it is suspected that you have taken refuge here how imprudent of you to have mixed yourselves up in this rebellion  we could hardly help ourselves jack said but it is too late to discuss that now will you look out of the window and see if the lane is empty if so we had best make off without delay  the young lady went to the window  no she replied at once there is a soldier on horseback a few yards to the right  dont open the window then jack said they have evidently put a line of patrols along the lane we must not get you into trouble he continued turning towards her if you will show us the way we will go at once and give ourselves up  oh no the lady exclaimed that must not be but where can i hide you and she stood for a minute or two thinking i think the safest place of all she said at last the only place where you would have a chance of escaping if a search is made is in the generals own writingroom it is very bare of furniture but there are heavy curtains to the windows no one would think of searching that room and the chances are that no one will go near the windows  the lads agreed that the plan was a good one and the young lady hurried away to see if the room which was not far from her own was still empty she returned in a minute and beckoned to them to follow her they soon arrived at a room which was simply furnished with a few chairs and an armchair placed at a table across the two windows hung heavy curtains and behind these the midshipmen took their places the curtains extending far enough beyond the windows for them to stand between them and the walls so that any one going to the windows would not necessarily see them then leaving them with many injunctions to remain quiet and with a promise to return at the end of the day and release them she left being she said due with her pupils at nine oclock  for half an hour the boys conversed in low tones with each other as to their chances of escape then footsteps were heard and the governor entered followed by several officers he took his seat at the table  if he said to one of them your report that you were so short a distance behind these men that it was impossible they could have reached the end of the lane before you entered it be correct it is clear they must have taken refuge here you did quite right to place a cordon all round the palace write an order at once for the chief of police to send down twenty men to search the house thoroughly from top to bottom let them visit every room not excepting even the apartments of my wife and daughters you say that they were most conspicuous in the attack upon your cavalry and i myself observed two very young men leading the attack upon the infantry well sir turning to another officer what is your report of the losses  two hundred and three of the cavalry have been killed sir there are only ten wounded one hundred and sixtythree infantry killed and 204 wounded we have found the bodies of 133 armed men who were killed either in the square or in the pursuit and 97 bodies apparently those of townspeople in the square  put them all down as insurgents the general said they are traitors and rebels the whole brood let strong bodies of infantry patrol the streets order all shops to be shut and the inhabitants to keep within doors and let a body of troops be placed at the disposal of the chief of police for a search from house to house some of these scoundrels may be hidden in the town  all day officers the bearers of reports or who came to receive orders entered and left the room among them the chief of police who reported that he had searched the palace from top to bottom without the omission of a single room and had failed altogether to find any traces of the fugitives  if they entered they must be somewhere said the general let a close cordon be kept around the house all night with orders to shoot down any one they may see leaving it tomorrow you will repeat your search of the house if they are here they must be found  the hours seemed intolerably long to the lads standing upright and motionless against the wall no one approached their hidingplace at four oclock the general gave orders that his horse and escort should be at the door and a few minutes afterwards he went out and the room was left deserted the midshipmen were now able to stand in easier positions but they did not venture to leave their hidingplaces in case any one should suddenly return the hours passed slowly on and it was nine oclock before the door opened it closed again and a voice asked in low tones whether they were still there  the lads joyfully replied that they were  follow me then she said as quietly as you can there is no one about  they were soon in the room where they had first entered the curtains were drawn and candles burning on the table  you are safe here the lady said i have just dined with my charges and my duties are over for the day no one is likely to disturb us here this is my private sittingroom my bedroom is next door if any one is heard coming you must hide there i will go in at once and change my dress for a dressinggown and i can then lock the door so that if any one comes there will be time for you to go in there and when i open it and say i am preparing for bed it will account for the door being locked  she did as she had said and then produced from a cupboard a box of biscuits and a decanter of wine which she placed before them  you must be starving she said i am sorry that i have nothing more to offer you but it was impossible for me to get any food i have been thinking all day she went on as the boys fell to at the biscuits how you are to be smuggled out i can only think of one plan and that is a fearfully dangerous one but i do not know that it is more so than your continued stay here the palace is to be searched tomorrow afternoon again even more strictly than today and that was strict enough they turned every room topsyturvy opened every closet and not only looked under the beds but pulled the beds to pieces to assure themselves that nobody was hidden within them i hear that the general says that he is so convinced that you are here somewhere that he will keep the soldiers round the house and search it every day till you are found if it is a month hence consequently great as is the risk of the plan i have thought of it is scarcely as great as that of remaining here  the midshipmen expressed their willingness to try any plan however desperate rather than remain day after day standing in the governors room with the risk of betrayal by a cough or other involuntary movement  this is my plan then the governors eldest daughters are women as old as myself they are tall and stout and as far as figure goes i think you might pass in their places they go out for a drive every morning i have this afternoon slipped into their rooms and have borrowed two of their dresses mantles and bonnets fortunately they usually wear veils they do not generally go to dress until the carriage is at the door and i propose that you shall boldly walk down and take their places of course the risk is dreadful but i really see no other chance for your escape what do you say  the midshipmen at once agreed to make the attempt and were soon dressed in the clothes which their friend had brought them walking about the room she gave them lessons in carriage and manner imitated herself the air with which the generals daughters bowed to the officers as they saluted them as they passed and even gave them instructions in the tone of voice in which they should order the driver to take the way to the public promenade at length she pronounced that they ought to pass muster at a casual inspection and then bidding them goodnight she retired to her own room while the lads were soon asleep the one on the couch the other on the hearthrug  at seven oclock their friend who had told them that her name was agnes sinclair came into the room dressed unlocked the door and then led them into her bedroom as she said that at halfpast seven the servants would come to do up the sittingroom light the fire and prepare breakfast  i am my own mistress she said till nine oclock and as the servants do not go into my bedroom till i have gone to my pupils you will be quite safe you must have some more biscuits for breakfast for i am a very small eater and it would not do were it noticed that a greater quantity of food than usual had disappeared  the boys were now again dressed in the clothes prepared for them and this time put on gloves which miss sinclair had also brought and into which it needed all the boys efforts to pass their hands fortunately the bonnets of the time completely enveloped the head concealing the back half and coming well forward over the face and when the veils were dropped miss sinclair said that unless she had known the truth she should not have suspected the deception  when the servant knocked at the door and said that breakfast was ready the governess left them and presently returned bringing them the biscuits  now she said in a quarter of an hour the carriage will be at the door it always comes punctually at nine from the window of the opposite room i can see when it arrives now you quite understand you walk straight along this passage at the end is a wider one to the right which will take you into the great hall here there will be several servants and perhaps some officers standing about all will bow as you pass through them you are to bow slightly as i have shown you if any of the officers come up to speak as is possible though not likely for none of high enough rank to do so are likely to be there so early answer only in a word or two in the voice you practised last night two servants will show you into the carriage as you take your seats you will say to the coachman to the promenade after that you must do as you judge best there is one drawback i forgot to tell you an escort of two soldiers always rides fifty or sixty yards behind the carriage  so that we once get through the town jack said we shant care much for the two soldiers for we still have our revolvers now you promise miss sinclair that when you come to england you will let our people know we have given you the addresses they will want to thank you for our escape if we get away and for your kindness even if the worst comes to the worst i do hope that there is no possibility of a suspicion falling upon you about the missing dresses  oh no miss sinclair said im sure no one saw me go to their rooms and it will be supposed that you were hidden somewhere there and have taken them yourselves i shall make the things you have taken off into a bundle slip into a room close to theirs and throw them under a bed if it were known that you are english it is possible that some suspicion might fall upon me as it is there is no reason why i more than any one else should have been concerned in the matter now it is just nine oclock i will go across into the other room and look out fortunately it is unoccupied  three minutes later she returned  it is at the door she said wait two or three minutes i will go straight now hide your clothes and take my place with my pupils as usual i am always punctual to the minute  with another word or two of thanks the boys said goodbye to her and miss sinclair at once went on her way with a final warning be sure and be leisurely in your movements do not show the least haste peep out before you start so as to be sure theres no one in this passage as otherwise you might be seen coming from this room  the boys waited another minute or two and then seeing that the passage was clear moved along it walking slowly and stiffly as they had been directed with short steps and gliding movement both had their pistols in their pockets ready to hand as they were resolved to be killed rather than taken fortunately there was no one in the next passage into which they turned and they reached the grand hall unnoticed here were a number of servants and officers who bowed deeply on perceiving as they supposed the daughters of the governor two servants threw open the grand door and an official preceded them to the carriage the boys bowed slightly and passed on no one accosted them and they took their seats in the carriage with the deliberation and dignity which had been impressed upon them the official spread a bearskin rug over their knees and demanded which way they would go  jack replied to the promenade the carriagewhich was an open oneproceeded on its way at a rapid pace and the boys hopes rose higher and higher they had not gone far when they heard a horses hoofs behind them and turning round saw an officer galloping rapidly  keep steady jack dick whispered  when the officer reached the side of the carriage he reined in his horse and took off his cap ladies he said his excellency the governor saw you drive away and ordered me to ride after you and tell you that he did not know you were going out and that he considered it more prudent for you to remain at home for a day or two until the excitement of the late events has cooled down  thank you dick said in his best russian and speaking in a feigned voice will you tell my father that we will return in a few minutes drive on he said to the coachman  the officer sat for a minute looking after them for something in the accent with which dick spoke seemed strange to him but being fortunately unacquainted with the ladies of the generals family he suspected nothing wrong it was evident to the boys however that the coachman was struck with the sound of the voice as he rapidly spoke to the man sitting next him and the latter once or twice endeavored privately to glance back  they had now reached the promenade which owing to the governors order that all inhabitants should keep their houses was entirely deserted except by a few russian officers walking or riding these all saluted as the generals carriage passed them on reaching the end of the drive the coachman was about to turn when the lads jumped to their feet and commanded him to stop the coachman looked round astonished but at the sight of two pistols pointed at their heads he and his fellowservant with a cry of alarm and astonishment leaped from the box jack in an instant scrambled over and seized the reins the soldiers had halted upon seeing the carriage stop and remained stupefied with astonishment as they saw the two servants leap off and one of the ladies climb into their seat nor did they move until the servants running up hastily explained what had happened then putting the spurs into their horses they galloped forward dick who was looking back saw at the same moment several horsemen at full gallop appear at the other end of the promenade  the general has found out the trick jack he said keep them going steadily and steer straight i can answer for those fellows behind they cant be sure yet whats up  as the soldiers approached dick leaned his pistol on the back of the carriage and took a steady aim and when they were within twenty yards fired aiming at the head of one of the horses in an instant there was a crash and the horse and rider were on the ground the other soldier at once reined up his horse bewildered at what had happened and not knowing even now that the carriage was not occupied by the generals daughters  thats right jack dick said we have got nearly half a mile start of the others and the forest is miss sinclair said scarce three miles away let them go it but be sure you steer straight  the horses were now tearing along at a furious gallop presently another long straight bit of road enabled them to see their pursuers again the horsemen had been increased in number by the officers who had been riding in the promenade and were now some twenty in number of these at least half whose helmets glistening in the sun showed dick that they were soldiers had already fallen in the rear the others had gained upon them considerably they were now however fully half way to the forest  thats right jack keep them going dick said as jack flogged the animals to their highest speed we shall have plenty of time to get away into the wood before they come up only for goodness sake keep us straight  when they reached the forest their pursuers were still some hundreds of yards in the rear checking the horses where the underwood was thickest the midshipmen leaped out gave a parting lash to the horses which started them again at full speed and then dashed into the thicket  any one who had seen them would have been astounded and amused at the spectacle of two fashionablydressed ladies dashing recklessly through the thick brushwood after a quarter of an hours run they paused breathless jack dashed his bonnet to the ground  for goodness sake dick he said shaking off his mantle unhook the back of my dress and let me get rid of the thing i used to laugh at my sisters for not running as fast as i could now i wonder how on earth they manage to run at all  their borrowed finery was soon got rid of and in their shirts and trousers the boys proceeded presently they came suddenly upon four peasants seated on the ground who upon seeing them leaped to their feet and greeted them with signs of vehement joy making signs to them to follow them and presently led them to a spot where the remains of the insurgent band were gathered a shout greeted them as soon as they were recognized and count stanislas running forward threw his arms round their necks and embraced them while the other leaders crowded round  it is indeed happiness to see you again the count said we feared you had fallen into the hands of the russians i sent spies last night into the town but they brought back word that the streets were absolutely deserted and they dared not enter i resolved to wait for a day or two until we could hear with certainty what had befallen you now tell us all that has happened  the midshipmen recounted their adventures saying that they had remained concealed in the very writingroom of the governor and giving full details of their escape dressed as his daughters saving only the part which miss sinclair had played for they thought that in case any of the band fell into the hands of the enemy they might under the influence of the torture which the russians freely administered to their captives reveal all that they had heard they then inquired what were the counts intentions  i shall move farther west he said and after gathering my old band together move to join some others who i hear have been doing good work in that direction we shall not be far from the frontier and much as i shall regret to lose you i will if you wish it lead a party to the frontier and cut a way through the cordon of troops there for you  the boys gladly accepted the offer they had had more than enough of insurrectionary warfare and longed to be back again with their comrades at sebastopol  three days marching took the band back to the forest where some 1500 men were assembled awaiting anxiously the return of the party  a day was given for rest and then horses were harnessed to the two batteries of artillery and moving by littlefrequented roads through the forest the small army marched west  for ten days the march continued for the roads were heavy and the horses unable to accomplish such marches as those of which the peasants were capable at last they effected a junction with the band which they had come to join whose numbers amounted to nearly 4000 men their arrival and especially the advent of the artillery was greeted with enthusiasm and it was at once proposed to take the offensive count stanislas said however that his horses were completely knocked up with the fatigue they had undergone and that a rest of two or three days was necessary in order to recruit  now he said to the midshipmen i will redeem my promise the frontier is only fifty miles distant i will send on a man at once to ascertain some point at which there are boats on this side of the river i will march at daylight with 150 picked men and no fear but with a sudden attack we shall break through the patrols  the plan was carried out the boys inured to marching made the fifty miles journey before nightfall they were met by the spy who stated that the boats had almost all been removed but that a number were gathered at a village which was occupied by 200 russian infantry  the midshipmen proposed that they should steal through and endeavor to get one of the boats but their friend would not hear of their running such a risk and after taking some hours of rest the party proceeded on their march it was an hour before daybreak when they entered the village just as they reached it a sentry fired his musket and with a rush the poles charged forward it had been arranged that the count and the midshipmen with five men should run straight through the village down to the waterside and that the rest of the force were to commence a furious attack upon the houses inhabited by the troops who believing that they were assailed by superior forces would be some time before they took the offensive     chapter xxi   back at the front  aroused by the sound of the sentrys musket the russian soldiers rushed to their windows and doors and opened a scattering fire which was heavily responded to by the poles the midshipmen with their party ran hastily down the village there were two sentries over the boats but these alarmed by the din in the village and the sight of the approaching figures fired their muskets and fled dick uttered a low exclamation  what is the matter dick are you hit  yes dick said my arm is broken never mind let us push on  they leaped into a boat jack seized the sculls the rope which fastened them to the shore was cut and with a last shout of farewell to the count they pulled off into the stream for a few minutes the sound of battle continued and then suddenly died away as count stanislas his object accomplished drew off his men  a few minutes rowing brought the boat to the opposite bank here they found austrian sentries who accosted them in german as however the austrian government offered no obstacle to polish fugitives entering the frontier the lads were conducted to the officer of the troops at the little village which faced that on the russian bank here they were questioned first in polish and then in german but upon the boys repeating the word english the officer who spoke a little french addressed them in that language and dick explained that they were english naval officers taken prisoners at sebastopol and making their escape through poland he then asked if there was a surgeon who could dress his wound but was told that none was procurable nearer than a town fifteen miles away a country cart was speedily procured and filled with straw and upon this dick lay down while jack took his seat by the peasant who was to drive the cart  it was eleven oclock in the day when they entered the town and the peasant drew up in accordance with the instructions he had received at the best hotel the landlord of which was in no slight degree surprised at such an arrival and was disposed to refuse them admittance jack however produced a bundle of russian notes at which sight the landlords hesitation vanished at once and in half an hour a surgeon stood by dicks bedside dressing his wound it was a severe one the bone being broken between the elbow and shoulder  the next day dick was in a state of high fever due more to the hardship and exposure through which he bad passed than to the wound and for a week lay between life and death then he began to mend but the doctor said that it would be long before he could use his arm again and that rest and quiet were absolutely necessary to restore him  a week later therefore the midshipmen left the town dick having determined that he would travel home by easy stages while jack of course would journey direct to join his ship  he had written immediately upon his arrival to acquaint his family and that of dick that both were alive and had escaped from russia the tailors had been set to work and the midshipmen presented a respectable appearance dick was still so weak that he could scarcely stand and jack tried hard to persuade him to stay for another week but dick was pining to be home and would not hear of delay a days travel in a diligence brought them to a railway station and twelve hours later they arrived at vienna  here they stopped for a day in luxurious quarters and then jack after seeing his friend into the train on his way home started to travel over the semmering pass down to trieste where he knew he should find no difficulty in obtaining a steamer to constantinople  after fortyeight hours diligence travelling jack reached the pretty seaport on the northern shore of the adriatic he found to his satisfaction that one of the austrian lloyds steamers would sail for constantinople on the following morning he spent the evening in buying a great stock of such articles as he had most found the want of in camp and had accumulated quite a respectable stock of baggage by the time he went on board ship after six days steaming during which they were never out of sight of land they cast anchor opposite constantinople  jack did not report himself to the naval authorities here as he thought it quite possible that the falcon had been recalled or sent on other service and he hoped that in that case he would upon reaching the front be appointed to some other ship  there was no difficulty in obtaining a passage to balaklava for two or three transports or merchantmen laden with stores were going up every day he paused however for three days as it was absolutely necessary for him to obtain a fitout of fresh uniforms before rejoining and at galata he found european tailors perfectly capable of turning out such articles  jack felt uncommonly pleased as he surveyed himself in a glass in his new equipment for it was now eight months since he had landed in the crimea and the dilapidation of his garments had from that time been rapid the difficulties of toilet had too been great and white shirts were things absolutely unknown so that jack had never felt really presentable from the time when he landed  the day he had obtained his outfit he took a passage in a ship laden with stores and sailed for the crimea he had already learned that the falcon was still there and when the vessel entered the harbor he was delighted at seeing her lying as one of the guardships there an hour later one of the ships boats conveyed him and his baggage to the side of the falcon the first person he saw on reaching the deck was mr hethcote the officer stared when jack saluted and reported himself in the usual words come aboard sir and fell back a pace in astonishment  what jack jack archer he exclaimed my dear boy is it really you  its me sure enough sir jack said and the next moment mr hethcote was shaking his hand as if he would have wrung it off  why my dear jack he exclaimed the men all reported that both you and poor hawtry were killed they said they saw him shot and looking back saw you killed over his body it was never doubted a moment and your names appeared in the list of the killed  well sir we are alive nevertheless and dick is by this time at home with his people he would have come on and joined with me at once sir only he got his arm broken and was laid up with fever after some fighting we had among the polish insurgents  among what mr hethcote exclaimed astonished but never mind that now i am glad indeed to hear that hawtry also is alive but you must tell me all about it presently there are your other friends waiting to speak to you  by this time the news of jacks return had spread through the ship the midshipmen had all run on deck and the men crowded the waist or regardless of discipline stood on the bulwarks jack had been a general favorite the gallantry which he and his comrade had displayed on the night of the storm had greatly endeared them to the crew and the men had bitterly regretted that they had not stood with him over hawtrys body but indeed it was not until they had passed on and it was too late to return that they had noticed his absence  as jack turned from mr hethcote his messmates crowded round him and the men broke into a hearty cheer again and again repeated jack gratified and touched by this hearty welcome could scarce reply to the questions which his comrades poured upon him and was speedily dragged below to the midshipmens berth where he gave a very brief outline of what had happened since he saw them a story which filled them with astonishment and some little envy  i will tell you all about it fully later on jack said but it would take me till night to give you the full yarn now but first you must tell me what has happened here you know i have heard nothing and only know that sebastopol is not yet taken  the recital was a long one and jack was fain to admit that the hardships which he had gone through were as nothing to those which had been borne by our soldiers in the crimea during the six months he had been away from them the trials and discomforts of the great storm had been but a sample of what was to be undergone after inkerman it had been plain to the generals in command that all idea of taking sebastopol must be abandoned until the spring and that at the utmost they could do no more than hold their position before it this had been rendered still more difficult by the storm in which enormous quantities of stores warm clothing and other necessaries had been lost  it was now too late to think of making a road from balaklava to the front a work which had the authorities in the first place dreamt that the army would have to pass the winter on the plateau was of all others the most necessary the consequence of this omission was that the sufferings of the troops were terrible  while balaklava harbor was crowded with ships full of huts clothing and fuel the men at the front were dying in hundreds from wet cold and insufficient food between them and abundance extended an almost impassable quagmire in which horses and bullocks sank and died in thousands although laden only with weights which a donkey in ordinary times could carry had the strength of the regiments in front been sufficient the soldiers might have been marched down when off duty to balaklava to carry up the necessaries they required but so reduced were they by overwork and fatigue that those fit for duty had often to spend five nights out of seven in the trenches and were physically too exhausted and wornout to go down to balaklava for necessaries even of the most urgent kind many of the regiments were almost annihilated large numbers of fresh troops had come out and drafts for those already there but the newcomers mostly raw lads broke down under the strain almost as fast as they arrived and in spite of the number sent out the total available strength did not increase one regiment could only muster nine men fit for duty many were reduced to the strength of a company the few survivors of one regiment were sent down to scutari until fresh drafts should arrive and the regiment could be reorganized and yet this regiment had not been engaged in any of the battles scarce a general of those who had commanded divisions and brigades at the alma now remained and the regimental officers had suffered proportionally the regiments which had won the alma still remained before sebastopol but their constituents had almost entirely changed and the proportion of those who had first landed in the crimea that still remained there when jack returned was small indeed  the sufferings of the french although great had not been nearly so severe as our own their camps were much nearer to their port the organization of their services was far better and more complete and as in the first place the siege work had been equally divided between them the numbers at that time being nearly the same the work of our men had become increasingly hard as their numbers diminished while that of the french grew lighter for their strength had been trebled by reinforcements from home thus while our men were often five nights out of the seven on duty in the cold and wet the french had five nights out of seven in bed this gave them far greater time to forage for fuel which was principally obtained by digging up the roots of the vines and brushwoodevery twig above the surface having long since been cleared awayto dig deep holes under their tents to dry their clothes and to make life comfortable  at last the strength of the english diminished to such a point that they were at length incapable of holding the long line of trenches and they were obliged to ask the french to relieve them which they did by taking over the right of our attack a measure which placed them opposite to the two russian positions of the mamelon and malakoff batteries which proved to be the keys of sebastopol  as spring came on matters brightened fast english contractors sent out large bodies of navvies and began to lay down a railway from balaklava to the front reinforcements poured in and the health of the troops began to improve troops of transport animals from every country on the mediterranean were landed a village of shops set up by enterprising settlers was started two miles out of balaklava huts sprang up in all directions and all sorts of comforts purchased by the subscriptions of the english people when they heard of the sufferings of their soldiers were landed and distributed  the work of getting up siege guns and storing ammunition for a reopening of the bombardment in earnest went on merrily and the arrival of 15000 turkish troops and of nearly 20000 sardinians who pitched their camps on the plain rendered the allies secure from an attack in that direction and enabled them to concentrate all their efforts on the siege  so far the success had lain wholly with the russians for every earthwork and battery raised and armed by the allies the russians threw up two and whereas when our armies arrived before it on 25th september sebastopol was little more than an open town which could have been carried by the first assault it was now a fortified place bristling with batteries in every direction of immense strength and constructed upon the most scientific principles many of their works especially the mamelon malakoff and tower batteries were fortresses in themselves with refuges dug deeply in the earth where the garrison slept secure from the heaviest fire of our guns and surrounded by works on every side  in the trenches it was the russians who were always the aggressors sortie after sortie was made throughout the winter and in these the russians often obtained possession for a time of portions of our trenches or those of the french along in front of their works the ground was studded with riflepits sometimes so close to our works that it was impossible for a man to show his head above them and the artillerymen were frequently unable to work their guns owing to the storm of bullets which the russians sent through the embrasures whenever a sign of movement was discerned in the desperate fights in darkness in the trenches we lost more men than in either of the pitched battles of the campaign and it was only the dogged courage of our soldiers and the devotion of the officers which enabled us to maintain our footing in the trenches before the city which we were supposed to be besieging  throughout the winter the fleet had lain inactive although why they should have done so none knew when they had it in their power by attacking the russian forts in the sea of azof to destroy the granaries upon which the besieged depended for their supplies  the midshipmen however were able to tell jack that they had not been altogether idle as the fleet had at last on the 22d of may been set in motion and they had but two days before returned from their expedition all the light vessels of the english and french fleets had taken part in it the fort of yenikale which commanded the entrance of the bay of kertch had been captured the batteries silenced and the town occupied and in four days after the squadron had entered the straits of kertch they had destroyed 245 russian vessels employed in carrying provisions to the russian army in the crimea besides this enormous magazines of corn and flour were destroyed at berdiansk genitchi and kertch and at the latter place immense quantities of military and naval stores also fell into our hands had this expedition taken place in october instead of may it is probable that the russians would have been unable to maintain their hold of sebastopol  a portion of the fleet had remained in possession of the sea of azof and thenceforth the russians had to depend upon land carriage this however mattered comparatively little as the country was now firm and dry and all the roads from russia to the crimea were available  all their comrades had taken share in the work in the batteries and jack learned to his surprise that captain stuart had been transferred to a larger ship and that mr hethcote had got his promotion and now commanded the falcon jack in the first excitement of meeting him not having noticed the changes in uniform which marked his advance  after two hours conversation with his friends jack received a message that captain hethcote invited him to dine in his cabin and here a quarter of an hour later he found not only the captain but the first and second lieutenants  after dinner was over jack was requested to give a full narrative of his adventures which greatly astonished his auditors and was not concluded until late in the evening the lieutenants then retired and jack was left alone with the captain who signified that he wished to speak further with him  well jack he said when they were alone i did not think when i offered my uncle to get you a midshipmans berth that i was going to put you in the way of passing through such a wonderful series of adventures they have been sadly cut up at home at the news of your death i hope that you wrote to them as soon as you had a chance  i wrote on the very day i crossed the frontier sir jack said besides i wrote twice from russia but i dont suppose they ever got the letters  and so you speak russian fluently now jack  i speak it quite well enough to get on with sir jack said you see i was speaking nothing else for five months i expect my grammar is very shaky as i picked it all up entirely by ear and no doubt i make awful mistakes but i can get on fast enough  i shall report your return tomorrow to the admiral captain hethcote said it is not improbable that he will at once attach you to the battery in front again the bombardment is to reopen next week and the generals expect to carry the town by assault though between ourselves i have no belief that our batteries will be able to silence the enemys guns sufficiently to make an assault upon such a tremendous position possible however as they expect to do it it is probable that they will like having an officer who can speak russian at the front as interpreters would of course be useful i suppose you would rather stay on board for a bit  yes sir i have had such a lot of knocking about since i left breslau that i should certainly have liked a months quiet but of course i am ready to do as ordered and indeed as the fun seems about to begin at last i should like to be in it  the next morning the captain sent his report to the admiral and received in reply a message that the admiral would be glad if captain hethcote would dine with him that day and would bring mr archer with him  admiral lyons was very kind to the young midshipman and insisted upon his giving him an account in full of all his adventures he confirmed captain hethcotes opinion as to jacks movements by saying as he bade him goodbye that in the morning he would receive a written order to go up to the front and to report himself to the officer in command of the naval brigade there  the next morning being that of the 5th june jack received his order and an hour later he started for the front with two sailors to carry his baggage he was astonished at the change which had been wrought at balaklava a perfect town of wooden huts had sprung up the principal portion of these was devoted to the general hospital the others were crammed with stores the greater part of the old tartar village had been completely cleared away the streets and roads were levelled and in good order  such troops as were about had received new uniforms and looked clean and tidy everywhere gangs of laborers were at work and the whole place wore a bright and cheerful aspect just outside the town an engine with a number of laden wagons was upon the point of starting the sun was blazing fiercely down and at the suggestion of one of the sailors who though ready enough for a spree on shore were viewing with some apprehension the prospect of the long trudge along the dusty road to sebastopol jack asked the officer in charge of the train for permission to ride up this was at once granted and jack his trunk and the sailors were soon perched on the top of a truckload of barrels of salt pork  jack could scarcely believe that the place was the same which he had last seen just when winter was setting in a large village had grown up near the mouth of the valley wooden huts for the numerous gangs of navvies and laborers stood by the side of the railway officers trotted past on ponies numbers of soldiers english french turkish and sardinian trudged along the road on their way to or from balaklava the wide plain across which our cavalry had charged was bright with flowers and dotted with the tents of the turks and sardinians nature wore a holiday aspect every one seemed cheerful and in high spirits and it needed the dull boom of the guns around sebastopol to recall the fact that the work upon which they were engaged was one of grim earnest  upon arriving at the camp jack found that its aspect was not less changed than that of the surrounding country many of the regiments were already in huts the roads and the streets between the tents were scrupulously clean and neat and before many of the officers tents clumps of flowers brought up from the plain had been planted the railway was not yet completed quite to the front and the last two miles had to be traversed on foot  upon presenting his written orders to the officer in command of the naval brigade jack was at once told off to a tent with two other midshipmen and was told that he would not for the present be placed upon regular duty but that he would be employed as aidedecamp to the commander and as interpreter should his services in that way be required     chapter xxii   the repulse at the redan  the first impulse of jack after having stowed his traps in the tent and introduced himself to his new messmates was to make his way to the lines of the 33d here he found that harry had been sent home sick in january but that he had sailed from england again with a draft and was expected to arrive in the course of a few days jack found but few of the officers still there whom he had before known several however were expected shortly back either from england or from the hospitals at scutari  greatly relieved to find that his brother was alive and well jack returned to the naval camp where he speedily made himself at home when he first mentioned to his messmates two lads about his own age that he had been a prisoner in russia the statement was received with incredulity and when at their request he proceeded to tell some of his adventures they regarded him with admiration as the most stupendous liar they had ever met it was long indeed before his statements were in any way believed and it was only when upon the occasion of one day dining with the officer in command of the brigade jack at his request related in the presence of several officers his adventures in russia that his statements were really accepted as facts for it was agreed that whatever yarns a fellow might invent to astonish his comrades he would not venture upon relating them as facts to a postcaptain this however was later on  on the morning after his arrival all was expectation for it was known that the bombardment was about to recommence at halfpast two oclock the roar of 157 guns and mortars in the british batteries and over 800 in those of the french broke the silence answered a minute or two later by that of the russian guns along their whole line of batteries the day was hot and almost without a breeze and the smoke from so vast a number of guns hung heavily on the hillside and nothing could be seen as to the effect which the cannonade was producing it was not until next morning that the effect of the fire was visible the faces of the russian batteries were pitted and scarred but no injury of importance had been inflicted upon them all day the fire continued with unabated fury on the side of the allies the russians replying intermittently presently the news circulated through the camp that an assault would be made at six oclock and all officers and men of duty thronged the brow of the plateau looking down upon the town  at halfpast six a body of french troops were observed to leave their trenches and in skirmishing order to make their way towards the mamelon the guns of the russian fort roared out but already the assailants were too close for these to have much effect soon a great shout from the spectators on the hill proclaimed that the zouaves who always led the french attacks had gained the parapet then from within a host of figures surged up against the sky and a curious conflict raged on the very summit of the work soon however the increasing mass of the french as they streamed up enabled them to maintain the footing they had gained and pouring down into the fort they drove the russians from it the french pouring out in their rear twice fresh bodies of russian reserves coming up attempted to roll back the french attack but these exultant with success pressed forward and in spite of the fire which the guns of the round tower fort poured upon them drove their enemies down the hill it was growing dark now and it could with difficulty be seen how the fight was going fresh masses of french troops poured from their advance trenches into the mamelon and there was no question that that point was decidedly gained  still however the battle raged around it the zouaves flushed with success attempted to carry the round tower with a rush and swept up to the abattis surrounding it the russians brought up fresh supports and the whole hillside was alive with the flicker of musketry the russian guns of all the batteries bearing upon the scene of action opened it while those of our right attack which were close to the french opened their fire to aid our allies had the zouaves been supported it is probable that they would have carried the round tower with their rush but this was not in the plan of operations and after fighting heroically for some time they fell back to the mamelon  the fight on the british side had been less exciting with a sudden rush our men had leaped on the advance trenches and driven the russians from their position in the quarries then rapidly turning the gabions of the trenches they prepared to hold the ground they had taken they were not to maintain their conquest unmolested for soon the russians poured down masses of troops to retake it all night long the flash of fire flickered round the position and six times the russian officers led up their troops to the attack  our assaulting force was over 1000 men and out of these 365 men and thirtyfive officers were killed or wounded had a stronger body been detailed there is no doubt that the redan which was near the quarries could have been taken for it was almost empty of troops and our men in the impetuosity of their first assault arrived close to it great discontent was felt that measures should not have been taken to follow up the success and both our allies and our own troops felt that a great opportunity had been missed owing to the want of forethought of their generals  the next day there was an armistice from one till six to collect and bury the dead and the officers and men of the contending parties moved over the ground which had been the scene of conflict chatting freely together exchanging cigars and other little articles jack who had gone down with his commanding officer created no slight astonishment among the russians by conversing with them in their own language in answer to their questions he told them that he had been a prisoner among them and begged them to forward a note which he had that morning written to count preskoff at berislav acquainting him that he had made his escape across the russian frontier and had rejoined the army for he thought it probable that the letter which he had given to count stanislaus to post after he left him might never have come to hand  at six oclock the guns again reopened the russians having made good use of their time in arming fresh batteries to counteract the effect of the works we had carried we had indeed hard work in maintaining our hold of the quarries which were commanded by several batteries whose position placed them outside the range of our guns our loss was very heavy as also was that of the french in the mamelon which was made a centre for the russian fire  on the nights of the 16th and 17th some of the british and french ships stood in close to sebastopol and kept up a heavy fire upon the town on the 16th it was decided by marshal pelissier and lord raglan that the assault should take place on the morning of the 18th of june and every arrangement was made for the attack the british force told off for the work consisted of detachments of the light second and third divisions and was divided into three columns sir john campbell had charge of the left colonel shadforth of the right and colonel lacy yea of the centre column general barnard was directed to take his brigade of the third division down to a ravine near the quarries while general eyre moved his brigade of the same division still farther along his orders were that in case of the assault on the redan being successful he should attack the works on its right  on the french left three columns each 6000 strong under general de salles were to attack three of the russian bastions while on their right three columns of equal force were to attack the russian positions general dautemarre assailing the gervais battery and the right flank of the malakoff general brunet to fall upon the left flank of the malakoff and the little redan from the mamelon while general mayrau was to carry the russian battery near the careening creek  thus the french were to assault in six columns numbering in all 36000 men with reserves of 25000 our assaulting columns contained only 1200 men while 10000 were in reserve the attack was to commence at daybreak but by some mistake the column of general mayrau attacked before the signal was given in a few minutes they were repulsed with great loss their general being mortally wounded four thousand of the imperial guard were sent to their assistance and three rockets being fired as a signal the assault was made all along the line the russians however had been prepared for what was coming by the assault on their left their reserves were brought up the redan was crowded with troops the guns were loaded with grape and as the little english columns leaped from their trenches and rushed to the assault they were received with tremendous fire  the inevitable result of sending 1000 men to attack a tremendously strong position held by ten times their own strength and across a ground swept by half a dozen batteries followed the handful of british struggled nobly forward broken up into groups by the irregularity of the ground and by the gaps made by the enemys fire  parties of brave men struggled up to the very abattis of the redan and there unsupported and powerless were shot down nothing could exceed the bravery which our soldiers manifested but their bravery was in vain the three officers in command of the columns sir john campbell colonel shadforth and colonel yea were all killed in vain the officers strove to lead their men to an attack there were indeed scarce any to lead and the russians in mockery of the foolishness of such an attack stood upon their parapets and asked our men why they did not come in at last the remnants of the shattered columns were called off upon the left the brigade under general eyre carried the cemetery by a sudden attack but so hot a fire was opened upon him that it was with difficulty the position could be held  this however was the sole success of the day both the french columns were repulsed with heavy loss from the malakoff and although gervais battery was carried it could not be maintained  the naval brigade furnished four parties of sixty men to carry scalingladders and woolbags two of these parties were held in reserve and did not advance captain peel was in command and was wounded as was mr wood a midshipman of hms queen who acted as his aidedecamp the three officers of one detachment were all wounded and of the other one was killed and one wounded  jack had in the morning regretted that he was not in orders for the service but when at night the loss which those who bad taken part in it had suffered was known he could not but congratulate himself that he had not been detailed for the duty the total british loss was twentytwo officers and 247 men killed seventyeight officers and 1207 men wounded the french lost thirtynine officers killed and ninetythree wounded 1600 men killed or taken prisoners and about the same number wounded so that our losses were enormously greater than those of the french in proportion to our numbers the russians admitted a loss of 5800 killed and wounded  jack was with many others a spectator of this scene from cathcart hill but it must not be imagined that even a vague idea of what was passing could be gleaned by the lookerson the redan which was the point of view immediately opposite was fully a mile away in a few minutes from the commencement of the fight the air was thick with smoke and the din of battle along so extended a front was so continuous and overpowering that it was impossible to judge by the sound of firing how the fight was going on at any particular point  upon the night before there was a general sanguine feeling as to the success of the attack and many a laughing invitation was given to future dinners in the hotels of sebastopol great then was the disappointment when an hour after its opening the tremendous roll of musketry gradually died away while the fire of the allied batteries angrily opened telling the tale that all along the line the allies had been defeated save only for the slight success at the cemetery  eagerly were the wounded questioned as carried on stretchers or slowly and painfully making their way upon foot they ascended the hill in most of them regret at their defeat or anger at the incompetence of those who had rendered defeat certain predominated over the pain of the wounds  be jabers said a little irishman but it was cruel work entirely there was myself and six others and the captain made our way up to a lot of high stakes stuck in the ground before the place we looked round and divil another soul was there near we couldnt climb over the stakes and if we had got over em there was a deep ditch beyond and no way of getting in or out and what would have been the good if we had when there were about 50000 russians inside ashouting and yelling at the top of their voices and afiring away tons of ammunition we stopped there five minutes it may be waiting to see if any one else was coming and then when four of us was killed and the captain wounded i thought it time to be laving so i lifted him up and carried him in and got an ugly baste of a russian bullet into my shoulder as i did so ye may call it fightin but its just murder i call it meself  something like this was the tale told by scores of wounded men and it is little wonder that sore with defeat and disappointment and heartsick at the loss which had been suffered the feelings of the army found vent in deep grumblings at the generals who had sent out a handful of men to assault a fortress  the next day there was another truce to allow of the burial of the dead and the collection of the wounded who lay thickly on the ground between the rival trenches it did not take place however till four in the afternoon by which time the wounded had been lying for thirty hours without water or aid the greater portion of the time exposed to the heat of a burning sun  ten days later lord raglan died he was a brave soldier an honorable man a most courteous and perfect english gentleman but he was most certainly not a great general he was succeeded by general simpson who appears to have been chosen solely because he had as a lad served in the peninsula the authorities seeming to forget that for the work upon which the army was engaged no school of war could compare with that of the crimea itself and that generals who had received their training there were incomparably fitter for the task than any others could be  two days after the repulse at the redan jack was delighted by the entry of his brother into his tent harry had of course left england before the receipt of jacks letter written when he had crossed the frontier and was overwhelmed with delight at the news which he had received ten minutes before on arriving at the camp that his brother was alive and was again with the naval brigade close by jacks tentmates were fortunately absent and the brothers were therefore able to enjoy the delight of their meeting alone and when the first rapture was over to sit down for a long talk jack was eager to learn what had happened at home of which he had heard nothing for six months and which harry had so lately left he was delighted to hear that all were well that his elder sister was engaged to be married and that although the shock of the news of his death had greatly affected his mother she had regained her strength and would harry was sure be as bright and cheerful as ever when she heard of his safety not till he had received answers to every question about home would jack satisfy his brothers curiosity as to his own adventures and then he astonished him indeed with an account of what he had gone through  well jack you are a lucky fellow harry said when he had finished to think of your having gone through all those adventures and living to tell of them why it will be something to talk about all your life  and you harry are you quite recovered  i am as well as ever harry said it was a case of typhus and frostbite mixed i lost two of my toes and they were afraid that i should be lame in consequence however i can march well enough for all practical purposes though i do limp a little as to the typhus it left me very weak but i soon picked up when the wind from england was blowing in my face only to think that all the time i was grieving for you as dead and buried by the russians among the hills over there that you were larking about with those jolly russian girls  oh yes thats all very well jack said but you must remember that all that pretty nearly led to my being hung or shot and it was a hot time among those poles too i can tell you  the next few days passed quietly on the 12th of july jack rode out with his commanding officer who with many others accompanied the reconnaissance made by the turks and french on a foraging and reconnoitring party towards baidar but they did not come in contact with the russians  both parties still worked steadily at their trenches the french were fortunate in having soft ground before them and were rapidly pushing their advances up towards the malakoff this position which could without difficulty have been seized by the allies at the commencement was in reality the key of the russian position its guns completely commanded the redan and its position would render that post untenable while the whole of the south side of sebastopol would lay at our mercy in front of the english the ground was hard and stony and it was next to impossible to advance our trenches towards the redan and the greater portion of the earth indeed had to be carried in sacks on mens backs from points in the rear  the working parties were also exposed to a crossfire and large numbers of men were killed every day  on the 31st a tremendous storm broke upon the camp but the soldiers were now accustomed to such occurrences the tents were well secured and but little damage was suffered save for a few sorties by the russians the next fortnight passed quietly  the cavalry were now pushed some distance inland and the officers made up parties to ride through the pretty valleys and visit the villas and country houses scattered along the shores     chapter xxiii   the battle of the tchernaya  on the evening of the 15th of august several tartars brought in news that the russians were preparing for an attack but so often had similar rumors been received that little attention was paid to their statements it was known indeed that they had received very large reinforcements and the troops had been several times called under arms to resist their repeated attacks these however had all passed off quietly and when the troops retired to rest none thought that a great battle was going to take place on the morrow  the tchernaya after leaving the valley of baidar flows between a number of low swells of ground and formed the front of the allied armies on the plains on the extreme right the turks were stationed next them came the sardinians whose position extended from a stream flowing into the tchernaya at right angles to an eminence known as mount hasfort in front and divided from it by an aqueduct which too ran parallel to the river was another hillock accessible from the first by a stone bridge at which the sardinians had a breastwork their outposts extended some distance on the other side of the tchernaya the french occupied a series of hillocks to the left of the sardinians guarding the road leading from balaklava to mckenzies farm the river and aqueduct both flowed along their front the road crossed the former by a bridge known as the traktia bridge the latter by a stone bridge in front of the traktia bridge was a breastwork  at dawn a strong body of russians were seen upon the heights opposite to those occupied by the sardinians and thence being on ground higher than that upon our side of the river they commanded both the sardinian and french positions the bridge was held by a company of infantry and a company of bersaglieri and general della marmora at once despatched another company of bersaglieri to enable the advance to hold their post until the army got under arms they mounted the opposite plateau but this was so swept by the russian guns that they were forced at once to retire to the bridge  soon the artillery opened along the whole line on both sides the french outposts had also been driven in and before the troops were fairly under arms the russians had crossed the bridge and were charging forward the aqueduct which was nine or ten feet wide and several feet deep now formed the front of the french defence it ran along on the face of the hill with a very steep slope facing the russians  in spite of the fire of the french artillery in front and of the sardinian artillery which swept them in flank the russian soldiers pressed most gallantly forward crossed the aqueduct and tried to storm the height the sardinian fire however was too severe and after ten minutes the russians fell back it met another column advancing at the double and uniting they again rushed forward while they forded the river two guns crossed by the bridge and another by a ford and opened upon the french the infantry rushing breast deep through the water began to scale the heights but the french met them boldly and after a fierce fight drove them down and across the bridge on their left another column had attacked the french right and in spite of the sardinian guns which ploughed long lanes in their ranks crossed the aqueduct and scaled the heights but as they reached the plateau so terrible a storm of grape and musketballs swept upon them that the bead of the column melted away as it surmounted the crest fresh men took the place of those that fell but when the french infantry with a mighty cheer rushed upon them the russians broke and ran so great was the crowd that they could not pass the river in time and 200 prisoners were taken while the french and sardinian artillery swept the remains of the column as it retreated with a terrible cross fire  at the bridge however the russians made one more effort the reserves were brought up and they again crossed the river and aqueduct the french however were now thoroughly prepared and the attack was like the preceding one beaten back with terrible slaughter the russians fell back along their whole line covered by the fire of their artillery while five regiments of cavalry took post to oppose that of the allies should they attempt to harass the retreat  the loss of the french was nine officers killed and fiftythree wounded 172 men killed and 1163 wounded the sardinians had two officers killed and eight wounded sixtytwo men killed and 135 wounded the russian loss was twentyseven officers killed and eightyfive wounded 3329 men killed 4785 wounded never were the advantages of position more clearly shown for the russians lost fifteen times as many killed as the allies four times as many wounded although they had all the advantages of a surprise on their side the english had only a battery of heavy guns under captain mowbray engaged these did good service  jack archer saw but little of this battle it commenced at daybreak and lasted little over an hour and when jack with hundreds of other officers and soldiers reached points from which a view of the plain could be commanded a thick cloud of smoke was drifting across it through which nothing could be seen until the heavy masses of russians were observed making their way back covered by their cavalry and the dying away of the cannonade told that the battle was over  life in camp was very cheery now the troops were in splendid health and high spirits races were got up in each division for almost all officers possessed ponies of some kind or other and great amusement was caused by these events some of the latelyarrived regiments had brought their regimental bands with them and these added to the liveliness of the camps a good supply of eatables and wine could be obtained from the sutlers and dinnerparties were constantly taking place altogether life in camp was very enjoyable  the french who during the winter had fared much better than ourselves were now in a very inferior condition the full publicity which had been given to the sufferings of our troops had so roused the british public that not only had they insisted that government should take all measures for the comfort of the soldiers but very large sums had been collected and ships laden with comforts and luxuries of all kinds despatched to the seat of war consequently our troops were now in every respect well fed and comfortable upon the other hand the details of the sufferings of the french troops had been carefully concealed from the french people consequently nothing was done for them and their food was the same now as it had been at varna in the previous year they were consequently exposed to the attacks of the same illness and while the british army was enjoying perfect health the french hospitals were crowded and many thousands died of cholera and fever  after the tchernaya as there was no probability of a renewal of the bombardment for a short time jack asked leave to spend a few days on board ship as his services as interpreter were not likely to be required this was readily granted here he had perfect rest captain hethcote did not put him in a watch and every day with some of his messmates he rowed out of the harbor and coasted along at the foot of the lofty cliffs sometimes fishing sometimes taking a bath in the cool waters this weeks rest and change did jack a great deal of good for he had been feeling the effects of the long strain of excitement he had had several slight touches of fever and the naval doctor had begun to speak of the probability of sending him down to the hospitalship at constantinople the weeks rest however completely set him up and he was delighted with the receipt of a budget of letters from home written upon the receipt of his letter announcing his safety  none but those who have gone through a long and tedious campaign or who may be living a struggling life in some young colony can know how great is the delight afforded by letters from home for a time the readers forget their surroundings and all the toil and struggle of their existence and are again in thought among the dear ones at home retiring to some quiet place apart from their comrades they read through their letters again and again and it is not till every little item is got by heart that the letters are folded up and put away to be reread over and over again until the next batch arrive  jack of course had heard much of his family from his brother but the long letters of his father and mother the large scrawling handwriting of his little brothers and sisters brought them before him far more vividly than any account could have done enclosed in his fathers letter was one with a russian postmark and this jack found was from count preskoff it had been written six weeks after he had left them and had curiously enough arrived in england on the very day after his own letter had reached home the count wrote expressing their anxiety regarding him and their earnest hopes that he had effected his escape he said that his wife and daughters diligently read every paper they could get from end to end but having seen no notice of the capture of two young englishmen in disguise they entertained strong hopes that their friends had effected their escape the count said he was sure that jack would be glad to hear that things in russia looked brighter that it was rumored that the emperor alexander intended on the occasion of his coronation to proclaim a general emancipation of the serfs and that other measures of reform would follow the party of progress were strong in the councils of the new monarch the decree for his own banishment from court had been cancelled and he was on the point of starting for st petersburg with his wife and daughters a personal friend of his own had been appointed commandant of berislav and the late deputy commandant had been sent to join his regiment in the crimea the countess and his daughters were well and olga was studying english he said that when the war was over he intended with his family to make a tour through the capitals of europe and hoped that they should see jack in england this was very welcome news and jack returned to the naval camp at the front in high glee  one morning a lieutenant named myers asked jack if he would like to accompany him on a reconnaissance which he heard that a party of the sardinian cavalry were going to push some little distance up the baida valley jack said that he would like it very much if he could borrow a pony mr myers said that he could manage this for him and at once went and obtained the loan of a pony from another officer who was just going down into the battery a quarter of an hour afterwards having taken the precaution to put some biscuits and cold meat into their haversacks and to fill their flasks with rum and water they started and rode across the plain to the sardinian camp  the lieutenant had obtained the news of the proposed reconnaissance from an officer with whom he was acquainted on the sardinian staff the news however had been kept secret as upon previous occasions so many officers off duty had accompanied these reconnaissances as to constitute an inconvenience on the present occasion the secret had been so well kept that only some four or five pleasureseekers had assembled when the column consisting of 400 cavalry started  jack accustomed only to the flat plains of southern and western russia was delighted with the beauty of the valley through which they now rode it was beautifully wooded and here and there tartar villages nestled among the trees these had long since been deserted by the inhabitants and had been looted by successive parties of friends and foes of everything portable  presently they turned out of the valley they had first passed through and followed a road over a slope into another valley similar to the first for an hour they rode on and then some distance ahead of the column they heard the report of a shot  the cossacks have got sight of us mr myers said we shall soon learn if the russians have any troops in the neighborhood  presently a scattered fire was opened from the walls of a country house standing embowered in trees on an eminence near what appeared to be the mouth of the valley the officer in command of the party dismounted one of the squadrons and sent the men up in skirmishing order against the house two other squadrons trotted down the valley and the rest remained in reserve a sharp musketry conflict went on for a short time around the chateau then the sardinians made a rush and their shouts of triumph and the cessation of musketry proclaimed their victory  at the same moment a soldier rode back from the cavalry that had gone up the valley to say that a strong body of the enemys horse were approaching across the plain the order was given for a general advance and the cavalry trotted down the valley to join the party in advance  now mr archer lieutenant myers said the best thing for us to do will be to ride forward to that house up there see the attacking party are coming back to their horses we ought to have a good view over the plain and shall see the fight between the sardinians and the enemy besides we may pick up some loot  they soon reached the house and tying up their horses entered it was a fine chateau handsomely furnished but short as was the time that the sardinians had held possession they had already tumbled everything into confusion in their search for plunder tables and couches had been upset closets and chiffoniers burst open with the buttends of the swords or with the discharge of a pistol into the lock lookingglasses had been smashed valuable vases lay in fragments on the floor bottles of wine whose necks had been hastily knocked off stood on the table in the courtyard were signs of strife three or four cossacks and two sardinian horsemen lay dead  we will go out to the terrace in front of the house mr myers said from that we ought to have a view over the country  owing however to the trees which grew around they were obliged to advance 100 yards or so from the house before they could see the plain then some halfmile out they saw the blue mass of sardinian cavalry advancing by squadrons still farther two bodies of russian horse each nearly equal in strength to the italians were seen there was a movement among the sardinian horse they formed into two bodies and dashed at the russians there was a cloud of dust swords could be seen flashing in the sun a confused mèlèe for a minute or two and then the russians broke and rode across the plain pursued by the sardinians  a very pretty charge mr myers said now well go in and look at the house it will be fully half an hour before they return again  they went in and wandered from room to room the place had evidently been tenanted until quite lately articles of womans work lay upon the table a canary bird was singing in his cage a fire burnt in the kitchen and a meal was evidently in course of preparation when the first alarm had been given the officers wandered from room to room and collected a number of little trifles to take home as remembrances small pictures of the greek saints such as are found in every russian house a little bronze statuette two or three small but handsomely bound books a couple of curious old plates and jack took possession as a present for his elder sister of a small workbox beautifully fitted up having made two bundles of their plunder they prepared to go out again to see if the sardinians were returning when jack looking out of the window uttered an exclamation of surprise and alarm one of the thick fogs which are so common in the black sea and on the surrounding coasts had suddenly rolled down upon them and it was difficult to see five yards from the window jacks exclamation was echoed by mr myers  this is a nice business the latter exclaimed we had better find our ponies and make our way down into the valley at once seeing how thick the fog has come on the sardinians may not return here at all  so saying they hurried to the spot where they had tied up their ponies and leading them by the reins descended into the valley  the fog is getting thicker and thicker mr myers said i cannot see three yards before me we must listen for them as they pass and then join them although its by no means impossible that we may be received with a shot  half an hour passed and they grew more and more anxious another halfhour and still no sound was heard  i do not think they can possibly have passed without our seeing them mr archer the valley is a quarter of a mile wide but we should be sure to hear the trampling of the horses and the jingling of the sabres  yes sir im sure they have not passed since we got here but they may possibly have seen the fog coming on and have ridden rapidly back and passed before we came down or they may have gone round by the mouth of the valley parallel to this which we left to cross into this one  that is just what i have been thinking mr myers said what do you think we had better do it is quite impossible that we can find our way back through such a fog as this  quite impossible sir jack said if we were to move from where we are we should lose all idea of our bearings in three minutes and should be as likely to go into the plain as up the valley  its a most awkward position mr myers said anxiously now mr archer you have had some sort of experience of this kind before tell me frankly what you think is the best thing to be done  i have been thinking it over sir for the last half hour jack said and it appears to me that the best thing to do would be for me to find my way up to the house again i cant well miss that as we came straight down hill i will bring back two of those cossacks cloaks and lances then we had better move about till we come on a clump of trees and make ourselves as comfortable there as we can these fogs last as you know sometimes for two or three days when it gets clear whether it is today or tomorrow we will look out and see whether there are any of the enemy about of course as they know the way they can come back in the fog if we see any of them we must put on the cossacks cloaks take their lances and boldly ride off they are always galloping about in pairs all over the country so that we shall attract no attention  but if they catch us the lieutenant said we shall be liable to be shot as spies  i suppose we shall sir jack answered but i would rather run the risk of being shot as a spy than the certainty of being caught as a naval officer and imprisoned till the war is over  well mr archer i certainly can suggest nothing better the lieutenant said will you go up then and get the cloaks you speak of  leaving his pony with the lieutenant jack made his way up the hill fortunately in their descent they had followed a small track worn by persons going to and from the chateau from the valley and he had therefore but little difficulty in finding the house he paused when he reached the courtyard for he heard voices in the chateau listening attentively he discovered that they were russians no doubt some of the party who had been driven thence by the sardinians and who had upon the retirement of the latter ridden straight back from the plain fortunately the fog was so thick that there was no probability whatever of his movements being discovered and he therefore proceeded to strip off two of the long coats reaching almost down to the heels which form the distinctive cossack dress from the dead men he took possession also of their caps their bandoliers for cartridges worn over one shoulder and of their carbines and lances and then retraced his steps down the hill to his companion leading their ponies they wandered aimlessly through the fog for a considerable time before they came to some trees  if you will hold my horse sir jack said i will just look round and see if this is a small wood i shall lose you before i have gone a yard so when you hear me whistle please whistle back but not loud for there may be enemies close by for aught i know i thought i heard voices just now  searching about jack found that the clump of trees extended for some little distance returning to the lieutenant they entered the wood and moved a little way among the trees so as to be out of sight if the fog lifted suddenly then they loosened the saddlegirths gathered some sticks and lit a fire and using the cossack coats for rugs began to discuss the meal they had brought with them  if the russians really advance again and get between us and balaklava i do not see how on earth we are to pass through them mr myers said  no sir i dont think we could jack answered i should propose that we make a wide sweep round so as to come down upon the shore some distance away as you know boats from the ships often land at some of the deserted places along there in search of loot so that we ought to be able to be taken off if when we are riding we come upon any russian troops suddenly so that we cannot move away in any other direction without exciting suspicion you must put a good face on it my russian is good enough to pass muster as a cossack all we have to do is to avoid any of these fellows for they would detect at once that i did not belong to them  well mr archer you take things very coolly and i hope you will get us out of the scrape we have got into if i had been by myself i should have ridden up and surrendered to the first russians i saw  that would have been the best way sir had it not been for those poor beggars having been killed up above there for in our naval dress we could not have hoped to have escaped as it is if we have any luck we shall soon be back at balaklava again     chapter xxiv   a fortunate storm  the fog seemed to get thicker and thicker as the day went on at nightfall when it became evident that no move could be made before morning they gave a biscuit to each of their ponies cut some grass and laid it before them and then wrapping themselves in the cossack cloaks to keep off the damp fog were soon asleep at daybreak the fog was still thick but as the sun rose it gradually dispersed it and they were shortly able to see up the valley they found that in their wandering in the mist they must have moved partly in a circle for they were still little more than a quarter of a mile from the point where they had left it to ascend to the chateau round this they could see many soldiers moving about looking up the valley they perceived lines of horses picqueted by a village but a few hundred yards away  those were the voices i thought i heard no doubt when we first came here jack said its lucky we found these trees for if we had wandered about a little longer we might have stumbled into the middle of them now sir we had better finish the biscuits we put aside for breakfast and be off it is quite evident the direct way to the camp is close to us  saddling up their horses and putting on the cossack black sheepskin caps and long coats and taking the lances and carbines the latter of which were carried across the saddle before them they mounted their ponies and rode off quitting the wood at such a point that it formed a screen between them and the cavalry in the distance until they had gone well down the valley they were unnoticed or at any rate unchallenged by the party at the chateau and issuing from the valley rode out into the open country  far out in the plain they saw several russians moving about and judged that these were occupied in searching those who had fallen in the cavalry fight of the preceding day they did not approach them but turning to the right trotted briskly along skirting the foot of the hills they passed through two or three tartar villages whose inhabitants scarcely glanced at them so accustomed were they to the sight of small parties of cossacks riding hither and thither  in one which stood just at the mouth of the valley which they had determined to enter as a road running up it seemed to indicate that it led to some place perhaps upon the seashore they found several russian soldiers loitering about lieutenant myers would have checked his pony but jack rode unhesitatingly forward an officer came out of one of the cottages  any news he asked  none jack said the enemys horse came out yesterday through the baida valley but we beat them back again  where are you going the russian asked  down towards the sea jack answered to pick up stragglers who land to plunder a whole sotina is coming down they will be here presently so saying with a wave of his hand he resumed his way up the valley lieutenant myers having ridden on lest any questions should be addressed to him the road mounted steadily and after some hours riding they crossed a brow and found themselves at the head of a valley opening before them and between the cliffs at its end they could see the sea  they could scarcely restrain a shout of joy and quickening their speed rode rapidly down the valley presently they perceived before them a small village lying on the seashore to the left of which stood a large chateau half hidden among trees  do you think its safe to ride in mr myers asked  most of these villages have been found deserted sir jack said by our fellows when they landed im afraid we are beyond the point to which they come for i should think we must be twenty miles from balaklava however there are not likely to be any troops here and we neednt mind the tartars  they found as they expected that the village was wholly deserted and riding through it they dismounted at the chateau the doors were fastened but walking round it they perceived no signs of life and breaking a window they soon effected an entrance  they found that the house which was of great size and evidently belonged to a russian magnate was splendidly furnished and that it had so far not been visited by any parties from the ships some fine pictures hung on the walls choice pieces of statuary were scattered here and there tables of malachite and other rare stones stood about and eastern carpets covered the floors  we are in clover now sir jack said and if we could but charter a ship we should be able to make a rich prize but as our ponies can only carry us im afraid that all these valuables are worthless to us  id give the whole lot of them the lieutenant said for a good meal at any rate we are sure to find something for the ponies  in the stables behind the house were great quantities of forage and the ponies soon had their fill  the officers taking some corn of which also there was an abundance hammered a quantity between two flat stones and moistening the rough flour so obtained with water made two flat cakes with which baked over a wood fire they satisfied their hunger a consultation was held while they ate their meal and it was agreed that as the place was evidently beyond the range of boats from balaklava they had better ride along the cliffs till they reached some village where as they would find from the state of the houses parties were in the habit of coming  after a couple of hours stay to give the horses time to rest they again saddled up and took the road along the coast after riding two miles along the edge of the cliffs they simultaneously checked their horses as upon mounting a slight rise they saw before them the tents of a considerable party of russian soldiers as they had paused the moment their heads came above the level they were themselves unobserved and turning they rode back to the chateau they had quitted where having made their ponies comfortable they prepared to pass the night there were plenty of luxurious beds and they slept profoundly all night in the morning they went down to the sea not a vestige of a boat was to be seen and they began to question whether it would not be possible to make a small raft and to paddle along the foot of the cliffs  we need not trouble about that now lieutenant myers said for unless i am mistaken were going to have a regular black sea gale in an hour or two the wind is freshening fast and the clouds banking up  the lieutenant was not mistaken in an hour the wind was blowing in furious gusts and the sea breaking heavily in the little bay  having nothing to do they sat under the shelter of a rock and watched the progress of the gale the wind was blowing dead along the shore and grew fiercer and fiercer three hours passed and then lieutenant myers leaped to his feet  see he said there is a boat coming round the point  it was so driving before the gale was a ships boat a rag of sail was set and they could see figures on board  she is making in here the lieutenant exclaimed let us run down and signal to them to beach her at that level spot just in front of the village no doubt it is some ships boat which came out to picnic at one of the villages near balaklava and they have been blown along the coast and have been unable to effect a landing  the boats head was now turned towards shore the sail lowered and the oars got out so high was the sea already that the spectators feared every moment she would be swamped but she was well handled and once in the little bay the water grew smoother and she soon made her way to the spot where the officers were standing the latter were astonished when the men leaped out instantly and without a word rushed at them and in a moment both were levelled to the ground by blows of stretchers when they recovered from the shock and astonishment they found the sailors grouped round them  hallo jack exclaimed in astonishment mr simmonds is that you what on earth are you knocking us about like that for  why jack archer exclaimed the officer addressed where on earth did you come from and what are you masquerading as a cossack for we saw you here and of course took you for an enemy i thought you were up at the front  so we were jack replied but as you see we are here now this is lieutenant myers of the tartar  im awfully sorry mr simmonds said holding out his hand and helping them to their feet  it was not your fault mr myers answered we forgot all about our cossack dresses of course you supposed that we were enemies it is fortunate indeed for us that you came here but i fear you must put to sea again there is a russian camp two miles off on the hill and the boat is sure to have been seen  it will be awkward lieutenant simmonds said looking at the sky for it is blowing tremendously i think though that it is breaking already these black sea gales do not often last long at any rate it would be better to take our chance there than to see the inside of a russian prison  if you send a man along the road to that crest lieutenant myers suggested he will see them coming and if we all keep close to the boat we may get out of gunshot in time  a sailor was accordingly despatched up the hill the instant he reached the top he was seen to turn hastily and to come running back at full speed  now lads mr simmonds said put your shoulders to her now all together get her into the water and be ready to jump in and push off when atkins arrives  when the sailor was still a hundred yards away the head of a column of russian infantry appeared over the crest when they saw the boat they gave a shout and breaking ran down the hill at full speed before they reached the village however atkins had leaped into the boat and with a cheer the men ran her out into the surf and scrambled in  out oars lads and row for your lives mr simmonds said and with steady strokes the sailors drove their boat through the waves  the russians opened fire the instant they reached the beach but the boat was already 150 yards away and although the bullets fell thickly round no one was hit  i think mr myers lieutenant simmonds said we had better layto before we get quite out of shelter of the bay with steady rowing we can keep her there and we shall be out of range of the russians  mr myers assented and for two hours the men rowing their utmost kept the boat stationary partly sheltered by the cliffs at the mouth of the bay the russians continued to fire but although the boat was not wholly beyond their range and the bullets sometimes fell near these were for the most part carried to leeward by the wind and not a single casualty occurred  the wind is falling fast lieutenant simmonds said we could show a rag of canvas outside now we had best make a long leg out to sea and then when the wind goes down we can make balaklava  for four or five hours the boat was buffeted in the tremendous seas but gradually as the wind went down these abated and after running twenty miles off the land the boats head was turned and she began to beat back to balaklava it was eleven oclock that night before they reached the falcon officers and men completely worn out with their exertions  jack found to his satisfaction that no report of his being missing had been received by the captain and next morning at daybreak he and lieutenant myers walked up to camp regretting the loss of their ponies which would however they were sure be found by the russians long ere they finished the stores of provender within their reach  upon reaching camp they found that their absence had not been noticed until the afternoon of the second day of their absence they had been seen to ride away together and when in the evening they were found to be absent it was supposed that they had gone down to balaklava and slept there when upon the following day they were still missing it was supposed that the admiral had retained them for duty on board ship the storm which had scattered everything had put them out of the thoughts of the commanding officer and it was only that morning that no letter respecting them having been received he was about to write to their respective captains to inquire the cause of their absence this was now explained and as they had been detained by circumstances altogether beyond their control they escaped without a reprimand and were indeed warmly congratulated upon the adventures they had passed through  in the meantime the cannonade had been going on very heavily in front the russian outworks were showing signs of weakness after the tremendous pounding they were receiving the french were pushing their trenches close up to the malakoff and upon both sides the soldiers were busy with pick and shovel on the night of the 30th august a tremendous explosion took place a russian shell exploding in a french ammunition wagon which blew up killing and wounding 150 officers and men  on the following night the naval brigade astonished the camp by giving private theatricals the bill was headed theatre royal naval brigade on friday evening 31st august will be performed deaf as a post to be followed by the silent woman the whole to conclude with a laughable farce entitled slasher and crasher seats to be taken at seven oclock performance to commence precisely at eight god save the queen rule britannia the scenes were furnished from hms london the actors were all sailors of the brigade the ladies parts being taken by young boatswains mates two thousand spectators closely packed were present and the performance was immensely enjoyed in spite of the fact that the shell from the russian longrange guns occasionally burst in the neighborhood of the theatre  the french had now pushed forward their trenches so far that from their front sap they could absolutely touch the abattis of the malakoff on the 3d the russians made a sortie and some heavy fighting took place in the trenches the time was now at hand when the last bombardment was to commence the french began it early on the morning of the 5th they had now got no less than 627 guns in position while the english had 202 the news that it was to commence was kept a profound secret and few of the english officers knew what was about to take place our own trenches were comparatively empty while those of the french were crowded with men who kept carefully out of sight of the enemy  suddenly three jets of earth and dust sprung into the air the french had exploded three mines and at the signal a stream of fire three miles in length ran from battery to battery as the whole of their guns opened fire the effect of this stupendous volley was terrible the iron shower ploughed up the batteries and entrenchments of the russians and crashed among the houses far behind in a moment the hillside was wreathed with smoke with the greatest energy the french worked their guns and the roar was continuous and terrible  for a time the russians seemed paralyzed by this tremendous fire lying quietly in their sheltered subterranean caves they had no thought of what was preparing for them and the storm which burst upon them took them wholly by surprise soon however they recovered from their astonishment and steadily opened fire in return the english guns now joined their voices to the concert and for two hours the storm of fire continued unabating on both sides  after two hours and a half the din ceased the french artillerymen waiting to allow their guns to cool at ten oclock the french again exploded some mines and for two hours renewed their cannonade as hotly as ever the russians could be seen pouring troops across the bridge over the harbor from their camps on the north side to resist the expected attack from twelve to five the firing was slack at that hour the french again began their cannonade as vigorously as before  when darkness came on and accurate firing at the enemys batteries was no longer possible the mortars and heavy guns opened fire on the place the sky was streaked with lines of fire as the heavy shells described their curves bursting with heavy explosions over the town presently a cheer rose from the spectators who thronged the crest of the bill for flames were seen bursting out from one of the russian frigates higher and higher they rose although by their light the russians could be perceived working vigorously to extinguish them at last they were seen to be leaving the ship soon the flames caught the mast and rigging and the pillar of fire lit up the whole town and surrounding country not a moment did our fire slacken but no answering flash now shot out from the russian lines of defence all night the fire continued to prevent the enemy from repairing damages  the next morning the english played the principal part in the attack our batteries commencing at daylight and continuing their fire all day the russians could be seen to be extremely busy hitherto they had believed that the allies would never be able to take the town but the tremendous fire which the allies had now opened and the close approach of the french to the malakoff had clearly shaken their confidence at last  large quantities of stores were transported during the day to the north side and on the heights there great numbers of men were seen to be laboring at fortifications the russian army in the field was observed to be moving towards inkerman and it was believed that it was about to repeat the experiment of the tchernaya and to make a desperate effort to relieve the town by defeating the allied armies in the field  all that night the bombardment continued without intermission the troops in the trenches keeping up a heavy musketry fire upon the enemys works to prevent them from repairing damages in the dark  the next day was a repetition of those which had gone before it the russians replied but seldom and occasionally when the smoke blew aside it could be seen that terrible damage was being inflicted on the russian batteries at dusk the cannonade ceased the shell bombardment took place and at eleven a tremendous explosion occurred in the town  the russians from time to time lit up the works with fireballs and carcasses evidently fearing a sudden night attack during the day a great council of war was held and as orders were sent to the surgeons to send all the patients in the hospital down to balaklava and to prepare for the reception of wounded it was known that the attack would take place next day  although the russian fire in reply to the bombardment had been comparatively slight from the 3d to the 6th we had three officers and fortythree men killed three officers and 189 men wounded  during these days jack had been on duty in the batteries and the sailors had taken their full part in the work  there was some disappointment that night in the naval camp when it was known by the issue of the divisional orders that the sailors were not to be engaged in the assault jack however aroused the indignation of his tentmates by saying frankly that he was glad that they were not going to share in the attack  it is all very well he said to fight when you have some chance of hitting back but to rush across ground swept by a couple of hundred guns is no joke and to be potted at by thousands of fellows in shelter behind trenches one knows what it was last time the french send 12000 men to attack a battery we try to carry an equally strong place with 1000 if i were ordered of course i should go but i tell you fairly i dont care about being murdered and i call it nothing short of murder to send 1000 men to attack such a position as that we used to say that an englishman could lick three frenchmen but we never did it in any battle i ever heard of our general seems to think that an englishman can lick ten russians although hes in the open and theyre behind shelter and covered by the fire of any number of pieces of artillery  but were certain to get in tomorrow jack  are we jack questioned so every one said last time its all very well for the french who are already right under the guns of the malakoff and have only twenty yards to run when they get in and drive the russians out there they are in a big circular fort just as they were in the mamelon and can hold their own no matter how many men the russians bring up to retake it weve 300 yards to run to get into the redan and when we get in where are we nowhere just in an open work where the russians can bring their whole strength down upon us i dont feel at all sure were going to take the place tomorrow  why archer youre a regular croaker one of the others said we shall have a laugh at you tomorrow evening  i hope you will jack said but i have my doubts i wish tomorrow was over i can tell you the light division are as usual to bear the brunt of it and the 33d will do their share harry has had good luck so far but it will be a hotter thing tomorrow than anything he has gone into yet unless indeed the bombardment of the last three days has taken all heart out of the russians well lets turn in for its bitterly cold tonight and i for one dont feel disposed for talking     chapter xxv   the capture of sebastopol  the morning of the 8th of september was bitterly cold and a keen wind blowing from the town raised clouds of dust  the storming parties were to be furnished by the light and second divisions the first storming party of the light division was to consist of 160 men of the 97th regiment who were to form in rear of a covering party of 100 men furnished by the second battalion rifle brigade they were to carry ladders for descending into the ditch of the redan behind them were to come 200 men of the 97th and 300 of the 90th the supports consisted of 750 men of the 19th and 88th regiments  therefore the assault was to be made by about 750 men with an equal body in support the remainder of the light division being in reserve  the covering party of the second division consisted of 100 men of the 3d buffs the storming party with ladders of 160 of the 3d buffs supported by 260 of the 3d buffs 300 of the 41st with 200 of the 62d and 100 of the 41st the rest of the second division were in reserve  the first and highland divisions were to be formed in the third parallel  the orders were that the british attack was not to commence until the french had gained possession of the malakoff this they did with but slight loss the storming columns were immensely strong as 30000 men were gathered in their trenches for the attack upon the malakoff this was effected almost instantaneously  upon the signal being given they leaped in crowds from the advanced trench climbed over the abattis descended the ditch and swarmed up the rugged slope in hundreds  the russians taken wholly by surprise vainly fired their cannon but ere the men could come out from their underground caves the french were already leaping down upon them it was a slaughter rather than a fight and in an incredibly short time the malakoff was completely in the possession of the french in less than a minute from the time they leaped from the trenches their flag floated on the parapet  the russians recovered from their first surprise soon made tremendous attempts to regain their lost position and five minutes after the french had entered great masses of russians moved forward to dispute its possession for seven hours from twelve to dusk the russians strove obstinately to recover the malakoff but the masses of men which the french poured in as soon as it was captured enabled them to resist the assaults  at length when night came on the russian general seeing that the tremendous slaughter which his troops were suffering availed nothing withdrew them from the attack  as the french flag appeared on the malakoff the english covering parties leaped from the trenches and rushed forward as they did so a storm of shot and shell swept upon them and a great number of men and officers were killed as they crossed the 250 yards between the trenches and the redan this work was a salient that is to say a work whose centre is advanced the two sides meeting there at an angle in case of the redan it was a very obtuse angle and the attacks should have been delivered far up the sides as men entering at the angle itself would be exposed to the concentrated fire of the enemy behind the breastworks which ran across the broad base of the triangle the projecting angle was however of course the point nearest to the english lines and exposed as they were to the sweeping fire of the enemy while crossing the open both columns of assault naturally made for this point  the russian resistance was slight and the stormers burst into the work the abattis had been torn to pieces by the cannonade and the men did not wait for the ladders but leapt into the ditch and scrambled up on the other side  the russians within ran back and opened a fire from their traverses and works in the rear as the english troops entered they halted to fire upon the enemy instead of advancing upon them the consequence was that the russians who were rapidly reinforced were soon able to open a tremendous concentrated fire upon the mass of men in the angle and these pressed upon by their comrades who flocked in behind them impeded by the numerous internal works mixed up in confusion all regimental order being lost were unable either to advance or to use their arms with effect in vain the officers strove by example and shouts to induce them to advance the men had an idea that the place was mined and that if they went forward they would be blown into the air they remained stationary holding their ground but refusing to go forward  every minute the russians brought up fresh reserves and a terrific fire was concentrated upon the british the officers showing themselves in front were soon shot down in numbers and success which had been in their hands at first was now impossible  for an hour and a half the slaughter continued and then as the russian masses poured forward to attack them the remnant who remained of the storming parties leaped from the parapet and made their way as best they could through the storm of bullet and shot back to the trenches  the fight had lasted an hour and three quarters and in that time we had lost more men than at inkerman our loss was 24 officers and 119 men killed 134 officers and 1897 men wounded had the regiments engaged been composed of the same materials as those who won the heights of the alma the result might have been different although even in that case it is questionable whether the small force told off for the assault would have finally maintained itself against the masses which the russians brought up against them but composed as they were of young troops many being lads sent off to the front a few weeks after being recruited the success of such an attack so managed was wellnigh impossible from the first  it was a gloomy evening in the british camps we were defeated while the french were victorious the fact too that the attack had failed in some degree owing to the misconduct of the men added to the effect of the failure it was said that the attack was to be renewed next morning and that the guards and highland brigade were to take part in it very gloomy was the talk over the tremendous loss which had taken place among the officers from the manner in which these had exposed themselves to induce their men to follow them their casualties had been nearly four times as large as they should have been in proportion to their numbers  jack archer was in deep grief for his brother had been severely wounded and the doctors gave no strong hopes of his life he had been shot in the hip as he strove to get the men of his company together and had been carried to the rear just before the russian advance drove the last remnants of the assailants from the salient  jack had with the permission of his commanding officer gone to sit by his brothers bedside and to give his services generally as a nurse to the wounded  at eleven oclock the hut was shaken by a tremendous explosion followed a few minutes afterwards by another several of the wounded officers begged jack to go to cathcarts hill to see what was doing  jack willingly complied and found numbers of officers and men hastening in the same direction a lurid light hung over sebastopol and it was evident that something altogether unusual was taking place  when he reached the spot from which he could obtain a view of sebastopol a wonderful sight met his eye in a score of places the town was on fire explosion after explosion followed and by their light crowds of soldiers could be seen crossing the bridge hour after hour the grandeur of the scene increased as fort after fort was blown up by the russians at four oclock the whole camp was shaken by a tremendous explosion behind the redan and a little later the magazines of the flagstaff and garden batteries were blown up and the whole of the russian fleet with the exception of the steamers had disappeared under the water scuttled by their late owners at halfpast five two of the great southern forts the quarantine and alexander were blown up and soon flames began to ascend from fort nicholas  the russian steamers were all night busy towing boats laden with stores from the south to the north side and when their work was done dense columns of smoke were seen rising from the decks at seven oclock in the morning the whole of the russian troops were safely across the bridge which was then dismembered and the boats which composed it taken over to the north side by this time sebastopol was from end to end a mass of flames and by nightfall nothing save a heap of smoking ruins surrounded by shattered batteries remained of the city which had for so many months kept at bay the armies of england and france  all through the night jack archer had travelled backwards and forwards between the crest of the hill and the hospital for so great was the interest of the wounded in what was taking place that he could not resist their entreaties especially as he could do nothing for his brother who was lying in a quiet halfdreamy state  the delight of the english army at the fall of the south side of sebastopol was greatly tempered by the knowledge that it was due to the capture of the malakoff by the french their own share in the attack having terminated by a defeat and the feeling which had been excited by the fact that the guards and highlanders who had taken no part whatever in the trenchwork during the winter and who were in a high state of efficiency should have been kept in reserve while the boy battalions bore the whole brunt of the attack found angry expression among the men  all that day the allied armies remained quiescent it was useless to attempt to occupy the burning town and the troops might have been injured by the explosions which took place from time to time of stores of powder  the zouaves however and our own sailors made their way down in considerable numbers and returned laden with loot from houses which had so far escaped the conflagration  happily the success of the french and our own failure did not create any feeling of unpleasantness between the troops of the two nations as the remnants of the french regiments engaged in the malakoff marched in the morning to their camps the second division was drawn up on parade as the leading regiment of zouaves came along the english regiment nearest to them burst into a hearty cheer which was taken up by the other regiments as the french came along and as they passed the english presented arms to their brave allies and the officers on both sides saluted with their swords  the next day the officers thronged down to see the ground where the fighting had taken place around the malakoff the ground was heaped with dead not less had been the slaughter outside the work known as the little redan where the french attack had been repulsed with prodigious loss  the houses of the portion of the town nearest the batteries were found full of dead men who had crawled in when wounded in front as a considerable number of the russian steamers of war were still floating under the guns of their batteries on the north side preparations were made at once to mount two heavy guns by the waterside but the russians seeing that the last remains of their fleet would speedily be destroyed took matters in their own hands and on the night of the 11th the six steamers that remained were burnt by the russians  after the din which had raged so fiercely for the previous four days and the dropping fire which had gone on for a year the silence which reigned was strange and almost oppressive there was nothing to be done no turn in the trenches or batteries to be served nothing to do but to rest and to prepare for the next winter which was now almost upon them  a week after the fall of sebastopol the anniversary of the battle of alma was celebrated what great events had taken place since that time  none of those who had rested that night on the vineclad hill they had won dreamed of what was before them or that they were soon to take part in the greatest siege which the world has ever known small indeed was the proportion of those who had fought at the alma now present with the army at sebastopol the fight of inkerman the mighty wear and tear in the trenches the deadly repulses at the redan and above all the hardships of that terrible winter had swept away the noble armies which had landed in the crimea and scarcely one in ten of those who heard the first gun in the alma was present at the fall of sebastopol  the naval camp was now broken up the sailors returned on board ship and the army prepared to go into winter quarters that is to say to dig deep holes under their tents to erect sheltering walls and in some instances to dig complete subterranean rooms  a week after the assault harry archer was carried down to balaklava and put on board ship the surgeons had in vain endeavored to extract the bullet and were unable to give any cheering reply to jacks anxious inquiries  his brother might live but they owned that his chances were slight it was a question of general health and constitution if mortification did not set in the wound might heal and he might recover and carry the bullet about with him all his life of course he had youth and health on his side and jack must hope for the best the report was not reassuring but they could say no more  weeks passed on and the two armies lay watching each other from the heights they occupied at last it was determined to utilize the magnificent fleet which had hitherto done so little accordingly an expedition was prepared whose object was to destroy the forts at kinburn and occupy that place and so further reduce the sources from which the russians drew their food  the sight was an imposing one as the allied squadrons in two long lines steamed north past the harbor of sebastopol the british contingent consisted of six lineofbattle ships seventeen steam frigates and sloops ten gunboats six mortar vessels and nine transports  on board the menofwar were 8340 infantry and 1350 marines the transports carried the royal artillery the medical commissariat and transport corps stores of all kinds and the reserve of ammunition the french fleet was nearly equal in number to our own  steaming slowly the great squadrons kept their course towards odessa and cast anchor three miles off the town odessa is one of the most stately cities of the sea broad esplanades lined with trees with a background of stately mansions terrace after terrace of fine houses rising behind with numbers of public buildings barracks palaces and churches stretching away on the flanks woods dotted with villas and country houses  odessa possessed forts and batteries capable of defending it against the attack of any small naval force but these could have made no defence whatever against so tremendous an armament as that collected before it with telescopes those on board were able to make out large numbers of people walking about or driving on the promenade long lines of dust along the roads showed that many of the inhabitants were hastily leaving or were sending away valuables while on the other hand the glimmer of bayonets among the dust told of the coming of troops who were hurrying in all directions to prevent our landing  odessa was however clearly at our mercy and considerable controversy took place at the time as to whether the allies should not have captured it being defended by batteries it ranked as a fortified town and we should have been clearly justified in destroying these and in putting the town under a heavy contribution which the wealthy city could readily have paid however it was for some reason decided not to do so and after lying at anchor for five days the greater portion of which was passed in a thick fog the great fleet steamed away towards kinburn the entrance to the gulf into which the dneiper and bug discharge themselves is guarded by fort kinburn on the one side and by fort nikolaev on the other the passage between them being about a mile across  on the 17th fire was opened on fort kinburn and although the russians fought bravely they were unable to withstand the tremendous fire poured upon them twentynine out of their seventyone guns and mortars were disabled and the two supporting batteries also suffered heavily the barracks were set on fire and the whole place was soon in flames gradually the russian fire ceased and for some time only one gun was able to answer the tremendous fire poured in upon them  at last finding the impossibility of further resistance the officer in command hoisted the white flag the fort on the opposite shore was blown up by the russians and the fleet entered the channel the troops were landed and kinburn occupied and held until the end of the war and the fleet after a reconnaissance made by a few gunboats up the dneiper returned to sebastopol  the winter was very dull exchanges of shots continued daily between the north and south side but with this exception hostilities were virtually suspended the chief incident being a tremendous explosion of a magazine in the centre of the camp shaking the country for miles away and causing a loss to the french of six officers killed and thirteen wounded and sixtyfive men killed and 170 wounded while seventeen english were killed and sixtynine wounded no less than 250000 pounds of gunpowder exploded together with mounds of shells carcasses and small ammunition hundreds of rockets rushed through the air shells burst in all directions over the camp and boxes of small ammunition exploded in every direction the ships in the harbors of balaklava and kamiesch rocked under the explosion mules and horses seven or eight miles away broke loose and galloped across the country wild with fright while a shower of fragments fell over a circle six miles in diameter  on the last day of february the news came that an armistice had been concluded the negotiations continued for some time before peace was finally signed but the war was at an end and a few days after the armistice was signed the falcon was ordered to england to the great delight of all on board who were heartily sick of the long period of inaction     chapter xxvi   conclusion  the falcon experienced pleasant weather until passing the straits of gibraltar then a heavy gale set in and for many days she struggled with the tempest whose fury was so great that for several hours she was in imminent danger of foundering  at last however the weather cleared and two days later the falcon cast anchor at spithead the next day the crew were paid off and the vessel taken into dock for muchneeded repairs  jacks father had already come down to portsmouth on the receipt of his letter announcing his arrival the day after the ship was paid off they returned home and jack received a joyful greeting from his family they found him wonderfully grown and aged during the two years of his absence whereas before he had promised to be short he was now above middle height his shoulders were broad and square his face bronzed by sun and wind and it was not till they heard his merry laugh that they quite recognized the jack who had left them  he soon went down to the town and looked up his former schoolfellows and even called upon his old classmaster and ended a long chat by expressing his earnest hope that the boys at present in his form were better at their verses than he had been  a month later harry who had quite recovered joined the circle having obtained leave and the two young fellows were the heroes of a number of balls and parties given by the major and his friends to celebrate their return  six months later jack was again appointed to a berth in a fine frigate commanded by his cousin the ship was ordered to the china seas where she remained until at the outbreak of the indian mutiny she was sent to calcutta on their arrival there jack found that captain peel under whom he had served before sebastopol was organizing a naval brigade for service ashore jack at once waited upon him and begged to be allowed to join the brigade his request was complied with and as he had now nearly served his time and passed his examination he received an appointment as acting lieutenant obtaining the full rank after the fight in which the brigade were engaged on their march up to cawnpore he was present at the tremendous struggle when the relieving force under lord clyde burst its way into lucknow and carried off the garrison and also at the final crushing out of the rebellion at that spot  at the conclusion of the war he rejoined his ship and returned with her when she finally left the station for england after an absence of five years he was now threeandtwenty and having been twice mentioned in despatches was looked upon as a rising young officer  a month or two after his return he received a letter from count preskoff with whom he had at intervals corresponded ever since his escape from captivity the count said that he with the countess and his youngest daughter olga were at present in paris the two elder girls had been for some years married the count said that he intended after making a stay for some time in paris to visit england but invited jack to come over to pay them a visit in paris jack gladly assented and a few days later joined his russian friends at the hotel meurice in the rue rivoli they received him with the greatest warmth and he was soon upon his old terms of familiarity with them he found to his great pleasure that olga could now speak english fluently and as he had forgotten a good deal of his russian and had learned no french she often acted as interpreter between him and her parents jacks russian however soon returned to him and at the end of a fortnight he was able to converse fluently in it again  he found olga very little altered but she on her part protested that she should not have known him again he had thought very often of her during the years which had passed but although he had steadfastly clung to the determination he had expressed to his friend hawtry of some day marrying her if she would have him he was now more alive than before to the difference between her position and his the splendid apartments occupied by the count his unlimited expenditure the beauty of his carriages and horses all showed jack the difference between a great russian seigneur and a lieutenant on halfpay feeling that he was becoming more and more in love with olga he determined to make some excuse to leave paris intending upon his return to apply at once to be sent on active service  one morning accordingly when alone with the count he said to him that he feared he should have to leave for england in a few days and it was probable he should shortly join his ship  the count looked keenly at him  my young friend he said have we been making a mistake the countess and i have thought that you were attached to our daughter  i am so assuredly jack said i love your daughter with all my heart and have loved her ever since i left her in russia but i am older now i recognize the difference of position between a penniless english lieutenant and a great russian heiress and it is because i feel this so strongly that i am thinking that it is best for my own peace of mind to leave paris at once and to return to england and to embark on service again as soon as possible  but how about olgas happiness the count said smiling  i dare not think sir jack said that it is concerned in the matter  i fear my young friend that it is concerned and seriously when you left us in russia olga announced to her mother that she intended to marry you some day if you ever came back to ask her although i would i confess have rather that she had married a russian i had so great an esteem and affection for you and owed you so much that her mother and myself determined not to thwart her inclination but to leave the matter to time olga devoted herself to the study of english she has since she grew up refused many excellent offers and when her mother has spoken to her on the subject her only answer has been mamma you know i chose long ago it was to see whether you also remained true to the affection which olga believed you gave her that we have travelled west and now that i find you are both of one mind you are talking of leaving us and going to sea  oh sir jack exclaimed delighted do you really mean that you give me permission to ask for your daughters hand  certainly i do jack the count replied i am quite sure that i can trust her happiness implicitly to you the fact that you have nothing but your pay matters very little olga will have abundance for both and i only bargain that you bring her over to russia every year for two or three months to stay with us you will of course my boy give up the sea now he said that you have got my consent you had better ask olgas  jack found that the count had not spoken too confidently as to the state of olgas feelings towards him and a month later a gay wedding took place at st james church the count and his wife staying at the bristol hotel and jacks father mother and elder brother and sisters coming up to the wedding to jacks great pleasure he happened to meet in the streets of london two or three days before his wedding his friend hawtry whom he had not seen since they parted on the polish frontier as their ships had never happened to be on the same station hawtry was rejoiced to hear of his friends good fortune and officiated at the wedding as jacks best man  a handsome estate in sussex was purchased by the count and this with the revenues of the estate in poland were settled upon her at her marriage there does not exist at present a happier couple in england than mr and mrs archer for olga refused to retain her title of countess except when at times the cares of a young family prevented their leaving home they have since their marriage paid a visit every year to russia  the count and countess are still alive although now far advanced in life the count is still hoping for the reforms which he believed thirty years ago would do so much for russia but he acknowledges that the fulfilment of his hopes appears to be as far off now as it was then  hawtry is now an admiral but is still a bachelor and he generally spends christmas with his old comrade jack archer
