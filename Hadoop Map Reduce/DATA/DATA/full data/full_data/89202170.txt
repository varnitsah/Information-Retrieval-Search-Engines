immortelles     in explanation   many of the verses in this book are republished with considerable alterations from various newspapers the collection includes few not relating to persons and events more or less familiar to the people of the pacific coastto whom the volume may be considered as especially addressed though not without a hope that some part of the contents may be found to have sufficient intrinsic interest to commend it to others in that case doubtless commentators will be raised up to make exposition of its full meaning with possibly an added meaning read into it by themselves  of my motives in writing and in now republishing i do not care to make either defense or explanation except with reference to those persons who since my first censure of them have passed away to one having only a readers interest in the matter it may easily seem that the verses relating to those might more properly have been omitted from this collection but if these pieces or indeed if any considerable part of my work in literature have the intrinsic worth which by this attempt to preserve some of it i have assumed their permanent suppression is impossible and it is only a question of when and by whom they shall be republished some one will surely search them out and put them in circulation  i conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected in his lifetime and this seems to me especially true of one whose work necessarily engendering animosities is peculiarly exposed to challenge as unjust that is a charge that can be best examined before time has effaced the evidence for the death of a man of whom i may have written what i venture to think worthy to live i am no way responsible and however sincerely i may regret it i can hardly be expected to consent that it shall affect my fortunes if the satirist who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that while condemning the sin he should spare the sinner were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship  persuaded of the validity of all this i have not hesitated to reprint even certain epitaphs which once of the living are now of the dead as all the others must eventually be the objection inheres in all forms of applied satiremy understanding of whose laws and liberties is at least derived from reverent study of the masters that in respect of matters herein mentioned i have but followed their practice can be shown by abundant instance and example  ambrose bierce     the key note   i dreamed i was dreaming one morn as i lay   in a garden with flowers teeming on an island i lay in a mystical bay   in the dream that i dreamed i was dreaming  the ghost of a scenthad it followed me there   from the place where i truly was resting it filled like an anthem the aisles of the air   the presence of roses attesting  yet i thought in the dream that i dreamed i dreamed   that the place was all barren of roses that it only seemed and the place i deemed   was the isle of bewildered noses  full many a seaman had testified   how all who sailed near were enchanted and landed to search and in searching died   for the roses the sirens had planted  for the sirens were dead and the billows boomed   in the stead of their singing forever but the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed   though man had discovered them never  i thought in my dream twas an idle tale   a delusion that mariners cherished that the fragrance loading the conscious gale   was the ghost of a rose long perished  i said i will fly from this island of woes   and acting on that decision by that odor of rose i was led by the nose   for twas truly ah truly elysian  i ran in my madness to seek out the source   of the redolent riverdirected by some supernatural sinister force   to a forest dark haunted infected  and still as i threaded twas all in the dream   that i dreamed i was dreaming each turning there were many a scream and a sudden gleam   of eyes all uncannily burning  the leaves were all wet with a horrible dew   that mirrored the red moons crescent and all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue   dim wavering phosphorescent  but the fragrance divine coming strong and free   led me on though my blood was clotting tillah joyi could see on the limbs of a tree   mine enemies hanging and rotting     cain   lord shed thy light upon his desert path   and gild his branded brow that no man spill   his forfeit life to balk thy holy will that spares him for the ripening of wrath  already lo the red sign is descried   to trembling jurors visibly revealed   the prison doors obediently yield the baffled hangman flings the cord aside  powell the brothers blood that marks your trail   hark how it cries against you from the ground   like the far baying of the tireless hound faith to your ear it is no nightingale  what signifies the date upon a stone   tomorrow you shall die if not today   what matter when the avenger choose to slay or soon or late the devil gets his own  thenceforth through all eternity youll hold   no one advantage of the later death   though you had granted ralph another breath would he today less silent lie and cold  earth cares not curst assassin when you die   you never will be readier than now   wear in gods name that mark upon your brow and keep the life you purchased with a lie     an obituarian   deathpoet pickering sat at his desk   wrapped in appropriate gloom his posture was pensive and picturesque   like a raven charming a tomb  enter a party adrinking the cup   of sorrowand likewise of woe some harrowing poetry mister whack up   all wrote in the key of o  for the angels has called my old woman hence   from the strife where she fit mighty free its a nickel a line condn the expense   for wealth is now little to me  the bard of mortality looked him through   in the piercingest sort of a way it is much to me though its little to you   ive taken a wife today  so he twisted the tail of his mental cow   and made her give down her flow the grief of that bard was longwinded somehow   there was reams and reamses of woe  the widower man which had buried his wife   grew lilylike round each gill for she turned in her grave and came back to life   then he cruel ignored the bill  then sorrow she opened her gates awide   as likewise did also woe and the deathpoets song as is heard inside   is sang in the key of o     a commuted sentence   boruck and waterman upon their grills   in hades lay with many a sigh and groan   hotly disputing for each swore his own were clearly keener than the others ills   and truly each had much to boast ofbone and sinew muscle tallow nerve and skin blood in the vein and marrow in the shin   teeth eyes and other organs for the soul has all of these and even a wagging chin   blazing and coruscating like a coal for lower sacramento you remember has trying weather even in middecember  now this occurred in the far future all   mankind had been a million ages dead   and each to her reward above had sped each to his punishment belowi call   that quite a just arrangement as i said boruck and waterman in warmest pain crackled and sizzed with all their might and main   for when on earth theyd freed a scurvy host of crooks from the state prison who again   had robbed and ravaged the pacific coast and such the felons predatory nature even got themselves into the legislature  so waterman and boruck lay and roared   in hades it is true all other males   felt the like flames and uttered equal wails but did not suffer them whereas they bored   each one the other but indeed my tales not getting on at all they lay and browned till boruck who long since his teeth had ground   away and spoke gum arabic and made stump speeches even in praying looked around   and said to bobs incinerated shade your excellency this is mighty hard on the inventors of the unpardonable pardon  the other soulhis right hand all aflame   for twas with that hed chiefly sinned although   his tongue too like a wick was working woe to the reserve of tallow in his frame   said with a sputtering uncertain flow and with a gesture like a shaken torch yes but im sure well not much longer scorch   although this climate is not good for hope whose joyous wing twould singe i think the porch   of hell well quit with a pacific slope last century i signified repentance and asked for commutation of our sentence  even as he spoke the form of satan loomed   in sight all crimson with reflectionss fire   like some tall tower or cathedral spire touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed   in mists and shadows of the night time sire said waterman his agitable wick still sputtering what calls you back so quick   it scarcely was a century ago you left us i have come to bring said nick   st peters answer he is never slow in correspondence to your application for pardonpardon mefor commutation  he says that hes instructed to reply   and he has so instructed me that sin   like yoursand this poor gentlemans whos in for bad advice to youcomes rather high   but since apparently you both begin to feel some pious promptings to the right and fain would turn your faces to the light   eternity seems all too long a term so tis commuted to onehalf im quite   prepared when that expires to free the worm and quench the fire and civilly retreating he left them holding their protracted meeting     a lifted finger      the chronicle did a great public service in whipping      and his fellowrascals out of officemh de youngs     newspaper   what you whip rascalsyou whose gutter blood bears in its dark dishonorable flood enough of prisonbirds prolific germs to serve a whole eternity of terms you for whose back the rods and cudgels strove ere yet the ax had hewn them from the grove you the de young whose splendor bright and brave is phosphorescence from anothers grave till now unknown by any chance or luck even to the hearts at which you feebly struck you whip a rascal out of officeyou whose leadless weapon once ignobly blew its smoke in six directions to assert your lack of appetite for others dirt  practice makes perfect when for fame you thirst then whip a rascal whip a cripple first or if for action youre less free than bold your palms both brimming with dishonest gold entrust the castigation that youve planned as once before to womans idle hand so in your spirit shall two pleasures join to slake the sacred thirst for blood and coin blood souls have blood even as the body hath and spilled twill fertilize the field of wrath lo in a purple gorge of yonder hills where oer a grave a bird its daysong stills a womans blood through roses ever red mutely appeals for vengeance on your head slandered to death to serve a sordid end she called you murderer and called me friend  now mark you libeler this course if you dare to maintain or rather to renew if one short years immunity has made you blink again the perils of your trade the ghastly sequence of the maddened knave the hot encounter and the colder grave if the grim dismal lesson you ignore while yet the stains are fresh upon your floor and calmly march upon the fatal brink with eyes averted to your trail of ink counting unkind the services of those who pull to hold you back your stupid nose the day for you to die is not so far or at the least to live the thing you are  pregnant with possibilities of crime and full of felons for all coming time your bloods too precious to be lightly spilt in testimony to a venial guilt live to get whelpage and preserve a name no praise can sweeten and no lie unshame live to fulfill the vision that i see down the dim vistas of the time to be a dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes of hungry ravens glooming all the skies a dream of gleaming teeth and foetid breath of jackals wrangling at the feast of death a dream of broken necks and swollen tongues the whole worlds gibbets loaded with de youngs  1881     two statesmen   in that fair city by the inland sea where blaine unhived his presidential bee frank pixleys meeting with george gorham sing celestial muse and what events did spring from the encounter of those mighty sons of thunder and of slaughter and of guns great gorham first his yearning tooth to sate and give him stomach for the days debate entering a restaurant with eager mien demands an ounce of bacon and a bean the trembling waiter by the statesmans eye smitten with terror hastens to comply nor chairs nor tables can his speed retard for famines fixed and horrible regard he takes for menace as he shaking flew lo the portentous pixley heaved in view before him yawned invisible the cell unheard behind the wardens footsteps fell thrice in convention rising to his feet he thrice had been thrust back into his seat thrice had protested been reminded thrice the nation had no need of his advice balked of his will to set the people right his soul was gloomy though his hat was white so fierce his mien with provident accord the waiters swarmed him thinking him a lord he spurned them roaring grandly to their chief give me fred crocker pays a leg of beef his wandering eyes deluminating flame fell upon gorham and the crisis came for pixley scowled and darkness filled the room till gorhams flashing orbs dispelled the gloom the patrons of the place by fear dismayed sprang to the street and left their scores unpaid so when jove thunders and his lightnings gleam to sour the milk and curdle too the cream and stormclouds gather on the shadowed hill the ass forsakes his hay the pig his swill hotly the heroes now engagedtheir breath came short and hard as in the throes of death they clenched their hands their weapons brandished high cut stabbed and hewed nor uttered any cry but gnashed their teeth and struggled on in brief one ate his bacon tother one his beef     matter for gratitude      especially should we be thankful for having escaped the     ravages of the yellow scourge by which our neighbors have     been so sorely afflictedgovernor stonemans thanksgiving     proclamation   be pleased o lord to take a peoples thanks that thine avenging sword has spared our ranks that thou hast parted from our lips the cup and forced our neighbors lips to drink it up father of mercies with a heart contrite we thank thee that thou goest south to smite and sparest san franciscos loins to crack thy lash on hermosillos bleeding back that oer our homes thine awful angel spread his wings in vain and guaymas weeps instead  we praise thee god that yellow fever here his horrid banner has not dared to rear consumptions jurisdiction to contest her dagger deep in every second breast catarrh and asthma and congestive chill attest thy bounty and perform thy will these native messengers obey thy call they summon singly but they summon all not as in mexicos impested clime can yellow jack commit recurring crime we thank thee that thou killest all the time  thy tender mercies father never end upon all heads thy blessings still descend though their forms vary here the sown seeds yield abundant grain that whitens all the field there the smit corn stands barren on the plain thrift reaps the straw and famine gleans in vain here the fat priest to the contented king points out the contrast and the people sing there mothers eat their offspring well at least thou hast provided offspring for the feast an earthquake here rolls harmless through the land and thou art good because the chimneys stand there templed cities sink into the sea and damp survivors howling as they flee skip to the hills and hold a celebration in honor of thy wise discrimination  o god forgive them all from stoneman down thy smile who construe and expound thy frown and fall with saintly grace upon their knees to render thanks when thou dost only sneeze     three kinds of a rogue   i  sharon ambitious of immortal shame fames deadwall daubed with his illustrious name served in the senate for our sins his time each word a folly and each vote a crime law for our governance well skilled to make by knowledge gained in study how to break yet still by the presiding eye ignored which only sought him when too loud he snored auspicious thunderwhen he woke to vote he stilled his own to cut his countrys throat that rite performed fell off again to sleep while statesmen ages dead awoke to weep for sedentary service all unfit by lying long disqualified to sit wasting below as he decayed aloft his seat grown harder as his brain grew soft he left the hall he could not bring away and grateful millions blessed the happy day whateer contention in that hall is heard his sovereign state has still the final word for disputatious statesmen when they roar startle the ancient echoes of his snore which from their dusty nooks expostulate and close with stormy clamor the debate to low melodious thunders then they fade their murmuring lullabies all ears invade peace takes the chair the portal silence keeps no motion stirs the dark lethean deeps washoe has spoken and the senate sleeps   ii  lo the new sharon with a new intent making no laws but keen to circumvent the laws of nature since he cant repeal that break his failing body on the wheel as tantalus again and yet again the elusive wave endeavors to restrain to slake his awful thirst so sharon tries to purchase happiness that age denies obtains the shadow but the substance goes and hugs the thorn but cannot keep the rose for dead sea fruits bids prodigally eats and then with tardy reformationcheats alert his faculties as three score years and four score vices will permit he nears dicing with deaththe finish of the game and curses still his candles wasting flame the narrow circle of whose feeble glow dims and diminishes at every throw moments his losses pleasures are his gains which even in his grasp revert to pains the joy of grasping them alone remains   iii  ring up the curtain and the play protract behold our sharon in his last mad act with man long warring quarreling with god he crouches now beneath a womans rod predestined for his back while yet it lay closed in an acorn which one luckless day he stole unconscious of its foetal twig from the scant garner of a sightless pig with bleeding shoulders pitilessly scored he bawls more lustily than once he snored the sympathetic comstocks droop to hear and carson river sheds a viscous tear which sturdy tumblebugs assail amain with ready thrift and urge along the plain the jackass rabbit sorrows as he lopes the sagebrush glooms along the mountain slopes in rising clouds the poignant alkali tearless itself makes everybody cry washoe canaries on the geiger grade subdue the singing of their cavalcade and wiping with their ears the tears unshed grieve for their familys unlucky head virginia city intermits her trade and wellclad strangers walk her streets unflayed nay all nevada ceases work to weep and the recording angel goes to sleep but in his dreams his goosequills creaking fount augments the debits in the long account and still the continents and oceans ring with royal torments of the silver king incessant bellowings fill all the earth mingled with inextinguishable mirth he roars men laugh nevadans weep beasts howl plash the affrighted fish and shriek the fowl with monstrous din their blended thunders rise peal upon peal and brawl along the skies startle in hell the sharons as they groan and shake the splendors of the great white throne still roaring outward through the vast profound the spreading circles of receding sound pursue each other in a failing race to the cold confines of eternal space there break and die along that awful shore which gods own eyes have never dared explore dark fearful formless nameless evermore  look to the west against yon steely sky lone mountain rears its holy cross on high about its base the meekfaced dead are laid to share the benediction of its shade with crossed white hands shut eyes and formal feet their nights are innocent their days discreet sharon some years perchance remain of life of vice and greed vulgarity and strife and thengod speed the day if such his will youll lie among the dead you helped to kill and be in good society at last your purse unsilvered and your face unbrassed     a man   pennoyer governor of oregon casting to south his eye across the bourne of his dominion where the palmiped with leathers twixt his toes paddles his marsh amphibious saw a rising cloud of hats and heard a faint far sound of distant cheers below the swell of the horizon lo cried one the president the president all footed webwise then took up the word the hill tribes and the tribes lacustrine and the folk riparian and littoral cried with one voice the president he comes and some there were who flung their headgear up in emulation of the southern mob while some more soberly disposed stood still and silently had fits and others made such reverent genuflexions as they could having that climate in their bones then spake the court dunce humbly as became him sire if thou as heretofore thou hast wilt deign to reap advantage of a fools

to retire said he be damned  to that high place oer portlands central block where the recording angel stands to view the sinning world nor thinks to move his feet aside and look below came flocking up inferior angels all aghast and cried pennoyer governor of oregon has said o what an awful wordtoo bad to be by us repeated yes i know said the superior birdi heard it too and have already booked it

mess of and i came to see that worth   received its dues id hardly finished waking the gravemould still upon me when my eye perceived a statue standing straight and high  twas a colossal figurebronze and gold   nobly designed in attitude commanding a toga from its shoulders fold on fold   fell to the pedestal on which twas standing nobility it had and splendid grace and all it should have hadexcept a face  it showed no features not a trace nor sign   of any eyes or nose could be detected on the smooth oval of its front no line   where sites for mouths are commonly selected all blank and blind its faulty head it reared let this be said twas generously eared  seeing these things i straight began to guess   for whom this mighty image was intended the head i cried is uptons and the dress   is parson bartletts own true his cloak ended flush with his lowest vertebra but no sane sculptor ever made a toga so  then on the pedestal these words i read   erected eighteen hundred

inscription ended in   the year three thousandwhich was just arriving by jove thought i twould make the founders grin   to learn whose fame so long has been surviving to read the name posterity will place in that blank void and view the finished face  even as i gazed the year three thousand came   and then by acclamation all the people decreed whose was our centurys best fame   then scaffolded the statue like a steeple to make the likeness and the name was sunk deep in the pedestals metallic trunk  whose was it gentle reader pray excuse   the seeming rudeness but i cant consent to be so forehanded with important news   twas neither yours nor minelet that content you if not the name i must surrender which upon a dead mans word was george k fitch     an art critic   ira p rankin youve

flung athwart my way emerging on a waste of rock and sand  the apples all are gone from here i said the roses perished and their spirits fled     i will go back a voice cried out the man is risen who eternally was dead  i turned and saw an angel standing there newly descended from the heights of air     sweeteyed compassion filled his face his hands a naked sword and golden trumpet bare  nay twas

and shot their bodies strewed each vacant lot  oer all the earth from berkeley down to san leandros ancient town and out in space as far as niles i saw their mortal parts in piles  one stack upreared its ridge so high against the azure of the sky that some good soul with pious views put up a steeple and sold pews  no wagging tail the scene relieved i never in my life conceived i swear it on the decalogue such penury of living dog  the barking and the howling stilled the snarling with the snarler killed all nature seemed to hold its breath the silence was as deep as death  true candidates were all in roar on every platform as before and villains as before felt free to finger the calliope  true the salvationist by night and milkman in the early light the lonely flutist and the mill

unheavenly hours crew with excruciating powers cats on the woodshed rang and roared fat citizens and foghorns snored  but this was all too fine for ears accustomed through the awful years to the nocturnal monologues and day debates of oakland dogs  and so the world was silent now what else befellto whom and how imprimis then there were no fleas and days of worth brought nights of ease  men walked about without the dread of being torn to many a shred each fragment holding half a cruse of hydrophobias quickening juice  they had not to propitiate some curst kioodle at each gate but entered

sway from walnut creek to san jose     the unfallen brave   not all in sorrow and in tears to pay of gratitudes arrears   the yearly sum not prompted wholly by the pride of those for whom their

town of muscatel whose fate is full of meaning if correctly understood admonition to the haughty consolation to the good  it happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred when twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird and men exclaimed by hunky who were bad enough to swear and pious persons supervised their adjectives with care  mr peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute his learning comprehensive multifarious minute it was commonly conceded in the section whence he came that the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game  and some there were who whispered in the town of muscatel that besides the game of draw he knew orthography as well though the school directors frigidly contemning that as stuff thought that draw and maybe spelling if it pleased him was enough  withal he was a haughty manindubitably great but too vain of his attainments and his power in debate his mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift its only me he said can give the human mind a lift  before a proper audience if ever ive a chance youll see me chipping in the cause of learning to advance just let me have a decent chance to back my mental hand and ill come to center lightly in a way theyll understand  such was william perry peters and i feel a poignant sense of grief that im unable to employ the present tense but providence disposes be our scheming what it may and disposed of mr peters in a cold regardless way  it occurred in san francisco whither mr peters came in the cause of education feeling still the holy flame of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind to a higher plane of knowledge than its architect designed  he attended the convention of the pedagogic host he was first in the pavilion he was last to leave his post for days and days he narrowly observed the chairmans eye his efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly  the blessed moment came at last the chairman tipped his head the gentleman from ahumer that functionary said the gentleman from ahumer reflected with a grin theyll know me better byandby when im achipping in  so william perry peters mounted cheerfully his feet and straightway was aglow with an incalculable heat his face was as effulgent as a human face could be and caloric emanated from his whole periphery  for he felt himself the focus of nonmuscatelish eyes and the pain of their convergence was a terror and surprise as with pitiless impaction all their heatwaves on him broke he was seen to be evolving awful quantities of smoke  put him out cried all in chorus but the meaning wasnt clear of that succoring suggestion to his obfuscated ear and it notably augmented his incinerating glow to regard himself excessive or in any way de trop  gone was all his wild ambition to lift up the human mind gone the words he would have utteredgone the thought that lay behind for words that burn may be consumed in a superior flame and thoughts that breathe may breathe their last and die a death of shame  hed known himself a shining light but never had he known himself so very luminous as now he knew he shone a pillar i of fire hed said to guide my race will be and now that very inconvenient thing to him was he  he stood there all irresolute the seconds went and came the minutes passed and did but add fresh fuel to his flame how long he stood he knew nottwas a century or more and then that incandescent man levanted for the door  he darted like a comet from the building to the street where fahrenheit attested ninetyfive degrees of heat vicissitudes of climate make the tenure of the

bill you whose most honest dollars all were got by saying for a fee the thing thats not to you tis one to challenge or defend clients are means their money is an end in my profession sometimes as in yours always a payment large enough secures a mercenary service to defend the guilty or the innocent to rend but mark the difference nor think it slight we do not hold it proper just and right of selfish lies a little still we shame and give our villainies another name hypocrisys an ugly vice no doubt but blushing sinners cant get on without happy the lawyerat his favored hands nor truth nor

proving that have been put forth though still the doubt remains if god has read them with befitting pains no morrow could get justice youll declare if none who knew him foul affirmed him fair ingenious man how easy tis to raise an argument to justify the course that pays  i grant you if you like that men may need the services performed for crime by greed grant that the perfect welfare of the state requires the aid of those who in debate as mercenaries lost in early youth the fine distinction between lie and truth who cheat in argument and set a snare to take the feet of justice unaware who serve with livelier zeal when rogues assist with perjury embracery the list is long to quote than when an honest soul scorning to plot conspire intrigue cajole reminds them their astonishment how great hed rather suffer wrong than perpetrate i grant in short tis better all around that ambidextrous consciences abound in courts of law to do the dirty work that selfrespecting

and hope on joyous pinions flew before  then dived the train adown the sunset slope pleasure was silent and unseen was hope  crashes and shrieks attested the decay that greed had wrought upon that

big smith that snowflakes all are his kin and kith wherever his eye he chances to throw the crystals of ice begin to grow and the fruits and flowers he sees are lost by the singeing touch of a sudden frost the women all shiver whenever hes near and look upon us with a look austere effect of the smithian atmosphere such in a word is the moral plan of the big big smith the school board man when told that madame ferrier had taught hernani in school his fist he brought like a triphammer down on his bulbous knee and he roared her nanny by gum well see if the publics time she dares devote to the educatin of any dam goat you do not entirely comprehend hernanis a play said his learned friend by victor hugoimmoral and bad whats worse its french well well my lad said smith if he cuts a swath so wide ill have him took reglar up and tried and he smiled so sweetly the other chap thought that himself was a finn or lapp caught in a storm of his native snows with a purple ear and an azure nose the

and scorning pious platitudes he saw in the beatitudes   a lamp to guide his feet  he knew that jonah downed the whale and made no bones of it the tale   that ananias told he swore was true he had no doubt that daniel laid the lions out in short he had all holiness all meekness and all lowliness   and was with saints enrolled  tis true some slight excess of zeal sincerely to promote the weal   of
