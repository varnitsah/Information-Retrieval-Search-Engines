56941343	ships company  by ww jacobs   illustration as i was asaying kindness to animals is all very well    watchdogs  its amost the only enjyment ive got left said the oldest inhabitant taking a long slow draught of beer that and a pipe o baccy  neither of em wants chewing and thats a great thing when you aint got anything worth speaking about left to chew with  he put his mug on the table and ignoring the stillness of the summer air sheltered the flame of a match between his cupped hands and conveyed it with infinite care to the bowl of his pipe  a dull but crafty old eye squinting down the stem assured itself that the tobacco was well alight before the match was thrown away  as i was asaying kindness to animals is all very well he said to the wayfarer who sat opposite him in the shade of the cauliflower elms but kindness to your fellercreeturs is more  the pint wot you give me is gone but im just as thankful to you as if it wasnt  he half closed his eyes and gazing on to the fields beyond fell into a reverie so deep that he failed to observe the landlord come for his mug and return with it filled  a little start attested his surprise and to his great annoyance upset a couple of tablespoonfuls of the precious liquid  some people waste all their kindness on dumb animals he remarked after the landlord had withdrawn from his offended vision but i was never a believer in it  i mind some time ago when a genlemen from lunnon wot ad more money than sense offered a prize for kindness to animals  i was the only one that didnt try for to win it  mr bunnett is name was and e come down and took farmer halls ouse for the summer  over sixty e was and old enough to know better  he used to put saucers of milk all round the ouse for cats to drink and by the time pore farmer hall got back every cat for three miles round ad got in the habit of coming round to the backdoor and asking for milk as if it was their right  farmer hall poisoned a saucer o milk at last and then ad to pay five shillings for a thin black cat with a mangy tail and one eye that bob pretty said belonged to is children  farmer hall said hed go to jail afore hed pay at fust but arter five men ad spoke the truth and said they ad see bobs youngsters tying a empty mustardtin to its tail ony the day afore he gave way  tha was bob pretty all over that was the biggest raskel claybury as ever had and it wasnt the fust bit o money e made out o mr bunnett coming to the place  it all come through mr bunnetts love for animals  i never see a man so fond of animals as e was and if he had ad is way claybury would ave been overrun by em by this time  the day arter e got to the farm he couldnt eat is breakfuss because of a pig that was being killed in the yard and it was no good pointing out to im that the pig was ony making a fuss about it because it was its nature so to do  he lived on wegetables and such like and the way e carried on one day over arf a biled caterpillar e found in his cabbage wouldnt be believed  he wouldnt eat another mossel but sat hunting igh and low for the other arf  he adnt been in claybury more than a week afore he said ow surprised e was to see ow pore dumb animals was treated  he made a little speech about it one evening up at the schoolroom and arter he ad finished he up and offered to give a prize of a gold watch that used to belong to is dear sister wot loved animals to the one wot was the kindest to em afore he left the place  if hed ha known claybury men better e wouldnt ha done it  the very next morning bill chambers took is babys milk for the cat and smacked is wifes ead for talking arter hed told er to stop  henery walker got into trouble for leaning over charlie stubbss fence and feeding his chickens for im and sam joness wife had to run off ome to er mother arfdressed because she had appened to overlay a sick rabbit wot sam ad taken to bed with im to keep warm  people used to stop animals in the road and try and do em a kindness especially when mr bunnett was passingand peter gubbins walked past is house one day with ole mrs broads cat in is arms  a badtempered old cat it was and wot with peter kissing the top of its ead and calling of it tiddleums it nearly went out of its mind  the fust time mr bunnett see bob pretty was about a week arter hed offered that gold watch  bob was stooping down very careful over something in the hedge and mr bunnett going up quietlike behind im see im messing about with a pore old toad he ad found with a smashed leg  wots the matter with it ses mr bunnett  bob didnt seem to hear im  he was akneeling on the ground with is ead on one side looking at the toad and by and by he pulled out is pocketankercher and put the toad in it as if it was made of eggshells and walked away  wots the matter with it ses mr bunnett amost trotting to keep up with im  got its leg urt in some way pore thing ses bob  i want to get it ome as soon as i can and wash it and put it on a piece o damp moss but im afraid its not long for this world  mr bunnett said it did im credit and walked home alongside of im talking  he was surprised to find that bob hadnt eard anything of the gold watch e was offering but bob said he was a busy ardworking man and didnt ave no time to go to hear speeches or listen to tittle tattle  when ive done my days work he ses i can always find a job in the garden and arter that i go in and elp my missis put the children to bed  she aint strong pore thing and its better than wasting time and money up at the cauliflower  he ad a lot o talk with mr bunnett for the next day or two and when e went round with the toad on the third day as lively and well as possible the old genleman said it was a miracle  and so it would ha been if it had been the same toad  he took a great fancy to bob pretty and somehow or other they was always dropping acrost each other  he met bob with is dog one daya large ugly brute but amost as clever as wot bob was imself  it stood there with its tongue anging out and looking at bob uneasylike out of the corner of its eye as bob stood apatting of it and calling it pet names   wunnerful affectionate old dog aint you joseph ses bob  hes got a kind eye ses mr bunnett  hes like another child to me aint you my pretty ses bob smiling at im and feeling in is pocket  here you are old chap  he threw down a biskit so sudden that joseph thinking it was a stone went off like a streak o lightning with is tail between is legs and yelping his ardest  most men would ha looked a bit foolish but bob pretty didnt turn a hair  aint it wunnerful the sense theyve got he ses to mr bunnett wot was still staring arter the dog  sense ses the old genleman  yes ses bob smiling  his food aint been agreeing with im lately and hes starving hisself for a bit to get round agin and e knew that e couldnt trust hisself alongside o this biskit  wot a pity men aint like that with beer  i wish as ow bill chambers and henery walker and a few more ad been ere just now  mr bunnett agreed with im and said wot a pity it was everybody adnt got bob prettys commonsense and good feeling  it aint that ses bob shaking his ead at him it aint to my credit  i dessay if sam jones and peter gubbins and charlie stubbs and dicky weed ad been brought up the same as i was theyd ave been a lot better than wot i am  he bid mr bunnett goodbye becos e said hed got to get back to is work and mr bunnett had ardly got ome afore henery walker turned up full of anxiousness to ask his advice about five little baby kittens wot is old cat had found in the washplace the night afore  drownd them little innercent things same as most would do i cant he ses shaking his ead but wot to do with em i dont know  couldnt you find omes for em ses mr bunnett  henery walker shook his ead agin  taint no use thinking o that he ses  theres more cats than omes about ere  why bill chambers drownded six ony last week right afore the eyes of my pore little boy upset im dreadful it did  mr bunnett walked up and down the room thinking  we must try and find omes for em when they are old enough he says at last ill go round myself and see wot i can do for you  henery walker thanked im and went off ome doing a bit o thinking and well he ad reason to  everybody wanted one o them kittens  peter gubbins offered for to take two and mr bunnett told henery walker next day that e could ha found omes for em ten times over  youve no idea wot fine kindarted people they are in this village when their arts are touched he ses smiling at henery  you ought to ave seen mr joness smile when i asked im to take one  it did me good to see it  and i spoke to mr chambers about drowning is kittens and he told me e hadnt slept a wink ever since  and he offered to take your old cat to make up for it if you was tired of keeping it  it was very ard on henery walker i must say that  other people was getting the credit of bringing up is kittens and more than that they used to ask mr bunnett into their places to see ow the little dears was agetting on  kindness to animals caused more unpleasantness in claybury than anything ad ever done afore  there was hardly a man as ud speak civil to each other and the wimmen was amost as bad  cats and dogs and suchlike began to act as if the place belonged to em and seven people stopped mr bunnett one day to tell im that joe parsons ad been putting down ratpoison and killed five little baby rats and their mother  it was some time afore anybody knew that bob pretty ad got is eye on that gold watch and when they did they could ardly believe it  they give bob credit for too much sense to waste time over wot they knew e couldnt get but arter they ad heard one or two things they got alarmed and pretty near the whole village went up to see mr bunnett and tell im about bobs true character  mr bunnett couldnt believe em at fast but arter they ad told im of bobs poaching and the artful ways and tricks he ad of getting money as didnt belong to im e began to think different  he spoke to parson about im and arter that e said he never wanted for to see bob prettys face again  there was a fine todo about it up at this ere cauliflower publicouse that night and the quietest man o the whole lot was bob pretty  he sat still all the time drinking is beer and smiling at em and giving em good advice ow to get that gold watch  its no good to me he ses shaking his ead  im a pore labourin man and i know my place  ow you could ever ave thought you ad a chance bob i dont know ses henery walker  ows the toad bob ses bill chambers and then they all

ses bob  come to think it over quiet like im afraid i shall win it arter all  cos why  cos i deserves it  they all laughed agin and bill chambers laughed so arty that e joggled peter gubbinss arm and upset is beer  laugh away ses bob pretending to get savage  them that laughs best laughs last mind  ill ave that watch now just to spite you all  ow are you going to get it bob ses sam jones jeering

shook his ead and started talking to bill chambers about something else  ill bet you two bob to one bob ses dicky well three to one then  bob sat up and looked atim for a long time considering and at last he ses all right he ses if smith the landlord will mind the money i will  he anded over his shilling but very slowlike and dicky weed anded over is money  arter that bob sat looking disagreeable like especially when  dicky said wot e was goin to do with the money and by an by sam jones dared im to ave the same bet with im in sixpences  bob pretty ad a pint more beer to think it over and arter bill chambers ad stood im another he said e would  he seemed a bit dazed like and by the time he went ome he ad made bets with thirteen of em being saturday night they ad all got money on em and as for bob he always ad some  smith took care of the money and wrote it all up on a slate  why dont you ave a bit on mr smith ses dicky  oh i dunno ses smith wiping down the bar with a wet cloth  its the

was drinking beer a smack on the back wot nearly ruined im for life   illustration some of em went and told mr bunnett some more things about bob next day   some of em went and told mr bunnett some more things about bob next day but they might as well ha saved their breath  the old genleman said be knew all about im and he never wanted to ear his name mentioned agin  arter which they began for to ave a more cheerful way of looking at things and sam jones said e was going to ave a hole bored through is sixpence and wear it round is neck to aggravate bob pretty with  for the next three or four weeks bob pretty seemed to keep very quiet and we all began to think as ow he ad made a mistake for once everybody else was trying their ardest for the watch and all bob done was to make a laugh of em and to say he believed it was ony made of brass arter all  then one arternoon just a few days afore mr bunnetts time was up at the farm bob took is dog out for a walk and arter watching the farm
