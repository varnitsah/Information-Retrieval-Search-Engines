term  18 the bishop scores     1  term begins   marriott walked into the senior dayroom and finding no one there hurled his portmanteau down on the table with a bang the noise brought william into the room william was attached to leicesters house beckford college as a mixture of butler and bootboy he carried a pail of water in his hand he had been engaged in cleaning up the house against the conclusion of the summer holidays of which this was the last evening by the simple process of transferring all dust dirt and other foreign substances from the floor to his own person  ullo mr marriott he said  hullo william said marriott how are you still jogging along thats a mercy i say look here i want a quiet word in season with the authorities they must have known i was coming back this evening of course they did why they specially wrote and asked me well wheres the red carpet wheres the awning wheres the brass band that ought to have met me at the station wheres anything i tell you what it is william my old companion theres a bad time coming for the headmaster if he doesnt mind what hes doing he must learn that life is stern and life is earnest william has gethryn come back yet  william who had been gasping throughout this harangue for the intellectual pressure of marriotts conversation of which there was always plenty was generally too much for him caught thankfully at the last remark as being the only intelligible one uttered up to present date and made answer  mr gethryn es gorn out on to the field mr marriott e come arf an hour ago  oh right thanks goodbye william give my respects to the cook and mind you dont work too hard think what it would be if you developed heart disease awful you mustnt do it william  marriott vanished and william slightly dazed went about his professional duties once more marriott walked out into the grounds in search of gethryn gethryn was the head of leicesters this term vice reynolds departed and marriott who was second man up shared a study with him leicesters had not a good name at beckford in spite of the fact that it was generally in the running for the cricket and football cups the fact of the matter was that with the exception of gethryn marriott a boy named reece who kept wicket for the school eleven and perhaps two others leicesters seniors were not a good lot to the school in general who gauged a fellows character principally by his abilities in the cricket and football fields it seemed a very desirable thing to be in leicesters they had been runnersup for the house football cup that year and this term might easily see the cricket cup fall to them amongst the few however it was known that the house was passing through an unpleasant stage in its career a house is either good or bad it is seldom that it can combine the advantages of both systems leicesters was bad  this was due partly to a succession of bad headprefects and partly to leicester himself who was wellmeaning but weak his spirit was willing but his will was not spirited when things went on that ought not to have gone on he generally managed to avoid seeing them and the things continued to go on altogether unless gethryns rule should act as a tonic leicesters was in a bad way  the powers that be however were relying on gethryn to effect some improvement he was in the sixth the first fifteen and the first eleven also a backbone was included in his anatomy and if he made up his mind to a thing that thing generally happened  the rev james beckett the headmaster of beckford had formed a very fair estimate of gethryns capabilities and at the moment when marriott was drawing the field for the missing one that worthy was sitting in the headmasters study with a cup in his right hand and a muffin halfeaten in his left drinking in tea and wisdom simultaneously the head was doing most of the talking he had led up to the subject skilfully and once reached he did not leave it the text of his discourse was the degeneracy of leicesters  now you know gethrynanother muffin help yourself you know reynoldswell he was a capital boy in his way capital and im sure we shall all miss him very muchbut he was not a good head of a house he was weak much too weak too easygoing you must avoid that gethryn reynolds and much more in the same vein gethryn left the room half an hour later full of muffins and good resolutions he met marriott at the fivescourts  where have you been to asked marriott ive been looking for you all over the shop  i and my friend the headmaster said gethryn have been having a quiet pot of tea between us  really was he affable  distinctly affable  you know said marriott confidentially he asked me in but i told him it wasnt good enough i said that if he would consent to make his tea with water that wasnt two degrees below lukewarm and bring on his muffins cooked instead of raw and supply some butter to eat with them i might look him up now and then otherwise it couldnt be done at the price but what did he want you for really  he was ragging me about the house quite right too you know theres no doubt about it leicesters does want bucking up  were going to get the cricket cup said marriott for the defence  we may if it wasnt for the houses in between school house and jephsons especially and anyhow thats not what i meant the games are all right its  the moral jenesaisquoi so to speak said marriott thatll be all right wait till we get at em what i want you to turn your great brain to now is this letter  he produced a letter from his pocket dont you bar chaps who show you their letters he said this was written by an aunt of mine i dont want to inflict the whole lot on you just look at line four you see what she says a boy is coming to mr leicesters house this term whom i particularly wish you to befriend he is the son of a great friend of a friend of mine and is a nice bright little fellow very jolly and full of spirits  that means interpolated gethryn grimly that he is up to the eyes in pure undiluted cheek and will want kicking after every meal and before retiring to rest go on  his name is  well  thats the point at this point the manuscript becomes absolutely illegible i have conjectured percy for the first name it may be richard but ill plunge on percy its the surname that stumps me personally i think its maccow though i trust it isnt for the kids sake i showed the letter to my brother the one whos at oxford he swore it was watson but on being pressed hedged with sandys you may as well contribute your little bit what do you make of it  gethryn scrutinized the document with care  she begins with a d you can see that  well  next letter a or u i see of course its duncan  think so said marriott doubtfully well lets go and ask the matron if she knows anything about him  miss jones he said when they had reached the house have you on your list of new boys a sportsman of the name of maccow or watson i am also prepared to accept sandys or duncan the christian name is either richard or percy there that gives you a fairly wide field to choose from  theres a p v wilson on the list said the matron after an inspection of that document  that must be the man said marriott thanks very much i suppose he hasnt arrived yet  no not yet you two are the only ones so far  oh well i suppose i shall have to see him when he does come ill come down for him later on  they strolled out on to the field again  in re the proposed buckingup of the house said marriott itll be rather a big job  rather i should think so we ought to have a most fearfully sporting time its got to be done the old man talked to me like several fathers  what did he say  oh heaps of things  i know did he mention amongst other things that reynolds was the worst idiot on the face of this socalled world  something of the sort  so i should think the late reynolds was a perfect specimen of the gelatinebackboned worm thats not my own but its the only description of him that really suits monk and danvers and the mob in general used to do what they liked with him talking of monk when you embark on your tour of moral agitation i should advise you to start with him  yes and danvers there isnt much to choose between them its a pity theyre both such good bats when you see a chap putting them through the slips like monk does you cant help thinking there must be something in him  so there is said marriott and its all bad i bar the man hes slimy its the only word for him and he uses scent by the gallon thank goodness this is his last term  is it really i never heard that  yes he and danvers are both leaving monks going to heidelberg to study german and danvers is going into his paters business in the city i got that from waterford  waterford is another beast said gethryn thoughtfully i suppose hes not leaving by any chance  not that i know of but hell be nothing without monk and danvers hes simply a sort of bottlewasher to the firm when they go hell collapse lets be strolling towards the house now shall we hullo our only reece hullo reece  hullo said the new arrival reece was a weird silent individual whom everybody in the school knew up to a certain point but very few beyond that point his manner was exactly the same when talking to the smallest fag as when addressing the headmaster he rather gave one the impression that he was thinking of something a fortnight ahead or trying to solve a chess problem without the aid of the board in appearance he was on the short side and thin he was in the sixth and a conscientious worker indeed he was only saved from being considered a swot to use the vernacular by the fact that from childhoods earliest hour he had been in the habit of keeping wicket like an angel to a good wicketkeeper much may be forgiven  he handed gethryn an envelope  letter bishop he said gethryn was commonly known as the bishop owing to a certain sermon preached in the college chapel some five years before in aid of the church missionary society in which the preacher had alluded at frequent intervals to another gethryn a bishop who it appeared had a see and did much excellent work among the heathen at the back of beyond gethryns friends and acquaintances who had been alternating between gingergethryns hair being inclined to rednessand sneg a name which utterly baffles the philologist had welcomed the new name warmly and it had stuck ever since and after all there are considerably worse names by which one might be called  what the dickens he said as he finished reading the letter  tell us the worst said marriott you must read it out now out of common decency after rousing our expectations like that  all right it isnt private its from an aunt of mine  seems to be a perfect glut of aunts said marriott what views has your representative got to air is she springing any jolly little fellow full of spirits on this happy community  no its not that its only an uncle of mine whos coming down here hes coming tomorrow and im to meet him the uncanny part of it is that ive never heard of him before in my life  that reminds me of a story i heard began reece slowly reeces observations were not frequent but when they came did so for the most part in anecdotal shape somebody was constantly doing something which reminded him of something he had heard somewhere from somebody the unfortunate part of it was that he exuded these reminiscences at such a leisurely rate of speed that he was rarely known to succeed in finishing any of them he resembled those serial stories which appear in papers destined at a moderate price to fill an obvious void and which break off abruptly at the third chapter owing to the premature decease of the said periodicals on this occasion marriott cut in with a few sage remarks on the subject of uncles as a class uncles he said are tricky you never know where youve got em you think theyre going to come out strong with a sovereign and they make it a shilling without a blush an uncle of mine once gave me a threepenny bit if it hadnt been that i didnt wish to hurt his feelings i should have flung it at his feet also i particularly wanted threepence at the moment is your uncle likely to do his duty bishop  i tell you i dont know the man never heard of him i thought i knew every uncle on the list but i cant place this one however i suppose i shall have to meet him  rather said marriott as they went into the house we should always strive to be kind even to the very humblest on the off chance you know the unknown may have struck it rich in sheep or something out in australia most uncles come from australia or he may be the boss of some trust and wallowing in dollars he may be anything lets go and brew bishop come on reece  i dont mind watching you two chaps eat said gethryn but i cant join in myself i have assimilated three pounds odd of the headmagisterial muffins already this afternoon dont mind me though  they went upstairs to marriotts study which was also gethryns two in a study was the rule at beckford though there were recluses who lived alone and seemed to enjoy it  when the festive board had ceased to groan and the cake which marriotts mother had expected to last a fortnight had been reduced to a mere wreck of its former self the thought of his aunts friends friends son returned to marriott and he went down to investigate returning shortly afterwards unaccompanied but evidently full of news  well said gethryn hasnt he come  a little said marriott just a little i went down to the fags room and when i opened the door i noticed a certain weird stillness in the atmosphere there is usually a row going on that you could cut with a knife i looked about the room was apparently empty then i observed a quaint object on the horizon do you know one skinner by any chance  my dear chap said gethryn skinner was a sort of juvenile professor moriarty a napoleon of crime he reeked of crime he revelled in his wicked deeds if a dormitoryprefect was kept awake at night by some diabolically ingenious contrivance for combining the minimum of risk with the maximum of noise then it was skinner who had engineered the thing again did a master playing nervously forward on a bad pitch at the nets to gosling the school fast bowler receive the ball gaspingly in the small ribs and look round to see whose was that raucous laugh which had greeted the performance he would observe a couple of yards away skinner deep in conversation with some friend of equally villainous aspect in short in a word the only adequate word he was skinner  well said reece  skinner proceeded marriott was seated in a chair bleeding freely into a rather dirty pockethandkerchief his usual genial smile was hampered by a cut lip and his right eye was blacked in the most graceful and pleasing manner i made tender inquiries but could get nothing from him except grunts so i departed and just outside the door i met young lee and got the facts out of him it appears that p v wilson my aunts friends friends son entered the fags room at fourfifteen at fourfifteenandahalf punctually skinner was observed to be trying to rag him apparently the great percy has no sense of humour for at fourseventeen he got tired of it and hit skinner crisply in the right eyeball blacking the same as per illustration the subsequent fight raged gorily for five minutes odd and then wilson who seems to be a professional pugilist in disguise landed what my informant describes as three corkers on his opponents proboscis skinners reply was to sit down heavily on the floor and give him to understand that the fight was over and that for the next day or two his face would be closed for alterations and repairs wilson thereupon harangued the company in wellchosen terms tried to get skinner to shake hands but failed and finally took the entire crew out to the shop where they made pigs of themselves at his expense i have spoken  and thats the kid youve got to look after said reece after a pause  yes said marriott what i maintain is that i require a kid built on those lines to look after me but you ought to go down and see skinners eye sometime its a beautiful bit of work     2  introduces an unusual uncle   on the following day at nine oclock the term formally began there is nothing of black monday about the first day of term at a public school black monday is essentially a private school institution  at beckford the first day of every term was a half holiday during the morning a feeble pretence of work was kept up but after lunch the school was free to do as it pleased and to go where it liked the nets were put up for the first time and the school professional emerged at last from his winter retirement with his coom right out to em sir right forward which had helped so many beckford cricketers to do their duty by the school in the field there was one net for the elect the remnants of last years eleven and the probables for this season and half a dozen more for lesser lights  at the first net norris was batting to the bowling of gosling a long thin day boy gethryn and the professionalas useful a trio as any school batsman could wish for norris was captain of the team this year a sound stylish bat with a stroke after the manner of tyldesley between cover and midoff which used to make miles the professional almost weep with joy but today he had evidently not quite got into form twice in successive balls gosling knocked his leg stump out of the ground with yorkers and the ball after that gethryn upset his middle with a beauty  hattrick norris shouted gosling  cant see em a bit today bowled bishop  a second teaser from gethryn had almost got through his defence the bishop was undoubtedly a fine bowler without being quite so fast as gosling he nevertheless contrived to work up a very considerable speed when he wished to and there was always something in every ball he bowled which made it necessary for the batsman to watch it all the way in matches against other schools it was generally gosling who took the wickets the batsmen were bothered by his pace but when the mcc or the incogniti came down bringing seasoned county men who knew what fast bowling really was and rather preferred it on the whole to slow then gethryn was called upon  most beckfordians who did not play cricket on the first day of term went on the river a few rode bicycles or strolled out into the country in couples but the majority amongst whom on this occasion was marriott sallied to the water and hired boats marriott was one of the six old cricket coloursthe others were norris gosling gethryn reece and pringle of the school housewho formed the foundation of this years eleven he was not an ornamental bat but stood quite alone in the matter of tall hitting twenty minutes of marriott when in form would often completely alter the course of a match he had been given his colours in the previous year for making exactly a hundred in sixtyone minutes against the authentics when the rest of the team had contributed ninetyeight the authentics made a hundred and eightyfour so that the school just won and the story of how there were five men out in the deep for him and how he put the slow bowler over their heads and over the ropes eight times in three overs had passed into a school legend  but today other things than cricket occupied his attention he had run wilson to earth and was engaged in making his acquaintance according to instructions received  are you wilson he asked pv wilson  wilson confirmed the charge  my names marriott does that convey any significance to your young mind  oh yes my mater knows somebody who knows your aunt  it is a true bill  and she said you would look after me i know you wont have time of course  i expect i shall have time to give you all the looking after youll require it wont be much from all ive heard was all that true about you and young skinner  wilson grinned  i did have a bit of a row with a chap called skinner he admitted  so skinner seems to think said marriott what was it all about  oh he made an ass of himself said wilson vaguely  marriott nodded  he would i know the man i shouldnt think youd have much trouble with skinner in the future by the way ive got you for a fag this term you dont have to do much in the summer just rot around you know and go to the shop for biscuits and things thats all and within limits of course you get the run of the study  i see said wilson gratefully the prospect was pleasant  oh yes and its your privilege to pipeclay my cricket boots occasionally before first matches youll like that can you steer a boat  i dont think so i never tried  its easy enough ill tell you what to do anyhow you probably wont steer any worse than i row so lets go and get a boat out and ill try and think of a few more words of wisdom for your benefit  at the nets norris had finished his innings and pringle was batting in his stead gethryn had given up his ball to baynes who bowled slow legbreaks and was the most probable of the probables abovementioned he went to where norris was taking off his pads and began to talk to him norris was the head of jephsons house and he and the bishop were very good friends in a casual sort of way if they did not see one another for a couple of days neither of them broke his heart whenever on the other hand they did meet they were always glad and always had plenty to talk about most school friendships are of that description  you were sending down some rather hot stuff said norris as gethryn sat down beside him and began to inspect pringles performance with a critical eye  i did feel rather fit said he but i dont think half those that got you would have taken wickets in a match you arent in form yet  i tell you what it is bishop said norris i believe im going to be a rank failure this season being captain does put one off  dont be an idiot man how can you possibly tell after one days play at the nets  i dont know i feel so beastly anxious somehow i feel as if i was personally responsible for every match lost it was all right last year when john brown was captain good old john do you remember his running you out in the charchester match  dont said gethryn pathetically the only time ive ever felt as if i really was going to make that century by jove see that drive pringle seems all right  yes you know hell simply walk into his blue when he goes up to the varsity what do you think of baynes  ought to be rather useful on his wicket jephson thinks hes good  mr jephson looked after the school cricket  yes i believe he rather fancies him said norris says he ought to do some big things if we get any rain hullo pringle are you coming out youd better go in then bishop  all right thanks oh by jove though i forgot i cant ive got to go down to the station to meet an uncle of mine  whats he coming up today for why didnt he wait till wed got a match of sorts on  i dont know the mans probably a lunatic anyhow i shall have to go and meet him and i shall just do it comfortably if i go and change now  oh right you are sammy do you want a knock  samuel wilberforce gosling known to his friends and admirers as sammy replied that he did not all he wanted now he said was a drink or possibly two drinks and a jolly good rest in the shade somewhere gosling was one of those rare individuals who cultivate bowling at the expense of batting a habit the reverse of what usually obtains in schools  norris admitted the justice of his claims and sent in a second eleven man baker a member of his own house in pringles place pringle and gosling adjourned to the school shop for refreshment  gethryn walked with them as far as the gate which opened on to the road where most of the boarding houses stood and then branched off in the direction of leicesters to change into everyday costume took him a quarter of an hour at the end of which period he left the house and began to walk down the road in the direction of the station  it was an hours easy walking between horton the nearest station to beckford and the college gethryn who was rather tired after his exertions at the nets took it very easily and when he arrived at his destination the church clock was striking four  is the threefiftysix in yet he asked of the solitary porter who ministered to the needs of the traveller at horton station  just acoming in now zur said the porter adding in a sort of inspired frenzy orton orton stertion orton and ringing a bell with immense enthusiasm and vigour  gethryn strolled to the gate where the stationmasters son stood at the receipt of custom to collect the tickets his uncle was to arrive by this train and if he did so arrive must of necessity pass this way before leaving the platform the train panted in pulled up whistled and puffed out again leaving three people behind it one of these was a woman of sixty approximately the second a small girl of ten the third a young gentleman in a top hat and etons who carried a bag and looked as if he had seen the hollowness of things for his face wore a bored supercilious look his uncle had evidently not arrived unless he had come disguised as an old woman an act of which gethryn refused to believe him capable  he enquired as to the next train that was expected to arrive from london the stationmasters son was not sure but would ask the porter whose name it appeared was johnny johnny gave the correct answer without an effort seventhirty it was sir except on saturdays when it was eight oclock  thanks said the bishop dash the man he might at least have wired  he registered a silent wish concerning the uncle who had brought him a long three miles out of his way with nothing to show at the end of it and was just turning to leave the station when the tophatted small boy who had been hovering round the group during the conversation addressed winged words to him these were the winged words  i say are you looking for somebody the bishop stared at him as a naturalist stares at a novel species of insect  yes he said why  is your name gethryn  this affair thought the bishop was beginning to assume an uncanny aspect  how the dickens did you know that he said  oh then you are gethryn thats all right i was told you were going to be here to meet this train glad to make your acquaintance my names farnie im your uncle you know  my what gurgled the bishop  your uncle un un clekul uncle fact i assure you     3  the uncle makes himself at home   but dash it said gethryn when he had finished gasping that must be rot  not a bit said the selfpossessed youth your mater was my elder sister youll find it works out all right look here a the daughter of b and c marries no look here i was born when you were four see  then the demoralized bishop remembered he had heard of his juvenile uncle but the tales had made little impression upon him till now they had not crossed one anothers tracks  oh all right said he ill take your word for it you seem to have been getting up the subject  yes thought you might want to know about it i say how far is it to beckford and how do you get there  up till now gethryn had scarcely realized that his uncle was actually coming to the school for good these words brought the fact home to him  oh lord he said are you coming to beckford  the thought of having his footsteps perpetually dogged by an uncle four years younger than himself and manifestly a youth with a fine taste in cheek was not pleasant  of course said his uncle what did you think i was going to do camp out on the platform  what house are you in  leicesters  the worst had happened the bitter cup was full the iron neatly inserted in gethryns soul in his most pessimistic moments he had never looked forward to the coming term so gloomily as he did now his uncle noted his lack of enthusiasm and attributed it to anxiety on behalf of himself  whats up he asked isnt leicesters all right is leicester a beast  no hes a perfectly decent sort of man its a good enough house at least it will be this term i was only thinking of something  i see well how do you get to the place  walk it isnt far  how far  three miles  the porter said four  it may be four i never measured it  well how the dickens do you think im going to walk four miles with luggage i wish you wouldnt rot  and before gethryn could quite realize that he the head of leicesters the secondbest bowler in the school and the best centre threequarter the school had had for four seasons had been requested in a peremptory manner by a youth of fourteen a mere kid not to rot the offender was talking to a cabman out of the reach of retaliation gethryn became more convinced every minute that this was no ordinary kid  this man says observed farnie returning to gethryn that hell drive me up to the college for seven bob as its a short four miles and ive only got two boxes it seems to me that hes doing himself fairly well what do you think  nobody ever gives more than four bob said gethryn  i told you so said farnie to the cabman you are a bally swindler he added admiringly  look ere began the cabman in a pained voice  oh dry up said farnie want a lift gethryn  the words were spoken not so much as from equal to equal as in a tone of airy patronage which made the bishops blood boil but as he intended to instil a few words of wisdom into his uncles mind he did not refuse the offer  the cabman apparently accepting the situation as one of those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune which no man can hope to escape settled down on the box clicked up his horse and drove on towards the college  what sort of a hole is beckford asked farnie after the silence had lasted some time  i find it good enough personally said gethryn if youd let us know earlier that you were coming wed have had the place done up a bit for you  this of course was feeble distinctly feeble but the bishop was not feeling himself the essay in sarcasm left the wouldbe victim entirely uncrushed he should have shrunk and withered up or at the least have blushed but he did nothing of the sort he merely smiled in his supercilious way until the bishop felt very much inclined to spring upon him and throw him out of the cab  there was another pause  farnie began gethryn at last  um  doesnt it strike you that for a kid like you youve got a good deal of edge on asked gethryn  farnie effected a masterly counterstroke he pretended not to be able to hear he was sorry but would the bishop mind repeating his remark  eh what he said very sorry but this cabs making such a row i say cabby why dont you sign the pledge and save your money up to buy a new cab eh oh sorry i wasnt listening now inasmuch as the whole virtue of the wretchedlittlekidlikeyou argument lies in the crisp despatch with which it is delivered gethryn began to find on repeating his observation for the third time that there was not quite so much in it as he had thought he prudently elected to change his style of attack  it doesnt matter he said wearily as farnie opened his mouth to demand a fourth encore it wasnt anything important now look here i just want to give you a few tips about what to do when you get to the coll to start with youll have to take off that white tie youve got on black and dark blue are the only sorts allowed here  how about yours then gethryn was wearing a somewhat sweet thing in brown and yellow  mine happens to be a first eleven tie  oh well as a matter of fact you know i was going to take off my tie i always do especially at night its a sort of habit ive got into  not quite so much of your beastly cheek please said gethryn  rightho said farnie cheerfully and silence broken only by the shrieking of the cab wheels brooded once more over the cab then gethryn feeling that perhaps it would be a shame to jump too severely on a new boy on his first day at a large public school began to think of something conciliatory to say look here he said youll get on all right at beckford i expect youll find leicesters a fairly decent sort of house anyhow you neednt be afraid youll get bullied theres none of that sort of thing at school nowadays  really  yes and theres another thing i ought to warn you about have you brought much money with you  bout fourteen pounds i fancy said farnie carelessly  fourteen what said the amazed bishop pounds  or sovereigns said farnie each worth twenty shillings you know  for a moment gethryns only feeling was one of unmixed envy previously he had considered himself passing rich on thirty shillings a term he had heard legends of course of individuals who come to school bursting with bullion but never before had he set eyes upon such an one but after a time it began to dawn upon him that for a new boy at a public school and especially at such a house as leicesters had become under the rule of the late reynolds and his predecessors there might be such a thing as having too much money  how the deuce did you get all that he asked  my pater gave it me hes absolutely cracked on the subject of pocketmoney sometimes he doesnt give me a sou and sometimes hell give me whatever i ask for  but you dont mean to say you had the cheek to ask for fourteen quid  i asked for fifteen got it too ive spent a pound of it i said i wanted to buy a bike you can get a jolly good bike for five quid about so you see i scoop ten pounds what  this ingenious if slightly unscrupulous feat gave gethryn an insight into his uncles character which up till now he had lacked he began to see that the moral advice with which he had primed himself would be out of place evidently this youth could take quite good care of himself on his own account still even a budding professor moriarty would be none the worse for being warned against gethryns bete noire monk so the bishop proceeded to deliver that warning  well he said you seem to be able to look out for yourself all right i must say but theres one tip i really can give you when you get to leicesters and a beast with a green complexion and an oily smile comes up and calls you old chaap and wants you to swear eternal friendship tell him its not good enough squash him  thanks said farnie who is this genial merchant  chap called monk youll recognize him by the smell of scent when you find the place smelling like an eaudecologne factory youll know monks somewhere near dont you have anything to do with him  you seem to dislike the gentleman  i bar the man but that isnt why im giving you the tip to steer clear of him there are dozens of chaps i bar who havent an ounce of vice in them and there are one or two chaps who have got tons monks one of them a fellow called danvers is another also a beast of the name of waterford there are some others as well but those are the worst of the lot by the way i forgot to ask have you ever been to school before  yes said farnie in the dreamy voice of one who recalls memories from the misty past i was at harrow before i came here and at wellington before i went to harrow and at clifton before i went to wellington  gethryn gasped  anywhere before you went to clifton he enquired  only private schools  the recollection of the platitudes which he had been delivering under the impression that he was talking to an entirely raw beginner made gethryn feel slightly uncomfortable what must this wanderer who had seen men and cities have thought of his harangue  why did you leave harrow asked he  sacked was the laconic reply  have you ever asks a modern philosopher gone upstairs in the dark and trodden on the last step when it wasnt there that sensation and the one gethryn felt at this unexpected revelation were identical and the worst of it was that he felt the keenest desire to know why harrow had seen fit to dispense with the presence of his uncle  why he began i mean he went on hurriedly why did you leave wellington  sacked said farnie again with the monotonous persistence of a solomon eagle  gethryn felt at this juncture much as the unfortunate gentleman in punch must have felt when having finished a humorous story the point of which turned upon squinting and red noses he suddenly discovered that his host enjoyed both those peculiarities he struggled manfully with his feelings for a time tact urged him to discontinue his investigations and talk about the weather curiosity insisted upon knowing further details just as the struggle was at its height farnie came unexpectedly to the rescue  it may interest you he said to know that i was not sacked from clifton  gethryn with some difficulty refrained from thanking him for the information  i never stop at a school long said farnie if i dont get sacked my father takes me away after a couple of terms i went to four private schools before i started on the public schools my pater took me away from the first two because he thought the drains were bad the third because they wouldnt teach me shorthand and the fourth because he didnt like the headmasters face i worked off those schools in a year and a half having finished this piece of autobiography he relapsed into silence leaving gethryn to recollect various tales he had heard of his grandfathers eccentricity the silence lasted until the college was reached when the matron took charge of farnie and gethryn went off to tell marriott of these strange happenings  marriott was amused nor did he attempt to conceal the fact when he had finished laughing which was not for some time he favoured the bishop with a very sound piece of advice if i were you he said i should try and hush this affair up its all fearfully funny but i think youd enjoy life more if nobody knew this kid was your uncle to see the head of the house going about with a juvenile uncle in his wake might amuse the chaps rather and you might find it harder to keep order i wont let it out and nobody else knows apparently go and square the kid oh i say though whats his name if its gethryn youre done unless you like to swear hes a cousin  no his names farnie thank goodness  thats all right then go and talk to him  gethryn went to the junior study farnie was holding forth to a knot of fags at one end of the room his audience appeared to be amused at something  i say farnie said the bishop half a second  farnie came out and gethryn proceeded to inform him that all things considered and proud as he was of the relationship it was not absolutely essential that he should tell everybody that he was his uncle in fact it would be rather better on the whole if he did not did he follow  farnie begged to observe that he did follow but that to his sorrow the warning came too late  im very sorry he said i hadnt the least idea you wanted the thing kept dark how was i to know ive just been telling it to some of the chaps in there awfully decent chaps they seemed to think it rather funny anyhow im not ashamed of the relationship not yet at any rate  for a moment gethryn seemed about to speak he looked fixedly at his uncle as he stood framed in the doorway a cheerful column of cool calm concentrated cheek then as if realizing that no words that he knew could do justice to the situation he raised his foot in silence and booted his own flesh and blood with marked emphasis after which ceremony he went still without a word upstairs again  as for farnie he returned to the junior dayroom whistling down south in a soft but cheerful key and solidified his growing popularity with doles of food from a hamper which he had brought with him finally on retiring to bed and being pressed by the rest of his dormitory for a story he embarked upon the history of a certain pollock and an individual referred to throughout as the porroh man the former of whom caused the latter to be decapitated and was ever afterwards haunted by his head which appeared to him all day and every day not excepting sundays and bank holidays in an upsidedown position and wearing a horrible grin in the end pollock very sensibly committed suicide with ghastly details and the dormitory thanked farnie in a subdued and chastened manner and tried with small success to go to sleep in short farnies first evening at beckford had been quite a triumph     4  pringle makes a sporting offer   estimating it roughly it takes a new boy at a public school about a week to find his legs and shed his skin of newness the period is of course longer in the case of some and shorter in the case of others both farnie and wilson had made themselves at home immediately in the case of the latter directly the skinner episode had been noised abroad and it was discovered in addition that he was a promising bat public opinion recognized that here was a youth out of the common run of new boys and the lower fourththe form in which he had been placed on arrivaltook him to its bosom as an equal farnies case was exceptional a career at harrow clifton and wellington however short and abruptly terminated gives one some sort of grip on the way public school life is conducted at an early date moreover he gave signs of what almost amounted to genius in the indoor game department now success in the field is a good thing and undoubtedly makes for popularity but if you desire to command the respect and admiration of your fellowbeings to a degree stretched almost to the point of idolatry make yourself proficient in the art of whiling away the hours of afternoon school before farnies arrival his form the upper fourth with the best intentions in the world had not been skilful raggers they had ragged in an intermittent onceaweek sort of way when however he came on the scene he introduced a welcome element of science into the sport as witness the following mr strudwick the regular master of the form happened on one occasion to be away for a couple of days and a stopgap was put in in his place the name of the stopgap was mr somerville smith he and farnie exchanged an unspoken declaration of war almost immediately the first round went in mr smiths favour he contrived to catch farnie in the act of performing some ingenious breach of the peace and it being a wednesday and a halfholiday sent him into extra lesson on the following morning more by design than accident farnie upset an inkpot mr smith observed icily that unless the stain was wiped away before the beginning of afternoon school there would be trouble farnie observed to himself that there would be trouble in any case for he had hit upon the central idea for the most colossal rag that in his opinion ever was after morning school he gathered the form around him and disclosed his idea the floor of the formroom he pointed out was some dozen inches below the level of the door would it not be a pleasant and profitable notion he asked to flood the floor with water to the depth of those dozen inches on the wall outside the formroom hung a row of buckets placed there in case of fire and the lavatory was not too far off for practical purposes mr smith had bidden him wash the floor it was obviously his duty to do so the form thought so too for a solid hour thirty weary but enthusiastic reprobates laboured without ceasing and by the time the bell rang all was prepared the floor was one still silent pool two caps and a few notebooks floated sluggishly on the surface relieving the picture of any tendency to monotony the form crept silently to their places along the desks as mr smiths footsteps were heard approaching they began to beat vigorously upon the desks with the result that mr smith quickening his pace dashed into the formroom at a hard gallop the immediate results were absolutely satisfactory and if matters subsequently when mr smith having changed his clothes returned with the headmaster did get somewhat warm for the thirty criminals they had the satisfying feeling that their duty had been done and a hearty and unanimous vote of thanks was passed to farnie from which it will be seen that master reginald farnie was managing to extract more or less enjoyment out of his life at beckford  another person who was enjoying life was pringle of the school house the keynote of pringles character was superiority at an early period of his lifehe was still unable to speak at the timehis grandmother had died this is probably the sole reason why he had never taught that relative to suck eggs had she lived her education in that direction must have been taken in hand baffled in this pringle had turned his attention to the rest of the human race he had a rooted conviction that he did everything a shade better than anybody else this belief did not make him arrogant at all and certainly not offensive for he was exceedingly popular in the school but still there were people who thought that he might occasionally draw the line somewhere watson the groundman for example thought so when pringle primed him with advice on the subject of preparing a wicket and langdale who had been captain of the team five years before had thought so most decidedly and had not hesitated to say so when pringle then in his first term and aged twelve had stood behind the first eleven net and requested him peremptorily to keep em down sir keep em down indeed the great man had very nearly had a fit on that occasion and was wont afterwards to attribute to the effects of the shock so received a sequence of three ducks which befell him in the next three matches  in short in every department of life pringles advice was always and generally unsought at everybodys disposal to round the position off neatly it would be necessary to picture him as a total failure in the practical side of all the subjects in which he was so brilliant a theorist strangely enough however this was not the case there were few better bats in the school than pringle norris on his day was more stylish and marriott not infrequently made more runs but for consistency pringle was unrivalled  that was partly the reason why at this time he was feeling pleased with life the school had played three matches up to date and had won them all in the first an oxford college team containing several old beckfordians had been met and routed pringle contributing thirtyone to a total of three hundred odd but norris had made a century which had rather diverted the public eye from this performance then the school had played the emeriti and had won again quite comfortably this time his score had been fortyone useful but still not phenomenal then in the third match versus charchester one of the big school matches of the season he had found himself he ran up a hundred and twentythree without a chance and felt that life had little more to offer that had been only a week ago and the glow of satisfaction was still pleasantly warm  it was while he was gloating silently in his study over the bat with which a grateful field sports committee had presented him as a reward for this feat that he became aware that lorimer his study companion appeared to be in an entirely different frame of mind to his own lorimer was in the upper fifth pringle in the remove lorimer sat at the study table gnawing a pen in a feverish manner that told of an overwrought soul twice he uttered sounds that were obviously sounds of anguish half groans and half grunts pringle laid down his bat and decided to investigate  whats up he asked  this bally poem thing said lorimer  poem oh ah i know pringle had been in the upper fifth himself a year before and he remembered that every summer term there descended upon that form a bad time in the shape of a poetry prize a certain indian potentate the rajah of seltzerpore had paid a visit to the school some years back and had left behind him on his departure certain monies in the local bank which were to be devoted to providing the upper fifth with an annual prize for the best poem on a subject to be selected by the headmaster entrance was compulsory the wily authorities knew very well that if it had not been the entries for the prize would have been somewhat small why the upper fifth were so favoured in preference to the sixth or remove is doubtful possibly it was felt that what with the jones history the smith latin verse the robinson latin prose and the de vere crespigny greek verse and other trophies open only to members of the remove and sixth those two forms had enough to keep them occupied as it was at any rate to the upper fifth the prize was given and every year three weeks after the commencement of the summer term the bad time arrived  cant you get on asked pringle  no  whats the subject  death of dido  something to be got out of that surely  wish youd tell me what  heap of things  such as what cant see anything myself i call it perfectly indecent dragging the good lady out of her wellearned tomb at this time of day ive looked her up in the dic of antiquities and it appears that she committed suicide some years ago bodysnatching i call it what do i want to know about her  whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba murmured pringle  hecuba said lorimer looking puzzled whats hecuba got to do with it  i was only quoting said pringle with gentle superiority  well i wish instead of quoting rot youd devote your energies to helping me with these beastly verses how on earth shall i begin  you might adapt my quotation whats dido got to do with me or i to do with dido i rather like that jam it down then you go on in a sort of ragtime metre in the coon drummajor style besides you see the beauty of it is that you administer a wholesome snub to the examiner right away makes him sit up at once put it down  lorimer bit off another quarter of an inch of his pen you neednt be an ass he said shortly  my dear chap said pringle enjoying himself immensely what on earth is the good of my offering you suggestions if you wont take them  lorimer said nothing he bit off another mouthful of penholder  well anyway resumed pringle i cant see why youre so keen on the business put down anything the beaks never make a fuss about these special exams  it isnt the beaks i care about said lorimer in an injured tone of voice as if someone had been insinuating that he had committed some crime only my people are rather keen on my doing well in this exam  why this exam particularly  oh i dont know my grandfather or someone was a bit of a pro at verse in his day i believe and they think it ought to run in the family  pringle examined the situation in all its aspects cant you get along he enquired at length  not an inch  pity i wish we could swop places  so do i for some things to start with i shouldnt mind having made that century of yours against charchester  pringle beamed the least hint that his fellowman was taking him at his own valuation always made him happy  thanks he said no but what i meant was that i wished i was in for this poetry prize i bet i could turn out a rattling good screed why last year i almost got the prize i sent in fearfully hot stuff  think so said lorimer doubtfully in answer to the rattling good screed passage of pringles speech well i wish youd have a shot you might as well  what really how about the prize  oh hang the prize well have to chance that  i thought you were keen on getting it  oh no second or third will do me all right and satisfy my people they only want to know for certain that ive got the poetic afflatus all right will you take it on  all right  thanks awfully  i say lorimer said pringle after a pause  yes  are your people coming down for the obs match  the old beckfordians match was the great function of the beckford cricket season the headmaster gave a gardenparty the school band played the school choir sang and sisters cousins aunts and parents flocked to the school in platoons  yes i think so said lorimer why  is your sister coming  oh i dont know a brothers utter lack of interest in his sisters actions is a weird and wonderful thing for an outsider to behold  well look here i wish youd get her to come we could give them tea in here and have rather a good time dont you think  all right ill make her come look here pringle i believe youre rather gone on mabel  this was lorimers vulgar way  dont be an ass said pringle with a laugh which should have been careless but was in reality merely feeble shes quite a kid  miss mabel lorimers exact age was fifteen she had brown hair blue eyes and a smile which disclosed to view a dimple there are worse things than a dimple distinctly so indeed when ladies of fifteen possess dimples mere man becomes but as a piece of damp blottingpaper pringle was seventeen and a half and consequently too old to take note of such frivolous attributes but all the same he had a sort of vague sketchy impression that it would be pleasanter to run up a lively century against the obs with miss lorimer as a spectator than in her absence he felt pleased that she was coming  i say about this poem said lorimer dismissing a subject which manifestly bored him and returning to one which was of vital interest youre sure you can write fairly decent stuff its no good sending in stuff thatll turn the examiners hair grey can you turn out something really decent  pringle said nothing he smiled gently as who should observe i and shakespeare     5  farnie gets into trouble   it was perhaps only natural that farnie having been warned so strongly of the inadvisability of having anything to do with monk should for that very reason be attracted to him nobody ever wants to do anything except what they are not allowed to do otherwise there is no explaining the friendship that arose between them jack monk was not an attractive individual he had a slack mouth and a shifty eye and his complexion was the sort which friends would have described as olive enemies with more truth as dirty green these defects would have mattered little of course in themselves theres many a bilious countenance so to speak covers a warm heart with monk however appearances were not deceptive he looked a bad lot and he was one  it was on the second morning of term that the acquaintanceship began monk was coming downstairs from his study with danvers and farnie was leaving the fags dayroom  see that kid said danvers thats the chap i was telling you about gethryns uncle you know  not really lets cultivate him i say old chap dont walk so fast farnie rightly concluding that the remark was addressed to him turned and waited and the three strolled over to the school buildings together  they would have made an interesting study for the observer of human nature the two seniors fancying that they had to deal with a small boy just arrived at his first school and in the grip of that strange lost feeling which attacks the best of new boys for a day or so after their arrival and farnie on the other hand watching every move as perfectly composed and at home as a youth should be with the experience of three public schools to back him up  when they arrived at the school gates monk and danvers turned to go in the direction of their formroom the remove leaving farnie at the door of the upper fourth at this point a small comedy took place monk after feeling hastily in his pockets requested danvers to lend him five shillings until next saturday danvers knew this request of old and he knew the answer that was expected of him by replying that he was sorry but he had not got the money he gave farnie who was still standing at the door his cue to offer to supply the deficiency most new boysthey had grasped this fact from experiencewould have felt it an honour to oblige a senior with a small loan as farnie made no signs of doing what was expected of him monk was obliged to resort to the somewhat cruder course of applying for the loan in person he applied farnie with the utmost willingness brought to light a handful of money mostly gold monks eye gleamed approval and he stretched forth an itching palm danvers began to think that it would be rash to let a chance like this slip ordinarily the tacit agreement between the pair was that only one should borrow at a time lest confidence should be destroyed in the victim but here was surely an exception a special case with a young gentleman so obviously a man of coin as farnie the rule might well be broken for once  while youre about it farnie old man he said carelessly you might let me have a bob or two if you dont mind five bobll see me through to saturday all right  do you mean tomorrow enquired farnie looking up from his heap of gold  no saturday week let you have it back by then at the latest make a point of it  how would a quid do  ripping said danvers ecstatically  same here assented monk  then thats all right said farnie briskly i thought perhaps you mightnt have had enough youve got a quid i know monk because i saw you haul one out at breakfast and danvers has got one too because he offered to toss you for it in the study afterwards and besides i couldnt lend you anything in any case because ive only got about fourteen quid myself  with which parting shot he retired wrapped in gentle thought into his formroom and from the noise which ensued immediately upon his arrival the shrewd listener would have deduced quite correctly that he had organized and taken the leading part in a general rag  monk and danvers proceeded upon their way  you got rather left there old chap said monk at length  i like that replied the outraged danvers how about you then it seemed to me you got rather left too  monk compromised  well anyhow he said we shant get much out of that kid  little beast said danvers complainingly and they went on into their formroom in silence  i saw your youngerrelative in earnest conversation with friend monk this morning said marriott later on in the day to gethryn i thought you were going to give him the tip in that direction  so i did said the bishop wearily but i cant always be looking after the little brute he only does it out of sheer cussedness because ive told him not to it stands to reason that he cant like monk  you remind me of the psalmist and the wicked man surname unknown said marriott you cant see the good side of monk  there isnt one  no hes only got two sides a bad side and a worse side which he sticks on on the strength of being fairly good at games i wonder if hes going to get his first this season hes not a bad bat  i dont think he will he is a good bat but there are heaps better in the place i say i think i shall give young farnie the tip once more and let him take it or leave it what do you think  hell leave it said marriott with conviction  nor was he mistaken farnie listened with enthusiasm to his nephews second excursus on the monk topic and though he said nothing was apparently convinced on the following afternoon monk danvers waterford and he hired a boat and went up the river together gethryn and marriott steered by wilson who was rapidly developing into a useful coxswain got an excellent view of them moored under the shade of a willow drinking gingerbeer and apparently on the best of terms with one another and the world in general in a brief but moving speech the bishop finally excommunicated his erring relative for all i care he concluded he can do what he likes in future i shant stop him  no said marriott i dont think you will  for the first month of his school life farnie behaved except in his choice of companions much like an ordinary junior he played cricket moderately well did his share of compulsory fielding at the first eleven net and went for frequent river excursions with monk danvers and the rest of the mob  at first the other juniors of the house were inclined to resent this extending of the right hand of fellowship to owners of studies and second eleven men and attempted to make farnie see the sin and folly of his ways but nature had endowed that youth with a fund of vitriolic repartee when millett one of leicesters juniors evolved some laborious sarcasm on the subject of farnies swell friends farnie in a series of three remarks reduced him figuratively speaking to a small and palpitating spot of grease after that his actions came in for no further or at any rate no outspoken comment  given sixpence a week and no more farnie might have survived an entire term without breaking any serious school rule but when after buying a bicycle from smith of markhams he found himself with eight pounds to his name in solid cash and the means of getting far enough away from the neighbourhood of the school to be able to spend it much as he liked he began to do strange and risky things in his spare time  the great obstacle to illicit enjoyment at beckford was the four oclock rollcall on halfholidays there were other obstacles such as halfholiday games and so forth but these could be avoided by the exercise of a little judgement the penalty for nonappearance at a halfholiday game was a fine of sixpence constant absence was likely in time to lead to a more or less thrilling interview with the captain of cricket but a very occasional attendance was enough to stave off this disaster and as for the sixpence to a man of means like farnie it was a mere nothing it was a bad system and it was a wonder under the circumstances how beckford produced the elevens it did but it was the system and farnie availed himself of it to the full  the obstacle of rollcall he managed also to surmount some reckless and penniless friend was generally willing for a consideration to answer his name for him and so most saturday afternoons would find farnie leaving behind him the flannelled fools at their various wickets and speeding out into the country on his bicycle in the direction of the village of biddlehampton where mine host of the cow and cornflower in addition to other refreshment for man and beast advertised that pingpong and billiards might be played on the premises it was not the former of these games that attracted farnie he was no pinger nor was he a pongster but for billiards he had a decided taste a genuine taste not the pumpedup affectation sometimes displayed by boys of his age considering his age he was a remarkable player later on in life it appeared likely that he would have the choice of three professions open to him namely professional billiard player billiard marker and billiard sharp at each of the three he showed distinct promise he was not lured to the green cloth by monk or danvers indeed if there had been any luring to be done it is probable that he would have done it and not they neither monk nor danvers was in his confidence in the matter billiards is not a cheap amusement by the end of his sixth week farnie was reduced to a single pound a sum which for one of his tastes was practically poverty and just at the moment when he was least able to bear up against it fate dealt him one of its nastiest blows he was playing a fifty up against a friendly but unskilful farmer at the cow and cornflower better look out he said as his opponent effected a somewhat rustic stroke youll be cutting the cloth in a second the farmer grunted missed by inches and retired leaving the red ball in the jaws of the pocket and farnie with three to make to win  it was an absurdly easy stroke and the bishops uncle took it with an absurd amount of conceit and carelessness hardly troubling to aim he struck his ball the cue slid off in one direction the ball rolled sluggishly in another and when the cue had finished its run the smooth green surface of the table was marred by a jagged and unsightly cut there was another young man gone wrong  to say that the farmer laughed would be to express the matter feebly that his young opponent who had been irritating him unspeakably since the beginning of the game with advice and criticism should have done exactly what he had cautioned him the farmer against a moment before struck him as being the finest example of poetic justice he had ever heard of and he signalized his appreciation of the same by nearly dying of apoplexy  the marker expressed an opinion that farnie had been and gone and done it  ere he said inserting a finger in the cut to display its dimensions look ere thisll mean a noo cloth young feller me lad thats wot thisll mean thatll be three pound we will trouble you for if you please  farnie produced his sole remaining sovereign  all ive got he said ill leave my name and address  dont you trouble young feller me lad said the marker who appeared to be a very aggressive and unpleasant sort of character altogether with meaning i know yer name and i knows yer address today fortnight at the very latest if you please you dont want me to ave to go to your master about it now do yer what say no ve well then today fortnight is the time and you remember it  what was left of farnie then rode slowly back to beckford why he went to monk on his return probably he could not have explained himself but he did go and having told his story in full wound up by asking for a loan of two pounds monks first impulse was to refer him back to a previous interview when matters had been the other way about that small affair of the pound on the second morning of the term then there flashed across his mind certain reasons against this move at present farnies attitude towards him was unpleasantly independent he made him understand that he went about with him from choice and that there was to be nothing of the patron and dependant about their alliance if he were to lend him the two pounds now things would alter and to have got a complete hold over master reginald farnie monk would have paid more than two pounds farnie had the intelligence to carry through anything however risky and there were many things which monk would have liked to do but owing to the risks involved shirked doing for himself besides he happened to be in funds just now  well look here old chap he said lets have strict business between friends if youll pay me back four quid at the end of term you shall have the two pounds how does that strike you  it struck farnie as it would have struck most people that if this was monks idea of strict business there were the makings of no ordinary financier in him but to get his two pounds he would have agreed to anything and the end of term seemed a long way off  the awkward part of the billiardplaying episode was that the punishment for it if detected was not expulsion but flogging and farnie resembled the lady in the ingoldsby legends who didnt mind death but who couldnt stand pinching he didnt mind expulsionhe was used to it but he could not stand flogging  thatll be all right he said and the money changed hands     6  and stays there   i say said baker of jephsons excitedly some days later reeling into the study which he shared with norris have you seen the team the mccs bringing down  at nearly every school there is a type of youth who asks this question on the morning of the mcc match norris was engaged in putting the finishing touches to a snowwhite pair of cricket boots  no hullo where did you raise that sporter lets have a look  but baker proposed to conduct this business in person it is ten times more pleasant to administer a series of shocks to a friend than to sit by and watch him administering them to himself he retained the sportsman and began to read out the team  thought middlesex had a match said norris as baker paused dramatically to let the name of a worldfamed professional sink in  no they dont play surrey till monday  well if theyve got an important match like surrey on on monday said norris disgustedly what on earth do they let their best man come down here today for and fag himself out  baker suggested gently that if anybody was going to be fagged out at the end of the day it would in all probability be the beckford bowlers and not a man who as he was careful to point out had run up a century a mere three days ago against yorkshire and who was apparently at that moment at the very top of his form  well said norris he might crock himself or anything rank bad policy i call it anybody else  baker resumed his reading a string of unknowns ended in another celebrity  blackwell said norris not o t blackwell  it says a t but went on baker brightening up again they always get the initials wrong in the papers certain to be o t by the way i suppose you saw that he made eightythree against notts the other day  norris tried to comfort himself by observing that notts couldnt bowl for toffee  last week too said baker he made a hundred and fortysix not out against malvern for the gentlemen of warwickshire they couldnt get him out he concluded with unction in spite of the fact that he himself was playing in the match today and might under the circumstances reasonably look forward to a considerable dose of leatherhunting the task of announcing the bad news to norris appeared to have a most elevating effect on his spirits  thats nothing extra special said norris in answer to the last item of information the malvern wickets like a billiardtable  our wickets arent bad either at this time of year said baker and i heard rumours that they had got a record one ready for this match  it seems to me said norris that what id better do if we want to bat at all today is to win the toss though sammy and the bishop and baynes ought to be able to get any ordinary side out all right  only this isnt an ordinary side its a sort of improved county team  theyve got about four men who might come off but the mcc sometimes have a bit of a tail we ought to have a look in if we win the toss  hope so said baker i doubt it though  at a quarter to eleven the school always went out in a body to inspect the pitch after the wicket had been described by experts in hushed whispers as looking pretty good the bell rang and all who were not playing for the team with the exception of the lucky individual who had obtained for himself the post of scorer strolled back towards the blocks monk had come out with waterford but seeing farnie ahead and walking alone he quitted waterford and attached himself to the genial reginald he wanted to talk business he had not found the speculation of the two pounds a very profitable one he had advanced the money under the impression that farnie by accepting it was practically selling his independence and there were certain matters in which monk was largely interested connected with the breaking of bounds and the purchase of contraband goods which he would have been exceedingly glad to have performed by deputy he had fancied that farnie would have taken over these jobs as part of his debt but he had mistaken his man on the very first occasion when he had attempted to put on the screw farnie had flatly refused to have anything to do with what he proposed he said that he was not monks faga remark which had the merit of being absolutely true  all this combined with a slight sinking of his own funds induced monk to take steps towards recovering the loan  i say farnie old chap  hullo  i say do you remember my lending you two quid some time ago  you dont give me much chance of forgetting it said farnie  monk smiled he could afford to be generous towards such witticisms  i want it back he said  all right youll get it at the end of term  i want it now  why  awfully hard up old chap  you arent said farnie youve got three pounds twelve and sixpence halfpenny if you will keep counting your money in public you cant blame a chap for knowing how much youve got  monk slightly disconcerted changed his plan of action he abandoned skirmishing tactics  never mind that he said the point is that i want that four pounds im going to have it too  i know at the end of term  im going to have it now  you can have a pound of it now  not enough  i dont see how you expect me to raise any more if i could do you think i should have borrowed it you might chuck rotting for a change  now look here old chap said monk i should think youd rather raise that tin somehow than have it get about that youd been playing pills at some pub out of bounds what  farnie for one of the few occasions on record was shaken out of his usual sangfroid even in his easy code of morality there had always been one crime which was an anathema the sort of thing no fellow could think of doing but it was obviously at this that monk was hinting  good lord man he cried you dont mean to say youre thinking of sneaking why the fellows would boot you round the field you couldnt stay in the place a week  there are heaps of ways said monk in which a thing can get about without anyone actually telling the beaks at present ive not told a soul but you know if i let it out to anyone they might tell someone else and so on and if everybody knows a thing the beaks generally get hold of it sooner or later youd much better let me have that four quid old chap  farnie capitulated  all right he said ill get it somehow  thanks awfully old chap said monk so long  in all beckford there was only one person who was in the least degree likely to combine the two qualities necessary for the extraction of farnie from his difficulties these qualities werein the first place ability in the second place willingness to advance him free of security the four pounds he required the person whom he had in his mind was gethryn he had reasoned the matter out step by step during the second half of morning school gethryn though he had as farnie knew no overwhelming amount of affection for his uncle might in a case of great need prove blood to be thicker as per advertisement than water but he reflected he must represent himself as in danger of expulsion rather than flogging he had an uneasy idea that if the bishop were to discover that all he stood to get was a flogging he would remark with enthusiasm that as far as he was concerned the good work might go on expulsion was different to save a member of his family from expulsion he might think it worth while to pass round the hat amongst his wealthy acquaintances if four plutocrats with four sovereigns were to combine farnie by their united efforts would be saved and he rather liked the notion of being turned into a sort of limited liability company like the duke of plaza toro at a pound a share it seemed to add a certain dignity to his position  to gethryns study therefore he went directly school was over if he had reflected he might have known that he would not have been there while the match was going on but his brain fatigued with his recent calculations had not noted this point  the study was empty  most people on finding themselves in a strange and empty room are seized with a desire to explore the same and observe from internal evidence what manner of man is the owner nowhere does character come out so clearly as in the decoration of ones private den many a man at present respected by his associates would stand forth unmasked at his true worth could the world but look into his room for there they would see that he was so lost to every sense of shame as to cover his books with brown paper or deck his walls with oleographs presented with the christmas numbers both of which habits argue a frame of mind fit for murderers stratagems and spoils let no such man be trusted  the bishops study which farnie now proceeded to inspect was not of this kind it was a neat study arranged with not a little taste there were photographs of teams with the college arms on their plain oak frames and photographs of relations in frames which tried to look and for the most part succeeded in looking as if they had not cost fourpence three farthings at a christmas bargain sale there were snapshots of various moving incidents in the careers of the bishop and his friends marriott for example as he appeared when carried to the pavilion after that sensational century against the authentics robertson of blakers winning the quarter mile john brown norriss predecessor in the captaincy and one of the four best batsmen beckford had ever had batting at the nets norris taking a skier on the boundary in last years mcc match the bishop himself going out to bat in the charchester match and many more of the same sort  all these farnie observed with considerable interest but as he moved towards the bookshelf his eye was caught by an object more interesting still it was a cashbox simple and unornamental but undoubtedly a cashbox and as he took it up it rattled  the key was in the lock in a boarding house at a public school it is not as a general rule absolutely necessary to keep ones valuables always hermetically sealed the difference between meum and tuum is so very rarely confused by the occupants of such an establishment that one is apt to grow careless and every now and then accidents happen an accident was about to happen now  it was at first without any motive except curiosity that farnie opened the cashbox he merely wished to see how much there was inside with a view to ascertaining what his prospects of negotiating a loan with his relative were likely to be when however he did see other feelings began to take the place of curiosity he counted the money there were ten sovereigns one halfsovereign and a good deal of silver one of the institutions at beckford was a mission the school by more or less voluntary contributions supported a species of home somewhere in the wilds of kennington no one knew exactly what or where this home was but all paid their subscriptions as soon as possible in the term and tried to forget about it gethryn collected not only for leicesters house but also for the sixth form and was consequently if only by proxy a man of large means too large farnie thought surely four pounds to be paid back probably almost at once would not be missed why shouldnt he  hullo  farnie spun round wilson was standing in the doorway  hullo farnie said he what are you playing at in here  what are you retorted farnie politely  come to fetch a book marriott said i might what are you up to  oh shut up said farnie why shouldnt i come here if i like matter of fact i came to see gethryn  he isnt here said wilson luminously  you dont mean to say youve noticed that already youve got an eye like a hawk wilson i was just taking a look round if you really want to know  well i shouldnt advise you to let marriott catch you mucking his study up seen a book called round the red lamp oh here it is coming over to the field  not just yet i want to have another look round dont you wait though  oh all right and wilson retired with his book  now though wilson at present suspected nothing not knowing of the existence of the cashbox farnie felt that when the money came to be missed and inquiries were made as to who had been in the study and when he would recall the interview two courses therefore remained open to him he could leave the money altogether or he could take it and leave himself in other words run away  in the first case there would of course remain the chance that he might induce gethryn to lend him the four pounds but this had never been more than a forlorn hope and in the light of the possibilities opened out by the cashbox he thought no more of it the real problem was should he or should he not take the money from the cashbox  as he hesitated the recollection of monks veiled threats came back to him and he wavered no longer he opened the box again took out the contents and dropped them into his pocket while he was about it he thought he might as well take all as only a part  then he wrote two notes oneto the bishophe placed on top of the cashbox the other he placed with four sovereigns on the table in monks study finally he left the room shut the door carefully behind him and went to the yard at the back of the house where he kept his bicycle  the workings of the human mind and especially of the young human mind are peculiar it never occurred to farnie that a result equally profitable to himself and decidedly more convenient for all concernedwith the possible exception of monkmight have been arrived at if he had simply left the money in the box and run away without it  however as the poet says you cant think of everything     7  the bishop goes for a ride   the mcc match opened auspiciously norris for the first time that season won the toss tom brown we read in a similar position with the usual liberality of young hands put his opponents in first norris was not so liberal he may have been young but he was not so young as that the sun was shining on as true a wicket as was ever prepared when he cried heads and the coin after rolling for some time in diminishing circles came to a standstill with the dragon undermost and norris returned to the pavilion and informed his gratified team that all things considered he rather thought that they would bat and he would be obliged if baker would get on his pads and come in first with him  the mcc men took the fieldo t blackwell by the way had shrunk into a mere brother of the centurymaking a tand the two school house representatives followed them an amateur of lengthy frame took the ball a man of pace to judge from the number of slips norris asked for two leg an obliging umpire informed him that he had got two leg the long bowler requested short slip to stand finer swung his arm as if to see that the machinery still worked and dashed wildly towards the crease the match had begun  there are few pleasanter or more thrilling moments in ones school career than the first over of a big match pleasant that is to say if you are actually looking on to have to listen to a match being started from the interior of a formroom is of course maddening you hear the sound of bat meeting ball followed by distant clapping somebody has scored but who and what it may be a four or it may be a mere single more important still it may be the other side batting after all some miscreant has possibly lifted your best bowler into the road the suspense is awful it ought to be a school rule that the captain of the team should send a message round the formrooms stating briefly and lucidly the result of the toss then one would know where one was as it is the entire form is dependent on the man sitting under the window the formmaster turns to write on the blackboard the only hope of the form shoots up like a rocket gazes earnestly in the direction of the pavilion and falls back with a thud into his seat they havent started yet he informs the rest in a stage whisper silence says the formmaster and the whole business must be gone through again with the added disadvantage that the master now has his eye fixed coldly on the individual nearest the window your only link with the outer world  various masters have various methods under such circumstances one more than excellent man used to close his book and remark i think well make up a little party to watch this match and the form gasping its thanks crowded to the windows another the exact antithesis of this great and good gentleman on seeing a boy taking fitful glances through the window would observe acidly you are at perfect liberty jones to watch the match if you care to but if you do you will come in in the afternoon and make up the time you waste and as all that could be seen from that particular window was one of the umpires and a couple of fieldsmen jones would reluctantly elect to reserve himself and for the present to turn his attention to euripides again  if you are one of the team and watch the match from the pavilion you escape these trials but there are others in the first few overs of a school match every ball looks to the spectators like taking a wicket the fiendish ingenuity of the slow bowler and the lightning speed of the fast man at the other end make one feel positively ill when the first ten has gone up on the scoringboard matters begin to right themselves today ten went up quickly the fast mans first ball was outside the offstump and a halfvolley and norris whatever the state of his nerves at the time never forgot his forward drive before the bowler had recovered his balance the ball was halfway to the ropes the umpire waved a large hand towards the pavilion the bowler looked annoyed and the school inside the formrooms asked itself feverishly what had happened and which side it was that was applauding  having bowled his first ball too far up the mcc man on the principle of anything for a change now put in a very short one norris a new man after that drive steered it through the slips and again the umpire waved his hand  the rest of the over was more quiet the last ball went for four byes and then it was bakers turn to face the slow man baker was a steady plodding bat he played five balls gently to midon and glanced the sixth for a single to leg with the fast bowler who had not yet got his length he was more vigorous and succeeded in cutting him twice for two  with thirty up for no wickets the school began to feel more comfortable but at fortythree baker was shattered by the man of pace and retired with twenty to his credit gethryn came in next but it was not to be his day out with the bat  the fast bowler who was now bowling excellently sent down one rather wide of the offstump the bishop made most of his runs from off balls and he had a go at this one it was rising when he hit it and it went off his bat like a flash in a school match it would have been a boundary but today there was unusual talent in the slips the man from middlesex darted forward and sideways he took the ball onehanded two inches from the ground and received the applause which followed the effort with a rather bored look as if he were saying my good sirs why make a fuss over these trifles the bishop walked slowly back to the pavilion feeling that his luck was out and pringle came in  a boy of pringles character is exactly the right person to go in in an emergency like the present one two wickets had fallen in two balls and the fast bowler was swelling visibly with determination to do the hattrick but pringle never went in oppressed by the fear of getting out he had a serene and boundless confidence in himself  the fast man tried a yorker pringle came down hard on it and forced the ball past the bowler for a single then he and norris settled down to a lengthy stand  i do like seeing pringle bat said gosling he always gives you the idea that hes doing you a personal favour by knocking your bowling about oh well hit  pringle had cut a fullpitch from the slow bowler to the ropes marriott who had been silent and apparently in pain for some minutes now gave out the following homemade effort      a dashing young sportsman named pringle       on breaking his duck with a single         observed with a smile         just notice my style         how science with vigour i mingle  little thing of my own he added quoting englands greatest librettist i call it heart foam i shall not publish it oh run it out  both pringle and norris were evidently in form norris was now not far from his fifty and pringle looked as if he might make anything the century went up and a run later norris offdrove the slow bowlers successor for three reaching his fifty by the stroke  must be fairly warm work fielding today said reece  by jove said gethryn i forgot i left my white hat in the house any of you chaps like to fetch it  there were no offers gethryn got up  marriott you slacker come over to the house  my good sir im in next why dont you wait till the fellows come out of school and send a kid for it  he probably wouldnt know where to find it i dont know where it is myself no i shall go but theres no need to fag about it yet hullo norris is out  norris had stopped a straight one with his leg he had made fiftyone in his best manner and the school leaving the formrooms at the exact moment when the fatal ball was being bowled were just in time to applaud him and realize what they had missed  gethryns desire for his hat was not so pressing as to make him deprive himself of the pleasure of seeing marriott at the wickets marriott ought to do something special today unfortunately after he had played out one over and hit two fours off it the luncheon interval began  it was therefore not for half an hour that the bishop went at last in search of the missing headgear as luck would have it the hat was on the table so that whatever chance he might have had of overlooking the note which his uncle had left for him on the empty cashbox disappeared the two things caught his eye simultaneously he opened the note and read it it is not necessary to transcribe the note in detail it was no masterpiece of literary skill but it had this merit that it was not vague reading it one grasped its meaning immediately  the bishops first feeling was that the bottom had dropped out of everything suddenly surprise was not the word it was the arrival of the absolutely unexpected  then he began to consider the position  farnie must be brought back that was plain and he must be brought back at once before anyone could get to hear of what had happened gethryn had the very strongest objections to his uncle considered purely as a human being but the fact remained that he was his uncle and the bishop had equally strong objections to any member of his family being mixed up in a business of this description  having settled that point he went on to the next how was he to be brought back he could not have gone far for he could not have been gone much more than half an hour again from his knowledge of his uncles character he deduced that he had in all probability not gone to the nearest station horton at horton one had to wait hours at a time for a train farnie must have made his wayon his bicyclestraight for the junction anfield fifteen miles off by a good road a train left anfield for london at threethirty it was now a little past two on a bicycle he could do it easily and get back with his prize by about five if he rode hard in that case all would be well only three of the school wickets had fallen and the pitch was playing as true as concrete besides there was pringle still in at one end well set and surely marriott and jennings and the rest of them would manage to stay in till five they couldnt help it all they had to do was to play forward to everything and they must stop in he himself had got out it was true but that was simply a regrettable accident not one man in a hundred would have caught that catch no with luck he ought easily to be able to do the distance and get back in time to go out with the rest of the team to field  he ran downstairs and out of the house on his way to the bicycleshed he stopped and looked towards the field part of which could be seen from where he stood the match had begun again the fast bowler was just commencing his run he saw him tear up to the crease and deliver the ball what happened then he could not see owing to the trees which stood between him and the school grounds but he heard the crack of ball meeting bat and a great howl of applause went up from the invisible audience a boundary apparently yes there was the umpire signalling it evidently a long stand was going to be made he would have oceans of time for his ride norris wouldnt dream of declaring the innings closed before five oclock at the earliest and no bowler could take seven wickets in the time on such a pitch he hauled his bicycle from the shed and rode off at racing speed in the direction of anfield     8  the mcc match   but out in the field things were going badly with beckford the aspect of a game often changes considerably after lunch for a while it looked as if marriott and pringle were in for their respective centuries but marriott was never a safe batsman  a hundred and fifty went up on the board off a square leg hit for two which completed pringles halfcentury and then marriott faced the slow bowler who had been put on again after lunch the first ball was a misshit it went behind point for a couple the next he got fairly hold of and drove to the boundary the third was a very simplelooking ball its sole merit appeared to be the fact that it was straight also it was a trifle shorter than it looked marriott jumped out and got too much under it up it soared straight over the bowlers head a trifle more weight behind the hit and it would have cleared the ropes as it was the man in the deepfield never looked like missing it the batsmen had time to cross over before the ball arrived but they did it without enthusiasm the run was not likely to count nor did it deepfield caught it like a bird marriott had made twentytwo  and now occurred one of those rots which so often happen without any ostensible cause in the best regulated school elevens pringle played the three remaining balls of the over without mishap but when it was the fast mans turn to bowl to bruce marriotts successor things began to happen bruce temporarily insane perhaps through nervousness played back at a halfvolley and was clean bowled hill came in and was caught two balls later at the wicket and the last ball of the over sent jenningss offstump out of the ground after that batsman had scored two  i can always bowl like blazes after lunch said the fast man to pringle its the lobster salad that does it i think four for a hundred and fiftyseven had changed to seven for a hundred and fiftynine in the course of a single over gethryns calculations if he had only known could have done now with a little revision  gosling was the next man he was followed after a brief innings of three balls which realized eight runs by baynes baynes though abstaining from runs himself helped pringle to add three to the score all in singles and was then yorked by the slow man who meanly and treacherously sent down without the slightest warning a very fast one on the leg stump then reece came in for the last wicket and the rot stopped reece always went in last for the school and the school in consequence always felt that there were possibilities to the very end of the innings  the lot of a lastwicket man is somewhat trying as at any moment his best innings may be nipped in the bud by the other man getting out he generally feels that it is hardly worth while to play himself in before endeavouring to make runs he therefore tries to score off every ball and thinks himself lucky if he gets half a dozen reece however took life more seriously he had made quite an art of lastwicket batting once against the butterflies he had run up sixty not out and there was always the chance that he would do the same again today with pringle at the other end he looked forward to a pleasant hour or two at the wicket  no bowler ever looks on the last man quite in the same light as he does the other ten he underrates him instinctively the mcc fast bowler was a man with an idea his idea was that he could bowl a slow ball of diabolical ingenuity as a rule public feeling was against his trying the experiment his captains were in the habit of enquiring rudely if he thought he was playing marbles this was exactly what the mcc captain asked on the present occasion when the head ball sailed ponderously through the air and was promptly hit by reece into the pavilion the bowler grinned and resumed his ordinary pace  but everything came alike to reece pringle too continued his career of triumph gradually the score rose from a hundred and seventy to two hundred pringle cut and drove in all directions with the air of a prince of the blood royal distributing largesse the second century went up to the accompaniment of cheers  then the slow bowler reaped his reward for pringle after putting his first two balls over the screen was caught on the boundary off the third he had contributed eightyone to a total of two hundred and thirteen  so far gethryns absence had not been noticed but when the umpires had gone out and the school were getting ready to take the field inquiries were made  you might begin at the top end gosling said norris  right said samuel whos going on at the other  baynes hullo wheres gethryn  isnt he here perhaps hes in the pavi  any of you chaps seen gethryn  he isnt in the pav said baker ive just come out of the first room myself and he wasnt there shouldnt wonder if hes over at leicesters  dash the man said norris he might have known wed be going out to field soon anyhow we cant wait for him we shall have to field a sub till he turns up  lorimers in the pav changed said pringle  all right hell do  and reinforced by the gratified lorimer the team went on its way  in the beginning the fortunes of the school prospered gosling opened as was his custom at a tremendous pace and seemed to trouble the first few batsmen considerably a worriedlooking little person who had fielded with immense zeal during the school innings at coverpoint took the first ball it was very fast and hit him just under the kneecap the pain in spite of the pad appeared to be acute the little man danced vigorously for some time and then with much diffidence prepared himself for the second instalment  now when on the cricket field the truculent samuel was totally deficient in all the finer feelings such as pity and charity he could see that the batsman was in pain and yet his second ball was faster than the first it came in quickly from the off the little batsman went forward in a hesitating halfhearted manner and played a clear two inches inside the ball the offstump shot out of the ground  bowled sammy said norris from his place in the slips  the next man was a clergyman a large man who suggested possibilities in the way of hitting but gosling was irresistible for three balls the priest survived but the last of the over a fast yorker on the leg stump was too much for him and he retired  two for none the critic in the deck chair felt that the match was as good as over  but this idyllic state of things was not to last the newcomer a tall man with a light moustache which he felt carefully after every ball soon settled down he proved to be a conversationalist until he had opened his account which he did with a strong drive to the ropes he was silent when however he had seen the ball safely to the boundary he turned to reece and began  rather a nice one that eh what yes got it just on the right place you know not a bad bat this is it what yes one of slogbury and whanghams sussex spankers dont you know chose it myself had it in pickle all the winter yes  play sir from the umpire  eh what oh right yes good make these sussexspankers oh well fielded  at the word spankers he had effected another drive but marriott at midoff had stopped it prettily  soon it began to occur to norris that it would be advisable to have a change of bowling gosling was getting tired and baynes apparently offered no difficulties to the batsman on the perfect wicket the conversational man in particular being very severe upon him it was at such a crisis that the bishop should have come in he was goslings understudy but where was he the innings had been in progress over half an hour now and still there were no signs of him a man thought norris who could cut off during the mcc match of all matches probably on some rotten business of his own was beyond the pale and must on reappearance be fallen upon and rent hehere something small and red whizzed at his face he put up his hands to protect himself the ball struck them and bounded out again when a fast bowler is bowling a slip he should not indulge in absentmindedness the conversational man had received his first life and as he was careful to explain to reece it was a curious thing but whenever he was let off early in his innings he always made fifty and as a rule a century goslings analysis was spoilt and the match in all probability lost and norris put it all down to gethryn if he had been there this would not have happened  sorry gosling he said  all right said gosling though thinking quite the reverse and he walked back to bowl his next ball conjuring up a beautiful vision in his mind j douglas and braund were fielding slip to him in the vision while in the background norris appeared in a cauldron of boiling oil  tut tut said baker facetiously to the raging captain  bakers was essentially a flippant mind not even a moment of solemn agony such as this was sacred to him  norris was icy and severe  if you want to rot about baker he said perhaps youd better go and play stumpcricket with the juniors  well retorted baker with great politeness i suppose seeing you miss a gaper like that right into your hands made me think i was playing stumpcricket with the juniors  at this point the conversation ceased baker suddenly remembering that he had not yet received his first eleven colours and that it would therefore be rash to goad the captain too freely while norris for his part recalled the fact that baker had promised to do some latin verse for him that evening and might if crushed with some scathing repartee refuse to go through with that contract so there was silence in the slips  the partnership was broken at last by a lucky accident the conversationalist called his partner for a short run and when that unfortunate gentleman had sprinted some twenty yards reconsidered the matter and sent him back reece had the bails off before the victim had completed a third of the return journey  for some time after this matters began to favour the school again with the score at a hundred and five three men left in two overs one bowled by gosling the others caught at point and in the deep off jennings who had deposed baynes six wickets were now down and the enemy still over a hundred behind  but the mcc in its school matches has this peculiarity however badly it may seem to stand there is always something up its sleeve in this case it was a professional a man indecently devoid of anything in the shape of nerves he played the bowling with a stolid confidence amounting almost to contempt which struck a chill to the hearts of the school bowlers it did worse it induced them to bowl with the sole object of getting the conversationalist at the batting end thus enabling the professional to pile up an unassuming but rapidly increasing score by means of threes and singles  as for the conversationalist he had made thirty or more and wanted all the bowling he could get  its a very curious thing he said to reece as he faced gosling after his partner had scored a three off the first ball of the over but some fellows simply detest fast bowling now i he never finished the sentence when he spoke again it was to begin a new one  how on earth did that happen he asked  i think it bowled you said reece stolidly picking up the two stumps which had been uprooted by goslings express  yes but how dash it what i cant underst most curious thing i everdash it all you know  he drifted off in the direction of the pavilion stopping on the way to ask short leg his opinion of the matter  bowled sammy said reece putting on the bails  well bowled gosling growled norris from the slips  sammy the marvel by jove said marriott switch it on samuel more and more  i wish norris would give me a rest where on earth is that man gethryn  rum isnt it theres going to be something of a row about it norris seems to be getting rather shirty hullo here comes the deathless author  the author referred to was the new batsman a distinguished novelist who played a good deal for the mcc he broke his journey to the wicket to speak to the conversationalist who was still engaged with short leg  bates old man he said if youre going to the pavilion you might wait for me i shall be out in an hour or two  upon which bates awaking suddenly to the position of affairs went on his way  with the arrival of the deathless author an unwelcome change came over the game his cricket style resembled his literary style both were straightforward and vigorous the first two balls he received from gosling he drove hard past cover point to the ropes gosling who had been bowling unchanged since the innings began was naturally feeling a little tired he was losing his length and bowling more slowly than was his wont norris now gave him a rest for a few overs bruce going on with rather innocuous medium lefthand bowling the professional continued to jog along slowly the novelist hit everything seemed to come alike to him gosling resumed but without effect while at the other end bowler after bowler was tried from a hundred and ten the score rose and rose and still the two remained together a hundred and ninety went up and norris in despair threw the ball to marriott  here you are marriott he said im afraid we shall have to try you  thats what i call really nicely expressed said marriott to the umpire yes over the wicket  marriott was a slow housematch sort of bowler that is to say in a house match he was quite likely to get wickets but in a first eleven match such an event was highly improbable his bowling looked very subtle and if the ball was allowed to touch the ground it occasionally broke quite a remarkable distance  the forlorn hope succeeded the professional for the first time in his innings took a risk he slashed at a very mild ball almost a wide on the off side the ball touched the corner of the bat and soared up in the direction of coverpoint where pringle held it comfortably  there you are said marriott when you put a really scientific bowler on youre bound to get a wicket why on earth didnt i go on before norris  you wait said norris there are five more balls of the over to come  bad job for the batsman said marriott  there had been time for a run before the ball reached pringle so that the novelist was now at the batting end marriotts next ball was not unlike his first but it was straighter and consequently easier to get at the novelist hit it into the road when it had been brought back he hit it into the road again marriott suggested that he had better have a man there  the fourth ball of the over was too wide to hit with any comfort and the batsman let it alone the fifth went for four to square leg almost killing the umpire on its way and the sixth soared in the old familiar manner into the road again marriotts over had yielded exactly twentytwo runs four to win and two wickets to fall  ill never read another of that mans books as long as i live said marriott to gosling giving him the ball youre our only hope sammy do go in and win  the new batsman had the bowling he snicked his first ball for a single bringing the novelist to the fore again and samuel wilberforce gosling vowed a vow that he would dismiss that distinguished novelist  but the best intentions go for nothing when ones arm is feeling like lead of all the miserable balls sent down that afternoon that one of goslings was the worst it was worse than anything of marriotts it flew sluggishly down the pitch well outside the leg stump the novelist watched it come and his eye gleamed it was about to bounce for the second time when with a pleased smile the batsman stepped out there was a loud musical report the note of a bat when it strikes the ball fairly on the driving spot  the man of letters shaded his eyes with his hand and watched the ball diminish in the distance  i rather think said he cheerfully as a crash of glass told of its arrival at the pavilion that that does it  he was perfectly right it did     9  the bishop finishes his ride   gethryn had started on his ride handicapped by two things he did not know his way after the first two miles and the hedges at the roadside had just been clipped leaving the roads covered with small thorns  it was the former of these circumstances that first made itself apparent for two miles the road ran straight but after that it was unexplored country the bishop being in both cricket and football teams had few opportunities for cycling he always brought his machine to school but he very seldom used it  at the beginning of the unexplored country an irresponsible person recommended him to go straight on he couldnt miss the road said he it was straight all the way gethryn thanked him rode on and having gone a mile came upon three roads each of which might quite well have been considered a continuation of the road on which he was already one curved gently off to the right the other two equally gently to the left he dismounted and the feelings of gratitude which he had borne towards his informant for his lucid directions vanished suddenly he gazed searchingly at the three roads but to single out one of them as straighter than the other two was a task that baffled him completely a signpost informed him of three things by following road one he might get to brindleham and ultimately if he persevered to corden road number two would lead him to old inns whatever they might be with the further inducement of little benbury while if he cast in his lot with road three he might hope sooner or later to arrive at much middlefoldonthehill and lesser middlefoldinthevale but on the subject of anfield and anfield junction the board was silent  two courses lay open to him should he select a route at random or wait for somebody to come and direct him he waited he went on waiting he waited a considerable time and at last just as he was about to trust to luck and make for much middlefoldonthehill a figure loomed in sight a slowmoving man who strolled down the old inns road at a pace which seemed to argue that he had plenty of time on his hands  i say can you tell me the way to anfield please said the bishop as he came up  the man stopped apparently rooted to the spot he surveyed the bishop with a glassy but determined stare from head to foot then he looked earnestly at the bicycle and finally in perfect silence began to inspect the bishop again  eh he said at length  can you tell me the way to anfield  anfield  yes how do i get there  the man perpended and when he replied did so after the style of the late and great ollendorf  old inns he said dreamily waving a hand down the road by which he had come be over there  yes yes i know said gethryn  was born at old inns i was continued the man warming to his subject lived there fiftyfive years i have yeou go straight down the road an yeou cam t old inns yes that be the way t old inns  gethryn nobly refrained from rending the speaker limb from limb  i dont want to know the way to old inns he said desperately where i want to get is anfield anfield you know which way do i go  anfield said the man then a brilliant flash of intelligence illumined his countenance whoy anfield be same road as old inns yeou go straight down the road an  thanks very much said gethryn and without waiting for further revelations shot off in the direction indicated a quarter of a mile farther he looked over his shoulder the man was still there gazing after him in a kind of trance  the bishop passed through old inns with some way on his machine he had much lost time to make up a signpost bearing the legend anfield four miles told him that he was nearing his destination the notice had changed to three miles and again to two when suddenly he felt that jarring sensation which every cyclist knows his back tyre was punctured it was impossible to ride on he got off and walked he was still in his cricket clothes and the fact that he had on spiked boots did not make walking any the easier his progress was not rapid  half an hour before his one wish had been to catch sight of a fellowbeing now when he would have preferred to have avoided his species men seemed to spring up from nowhere and every man of them had a remark to make or a question to ask about the punctured tyre reserve is not the leading characteristic of the average yokel  gethryn however refused to be drawn into conversation on the subject at last one more determined than the rest brought him to bay  hoy mister stop called a voice gethryn turned a man was running up the road towards him  he arrived panting  whats up said the bishop  youve got a puncture said the man pointing an accusing finger at the flattened tyre  it was not worth while killing the brute probably he was acting from the best motives  no said gethryn wearily it isnt a puncture i always let the air out when im riding it looks so much better dont you think so why did they let you out goodbye  and feeling a little more comfortable after this outburst he wheeled his bicycle on into anfield high street  minds in the village of anfield worked with extraordinary rapidity the first person of whom he asked the way to the junction answered the riddle almost without thinking he left his machine out in the road and went on to the platform the first thing that caught his eye was the station clock with its hands pointing to five past four and when he realized that his uncles train having left a clear half hour before his labours had all been for nothing the full bitterness of life came home to him  he was turning away from the station when he stopped something else had caught his eye on a bench at the extreme end of the platform sat a youth and a further scrutiny convinced the bishop of the fact that the youth was none other than master reginald farnie late of beckford and shortly or he would know the reason why to be once more of beckford other people besides himself it appeared could miss trains  farnie was reading one of those halfpenny weeklies whichwith a nerve which is the only creditable thing about themcall themselves comic he did not see the bishop until a shadow falling across his paper caused him to look up  it was not often that he found himself unequal to a situation monk in a recent conversation had taken him aback somewhat but his feelings on that occasion were not to be compared with what he felt on seeing the one person whom he least desired to meet standing at his side his jaw dropped limply comic blitherings fluttered to the ground  the bishop was the first to speak indeed if he had waited for farnie to break the silence he would have waited long  get up he said farnie got up  come on farnie came  go and get your machine said gethryn hurry up and now you will jolly well come back to beckford you little beast  but before that could be done there was gethryns back wheel to be mended this took time it was nearly half past four before they started  oh said gethryn as they were about to mount theres that money i was forgetting out with it  ten pounds had been the sum farnie had taken from the study six was all he was able to restore gethryn enquired after the deficit  i gave it to monk said farnie  to gethryn in his present frame of mind the mere mention of monk was sufficient to uncork the vials of his wrath  what the blazes did you do that for whats monk got to do with it  he said hed get me sacked if i didnt pay him whined farnie  this was not strictly true monk had not said he had hinted and he had hinted at flogging not expulsion  why pursued the bishop what had you and monk been up to  farnie using his outofbounds adventures as a foundation worked up a highly artistic narrative of doings which if they had actually been performed would certainly have entailed expulsion he had judged gethryns character correctly if the matter had been simply a case for a flogging the bishop would have stood aside and let the thing go on against the extreme penalty of school law he felt bound as a matter of family duty to shield his relative and he saw a bad time coming for himself in the very near future either he must expose farnie which he had resolved not to do or he must refuse to explain his absence from the mcc match for by now there was not the smallest chance of his being able to get back in time for the visitors innings as he rode on he tried to imagine what would happen in consequence of that desertion and he could not do it his crime was so far as he knew absolutely without precedent in the school history  as they passed the cricket field he saw that it was empty stumps were usually drawn early in the mcc match if the issue of the game was out of doubt as the marylebone men had trains to catch evidently this had happened today it might mean that the school had won easilythey had looked like making a big score when he had left the groundin which case public opinion would be more lenient towards him after a victory a school feels that alls well that ends well but it might on the other hand mean quite the reverse  he put his machine up and hurried to the study several boys as he passed them looked curiously at him but none spoke to him  marriott was in the study reading a book he was still in flannels and looked as if he had begun to change but had thought better of it as was actually the case  hullo he cried as gethryn appeared where the dickens have you been all the afternoon what on earth did you go off like that for  im sorry old chap said the bishop i cant tell you i shant be able to tell anyone  but man try and realize what youve done do you grasp the fact that youve gone and got the school licked in the mcc match and that we havent beaten the mcc for about a dozen years and that if youd been there to bowl we should have walked over this time do try and grasp the thing  did they win  rather by a wicket two wickets i mean we made 213 your bowling would just have done it  gethryn sat down  oh lord he said blankly this is awful  but look here bishop continued marriott this is all rot you cant do a thing like this and then refuse to offer any explanation and expect things to go on just as usual  i dont said gethryn i know theres going to be a row but i cant explain youll have to take me on trust  oh as far as i am concerned its all right said marriott i know you wouldnt be ass enough to do a thing like that without a jolly good reason its the other chaps im thinking about youll find it jolly hard to put norris off im afraid hes most awfully sick about the match he fielded badly which always makes him shirty jephson too youll have a bad time with jephson his one wish after the match was to have your gore and plenty of it nothing else would have pleased him a bit and think of the chaps in the house too just consider what a pull this gives monk and his mob over you the housell want some looking after now i fancy  and theyll get it said gethryn if monk gives me any of his beastly cheek ill knock his head off  but in spite of the consolation which such a prospect afforded him he did not look forward with pleasure to the next day when he would have to meet norris and the rest it would have been bad in any case he did not care to think what would happen when he refused to offer the slightest explanation     10  in which a case is fully discussed   gethryn was right in thinking that the interviews would be unpleasant they increased in unpleasantness in arithmetical progression until they culminated finally in a terrific encounter with the justly outraged norris  reece was the first person to institute inquiries and if everybody had resembled him matters would not have been so bad for gethryn reece possessed a perfect genius for minding his own business the dialogue when they met was brief  hullo said reece  hullo said the bishop  where did you get to yesterday said reece  oh i had to go somewhere said the bishop vaguely  oh pity wasnt a bad match and that was all the comment reece made on the situation  gethryn went over to the chapel that morning with an empty sinking feeling inside him he was quite determined to offer no single word of explanation and he felt that that made the prospect all the worse there was a vast uncertainty in his mind as to what was going to happen nobody could actually do anything to him of course it would have been a decided relief to him if anybody had tried that line of action for moments occur when the only thing that can adequately soothe the wounded spirit is to hit straight from the shoulder at someone the punchingball is often found useful under these circumstances as he was passing jephsons house he nearly ran into somebody who was coming out  be firm my moral pecker thought gethryn and braced himself up for conflict  well gethryn said mr jephson  the question well especially when addressed by a master to a boy is one of the few questions to which there is literally no answer you can look sheepish you can look defiant or you can look surprised according to the state of your conscience but anything in the way of verbal response is impossible  gethryn attempted no verbal response  well gethryn went on mr jephson was it pleasant up the river yesterday  mr jephson always preferred the rapier of sarcasm to the bludgeon of abuse  yes sir said gethryn very pleasant he did not mean to be massacred without a struggle  what cried mr jephson you actually mean to say that you did go up the river  no sir  then what do you mean  it is always pleasant up the river on a fine day said gethryn  his opponent to use a metaphor suitable to a cricket master changed his action he abandoned sarcasm and condescended to direct inquiry  where were you yesterday afternoon he said  the bishop like mr hurry bungsho jabberjee ba became at once the silent tomb  did you hear what i said gethryn icily where were you yesterday afternoon  i cant say sir  these words may convey two meanings they may imply ignorance in which case the speaker should be led gently off to the nearest asylum or they may imply obstinacy mr jephson decided that in the present case obstinacy lay at the root of the matter he became icier than ever  very well gethryn he said i shall report this to the headmaster  and gethryn feeling that the conference was at an end proceeded on his way  after chapel there was norris to be handled norris had been rather late for chapel that morning and had no opportunity of speaking to the bishop but after the service was over and the school streamed out of the building towards their respective houses he waylaid him at the door and demanded an explanation the bishop refused to give one norris whose temper never had a chance of reaching its accustomed tranquillity until he had consumed some breakfasthe hated early morning chapelraved the bishop was worried but firm  then you mean to sayyou dont mean to sayi mean you dont intend to explain said norris finally working round for the twentieth time to his original text  i cant explain  you wont you mean  yes ill apologize if you like but i wont explain  norris felt the strain was becoming too much for him  apologize he moaned addressing circumambient space apologize a man cuts off in the middle of the mcc match loses us the game and then comes back and offers to apologize  the offers withdrawn put in gethryn apologies and explanations are both off it was hopeless to try and be conciliatory under the circumstances they did not admit of it  norris glared  i suppose he said you dont expect to go on playing for the first after this we cant keep a place open for you in the team on the off chance of your not having a previous engagement you know  thats your affair said the bishop youre captain have you finished your address is there anything else youd like to say  norris considered and as he went in at jephsons gate wound up with this parthian shaft  all i can say is that youre not fit to be at a public school they ought to sack a chap for doing that sort of thing if youll take my advice youll leave  about two hours afterwards gethryn discovered a suitable retort but coming to the conclusion that better late than never does not apply to repartees refrained from speaking it  it was mr jephsons usual custom to sally out after supper on sunday evenings to smoke a pipe or several pipes with one of the other housemasters on this particular evening he made for robertsons which was one of the four houses on the opposite side of the school grounds he could hardly have selected a better man to take his grievance to mr robertson was a long silent man with grizzled hair and an eye that pierced like a gimlet he had the enviable reputation of keeping the best order of any master in the school he was also one of the most popular of the staff this was all the more remarkable from the fact that he played no games  to him came mr jephson primed to bursting point with his grievance  anything wrong jephson said mr robertson  wrong i should just think there was did you happen to be looking at the match yesterday robertson  mr robertson nodded  i always watch school matches good match norris missed a bad catch in the slips he was asleep  mr jephson conceded the point it was trivial  yes he said he should certainly have held it but thats a mere detail i want to talk about gethryn do you know what he did yesterday i never heard of such a thing in my life never went off during the luncheon interval without a word and never appeared again till lockup and now he refuses to offer any explanation whatever i shall report the whole thing to beckett i told gethryn so this morning  i shouldnt said mr robertson i really think i shouldnt beckett finds the ordinary duties of a headmaster quite sufficient for his needs this business is not in his province at all  not in his province my dear sir what is a headmaster for if not to manage affairs of this sort  mr robertson smiled in a sphinxlike manner and answered after the fashion of socrates with a question  let me ask you two things jephson you must proceed gingerly now firstly it is a headmasters business to punish any breach of school rules is it not  well  and school prefects do not attend rollcall and have no restrictions placed upon them in the matter of bounds  no well  then perhaps youll tell me what school rule gethryn has broken said mr robertson  you see you cant he went on of course you cant he has not broken any school rule he is a prefect and may do anything he likes with his spare time he chooses to play cricket then he changes his mind and goes off to some unknown locality for some reason at present unexplained it is all perfectly legal extremely quaint behaviour on his part i admit but thoroughly legal  then nothing can be done exclaimed mr jephson blankly but its absurd something must be done the thing cant be left as it is its preposterous  i should imagine said mr robertson from what small knowledge i possess of the human boy that matters will be made decidedly unpleasant for the criminal  well i know one thing he wont play for the team again  there is something very refreshing about your logic jephson because a boy does not play in one match you will not let him play in any of the others though you admit his absence weakens the team however i suppose that is unavoidable mind you i think it is a pity of course gethryn has some explanation if he would only favour us with it personally i think rather highly of gethryn so does poor old leicester he is the only headprefect leicester has had for the last halfdozen years who knows even the rudiments of his business but its no use my preaching his virtues to you you wouldnt listen take another cigar and lets talk about the weather  mr jephson took the proffered weed and the conversation though it did not turn upon the suggested topic ceased to have anything to do with gethryn  the general opinion of the school was dead against the bishop one or two of his friends still clung to a hope that explanations might come out while there were also a few who always made a point of thinking differently from everybody else of this class was pringle on the monday after the match he spent the best part of an hour of his valuable time reasoning on the subject with lorimer lorimers vote went with the majority although he had fielded for the bishop he was not of course being merely a substitute allowed to bowl as the bishop had had his innings and it had been particularly galling to him to feel that he might have saved the match if it had only been possible for him to have played a larger part  its no good jawing about it he said there isnt a word to say for the man he hasnt a leg to stand on why it would be bad enough in a house or form match even but when it comes to first matches here words failed lorimer  not at all said pringle unmoved there are heaps of reasons jolly good reasons why he might have gone away  such as said lorimer  well he might have been called away by a telegram for instance  what rot why should he make such a mystery of it if that was all  hed have explained all right if somebody had asked him properly you get a chap like norris who when he loses his hair has got just about as much tact as a rhinoceros going and ballyragging the man and no wonder he wont say anything i shouldnt myself  well go and talk to him decently then lets see you do it and ill bet it wont make a bit of difference what the chap has done is to go and get himself mixed up in some shady business somewhere thats the only thing it can be  rot said pringle the bishop isnt that sort of chap  you cant tell i say he broke off suddenly have you done that poem yet  pringle started he had not so much as begun that promised epic  ierhavent quite finished it yet im thinking it out you know getting a sort of general grip of the thing  oh well i wish youd buck up with it its got to go in tomorrow week  tomorrow week tuesday the what twentysecond isnt it right ill remember two days after the obs match thatll fix it in my mind by the way your people are going to come down all right arent they i mean we shall have to be getting in supplies and so on  yes theyll be coming theres plenty of time though to think of that what youve got to do for the present is to keep your mind glued on the death of dido  rather said pringle i wont forget  this was at six twentytwo pm by the time sixthirty boomed from the college clocktower pringle was absorbing a thrilling work of fiction and dido her death and everything connected with her had faded from his mind like a beautiful dream     11  poetry and stumpcricket   the old beckfordians match came off in due season and pringle enjoyed it thoroughly though he only contributed a dozen in the first innings he made up for this afterwards in the second when the school had a hundred and twenty to get in just two hours he went in first with marriott and they pulled the thing off and gave the school a ten wickets victory with eight minutes to spare pringle was in rare form he made fiftythree mainly off the bowling of a certain jr smith whose fag he had been in the old days when at school smith had always been singularly aggressive towards pringle and the latter found that much pleasure was to be derived from hitting fours off his bowling subsequently he ate more strawberries and cream than were strictly speaking good for him and did the honours at the study teaparty with the grace of a born host and as he had hoped miss mabel lorimer did ask what that silverplate was stuck on to that bat for  it is not to be wondered at that in the midst of these festivities such trivialities as lorimers poem found no place in his thoughts it was not until the following day that he was reminded of it  that sunday was a visiting sunday visiting sundays occurred three times a term when everybody who had friends and relations in the neighbourhood was allowed to spend the day with them pringle on such occasions used to ride over to biddlehampton the scene of farnies adventures on somebody elses bicycle his destination being the residence of a certain colonel ashby no relation but a great friend of his fathers  the gallant colonel had besides his other meritswhich were numerousthe pleasant characteristic of leaving his guests to themselves to be left to oneself under some circumstances is apt to be a drawback but in this case there was never any lack of amusements the only objection that pringle ever found was that there was too much to do in the time there was shooting riding fishing and also stumpcricket given proper conditions no game in existence yields to stumpcricket in the matter of excitement a stableyard makes the best pitch for the walls stop all hits and you score solely by boundaries one for every hit two if it goes past the coachroom door four to the end wall and out if you send it over it is perfect  there were two junior ashbys twins aged sixteen they went to school at charchester returning to the ancestral home for the weekend sometimes when pringle came they would bring a school friend in which case pringle and he would play the twins but as a rule the programme consisted of a series of five test matches charchester versus beckford and as pringle was almost exactly twice as good as each of the twins taken individually when they combined it made the sides very even and the test matches were fought out with the most deadly keenness  after lunch the colonel was in the habit of taking pringle for a stroll in the grounds to watch him smoke a cigar or two on this sunday the conversation during the walk after beginning as was right and proper with cricket turned to work  let me see said the colonel as pringle finished the description of how point had almost got to the square cut which had given him his century against charchester youre out of the upper fifth now arent you i always used to think you were going to be a fixture there you are like your father in that way i remember him at rugby spending years on end in the same form couldnt get out of it but you did get your remove if i remember  rather said pringle years ago thats to say last term and im jolly glad i did too  his errant memory had returned to the poetry prize once more  oh said the colonel why is that  pringle explained the peculiar disadvantages that attended membership of the upper fifth during the summer term  i dont think a man ought to be allowed to spend his money in these special prizes he concluded at any rate they ought to be sixth form affairs its hard enough having to do the ordinary work and keep up your cricket at the same time  they are compulsory then  yes swindle i call it the chap who shares my study at beckford is in the upper fifth and his hairs turning white under the strain the worst of it is too that ive promised to help him and i never seem to have any time to give to the thing i could turn out a great poem if i had an hour or two to spare now and then  whats the subject  death of dido this year they are always jolly keen on deaths last year it was cato and the year before julius caesar they seem to have very morbid minds i think they might try something cheerful for a change  dido said the colonel dreamily death of dido where have i heard either a story or a poem or a riddle or something in some way connected with the death of dido it was years ago but i distinctly remember having heard somebody mention the occurrence oh well it will come back presently i dare say  it did come back presently the story was this a friend of colonel ashbysthe onetime colonel of his regiment to be exactwas an earnest student of everything in the literature of the country that dealt with sport this gentleman happened to read in a publishers list one day that a limited edition of the dark horse by a mr arthur james was on sale and might be purchased from the publisher by all who were willing to spend half a guinea to that end  well old matthews said the colonel sent off for this book thought it must be a sporting novel dont you know i shall never forget his disappointment when he opened the parcel it turned out to be a collection of poems the dark horse and other studies in the tragic was its full title  matthews never had a soul for poetry good or bad the dark horse itself was about a knight in the middle ages you know great nonsense it was too matthews used to read me passages from time to time when he gave up the regiment he left me the book as a farewell gift he said i was the only man he knew who really sympathized with him in the affair ive got it still its in the library somewhere if you care to look at it what recalled it to my mind was your mention of dido the second poem was about the death of dido as far as i can remember im no judge of poetry but it didnt strike me as being very good at the same time you might pick up a hint or two from it it ought to be in one of the two lower shelves on the right of the door as you go in unless it has been taken away that is not likely though we are not very enthusiastic poetry readers here  pringle thanked him for his information and went back to the stableyard where he lost the fourth test match by sixteen runs owing to preoccupation you cant play a yorker on the legstump with a thin walkingstick if your mind is occupied elsewhere and the legstump yorkers of james the elder by a minute of the two ashbys were achieving a growing reputation in charchester cricket circles  one ought never thought pringle to despise the gifts which fortune bestows on us and this mention of an actual completed poem on the very subject which was in his mind was clearly a gift of fortune how much better it would be to read thoughtfully through this poem and quarry out a set of verses from it suitable to lorimers needs than to waste his braintissues in trying to evolve something original from his own inner consciousness pringle objected strongly to any unnecessary waste of his braintissues besides the best poets borrowed virgil did it tennyson did it even homerwe have it on the authority of mr kiplingwhen he smote his blooming lyre went and stole what he thought he might require why should pringle of the school house refuse to follow in such illustrious footsteps  it was at this point that the guileful james delivered his insidious yorker and the dull thud of the tennis ball on the board which served as the wicket told a listening world that charchester had won the fourth test match and that the scores were now two all  but beckfords star was to ascend again pringles mind was made up he would read the printed poem that very night and before retiring to rest he would have lorimers verses complete and ready to be sent in for judgement to the examiner but for the present he would dismiss the matter from his mind and devote himself to polishing off the charchester champions in the fifth and final test match and in this he was successful for just as the bell rang summoning the players in to a wellearned tea a sweet forward drive from his walkingstick crashed against the end wall and beckford had won the rubber  as the young batsman undefeated to the last reached the pavilion said pringle getting into his coat a prolonged and deafening salvo of cheers greeted him his twentythree not out compiled as it was against the finest bowling charchester could produce and on a wicket that was always treacherous theres a brick loose at the top end was an effort unique in its heroism  oh come on said the defeated team  if you have fluked a win said james its nothing much wait till next visiting sunday  and the teams went in to tea  in the programme which pringle had mapped out for himself he was to go to bed with his book at the highly respectable hour of ten work till eleven and then go to sleep but programmes are notoriously subject to alterations pringles was altered owing to a remark made immediately after dinner by john ashby who desirous of retrieving the fallen fortunes of charchester offered to play pringle a hundred up at billiards giving him thirty now pringles ability in the realm of sport did not extend to billiards but the human being who can hear unmoved a fellow human being offering him thirty start in a game of a hundred has yet to be born he accepted the challenge and permission to play having been granted by the powers that were on the understanding that the cloth was not to be cut and as few cues broken as possible the game began james acting as marker  there are doubtless ways by which a game of a hundred up can be got through in less than two hours but with pringle and his opponent desire outran performance when the highest break on either side is six and the average break two matters progress with more stateliness than speed at last when the hands of the clock both pointed to the figure eleven pringle whose score had been at ninetyeight since halfpast ten found himself within two inches of his opponents ball which was tottering on the very edge of the pocket he administered the coup de grace with the air of a john roberts and retired triumphant while the charchester representatives pointed out that as their score was at seventyfour they had really won a moral victory by four points to which specious and unsportsmanlike piece of sophistry pringle turned a deaf ear  it was now too late for any serious literary efforts no bard can do without his sleep even homer used to nod at times so pringle contented himself with reading through the poem which consisted of some thirty lines and copying the same down on a sheet of notepaper for future reference after which he went to bed  in order to arrive at beckford in time for morning school he had to start from the house at eight oclock punctually this left little time for poetical lights the consequence was that when lorimer on the following afternoon demanded the poem as per contract all that pringle had to show was the copy which he had made of the poem in the book there was a moments suspense while conscience and sheer wickedness fought the matter out inside him and then conscience which had started on the encounter without enthusiasm being obviously flabby and out of condition threw up the sponge  here you are said pringle its only a rough copy but here it is  lorimer perused it hastily  but i say he observed in surprised and awestruck tones this is rather good  it seemed to strike him as quite a novel idea yes not bad is it  but itll get the prize  oh we shall have to prevent that somehow  he did not mention how and lorimer did not ask  well anyhow said lorimer thanks awfully i hope youve not fagged about it too much  oh no said pringle airily rather not its been no trouble at all  he thus it will be noticed concluded a painful and immoral scene by speaking perfect truth a most gratifying reflection     12  we the undersigned   norris kept his word with regard to the bishops exclusion from the eleven the team which had beaten the obs had not had the benefit of his assistance lorimer appearing in his stead lorimer was a fast righthand bowler deadly in house matches or on a very bad wicket he was the mainstay of the second eleven attack and in an ordinary year would have been certain of his first eleven cap this season however with gosling baynes and the bishop the school had been unusually strong and lorimer had had to wait  the nonappearance of his name on the noticeboard came as no surprise to gethryn he had had the advantage of listening to norriss views on the subject but when marriott grasped the facts of the case he went to norris and raved norris as is right and proper in the captain of a school team when the wisdom of his actions is called into question treated him with no respect whatever  its no good talking he said when marriott had finished a brisk opening speech i know perfectly well what im doing  then theres no excuse for you at all said marriott if you were mad or delirious i could understand it  come and have an ice said norris  ice snorted marriott whats the good of standing there babbling about ices do you know we havent beaten the obs for four years  we shall beat them this year  not without gethryn  we certainly shant beat them with gethryn because hes not going to play a chap who chooses the day of the mcc match to go off for the afternoon and then refuses to explain can consider himself jolly well chucked until further notice feel ready for that ice yet  dont be an ass  well if ever you do get any ice take my tip and tie it carefully round your head in a handkerchief then perhaps youll be able to see why gethryn isnt playing against the obs on saturday  and marriott went off raging and did not recover until late in the afternoon when he made eightythree in an hour for leicesters house in a scratch game  there were only three of the eleven houses whose occupants seriously expected to see the house cricket cup on the mantelpiece of their diningroom at the end of the season these were the school house jephsons and leicesters in view of pringles sensational feats throughout the term the knowing ones thought that the cup would go to the school house with leicesters runnersup the various members of the first eleven were pretty evenly distributed throughout the three houses leicesters had gethryn reece and marriott jephsons relied on norris bruce and baker the school house trump card was pringle with lorimer and baynes to do the bowling and hill of the first eleven and kynaston and langdale of the second to back him up in the batting department both the other first eleven men were day boys  the presence of gosling in any of the house elevens however weak on paper would have lent additional interest to the fight for the cup for in house matches where every team has more or less of a tail one really good fast bowler can make a surprising amount of difference to a side  there was a great deal of interest in the school about the house cup the keenest of all games at big schools are generally the house matches when beckford met charchester or any of the four schools which it played at cricket and football keenness reached its highest pitch but next to these came the house matches  now that he no longer played for the eleven the bishop was able to give his whole mind to training the house team in the way it should go exclusion from the first eleven meant also that he could no longer unless possessed of an amount of sangfroid so colossal as almost to amount to genius put in an appearance at the first eleven net under these circumstances leicesters net summoned him like mr phil mays lady when she was ejected with perfect justice by a barman he went somewhere where he would be respected to the house then he devoted himself and scratch games and beforebreakfast fieldouts became the order of the day  house fielding before breakfast is one of the things which cannot be classed under the head of the lighter side of cricket you get up in the small hours dragged from a comfortable bed by some sportsman who you feel carries enthusiasm to a point where it ceases to be a virtue and becomes a nuisance you get into flannels and still half asleep stagger off to the field where a hired ruffian hits you up catches which bite like serpents and sting like adders from time to time he adds insult to injury by shouting get to em get to ema remark which finds but one parallel in the language the keep moving of the football captain altogether there are many more pleasant occupations than early morning fieldouts and it requires a considerable amount of keenness to carry the victim through them without hopelessly souring his nature and causing him to foster uncharitable thoughts towards his house captain  j monk of leicesters found this increased activity decidedly uncongenial he had no real patriotism in him he played cricket well but he played entirely for himself  if for instance he happened to make fifty in a matchand it happened fairly frequentlyhe vastly preferred that the rest of the side should make ten between them than that there should be any more halfcenturies on the score sheet even at the expense of losing the match it was not likely therefore that he would take kindly to this mortification of the flesh the sole object of which was to make everybody as conspicuous as everybody else besides in the matter of fielding he considered that he had nothing to learn which as euclid would say was absurd fielding is one of the things which is never perfect  monk moreover had another reason for disliking the fieldouts gethryn as captain of the house team was naturally master of the ceremonies and monk objected to gethryn for this dislike he had solid reasons about a fortnight after the commencement of term the bishop going downstairs from his study one afternoon was aware of what appeared to be a species of free fight going on in the doorway of the senior dayroom the senior dayroom was where the rowdy element of the house collected the individuals who were too old to be fags and too low down in the school to own studies  under ordinary circumstances the bishop would probably have passed on without investigating the matter a head of a house hates above all things to get a name for not minding his own business in unimportant matters such a reputation tells against him when he has to put his foot down over big things to have invaded the senior dayroom and stopped a conventional senior dayroom rag would have been interfering with the most cherished rights of the citizens the freedom which is the birthright of every englishman so to speak  but as he passed the door which had just shut with a bang behind the free fighters he heard monks voice inside and immediately afterwards the voice of danvers and he stopped in the first place he reasoned within himself if monk and danvers were doing anything it was probably something wrong and ought to be stopped gethryn always had the feeling that it was his duty to go and see what monk and danvers were doing and tell them they mustnt he had a profound belief in their irreclaimable villainy in the second place having studies of their own they had no business to be in the senior dayroom at all it was contrary to the etiquette of the house for a study man to enter the senior dayroom and as a rule the senior dayroom resented it as to all appearances they were not resenting it now the obvious conclusion was that something was going on which ought to cease  the bishop opened the door etiquette did not compel the head of the house to knock the rule being that you knocked only at the doors of those senior to you in the house he was consequently enabled to witness a tableau which if warning had been received of his coming would possibly have broken up before he entered in the centre of the group was wilson leaning over the study table not so much as if he liked so leaning as because he was held in that position by danvers in the background stood monk armed with a walkingstick round the walls were various ornaments of the senior dayroom in attitudes of expectant attention being evidently content to play the part of friends and retainers leaving the leading parts in the hands of monk and his colleague  hullo said the bishop whats going on  its all right old chap said monk grinning genially were only having an execution  whats the row said the bishop whats wilson been doing  nothing broke in that youth who had wriggled free from danverss clutches i havent done a thing gethryn these beasts lugged me out of the junior dayroom without saying what for or anything  the bishop began to look dangerous this had all the outward aspect of a case of bullying under reynoldss leadership leicesters had gone in rather extensively for bullying and the bishop had waited hungrily for a chance of catching somebody actively engaged in the sport so that he might drop heavily on that person and make life unpleasant for him  well he said turning to monk lets have it what was it all about and what have you got to do with it  monk began to shuffle  oh it was nothing much he said  then what are you doing with the stick pursued the bishop relentlessly  young wilson cheeked perkins said monk  murmurs of approval from the senior dayroom perkins was one of the ornaments referred to above  how asked gethryn  wilson dashed into the conversation again  perkins told me to go and get him some grub from the shop i was doing some work so i couldnt besides im not his fag if perkins wants to go for me why doesnt he do it himself and not get about a hundred fellows to help him  exactly said the bishop a very sensible suggestion perkins fall upon wilson and slay him ill see fair play go ahead  erno said perkins uneasily he was a small weedylooking youth not built for fighting except by proxy and he remembered the episode of wilson and skinner  then the things finished said gethryn wilson walks over we neednt detain you wilson  wilson departed with all the honours of war and the bishop turned to monk  now perhaps youll tell me he said what the deuce you and danvers are doing here  well hang it all old chap  the bishop begged that monk would not call him old chap  ill call you sir if you like said monk  a gleam of hope appeared in the bishops eye monk was going to give him the opportunity he had long sighed for in cold blood he could attack no one not even monk but if he was going to be rude that altered matters  what business have you in the dayroom he said youve got studies of your own  if it comes to that said monk so have you weve got as much business here as you what the deuce are you doing here  taken by itself taken neat as it were this repartee might have been insufficient to act as a casus belli but by a merciful dispensation of providence the senior dayroom elected to laugh at the remark and to laugh loudly monk also laughed not however for long the next moment the bishop had darted in knocked his feet from under him and dragged him to the door captain kettle himself could not have done it more neatly  now said the bishop we can discuss the point  monk got up looking greener than usual and began to dust his clothes  dont talk rot he said i cant fight a prefect  this of course the bishop had known all along what he had intended to do if monk had kept up his end he had not decided when he embarked upon the engagement the head of a house cannot fight bybattles with his inferiors without the loss of a good deal of his painfully acquired dignity but gethryn knew monk and he had felt justified in risking it he improved the shining hour with an excursus on the subject of bullying dispensed a few general threats and left the room  monk hadperhaps not unnaturallynot forgotten the incident and now that public opinion ran strongly against gethryn on account of his mcc match manoeuvres he acted a mass meeting of the mob was called in his study and it was unanimously voted that fieldouts in the morning were undesirable and that it would be judicious if the team were to strike now as the mob included in their numbers eight of the house eleven their opinions on the subject carried weight  look here said waterford struck with a brilliant idea i tell you what well do lets sign a roundrobin refusing to play in the house matches unless gethryn resigns the captaincy and the fieldouts stop  we may as well sign in alphabetical order said monk prudently itll make it safer  the idea took the mobs fancy the roundrobin was drawn up and signed  now if we could only get reece suggested danvers its no good asking marriott but reece might sign  lets have a shot at any rate said monk  and a deputation consisting of danvers waterford and monk duly waited upon reece in his study and broached the project to him     13  leicesters house team goes into a second edition   reece was working when the deputation entered he looked up enquiringly but if he was pleased to see his visitors he managed to conceal the fact  oh i say reece began monk who had constituted himself spokesman to the expedition are you busy  yes said reece simply going on with his writing  this might have discouraged some people but nature had equipped monk with a tough skin which hints never pierced he dropped into a chair crossed his legs and coughed danvers and waterford leaned in picturesque attitudes against the door and mantelpiece there was a silence for a minute during which reece continued to write unmoved  take a seat monk he said at last without looking up  oh er thanks i have said monk i say reece we wanted to speak to you  go ahead then said reece i can listen and write at the same time im doing this prose against time  its about gethryn  whats gethryn been doing  oh i dont know nothing special its about his being captain of the house team the chaps seem to think he ought to resign  which chaps enquired reece laying down his pen and turning round in his chair  the rest of the team you know  why dont they think he ought to be captain the head of the house is always captain of the house team unless hes too bad to be in it at all dont the chaps think gethryns good at cricket  oh hes good enough said monk its more about this mcc match business you know his cutting off like that in the middle of the match the chaps think the house ought to take some notice of it express its disapproval and that sort of thing  and what do the chaps think of doing about it  monk inserted a hand in his breastpocket and drew forth the roundrobin he straightened it out and passed it over to reece  weve drawn up this notice he said and we came to see if youd sign it nearly all the other chaps in the team have  reece perused the document gravely then he handed it back to its owner  what rot said he  i dont think so at all said monk  nor do i broke in danvers speaking for the first time what else can we do we cant let a chap like gethryn stick to the captaincy  why not  a cad like that  thats a matter of opinion i dont suppose everyone thinks him a cad i dont personally  well anyway asked waterford are you going to sign  my good man of course im not do you mean to say you seriously intend to hand in that piffle to gethryn  rather said monk  then youll be making fools of yourselves ill tell you exactly whatll happen if you care to know gethryn will read this rot and simply cut everybody whose name appears on the list out of the house team i dont know if youre aware of it but there are several other fellows besides you in the house and if you come to think of it you arent so awfully good you three are in the second the other five havent got colours at all  anyhow were all in the house team said monk  dont let that worry you said reece you wont be long if you show gethryn that interesting document anything else i can do for you  no thanks said monk and the deputation retired  when they had gone reece made his way to the bishops study it was not likely that the deputation would deliver their ultimatum until late at night when the study would be empty from what reece knew of monk he judged that it would be pleasanter to him to leave the document where the bishop could find it in the morning rather than run the risks that might attend a personal interview there was time therefore to let gethryn know what was going to happen so that he might not be surprised into doing anything rash such as resigning the captaincy for example not that reece thought it likely that he would but it was better to take no risks  both marriott and gethryn were in the study when he arrived  hullo reece said marriott come in and take several seats have  a biscuit have two have a good many  reece helped himself and gave them a brief description of the late interview  im not surprised said gethryn i thought monk would be getting at me somehow soon i shall have to slay that chap someday what ought i to do do you think  my dear chap said marriott theres only one thing you can do cut the lot of them out of the team and fill up with substitutes  reece nodded approval  of course thats what you must do as a matter of fact i told them you would ive given you a reputation you must live up to it  besides continued marriott after all it isnt such a crusher when you come to think of it only four of them are really certainties for their places monk danvers waterford and saunders the rest are simply tail  reece nodded again great minds think alike exactly what i told them only they wouldnt listen  well whom do you suggest instead of them some of the kids are jolly keen and all that but they wouldnt be much good against baynes and lorimer for instance  if i were you said marriott i shouldnt think about their batting at all i should go simply for fielding with a good fielding side we ought to have quite a decent chance theres no earthly reason why you and reece shouldnt put on enough for the first wicket to win all the matches its been done before dont you remember the school house getting the cup four years ago when twiss was captain they had nobody who was any earthly good except twiss and birch and those two used to make about a hundred and fifty between them in every match besides some of the kids can bat rather well wilson for one he can bowl too  yes said the bishop all right stick down wilson who else gregson isnt bad he can field in the slips which is more than a good many chaps can  gregsons good said reece put him down that makes five you might have young lee in too ive seen him play like a book at his form net once or twice  leesix five more wanted wheres a house list here we are now adams bond brown burgess burgess has his points shall i stick him down  not presume to dictate said marriott but adams is streets better than burgess as a field and just as good a bat  why when have you seen him  in a scratch game between his form and another he was carting all over the shop made thirty something  well have both of them in then plenty of room this is the team so far wilson gregson lee adams and burgess with marriott reece and gethryn jolly hot stuff it is too by jove well simply walk that tankard now for the last places i vote we each select a man and nobodys allowed to appeal against the others decision i lead off with crowinshaw good name crowinshaw look well on a score sheet  heave us the list said marriott thanks my dear sir theres only one man in the running at all which his names chamberlain shove down joseph and dont let me hear anyone breathe a word against him come on reece lets have your man i bet reece selects some weird rotter  reece pondered  carstairs he said  oh my very dear sir carstairs  all criticism barred said the bishop  sorry by the way what house are we drawn against in the first round  websters  ripping we can smash websters theyve got nobody itll be rather a good thing having an easy time in our first game we shall be able to get some idea about the teams play i shouldnt think we could possibly get beaten by websters  there was a knock at the door wilson came in with a request that he might fetch a book that he had left in the study  oh wilson just the man i wanted to see said the bishop wilson youre playing against websters next week  by jove said wilson am i really  he had spent days in working out on little slips of paper during school his exact chances of getting a place in the house team recently however he had almost ceased to hope he had reckoned on at least eight of the senior study being chosen before him  yes said the bishop you must buck up practise fielding every minute of your spare time anybodyll hit you up catches if you ask them  right said wilson i will  all right then go and tell lee that i want to see him  lee said the bishop when that worthy appeared i wanted to see you to tell you youre playing for the house against websters thought you might like to know  by jove said lee am i really  yes buck up with your fielding  right said lee  thats all if youre going downstairs you might tell adams to come up  for a quarter of an hour the bishop interviewed the junior members of his team and impressed on each of them the absolute necessity of bucking up with his fielding and each of them protested that the matter should receive his best consideration  well theyre keen enough anyway said marriott as the door closed behind carstairs the last of the new recruits and thats the great thing hullo whos that i thought you had worked through the lot come in  a small form appeared in the doorway carrying in its right hand a neatlyfolded note  monk told me to give you this gethryn  half a second said the bishop as the youth made for the door there may be an answer  monk said there wouldnt be one  oh no its all right there isnt an answer  the door closed the bishop laughed and threw the note over to reece  recognize it  reece examined the paper  its a fair copy the one monk showed me was rather smudged i suppose they thought you might be hurt if you got an inky roundrobin considerate chap monk  lets have a look said marriott by jove i say listen to this bit like macaulay isnt it  he read extracts from the ultimatum  lets have it said gethryn stretching out a hand  not much im going to keep it and have it framed  all right im going down now to put up the list  when he had returned to the study monk and danvers came quietly downstairs to look at the noticeboard it was dark in the passage and monk had to strike a light before he could see to read  by george he said as the match flared up reece was right he has  well theres one consolation commented danvers viciously they cant possibly get that cup now theyll have to put us in again soon you see if they dont  m yes said monk doubtfully     14  norris takes a short holiday   its all rot observed pringle to say that they havent a chance because they have  he and lorimer were passing through the cricketfield on their way back from an early morning visit to the baths and had stopped to look at leicesters house team revised version taking its daily hour of fielding practice they watched the performance keenly and critically as spies in an enemys camp  who said they hadnt a chance said lorimer i didnt  oh everybody the chaps call them the kindergarten and the kids happy league and things of that sort rot i call it they seem to forget that you only want two or three really good men in a team if the rest can field look at our crowd theyve all either got their colours or else are just outside the teams and i swear you cant rely on one of them to hold the merest sitter right into his hands  on the subject of fielding in general and catching in particular pringle was feeling rather sore in the match which his house had just won against brownings he had put himself on to bowl in the second innings he was one of those bowlers who manage to capture from six to ten wickets in the course of a season and the occasions on which he bowled really well were few on this occasion he had bowled excellently and it had annoyed him when five catches five soft gentle catches were missed off him in the course of four overs as he watched the crisp clean fielding which was shown by the very smallest of leicesters small tail he felt that he would rather have any of that despised eight on his side than any of the school house lights except baynes and lorimer  our lots all right really said lorimer in answer to pringles sweeping condemnation everybody has his off days theyll be all right next match  doubt it replied pringle its all very well for you you bowl to hit the sticks i dont now just watch these kids for a moment now look no he couldnt have got to that wait a second now  gethryn had skied one into the deep wilson burgess and carstairs all started for it  burgess called the bishop  the other two stopped dead burgess ran on and made the catch  now there you are said pringle pointing his moral see how those two kids stopped when gethryn called if that had happened in one of our matches youd have had half a dozen men rotting about underneath the ball and getting in one anothers way and then probably winding up by everybody leaving the catch to everybody else  oh come on said lorimer youre getting morbid why the dickens didnt you think of having our fellows out for fielding practice if youre so keen on it  they wouldnt have come when a chap gets colours he seems to think hes bought the place you cant drag a second eleven man out of his bed before breakfast to improve his fielding he thinks it cant be improved theyre a heartbreaking crew  good said lorimer i suppose that includes me  no youre a model man i have seen you hold a catch now and then  thanks oh i say i gave in the poem yesterday i hope the deuce it wont get the prize i hope they wont spot either that i didnt write the thing  not a chance said pringle complacently youre all right dont you worry yourself  websters against whom leicesters had been drawn in the opening round of the house matches had three men in their team and only three who knew how to hold a bat it was the slackest house in the school and always had been it did not cause any overwhelming surprise accordingly when leicesters beat them without fatigue by an innings and a hundred and twentyone runs websters won the toss and made thirtyfive for leicesters reece and gethryn scored fifty and sixtytwo respectively and marriott fiftythree not out they then with two wickets down declared and rattled websters out for seventy the public which had had its eye on the team in order to see how its tail was likely to shape was disappointed the only definite fact that could be gleaned from the match was that the junior members of the team were not to be despised in the field the early morning fieldouts had had their effect adams especially shone while wilson at cover and burgess in the deep recalled jessop and tyldesley  the school made a note of the fact so did the bishop he summoned the eight juniors seriatim to his study and administered much praise coupled with the news that fielding before breakfast would go on as usual  leicesters had drawn against jephsons in the second round norriss lot had beaten cookes by curiously enough almost exactly the same margin as that by which leicesters had defeated websters it was generally considered that this match would decide leicesters chances for the cup if they could beat a really hot team like jephsons it was reasonable to suppose that they would do the same to the rest of the houses though the school house would have to be reckoned with but the school house as pringle had observed was weak in the field it was not a coherent team individually its members were good but they did not play together as leicesters did  but the majority of the school did not think seriously of their chances except for pringle who as has been mentioned before always made a point of thinking differently from everyone else no one really believed that they would win the cup or even appear in the final how could a team whose tail began at the fall of the second wicket defeat teams which like the school house had no real tail at all  norris supported this view it was for this reason that when at breakfast on the day on which jephsons were due to play leicesters he received an invitation from one of his many uncles to spend a weekend at his house he decided to accept it  this uncle was a man of wealth after winning two fortunes on the stock exchange and losing them both he had at length amassed a third with which he retired in triumph to the country leaving throgmorton street to exist as best it could without him he had bought a showplace at a village which lay twenty miles by rail to the east of beckford and it had always been norriss wish to see this showplace a house which was said to combine the hoariest of antiquity with a variety of modern comforts  merely to pay a flying visit there would be good but his uncle held out an additional attraction if norris could catch the oneforty from horton he would arrive just in time to take part in a cricket match that day being the day of the annual encounter with the neighbouring village of pudford the rector of pudford the opposition captain so wrote norriss uncle had by underhand means lured down three really decent players from oxfordnot blues but almostwho had come to the village ostensibly to read classics with him as their coach but in reality for the sole purpose of snatching from little bindlebury his own village the laurels they had so nobly earned the year before he had heard that norris was captaining the beckford team this year and had an average of thirtyeight point nought three two so would he come and make thirtyeight point nought three two for little bindlebury  this thought norris is fame this is where i spread myself i must be in this at any price  he showed the letter to baker  what a pity said baker  whats a pity  that you wont be able to go it seems rather a catch  cant go said norris my dear sir youre talking through your hat think im going to refuse an invitation like this not if i know it im going to toddle off to jephson get an exeat and catch that oneforty and if i dont paralyse the pudford bowling ill shoot myself  but the house match leicesters this afternoon gurgled the amazed baker  oh hang leicesters surely the rest of you can lick the kids happy league without my help if you cant you ought to be ashamed of yourselves ive chosen you a wicket with my own hands fit to play a test match on  of course we ought to lick them but you can never tell at cricket whats going to happen we oughtnt to run any risks when weve got such a good chance of winning the pot why its centuries since we won the pot dont you go  i must man its the chance of a lifetime  baker tried another method of attack  besides he said you dont suppose jephsonll let you off to play in a beastly little village game when theres a house match on  he must never know hissed norris after the manner of the surreyside villain  hes certain to ask why you want to get off so early  i shall tell him my uncle particularly wishes me to come early  suppose he asks why  i shall say i cant possibly imagine  oh well if youre going to tell lies  not at all merely a diplomatic evasion im not bound to go and sob out my secrets on jephsons waistcoat  baker gave up the struggle with a sniff norris went to mr jephson and got leave to spend the weekend at his uncles the interview went without a hitch as norris had prophesied  you will miss the house match norris then said mr jephson  im afraid so sir but mr leicesters are very weak  hm reece marriott and gethryn are a good beginning  yes sir but theyve got nobody else their tail starts after those three  very well but it seems a pity  thank you sir said norris wisely refraining from discussing the matter he had got his exeat which was what he had come for  in all the annals of pudford and little bindlebury cricket there had never been such a match as that years the rector of pudford and his three oxford experts performed prodigies with the bat prodigies that is to say judged from the standpoint of ordinary pudford scoring where double figures were the exception rather than the rule  the rector an elderly benevolentlooking gentleman played with astounding caution and still more remarkable luck for seventeen finally after he had been in an hour and ten minutes midon accepted the eighth easy chance offered to him and the ecclesiastic had to retire the three varsity men knocked up a hundred between them and the complete total was no less than a hundred and thirtyfour  then came the sensation of the day after three wickets had fallen for ten runs norris and the little bindlebury curate an old cantab stayed together and knocked off the deficit  norriss contribution of seventyeight not out was for many a day the sole topic of conversation over the evening pewter at the little bindlebury arms a nonenthusiast who tried on one occasion to introduce the topic of farmer giless grey pig found himself the most unpopular man in the village  on the monday morning norris returned to jephsons with pride in his heart and a sovereign in his pocket the latter the gift of his excellent uncle  he had had he freely admitted to himself a good time his uncle had done him well exceedingly well and he looked forward to going to the showplace again in the near future in the meantime he felt a languid desire to know how the house match was going on they must almost have finished the first innings he thoughtunless jephsons had run up a very big score and kept their opponents in the field all the afternoon  hullo baker he said tramping breezily into the study ive had the time of a lifetime great simply no other word for it hows the match getting on  baker looked up from the book he was reading  what match he enquired coldly  house match of course you lunatic what match did you think i meant hows it going on  its not going on said baker its stopped  you neednt be a funny goat said norris complainingly you know what i mean what happened on saturday  they won the toss began baker slowly  yes  and went in and made a hundred and twenty  good i told you they were no use a hundred and twentys rotten  then we went in and made twentyone  hundred and twentyone  no just a simple twentyone without any trimmings of any sort  but man how why how on earth did it happen  gethryn took eight for nine does that seem to make it any clearer  eight for nine rot  show you the scoresheet if you care to see it in the second innings  oh you began a second innings  yes we also finished it we scored rather freely in the second innings ten was on the board before the fifth wicket fell in the end we fairly collared the bowling and ran up a total of fortyeight  norris took a seat and tried to grapple with the situation  fortyeight look here baker swear youre not ragging  baker took a green scoringbook from the shelf and passed it to him  look for yourself he said  norris looked he looked long and earnestly then he handed the book back  then theyve won he said blankly  how do you guess these things observed baker with some bitterness  well you are a crew said norris getting out for twentyone and fortyeight i see gethryn got nine for thirty in the second innings he seems to have been on the spot i suppose the wicket suited him  if you can call it a wicket next time you specially select a pitch for the house to play on i wish youd hunt up something with some slight pretensions to decency  why what was wrong with the pitch it was a bit worn that was all  if said baker you call having holes three inches deep just where every ball pitches being a bit worn i suppose it was anyhow it would have been almost as well dont you think if youd stopped and played for the house instead of going off to your rotten village match you were sick enough when gethryn went off in the mcc match  oh curse said norris  for he had been hoping against hope that the parallel nature of the two incidents would be less apparent to other people than it was to himself  and so it came about that leicesters passed successfully through the first two rounds and soared into the dizzy heights of the semifinal     15  versus charchester at charchester   from the fact that he had left his team so basely in the lurch on the day of an important match a casual observer might have imagined that norris did not really care very much whether his house won the cup or not but this was not the case in reality the success of jephsons was a very important matter to him a sudden whim had induced him to accept his uncles invitation but now that that acceptance had had such disastrous results he felt inclined to hire a sturdy menial by the hour to kick him till he felt better to a person in such a frame of mind there are three methods of consolation he can commit suicide he can take to drink or he can occupy his mind with other matters and cure himself by fixing his attention steadily on some object and devoting his whole energies to the acquisition of the same  norris chose the last method on the saturday week following his performance for little bindlebury the beckford eleven was due to journey to charchester to play the return match against that school on their opponents ground and norris resolved that that match should be won for the next week the team practised assiduously those members of it who were not playing in house matches spending every afternoon at the nets the treatment was not without its effect the team had been a good one before now every one of the eleven seemed to be at the very summit of his powers new and hitherto unsuspected strokes began to be developed leg glances which recalled the hove and ranjitsinhji late cuts of palairetical brilliance in short all nature may be said to have smiled and by the end of the week norris was beginning to be almost cheerful once more and then on the monday before the match samuel wilberforce gosling came to school with his right arm in a sling norris met him at the school gates rubbed his eyes to see whether it was not after all some horrid optical illusion and finally when the stern truth came home to him almost swooned with anguish  what how why he enquired lucidly  the injured samuel smiled feebly  im fearfully sorry norris he said  dont say you cant play on saturday moaned norris  frightfully sorry i know its a bit of a sickener but i dont see how i can really the doctor says i shant be able to play for a couple of weeks  now that the blow had definitely fallen norris was sufficiently himself again to be able to enquire into the matter  how on earth did you do it how did it happen  gosling looked guiltier than ever  it was on saturday evening he said we were ragging about at home a bit you know and my young sister wanted me to send her down a few balls somebody had given her a composition bean and a bat and shes been awfully keen on the game ever since she got them  i think its simply sickening the way girls want to do everything we do said norris disgustedly  gosling spoke for the defence  well shes only thirteen you cant blame the kid seemed to me a jolly healthy symptom laudable ambition and that sort of thing  well  well i sent down one or two she played em like a book bit inclined to pull all girls are so i put in a long hop on the off and she let go at it like jessop shes got a rattling stroke in midons direction well the bean came whizzing back rather wide on the right i doubled across to bring off a beefy candb and the bally thing took me right on the tips of the fingers those composition balls hurt like blazes i can tell you smashed my second finger simply into hash and i couldnt grip a ball now to save my life much less bowl im awfully sorry its a shocking nuisance  norris agreed with him it was more than a nuisance it was a staggerer now that gethryn no longer figured for the first eleven gosling was the schools one hope baynes was good on his wicket but the wickets he liked were the seaofmud variety and this summer fine weather had set in early and continued lorimer was also useful but not to be mentioned in the same breath as the great samuel the former was good the latter would be good in a year or so his proper sphere of action was the tail if the first pair of bowlers could dismiss five good batsmen lorimers fast straight deliveries usually accounted for the rest but there had to be somebody to pave the way for him he was essentially a change bowler it is hardly to be wondered at that norris very soon began to think wistfully of the bishop who was just now doing such great things with the ball wasting his sweetness on the desert air of the house matches would it be consistent with his dignity to invite him back into the team it was a nice point with some persons there might be a risk but gethryn as he knew perfectly well was not the sort of fellow to rub in the undeniable fact that the school team could not get along without him he had half decided to ask him to play against charchester when gosling suggested the very same thing  why dont you have gethryn in again he said youve stood him out against the obs and the masters surely thats enough especially as hes miles the best bowler in the school  bar yourself  not a bit he can give me points you take my tip and put him in again  think hed play if i put him down because you know im dashed if im going to do any grovelling and that sort of thing  certain to i should think anyhow its worth trying  pringle on being consulted gave the same opinion and norris was convinced the list went up that afternoon and for the first time since the mcc match gethryns name appeared in its usual place  norris is learning wisdom in his old age said marriott to the bishop as they walked over to the house that evening  leicesters were in the middle of their semifinal and looked like winning it  i was just wondering what to do about it said gethryn what would you do play do you think  play my dear man what else did you propose to do you werent thinking of refusing  i was  but man thats rank treason if youre put down to play for the school you must play theres no question about it if norris knocked you down with one hand and put you up on the board with the other youd have to play all the same you mustnt have any feelings where the school is concerned nobodys ever refused to play in a first match its one of the things you cant do norris hasnt given you much of a time lately i admit still you must lump that excuse sermon i hope its done you good  very well ill play its rather rot though  no its all right really its only that youve got into a groove youre so used to doing the heavy martyr that the sudden change has knocked you out rather come and have an ice before the shop shuts  so gethryn came once more into the team and travelled down to charchester with the others and at this point a painful alternative faces me i have to choose between truth and inclination i should like to say that the bishop eclipsed himself and broke all previous records in the charchester match by the rules of the dramatic nothing else is possible but truth though it crush me and truth compels me to admit that his performance was in reality distinctly mediocre one of his weak points as a bowler was that he was at sea when opposed to a lefthander many bowlers have this failing some strange power seems to compel them to bowl solely on the leg side and nothing but long hops and full pitches it was so in the case of gethryn charchester won the toss and batted first on a perfect wicket the first pair of batsmen were the captain a great bat who had scored seventythree not out against beckford in the previous match and a lefthanded fiend bayness legbreaks were useless on a wicket which from the hardness of it might have been constructed of asphalt and the rubbish the bishop rolled up to the lefthanded artiste was painful to witness at four oclockthe match had started at halfpast eleventhe charchester captain reached his century and was almost immediately stumped off baynes the bishop bowled the next man first ball the one bright spot in his afternoons performance then came another long stand against which the beckford bowling raged in vain at five oclock charchester by that time having made two hundred and fortyone for two wickets the lefthander ran into three figures and the captain promptly declared the innings closed beckfords only chance was to play for a draw and in this they succeeded when stumps were drawn at a quarter to seven the score was a hundred and three and five wickets were down the bishop had the satisfaction of being not out with twentyeight to his credit but nothing less than a century would have been sufficient to soothe him after his shocking bowling performance pringle who during the luncheon interval had encountered his young friends the ashbys and had been duly taunted by them on the subject of leatherhunting was top scorer with fortyone norris i regret to say only made three running himself out in his second over as the misfortune could not by any stretch of imagination be laid at anybody elses door but his own he was decidedly savage the team returned to beckford rather footsore very disgusted and abnormally silent norris sulked by himself at one end of the saloon carriage and the bishop sulked by himself at the other end and even marriott forbore to treat the situation lightly it was a mournful homecoming no cheering wildly as the brake drove to the college from horton no shouting of the school song in various keys as they passed through the big gates simply silence and except when putting him on to bowl or taking him off or moving him in the field norris had not spoken a word to the bishop the whole afternoon  it was shortly after this disaster that mr mortimer wells came to stay with the headmaster mr mortimer wells was a brilliant and superior young man who was at some pains to be a cynic he was an old pupil of the heads in the days before he had succeeded to the rule of beckford he had the reputation of being a ripe scholar and to him had been deputed the task of judging the poetical outbursts of the bards of the upper fifth with the object of awarding to the most deservingor perhaps to the least undeservingthe handsome prize bequeathed by his openhanded highness the rajah of seltzerpore  this gentleman sat with his legs stretched beneath the headmasters generous table dinner had come to an end and a cup of coffee acting in cooperation with several glasses of port and an excellent cigar had inspired him to hold forth on the subject of poetry prizes he held forth  the poetry prize system said heit is astonishing what nonsense a man ordinarily intelligent will talk after dinneris on exactly the same principle as those pennyintheslot machines that you see at stations you insert your penny you set your prize subject in the former case you hope for wax vestas and you get butterscotch in the latter you hope for something at least readable and you get the most complete terrible uninspired twaddle that was ever written on paper the boy mindhere the ash of his cigar fell off on to his waistcoatthe merely boy mind is incapable of poetry  from which speech the shrewd reader will infer that mr mortimer wells was something of a prig and perhaps altogether shrewd reader youre right  mr lawrie the master of the sixth who had been asked to dinner to meet the great man disagreed as a matter of principle he was one of those men who will take up a cause from pure love of argument  i think youre wrong sir im perfectly convinced youre wrong  mr wells smiled in his superior way as if to say that it was a pity that mr lawrie was so foolish but that perhaps he could not help it  ah he said but you have not had to wade through over thirty of these gems in a single week i have i can assure you your views would undergo a change if you could go through what i have let me read you a selection if that does not convert you nothing will if you will excuse me for a moment beckett i will leave the groaning board and fetch the manuscripts  he left the room and returned with a pile of paper which he deposited in front of him on the table  now he said selecting the topmost manuscript i will take no unfair advantage i will read you the very pick of the bunch none of the othererpoems come within a long way of this it is a case of eclipse first and the rest nowhere the author the gifted author is a boy of the name of lorimer whom i congratulate on taking the rajahs prize i drain this cup of coffee to him are you ready now then  he cleared his throat     16  a disputed authorship   one moment said mr lawrie might i ask what is the subject of the poem  death of dido said the headmaster good hackneyed evergreen subject mellow with years go on wells  mr wells began      queen of tyre ancient tyre       whilom mistress of the wave  mr lawrie who had sunk back into the recesses of his chair in an attitude of attentive repose sat up suddenly with a start  what he cried  hullo said mr wells has the beauty of the work come home to you already  you notice he said as he repeated the couplet that flaws begin to appear in the gem right from the start it was rash of master lorimer to attempt such a difficult metre plucky but rash he should have stuck to blank verse tyre you notice two syllables to rhyme with deny her in line three what did fortune eer deny her were not all her warriors brave that last line seems to me distinctly weak i dont know how it strikes you  youre hypercritical wells said the head now for a boy i consider that a very good beginning what do you say lawrie  ier oh i think i am hardly a judge  to resume said mr mortimer wells he resumed and ran through the remaining verses of the poem with comments when he had finished he remarked that in his opinion a whiff of fresh air would not hurt him if the headmaster would excuse him he would select another of those excellent cigars and smoke it out of doors  by all means said the head i think i wont join you myself but perhaps lawrie will  no thank you i think i will remain yes i think i will remain  mr wells walked jauntily out of the room when the door had shut mr lawrie coughed nervously  another cigar lawrie  ierno thank you i want to ask you a question what is your candid opinion of those verses mr wells was reading just now  the headmaster laughed  i dont think wells treated them quite fairly in my opinion they were distinctly promising for a boy in the upper fifth you understand yes on the whole they showed distinct promise  they were mine said mr lawrie  yours i dont understand how were they yours  i wrote them every word of them  you wrote them but my dear lawrie  i dont wonder that you are surprised for my own part i am amazed simply amazed how the boyi dont even remember his namecontrived to get hold of them i have not the slightest conception but that he did so contrive is certain the poem is word for word literally word for word the same as one which i wrote when i was at cambridge  you dont say so  yes it can hardly be a coincidence  hardly said the head are you certain of this  perfectly certain i am not eager to claim the authorship i can assure you especially after mr wellss very outspoken criticisms but there is nothing else to be done the poem appeared more than a dozen years ago in a small book called the dark horse  ah something in the whyte melville style i suppose  no said mr lawrie sharply no certainly not they were serious poems tragical most of them i had them collected and published them at my own expense very much at my own expense i used a pseudonym i am thankful to say as far as i could ascertain the total sale amounted to eight copies i have never felt the very slightest inclination to repeat the performance but how this boy managed to see the book is more than i can explain he can hardly have bought it the price was halfaguinea and there is certainly no copy in the school library the thing is a mystery  a mystery that must be solved said the headmaster the fact remains that he did see the book and it is very serious wholesale plagiarism of this description should be kept for the school magazine it should not be allowed to spread to poetry prizes i must see lorimer about this tomorrow perhaps he can throw some light upon the matter  when in the course of morning school next day the school porter entered the upper fifth formroom and informed mr sims who was engaged in trying to drive the beauties of plautus colloquial style into the upper fifth brain that the headmaster wished to see lorimer lorimers conscience was so abnormally good that for the life of him he could not think why he had been sent for as far as he could remember there was no possible way in which the authorities could get at him if he had been in the habit of smoking out of bounds in lonely fields and deserted barns he might have felt uneasy but whatever his failings that was not one of them it could not be anything about bounds because he had been so busy with cricket that he had had no time to break them this term he walked into the presence glowing with conscious rectitude and no sooner was he inside than the headmaster with three simple words took every particle of starch out of his anatomy  sit down lorimer he said  there are many ways of inviting a person to seat himself the genial take a pew of ones equal inspires confidence the raucous sit down in front of the frenzied pit when you stand up to get a better view of the stage is not so pleasant but worst of all is the icy sit down of the annoyed headmaster in his mouth the words take to themselves new and sinister meanings they seem to accuse you of nameless crimes and to warn you that anything you may say will be used against you as evidence  why have i sent for you lorimer  a nasty question that and a very favourite one of the rev mr beckett headmaster of beckford in nine cases out of ten the person addressed paralysed with nervousness would give himself away upon the instant and confess everything lorimer however was saved by the fact that he had nothing to confess he stifled an inclination to reply because the woodpecker would peck her or words to that effect and maintained a pallid silence  have you ever heard of a book called the dark horse lorimer  lorimer began to feel that the conversation was too deep for him after opening in the conventional judgethenplacedtheblackcaponhishead manner his assailant had suddenly begun to babble lightly of sporting literature he began to entertain doubts of the headmasters sanity it would not have added greatly to his mystification if the head had gone on to insist that he was the emperor of peru and worked solely by electricity  the headmaster for his part was also surprised he had worked for dismay conscious guilt confessions and the like instead of blank amazement he too began to have his doubts had mr lawrie been mistaken it was not likely but it was barely possible in which case the interview had better be brought to an abrupt stop until he had made inquiries the situation was at a deadlock  fortunately at this point halfpast twelve struck and the bell rang for the end of morning school the situation was saved and the tension relaxed  you may go lorimer said the head i will send for you later  he swept out of the room and lorimer raced over to the house to inform pringle that the headmaster had run suddenly mad and should by rights be equipped with a straitwaistcoat  you never saw such a man he said hauled me out of school in the middle of a plautus lesson dumps me down in a chair and then asks me if ive read some weird sporting novel or other  sporting novel my dear man  well it sounded like it from the title  the title oh  whats up  pringle had leaped to his feet as if he had suddenly discovered that he was sitting on something redhot his normal air of superior calm had vanished he was breathless with excitement a sudden idea had struck him with the force of a bullet  what was the title he asked you if youd read the book of he demanded incoherently  the derby winner  pringle sat down again relieved  oh are you certain  no of course it wasnt that i was only ragging the real title was the dark horse hullo whats up now have you got em too  whats up ill tell you were done for absolutely pipped thats whats the matter  hang it man do give us a chance why cant you explain instead of sitting there talking like that why are we done what have we done anyway  the poem of course the prize poem i forgot i never told you i hadnt time to write anything of my own so i cribbed it straight out of a book called the dark horse now do you see  lorimer saw he grasped the whole unpainted beauty of the situation in a flash and for some moments it rendered him totally unfit for intellectual conversation when he did speak his observation was brief but it teemed with condensed meaning it was the conversational parallel to the ox in the teacup  my aunt he said  therell be a row about this said pringle  what am i to say when he has me in this afternoon he said he would  let the whole thing out no good trying to hush it up he may let us down easy if youre honest about it  it relieved lorimer to hear pringle talk about us it meant that he was not to be left to bear the assault alone which considering that the whole trouble was strictly speaking pringles fault was only just  but how am i to explain i cant reel off a long yarn all about how you did it all and so on it would be too low  i know said pringle ive got it look here on your way to the old mans room you pass the remove door well when you pass drop some money ill be certain to hear it as i sit next the door and then ill ask to leave the room and well go up together  good man pringle youre a genius thanks awfully  but as it happened this crafty scheme was not found necessary the blow did not fall till after lockup  lorimer being in the headmasters house it was possible to interview him without the fuss and advertisement inseparable from a sending for during school just as he was beginning his nightwork the butler came with a message that he was wanted in the headmasters part of the house  it was only mr lorimer as the master wished to see said the butler as pringle rose to accompany his companion in crime  thats all right said pringle the headmasters always glad to see me ive got a standing invitation hell understand  at first when he saw two where he had only sent for one the headmaster did not understand at all and said so he had prepared to annihilate lorimer hip and thigh for he was now convinced that his blank astonishment at the mention of the dark horse during their previous interview had been in the words of the bard a mere veneer a wile of guile since the morning he had seen mr lawrie again and had with his own eyes compared the two poems the printed and the written the author by special request having hunted up a copy of that valuable work the dark horse from the depths of a cupboard in his rooms  his astonishment melted before pringles explanation which was brief and clear and gave way to righteous wrath in wellchosen terms he harangued the two criminals finally he perorated  there is only one point which tells in your favour you have not attempted concealment pringle nudged lorimer surreptitiously at this and i may add that i believe that as you say you did not desire actually to win the prize by underhand means but i cannot overlook such an offence it is serious most serious you will both of you go into extra lesson for the remaining saturdays of the term  extra lesson meant that instead of taking a halfholiday on saturday like an ordinary lawabiding individual you treated the day as if it were a fullschool day and worked from two till four under the eye of the headmaster taking into consideration everything the punishment was not an extraordinarily severe one for there were only two more saturdays to the end of term and the sentence made no mention of the wednesday halfholidays  but in effect it was serious indeed it meant that neither pringle nor lorimer would be able to play in the final house match against leicesters which was fixed to begin on the next saturday at two oclock among the rules governing the house matches was one to the effect that no house might start a match with less than eleven men nor might the eleven be changed during the progress of the matcha rule framed by the headmaster not wholly without an eye to emergencies like the present  thank goodness said pringle that there arent any more first matches its bad enough though by jove as it is i suppose its occurred to you that this cuts us out of playing in the final  lorimer said the point had not escaped his notice  i wish he observed with simple pathos that id got the rajah of seltzerpore here now id strangle him i wonder if the old man realizes that hes done his own house out of the cup  wouldnt care if he did still its a sickening nuisance leicesters are a cert now  absolute cert said lorimer baynes cant do all the bowling especially on a hard wicket and theres nobody else as for our batting and fielding  dont saidpringle gloomily its too awful  on the following saturday leicesters ran up a total in their first innings which put the issue out of doubt and finished off the game on the monday by beating the school house by six wickets     17  the winter term   it was the first day of the winter term  the bishop as he came back by express could not help feeling that after all life considered as an institution had its points things had mended steadily during the last weeks of the term he had kept up his end as head of the house perfectly the internal affairs of leicesters were going as smoothly as oil and there was the cricket cup to live up to nothing pulls a house together more than beating all comers in the field especially against odds as leicesters had done and then monk and danvers had left that had set the finishing touch to a good terms work the mob were no longer a power in the land waterford remained but a subdued benevolent waterford with a wonderful respect for law and order yes as far as the house was concerned gethryn felt no apprehensions as regarded the school at large things were bound to come right in time a school has very little memory and in the present case the bishop being second man in the fifteen had unusual opportunities of righting himself in the eyes of the multitude in the winter term cricket is forgotten football is the only game that counts  and to round off the whole thing when he entered his study he found a letter on the table it was from farnie and revealed two curious and interesting facts firstly he had left and beckford was to know him no more secondlythis was even more remarkablehe possessed a conscience  dear gethryn ran the letter i am writing to tell you my father is sending me to a school in france so i shall not come back to beckford i am sorry about the mcc match and i enclose the four pounds you lent me i utterly bar the idea of going to france its beastly yours truly r farnie  the money mentioned was in the shape of a cheque signed by farnie senior  gethryn was distinctly surprised that all this time remorse like a worm i the bud should have been feeding upon his uncles damask cheek as it were he had never suspected his relatives demeanour since the mcc match had it is true been considerably toned down but this he had attributed to natural causes not unnatural ones like conscience as for the four pounds he had set it down as a bad debt to get it back was like coming suddenly into an unexpected fortune he began to think that there must have been some good in farnie after all though he was fain to admit that without the aid of a microscope the human eye might well have been excused for failing to detect it  his next thought was that there was nothing now to prevent him telling the whole story to reece and marriott reece if anybody deserved to have his curiosity satisfied the way in which he had abstained from questions at the time of the episode had been nothing short of magnificent reece must certainly be told  neither reece nor marriott had arrived at the moment both were in the habit of returning at the latest possible hour except at the beginning of the summer term the bishop determined to reserve his story until the following evening  accordingly when the study kettle was hissing on the etna and wilson was crouching in front of the fire making toast in his own inimitable style he embarked upon his narrative  i say marriott  hullo  do you notice a subtle change in me this term does my expressive purple eye gleam more brightly than of yore it does exactly so i feel awfully bucked up you know that kid farnie has left  i thought i missed his merry prattle whats happened to him  gone to a school in france somewhere  jolly for france  awfully but the point is that now hes gone i can tell you about that mcc match affair i know you want to hear what really did happen that afternoon  marriott pointed significantly at wilson whose back was turned  oh thats all right said gethryn wilson  yes  you mustnt listen try and think youre a piece of furniture see and if you do happen to overhear anything you neednt go gassing about it follow  all right said wilson and gethryn told his tale  jove he said as he finished thats a relief its something to have got that off my chest i do bar keeping a secret  but i say said marriott  well  well it was beastly good of you to do it and that sort of thing i suppose i see that all right but my dear man what a rotten thing to do a kid like that a little beast who simply cried out for sacking  well at any rate its over now you neednt jump on me i acted from the best motives thats what my grandfather farnies pater you know always used to say when he got at me for anything in the happy days of my childhood dont sit there looking like a beastly churchwarden you ass buck up and take an intelligent interest in things  no but really bishop said marriott you must treat this seriously youll have to let the other chaps know about it  how put it up on the noticeboard this is to certify that mr allan gethryn of leicesters house beckford is dismissed without a stain on his character you ass how can i let them know i seem to see myself doing the boyhero style of things my friends you wronged me you wronged me very grievously but i forgive you i put up with your cruel scorn i endured it i steeled myself against it and now i forgive you profusely every one of you let us embrace it wouldnt do you must see that much dont be a goat is that toast done yet wilson  wilson exhibited several pounds of the article in question  good said the bishop youre a great man wilson you can make a small selection of those biscuits and if you bag all the sugar ones ill slay you and then you can go quietly downstairs and rejoin your sorrowing friends and dont you go telling them what ive been saying  rather not said wilson  he made his small selection and retired the bishop turned to marriott again  i shall tell reece because he deserves it and i rather think i shall tell gosling and pringle nobody else though whats the good of it everybodyll forget the whole thing by next season  how about norris asked marriott  now there you have touched the spot i cant possibly tell norris myself my natural pride is too enormous descended from a primordial atomic globule you know like pooh bah and i shook hands with a duke once the man norris and i i regret to say had something of a row on the subject last term we parted with mutual expressions of hate and havent spoken since what i should like would be for somebody else to tell him all about it not you it would look too much like a putup job so dont you go saying anything swear  why not  because you mustnt swear let me hear you swear by the bones of your ancestors  all right i call it awful rot though  cant be helped painful but necessary now im going to tell reece though i dont expect hell remember anything about it reece never remembers anything beyond his last meal  idiot said marriott after him as the door closed i dont know though he added to himself  and pouring himself out another cup of tea he pondered deeply over the matter  reece heard the news without emotion  youre a good sort bishop he said i knew something of the kind must have happened it reminds me of a thing that happened to  yes it is rather like it isnt it said the bishop by the way talking about stories a chap i met in the holidays told me a ripper you see this chap and his brother  he discoursed fluently for some twenty minutes reece sighed softly but made no attempt to resume his broken narrative he was used to this sort of thing  it was a fortnight later and marriott and the bishop were once more seated in their study waiting for wilson to get tea ready wilson made toast in the foreground marriott was in football clothes rubbing his shin gently where somebody had kicked it in the scratch game that afternoon after rubbing for a few moments in silence he spoke suddenly  you must tell norris he said its all rot  i cant  then i shall  no dont you swore you wouldnt  well but look here i just want to ask you one question what sort of a time did you have in that scratch game tonight  beastly i touched the ball exactly four times if i wasnt so awfully ornamental i dont see what would be the use of my turning out at all im no practical good to the team  exactly thats just what i wanted to get at i dont mean your remark about your being ornamental but about your never touching the ball until you explain matters to norris you never will get a decent pass norris and you are a rattling good pair of centre threes but if he never gives you a pass i dont see how we can expect to have any combination in the first its no good my slinging out the ball if the centres stick to it like glue directly they get it and refuse to give it up its simply sickening  marriott played half for the first fifteen and his soul was in the business  but my dear chap said gethryn you dont mean to tell me that a man like norris would purposely rot up the firsts combination because he happened to have had a row with the other centre hes much too decent a fellow  no i dont mean that exactly what he does is this ive watched him he gets the ball he runs with it till his man is on him and then he thinks of passing youre backing him up he sees you and says to himself i cant pass to that cad  meaning me  meaning you  thanks awfully  dont mention it im merely quoting his thoughts as deduced by me he says i cant pass to thatwell individual if you prefer it wheres somebody else so he hesitates and gets tackled or else slings the ball wildly out to somebody who cant possibly get to it its simply infernal and we play the nomads tomorrow too something must be done  somebody ought to tell him why doesnt our genial skipper assert his authority  hills a forward you see and doesnt get an opportunity of noticing it i cant tell him of course ive not got my colours  youre a cert for them  hope so anyway ive not got them yet and norris has so i cant very well go slanging him to hill sort of thing rude people would call side  well ill look out tomorrow and if its as bad as you think ill speak to hill its a beastly thing to have to do  beastly agreed marriott its got to be done though we cant go through the season without any combination in the threequarter line just to spare norriss feelings  its a pity though said the bishop because norris is a ripping good sort of chap really i wish we hadnt had that bustup last term     18  the bishop scores   at this point wilson finished the toast and went out as he went he thought over what he had just heard marriott and gethryn frequently talked the most important school politics before him for they had discovered at an early date that he was a youth of discretion who could be trusted not to reveal state secrets but matters now seemed to demand such a revelation it was a serious thing to do but there was nobody else to do it and it obviously must be done so by a simple process of reasoning he ought to do it half an hour had to elapse before the bell rang for lockup there was plenty of time to do the whole thing and get back to the house before the door was closed he took his cap and trotted off to jephsons  norris was alone in his study when wilson knocked at the door he seemed surprised to see his visitor he knew wilson well by sight he being captain of the first eleven and wilson a distinctly promising junior bat but this was the first time he had ever exchanged a word of conversation with him  hullo he said putting down his book  oh i say norris began wilson nervously can i speak to you for a minute  all right go ahead  after two false starts wilson at last managed to get the thread of his story he did not mention marriotts remarks on football subjects but confined himself to the story of farnie and the bicycle ride as he had heard it from gethryn on the second evening of the term  so thats how it was you see he concluded  there was a long silence wilson sat nervously on the edge of his chair and norris stared thoughtfully into the fire  so shall i tell him its all right asked wilson at last  tell who whats all right asked norris politely  oh er gethryn you know replied wilson slightly disconcerted he had had a sort of idea that norris would have rushed out of the room sprinted over to leicesters and flung himself on the bishops bosom in an agony of remorse he appeared to be taking things altogether too coolly  no said norris dont tell him anything i shall have lots of chances of speaking to him myself if i want to it isnt as if we were never going to meet again youd better cut now theres the bell just going good night  good night norris  oh and i say said norris as wilson opened the door i meant to tell you some time ago if you buck up next cricket season its quite possible that youll get colours of some sort you might bear that in mind  i will said wilson fervently good night norris thanks awfully  the nomads brought down a reasonably hot team against beckford as a general rule for the school had a reputation in the football world they were a big lot this year their forwards looked capable and when after the school fullback had returned the ball into touch on the halfway line the lineout had resulted in a handball and a scrum they proved that appearances were not deceptive they broke through in a solid massthe beckford forwards never somehow seemed to get together properly in the first scrum of a big matchand rushed the ball down the field norris fell on it another hastilyformed scrum and the nomads front rank was off again ten yards nearer the school line there was another halt grainger the beckford fullback whose speciality was the stopping of rushes had curled himself neatly round the ball then the school forwards awoke to a sense of their responsibilities it was time they did for beckford was now penned up well within its own twentyfive line and the nomad halves were appealing pathetically to their forwards to let that ball out for goodness sake but the forwards fancied a combined rush was the thing to play for a full minute they pushed the school pack towards their line and then some rash enthusiast kicked a shade too hard the ball dribbled out of the scrum on the school side and marriott punted into touch  you must let it out you men said the aggrieved halfbacks  marriotts kick had not brought much relief the visitors were still inside the beckford twentyfive line and now that their forwards had realized the sin and folly of trying to rush the ball through matters became decidedly warm for the school outsides norris and gethryn in the centre and grainger at back performed prodigies of tackling the wing threequarter hovered nervously about feeling that their time might come at any moment  the nomad attack was concentrated on the extreme right  philips the international was officiating for them as wingthreequarters on that side and they played to him if he once got the ball he would take a considerable amount of stopping but the ball never managed to arrive norris and gethryn stuck to their men closer than brothers  a prolonged struggle on the goalline is a great spectacle that is why purely in the opinion of the present scribe rugby is such a much better game than association you dont get that sort of thing in soccer but such struggles generally end in the same way the nomads were now within a couple of yards of the school line it was a question of time in three minutes the whistle would blow for halftime and the school would be saved  but in those three minutes the thing happened for the first time in the match the nomad forwards heeled absolutely cleanly hitherto the ball had always remained long enough in the scrum to give marriott and wogan the school halves time to get round and on to their men before they could become dangerous but this time the ball was in and out again in a moment the nomad half who was taking the scrum picked it up and was over the line before marriott realized that the ball was out at all the school lining the ropes along the touchline applauded politely but feebly as was their custom when the enemy scored  the kick was a difficult onethe man had got over in the cornerand failed the referee blew his whistle for halftime the teams sucked lemons and the beckford forwards tried to explain to hill the captain why they never got that ball in the scrums hill having observed bitterly as he did in every match when the school did not get thirty points in the first half that he would chuck the whole lot of them out next saturday the game recommenced  beckford started on the second half with three points against them but with both wind what there was of it and slope in their favour three points especially in a club match where ones opponents may reasonably be expected to suffer from lack of training and combination is not an overwhelming score  beckford was hopeful and determined  to record all the fluctuations of the game for the next thirtyfive minutes is unnecessary copies of the beckfordian containing a full report crammed with details and written in the most polished english may still be had from the editor at the modest price of sixpence suffice it to say that two minutes from the kickoff the nomads increased their score with a goal from a mark and almost immediately afterwards marriott gave the school their first score with a neat dropkick it was about five minutes from the end of the game and the nomads still led when the event of the afternoon took place the nomad forwards had brought the ball down the ground with one of their combined dribbles and a scrum had been formed on the beckford twentyfive line the visitors heeled as usual the half who was taking the scrum whipped the ball out in the direction of his colleague but before it could reach him wogan had intercepted the pass and was off down the field through the enemys threequarter line with only the back in front of him and with norris in close attendance followed by gethryn  there is nothing like an intercepted pass for adding a dramatic touch to a close game a second before it had seemed as though the school must be beaten for though they would probably have kept the enemy out for the few minutes that remained they could never have worked the ball down the field by ordinary giveandtake play and now unless wogan shamefully bungled what he had begun so well victory was certain  there was a danger though wogan might in the excitement of the moment try to get past the back and score himself instead of waiting until the back was on him and then passing to norris the school on the touchline shrieked their applause but there was a note of anxiety as well a slight reputation which wogan had earned for playing a selfish game sprang up before their eyes would he pass or would he run himself if the latter the odds were anything against his succeeding  but everything went right wogan arrived at the back drew that gentlemans undivided attention to himself and then slung the ball out to norris the model of what a pass ought to be norris made no mistake about it  then the remarkable thing happened the bishop having backed norris up for fifty yards at full speed could not stop himself at once his impetus carried him on when all need for expenditure of energy had come to an end he was just slowing down leaving norris to complete the thing alone when to his utter amazement he found the ball in his hands norris had passed to him with a clear run in and the nearest foeman yards to the rear norris had passed it was certainly weird but his first duty was to score there must be no mistake about the scoring afterwards he could do any thinking that might be required he shot at express speed over the line and placed the ball in the exact centre of the white line which joined the posts then he walked back to where norris was waiting for him  good man said norris that was awfully good  his tone was friendly he spoke as he had been accustomed to speak before the mcc match gethryn took his cue from him it was evident that for reasons at present unexplained norris wished for peace and such being the case the bishop was only too glad to oblige him  no he said it was jolly good of you to let me in like that why youd only got to walk over  oh i dont know i might have slipped or something anyhow i thought id better pass what price beckford combination the homemade article eh  rather said the bishop  oh by the way said norris i was talking to young wilson yesterday evening or rather he was talking to me decent kid isnt he he was telling me about farnie the mcc match you know and so on  oh said the bishop he began to see how things had happened  yes said norris hullo that gives us the game  a roar of applause from the touchline greeted the successful attempt of hill to convert gethryns try into the necessary goal the referee performed a solo on the whistle and immediately afterwards another as if as an encore  no side he said pensively the school had won by two points  thats all right said norris i say can you come and have tea in my study when youve changed some of the fellows are coming ive asked reece and marriott and pringle said hed turn up too itll be rather a tight fit but well manage somehow  right said the bishop thanks very much  norris was correct it was a tight fit but then a study brew loses half its charm if there is room to breathe it was a most enjoyable ceremony in every way after the serious part of the meal was over and the time had arrived when it was found pleasanter to eat wafer biscuits than muffins the bishop obliged once more with a recital of his adventures on that distant day in the summer term  there were several comments when he had finished the only one worth recording is reeces  reece said it distinctly reminded him of a thing which had happened to a friend of a chap his brother had known at sandhurst
