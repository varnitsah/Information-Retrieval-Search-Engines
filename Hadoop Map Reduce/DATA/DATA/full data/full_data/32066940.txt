32066940	homer and his age  by  andrew lang   illustration algonquins under shield frontispiece   to r w raper in all gratitude     preface   in homer and the epic ten or twelve years ago i examined the literary objections to homeric unity these objections are chiefly based on alleged discrepancies in the narrative of which no one poet it is supposed could have been guilty the critics repose i venture to think mainly on a fallacy we may style it the fallacy of the analytical reader the poet is expected to satisfy a minutely critical reader a personage whom he could not foresee and whom he did not address nor are contradictory instances examinedthat is as blass has recently reminded his countrymen homer is put to a test which goethe could not endure no long fictitious narrative can satisfy the analytical reader  the fallacy is that of disregarding the homeric poets audience he did not sing for aristotle or for aristarchus or for modern minute and reflective inquirers but for warriors and ladies he certainly satisfied them but if he does not satisfy microscopic professors he is described as a syndicate of many minstrels living in many ages  in the present volume little is said in defence of the poets consistency several chapters on that point have been excised the way of living which homer describes is examined and an effort is made to prove that he depicts the life of a single brief age of culture the investigation is compelled to a tedious minuteness because the points of attackthe alleged discrepancies in descriptions of the various details of existenceare so minute as to be all but invisible  the unity of the epics is not so important a topic as the methods of criticism they ought to be sober logical and self consistent when these qualities are absent homeric criticism may be described in the recent words of blass as a swamp haunted by wandering fires will o the wisps  in our country many of the most eminent scholars are no believers in separatist criticism justly admiring the industry and erudition of the separatists they are unmoved by their arguments to which they do not reply being convinced in their own minds but the number and perseverance of the separatists make on the general reader the impression that homeric unity is chose jugée that scientia locuta est and has condemned homer this is far from being the case the question is still open science herself is subject to criticism and new materials accruing yearly forbid a tame acquiescence in hasty theories  may i say a word to the lovers of poetry who in reading homer feel no more doubt than in reading milton that on the whole they are studying a work of one age by one author do not let them be driven from their natural impression by the statement that science has decided against them the certainties of the exact sciences are one thing the opinions of homeric commentators are other and very different things among all the branches of knowledge which the homeric critic should have at his command only philology archaeology and anthropology can be called sciences and they are not exact sciences they are but skirmishing advances towards the true solution of problems prehistoric and protohistoric  our knowledge shifts from day to day on every hand in regard to almost every topic discussed we find conflict of opinions there is no certain scientific decision but there is the possibility of working in the scientific spirit with breadth of comparison consistency of logic economy of conjecture abstinence from the piling of hypothesis on hypothesis  nothing can be more hurtful to science than the dogmatic assumption that the hypothesis most in fashion is scientific  twenty years ago the philological theory of the solar myth was preached as scientific in the books primers and lectures of popular science today its place knows it no more the separatist theories of the homeric poems are not more secure than the solar myth like a wave shall they pass and be passed  when writing on the homeric house chapter x i was unacquainted with mr percy gardners essay the palaces of homer journal of hellenic studies vol iii pp 264 282 mr

algonquin corslet  gold corslet     chapter i   the homeric age  the aim of this book is to prove that the homeric epics as wholes and apart from passages gravely suspected in antiquity present a perfectly harmonious picture of the entire life and civilisation of one single age the faint variations in the design are not greater than such as mark every moment of culture for in all there is some movement in all cases are modified by circumstances if our contention be true it will follow that the poems themselves as wholes are the product of a single age not a mosaic of the work of several changeful centuries  this must be the caseif the life drawn is harmonious the picture must be the work of a single epochfor it is not in the nature of early uncritical times that later poets should adhere or even try to adhere to the minute details of law custom opinion dress weapons houses and so on as presented in earlier lays or sagas on the same set of subjects even less are poets in uncritical times inclined to archaise either by attempting to draw fancy pictures of the manners of the past or by making researches in graves or among old votive offerings in temples for the purpose of preserving local colour the idea of such archaising is peculiar to modern times to take an instance much to the point virgil was a learned poet famous for his antiquarian erudition and professedly imitating and borrowing from homer now had virgil worked as a man of today would work on a poem of trojan times he would have represented his heroes as using weapons of bronze footnote looking back at my own poem helen of troy 1883 i find that when the metal of a weapon is mentioned the metal is bronze no such idea of archaising occurred to the learned virgil it is the iron that pierces the head of remulus aeneid ix 633 it is the iron that waxes warm in the breast of antiphates ix 701 virgils men again do not wear the great homeric shield suspended by a baldric aeneas holds up his buckler clipeus borne on his left arm x 26 i homer familiar with no buckler worn on the left arm has no such description when the hostile ranks are to be broken in the aeneid it is with the iron x 372 and so throughout  the most erudite ancient poet in a critical age of iron does not archaise in our modern fashion he does not follow his model homer in his descriptions of shields swords and spears but according to most homeric critics the later continuators of the greek epics about 800540 bc are men living in an age of iron weapons and of round bucklers worn on the left arm yet unlike virgil they always give their heroes arms of bronze and unlike virgil as we shall see they do not introduce the buckler worn on the left arm they adhere conscientiously to the use of the vast mycenaean shield in their time obsolete yet by the theory in many other respects they innovate at will introducing corslets and greaves said to be unknown to the beginners of the greek epics just as virgil innovates in bucklers and iron weapons all this theory seems inconsistent and no ancient poet not even virgil is an archaiser of the modern sort  all attempts to prove that the homeric poems are the work of several centuries appear to rest on a double hypothesis first that the later contributors to the iliad kept a steady eye on the traditions of the remote achaean age of bronze next that they innovated as much as they pleased  poets of an uncritical age do not archaise this rule is overlooked by the critics who represent the homeric poems as a complex of the work of many singers in many ages for example professor percy gardner in his very interesting new chapters in greek history 1892 carries neglect of the rule so far as to suppose that the late homeric poets being aware that the ancient heroes could not ride or write or eat boiled meat consciously and purposefully represented them as doing none of these things this they did on the same principle on which a writer of pastoral idylls in our own day would avoid the mention of the telegraph or telephone footnote op cit p 142 a writer of our own daythere is the pervading fallacy it is only writers of the last century who practise this archaeological refinement the authors of beowulf and the nibelungenlied of the chansons de geste and of the arthurian romances always describe their antique heroes and the details of their life in conformity with the customs costume and armour of their own much later ages  but mr leaf to take another instance remarks as to the lack of the metal lead in the epics that it is mentioned in similes only as though the poet were aware the metal was unknown in the heroic age footnote iliad note on xi 237 here the poet is assumed to be a careful but illinformed archaeologist who wishes to give an accurate representation of the past lead in fact was perfectly familiar to the mycenaean prime footnote tsountas and manatt p 73 the critical usage of supposing that the ancients were like the most recent modernsin their archaeological preoccupationsis a survival of the uncritical habit which invariably beset old poets and artists ancient poets of the uncritical ages never worked on the same principle as a writer in our day as regards archaeological precision at least we are acquainted with no example of such accuracy  let us take another instance of the critical fallacy the age of the achaean warriors who dwelt in the glorious halls of mycenae was followed at an interval by the age represented in the relics found in the older tombs outside the dipylon gate of athens an age beginning probably about 900850 bc the culture of this dipylon age a time of geometrical ornaments on vases and of human figures drawn in geometrical forms lines and triangles was quite unlike that of the achaean age in many ways for example in mode of burial and in the use of iron for weapons mr h r hall in his learned book the oldest civilisation of greece 1901 supposes the culture described in the homeric poems to be contemporary in asia with that of this dipylon period in greece footnote op cit pp 49 222 he says the homeric culture is evidently the culture of the poets own days there is no attempt to archaise here they do not archaise as to the details of life but the homeric poets consciously and consistently archaised in regard to the political conditions of continental greece in the achaean times they give in all probability a pretty accurate description of the loose feudalism of mycenaean greece footnote op cit pp 223 225  we shall later show that this homeric picture of a past political and social condition of greece is of vivid and delicate accuracy that it is drawn from the life not constructed out of historical materials mr hall explains the fact by the conscious and consistent archaeological precision of the asiatic poets of the ninth century now to any one who knows early national poetry early uncritical art of any kind this theory seems not easily tenable the difficulty of the theory is increased if we suppose that the achaeans were the recent conquerors of the mycenaeans whether we regard the achaeans as celts with mr ridgeway victors over an aryan people the pelasgic mycenaeans or whether with mr hall we think that the achaeans were the aryan conquerors of a nonaryan people the makers of the mycenaean civilisation in the stress of a conquest followed at no long interval by an expulsion at the hands of dorian invaders there would be little thought of archaising among achaean poets footnote mr hall informs me that he no longer holds the opinion that the poets archaised  a distinction has been made it is true between the poet and other artists in this respect monsieur perrot says the vase painter reproduces what he sees while the epic poets endeavoured to represent a distant past if homer gives swords of bronze to his heroes of times gone by it is because he knows that such were the weapons of these heroes of long ago in arming them with bronze he makes use in his way of what we call local colour thus the homeric poet is a more conscientious historian than virgil footnote la grète de lepopée perrot et chipiez p 230  now we contend that old uncritical poets no more sought for antique local colour than any other artists did m perrot himself says with truth the chanson de roland and all the gestes of the same cycle explain for us the iliad and the odyssey footnote op cit p 5 but the poet of the chanson de roland accoutres his heroes of old time in the costume and armour of his own age and the later poets of the same cycle introduce the innovations of their time they do not hunt for local colour in the chanson de roland the very words local colour are a modern phrase for an idea that never occurred to the artists of ancient uncritical ages the homeric poets like the painters of the dipylon period describe the details of life as they see them with their own eyes such poets and artists never have the fear of anachronisms before them this indeed is plain to the critics themselves for they detect anachronisms as to land tenure burial the construction of houses marriage customs weapons and armour in the iliad and odyssey these supposed anachronisms we examine later if they really exist they show that the poets were indifferent to local colour and archaeological precision or were incapable of attaining to archaeological accuracy in fact such artistic revival of the past in its habit as it lived is a purely modern ideal  we are to show then that the epics being as wholes free from such inevitable modifications in the picture of changing details of life as uncritical authors always introduce are the work of the one age which they represent this is the reverse of what has long been and still is the current theory of homeric criticism according to which the homeric poems are and bear manifest marks of being a mosaic of the poetry of several ages of change  till wolf published his prolegomena to blank space 1795 there was little opposition to the old belief that the iliad and odyssey were allowing for interpolations the work of one or at most of two poets after the appearance of wolfs celebrated book homeric critics have maintained generally speaking that the iliad is either a collection of short lays disposed in sequence in a late age or that it contains an ancient original kernel round which expansions made throughout some centuries of changeful life have accrued and have been at last arranged by a literary redactor or editor  the latter theory is now dominant it is maintained that the iliad is a work of at least four centuries some of the objections to this theory were obvious to wolf himselfmore obvious to him than to his followers he was aware and some of them are not of the distinction between reading the iliad as all poetic literature is naturally read and by all authors is meant to be read for human pleasure and studying it in the spirit of the analytical reader as often as he read for pleasure he says disregarding the purely fanciful historical conditions which he invented for homer as often as he yielded himself to that running stream of action and narration as often as he considered the harmony of colour and of characters in the epic no man could be more angry with his own destructive criticism than himself wolf ceased to be a wolfian whenever he placed himself at the point of view of the reader or the listener to whom alone every poet makes his appeal  but he deemed it his duty to place himself at another point of view that of the scientific literary historian the historian of a period concerning whose history he could know nothing how could the thing be possible he asked himself how could a long poem like the iliad come into existence in the historical circumstances footnote exact place in paragraph unknown preface to homer p xxii 1794 wolf was unaware that he did not know what the historical circumstances were we know how little we know but we do know more than wolf he invented the historical circumstances of the supposed poet they were he said like those of a man who should build a large ship in an inland place with no sea to launch it upon the iliad was the large ship the sea was the public homer could have no readers wolf said in an age that like the old hermit of prague never saw pen and ink had no knowledge of letters or if letters were dimly known had never applied them to literature in such circumstances no man could have a motive for composing a long poem footnote prolegomena to the iliad p xxvi  yet if the original poet homer could make the greater part of the songs as wolf admitted what physical impossibility stood in the way of his making the whole meanwhile the historical circumstances as conceived of by wolf were imaginary he did not take the circumstances of the poet as described in the odyssey here a king or prince has a minstrel honoured as were the minstrels described in the ancient irish books of law his duty is to entertain the prince and his family and guests by singing epic chants after supper and there is no reason why his poetic narratives should be brief but rather he has an opportunity that never occurred again till the literary age of greece for producing a long poem continued from night to night in the later age in the asiatic colonies and in greece the rhapsodists competing for prizes at feasts or reciting to a civic crowd were limited in time and gave but snatches of poetry it is in this later civic age that a poet without readers would have little motive for building wolfs great ship of song and scant chance of launching it to any profitable purpose to this point we return but when once critics following wolf had convinced themselves that a long early poem was impossible they soon found abundant evidence that it had never existed  they have discovered discrepancies of which they say no one sane poet could have been guilty they have also discovered that the poems had not as wolf declared one harmony of colour unus color each age they say during which the poems were continued lent its own colour the poets by their theory now preserved the genuine tradition of things old cremation cairn and urn burial the use of the chariot in war the use of bronze for weapons a peculiar stage of customary law a peculiar form of semifeudal society a peculiar kind of house but again by a change in the theory the poets introduced later novelties later forms of defensive armour later modes of burial later religious and speculative beliefs a later style of house an advanced stage of law modernisms in grammar and language  the usual position of critics in this matter is stated by helbig and we are to contend that the theory is contradicted by all experience of ancient literatures and is in itself the reverse of consistent the artists of antiquity says helbig with perfect truth had no idea of archaeological studies they represented legendary scenes in conformity with the spirit of their own age and reproduced the arms and implements and costume that they saw around them footnote lÉpopée homerique p 5 homerische epos p 4  now a poet is an artist like another and he toono less than the vase painter or engraver of gemsin dealing with legends of times past represents in an uncritical age the arms utensils costume and the religious geographical legal social and political ideas of his own period we shall later prove that this is true by examples from the early mediaeval epic poetry of europe  it follows that if the iliad is absolutely consistent and harmonious in its picture of life and of all the accessories of life the iliad is the work of a single age of a single stage of culture the poet describing his own environment but helbig on the other hand citing wilamowitz moellendorff declares that the iliadthe work of four centuries he saysmaintains its unity of colour by virtue of an uninterrupted poetical tradition footnote homerische untersuchungen p 292 homerische epos p i if so the poets must have archaeologised must have kept asking themselves is this or that detail true to the past which artists in uncritical ages never do as we have been told by helbig they must have carefully pondered the surviving old achaean lays which were born when the heroes could not read or boil flesh or back a steed by carefully observing the earliest lays the late poets in times of changed manners could avoid anachronisms by the aid of tradition which gave them a very exact idea of the epic heroes such is the opinion of wilamowitz moellendorff he appears to regard the tradition as keeping the later poets in the old way automatically not consciously but this we also learn from helbig did not occur the poets often wandered from the way footnote helbig homerische epos pp 2 3 thus old mycenaean lays if any existed would describe the old mycenaean mode of burial the homeric poet describes something radically different we vainly ask for proof that in any early national literature known to us poets have been true to the colour and manners of the remote times in which their heroes moved and of which old minstrels sang the thing is without example of this proofs shall be offered in abundance  meanwhile the whole theory which regards the iliad as the work of four or five centuries rests on the postulate that poets throughout these centuries did what such poets never do kept true to the details of a life remote from their own and also did not  for helbig does not after all cleave to his opinion on the other hand he says that the later poets of the iliad did not cling to tradition they allowed themselves to be influenced by their own environment this influence betrays itself in the descriptions of details the rhapsodists reciters supposed to have altered the poems at will did not fail to interpolate relatively recent elements into the oldest parts of the epic footnote homerische epos p 2  at this point comes in a complex inconsistency the tenth book of the iliad thinks helbigin common with almost all criticsis one of the most recent lays of the iliad but in this recent lay say of the eighth or seventh century the poet describes the thracians as on a level of civilisation with the achaeans and indeed as even more luxurious wealthy and refined in the matter of good horses glorious armour and splendid chariots but by the time of the persian wars says helbig the thracians were regarded by the greeks as rude barbarians and their military equipment was totally ungreek they did not wear helmets but caps of foxskin they had no body armour their shields were small round bucklers their weapons were bows and daggers these customs could not at the time of the persian wars be recent innovations in thrace footnote herodotus vii 75  had the poet of iliad book x known the thracians in this condition says helbig as he was fond of details of costume and arms he would have certainly described their foxskin caps bows bucklers and so forth he would not here have followed the epic tradition which represented the thracians as makers of great swords and as splendidly armed charioteers his audience had met the thracians in peace and war and would contradict the poets description of them as heavily armed charioteers it follows therefore that the latest poets such as the author of book x did not introduce recent details those of their own time but we have just previously been told that to do so was their custom in the description of details  now studniczka footnote homerische epos pp 711 cf note i zeitschrift fur die oestern gymnasien 1886 p 195 explains the picture of the thracians in iliad book x on helbigs other principle namely that the very late author of the tenth book merely conforms to the conventional tradition of the epic adheres to the model set in ancient achaean or rather ancient ionian times and scrupulously preserved by the latest poetsthat is when the latest poets do not bring in the new details of their own age but helbig will not accept his own theory in this case whence does it follow that the author of the tenth book must in his opinion have lived in achaean times and described the thracians as they then were charioteers heavily armed not lightclad archers if this is so we ask how helbig can aver that the tenth book is one of the latest parts of the iliad  in studying the critics who hold that the iliad is the growth of four centuriessay from the eleventh to the seventh century bcno consistency is to be discovered the earth is never solid beneath our feet we find now that the poets are true to tradition in the details of ancient lifenow that the poets introduce whatever modern details they please the late poets have now a very exact knowledge of the past now the late poets know nothing about the past or again some of the poets are fond of actual and very minute archaeological research the theory shifts its position as may suit the point to be made at the moment by the critic all is arbitrary and it is certain that logic demands a very different method of inquiry if helbig and other critics of his way of thinking mean that in the iliad 1 there are parts of genuine antiquity other parts 2 by poets who with stern accuracy copied the old modes other parts 3 by poets who tried to copy but failed with passages 4 by poets who deliberately innovated and passages 5 by poets who drew fanciful pictures of the past from their inner consciousness while finally 6 some poets made minute antiquarian researches and if the argument be that the critics can detect these six elements then we are asked to repose unlimited confidence in critical powers of discrimination the critical standard becomes arbitrary and subjective  it is our effort then in the following pages to show that the unus color of wolf does pervade the epics that recent details are not often if ever interpolated that the poems harmoniously represent one age and that a brief age of culture that this effect cannot in a thoroughly uncritical period have been deliberately aimed at and produced by archaeological learning or by sedulous copying of poetic tradition or by the scientific labours of an editor of the sixth century bc we shall endeavour to prove what we have already indicated that the hypotheses of expansion are not selfconsistent or in accordance with what is known of the evolution of early national poetry the strongest part perhaps of our argument is to rest on our interpretation of archaeological evidence though we shall not neglect the more disputable or less convincing contentions of literary criticism     chapter ii   hypotheses as to the growth of the epics  a theorist who believes that the homeric poems are the growth of four changeful centuries must present a definite working hypothesis as to how they escaped from certain influences of the late age in which much of them is said to have been composed we must first ask to what manner of audiences did the poets sing in the alleged four centuries of the evolution of the epics mr leaf as a champion of the theory of ages of expansion answers that the iliad and odyssey are essentially and above all court poems they were composed to be sung in the palaces of a ruling aristocracy  the poems are aristocratic and courtly not popular footnote companion to the iliad pp 28 1892 they are not volkspoesie they are not ballads it is now generally recognised that this conception is radically false  these opinions in which we heartily agreethere never was such a thing as a popular epicwere published fourteen years ago mr leaf however would not express them with regard to our iliad and odyssey because in his view a considerable part of the iliad as it stands was made not by court bards in the achaean courts of europe not for an audience of noble warriors and dames but by wandering minstrels in the later ionian colonies of asia they did not chant for a military aristocracy but for the enjoyment of town and country folk at popular festivals footnote iliad vol i p xvi 1900 the poems were begun indeed he thinks for a wealthy aristocracy living on the product of their lands in european greece were begun by contemporary court minstrels but were continued vastly expanded and altered to taste by wandering singers and reciting rhapsodists who amused the holidays of a commercial expansive and bustling ionian democracy footnote companion to the iliad p ii   we must suppose that on this theory the later poets pleased a commercial democracy by keeping up the tone that had delighted an old landowning military aristocracy it is not difficult however to admit this as possible for the poems continued to be admired in all ages of greece and under every form of society the real question is would the modern poets be the men to keep up a tone some four or five centuries old and to be true if they were true to the details of the heroic age it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some part of the most primitive iliad may have been actually sung by the court minstrel in the palace whose ruins can still be seen in mycenae footnote leaf iliad vol i p xv but by the expansionist theory even the oldest parts of our iliad are now full of what we may call quite recent ionian additions full of late retouches and full so to speak of omissions of old parts  through four or five centuries by the hypothesis every singer who could find an audience was treating as much as he knew of a vast body of ancient lays exactly as he pleased adding here lopping there altering everywhere moreover these were centuries full of change the ancient achaean palaces were becoming the ruins which we still behold the old art had faded and then fallen under the disaster of the dorian conquest a new art or a recrudescence of earlier art very crude and barbaric had succeeded and was beginning to acquire form and vitality the very scene of life was altered the new singers and listeners dwelt on the eastern side of the aegean knights no longer as in europe fought from chariots war was conducted by infantry for the most part with mounted auxiliaries with the disappearance of the war chariot the huge mycenaean shields had vanished or were very rarely used the early vase painters do not to my knowledge represent heroes as fighting from war chariots they had lost touch with that method fighting men now carried relatively small round bucklers and iron was the metal chiefly employed for swords spears and arrow points would the new poets in deference to tradition abstain from mentioning cavalry or small bucklers or iron swords and spears or would they avoid puzzling their hearers by speaking of obsolete and unfamiliar forms of tactics and of military equipment would they therefore sing of things familiarof iron weapons small round shields hoplites and cavalry we shall see that confused and selfcontradictory answers are given by criticism to all these questions by scholars who hold that the epics are not the product of one but of many ages  there were other changes between the ages of the original minstrel and of the late successors who are said to have busied themselves in adding to mutilating and altering his old poem kings and courts had passed away old ionian myths and religious usages unknown to the homeric poets had come out into the light commerce and pleasure and early philosophies were the chief concerns of life yet the poems continued to be aristocratic in manners and in religion and ritual to be pure from recrudescences of savage poetry and superstition though the ionians did not drop the more primitive phases of belief which had clung to them these rose to the surface with the rest of the marvellous ionic genius and many an ancient survival was enshrined in the literature or mythology of athens which had long passed out of all remembrance at mycenas footnote companion to the iliad p 7  amazing to say none of these more primitive phases of belief none of the recrudescent savage magic was intruded by the late ionian poets into the iliad which they continued by the theory such phases of belief were indeed by their time popular and frequently appeared in the cyclic poems on the trojan war continuations of the iliad which were composed by ionian authors at the same time as much of the iliad itself by the theory was composed the authors of these cyclic poems authors contemporary with the makers of much of the iliad were eminently unhomeric in many respects footnote cf monro the cyclic poets odyssey vol ii pp 342384 they had ideas very different from those of the authors of the iliad and odyssey as these ideas have reached us  helbig states this curious fact that the homeric poems are free from many recent or recrudescent ideas common in other epics composed during the later centuries of the supposed four hundred years of epic growth footnote homerische epos p 3 thus a signet ring was mentioned in the ilias puma and there are no rings in iliad or odyssey but helbig does not perceive the insuperable difficulty which here encounters his hypothesis he remarks in certain poems which were grouping themselves around the iliad and odyssey we meet data absolutely opposed to the conventional style of the epic he gives three or four examples of perfectly unhomeric ideas occurring in epics of the eighth to seventh centuries bc and a large supply of such cases can be adduced but helbig does not ask how it happened that if poets of these centuries had lost touch with the epic tradition and had wandered into a new region of thought as they had examples of their notions do not occur in the iliad and odyssey by his theory these poems were being added to and altered even in their oldest portions at the very period when strange fresh or old and newly revived fancies were flourishing if so how were the iliad and odyssey unlike the cyclic poems kept uncontaminated as they confessedly were by the new romantic ideas  here is the real difficulty cyclic poets of the eighth and seventh centuries had certainly lost touch with the epic tradition their poems make that an admitted fact yet poets of the eighth to seventh centuries were by the theory busily adding to and altering the ancient lays of the iliad how did they abstain from the new or revived ideas and from the new genre of romance are we to believe that one set of late ionian poetsthey who added to and altered the iliadwere true to tradition while another contemporary set of ionian poets the cyclicsauthors of new epics on homeric themesare known to have quite lost touch with the homeric taste religion and ritual the reply will perhaps be a cyclic poet said here i am going to compose quite a new poem about the old heroes i shall make them do and think and believe as i please without reference to the evidence of the old poems but it will have to be added the rhapsodists of 800540 bc and the general editor of the latter date thought we are continuing an old set of lays and we must be very careful in adhering to manners customs and beliefs as described by our predecessors for instance the old heroes had only bronze no ironand then the rhapsodists forgot and made iron a common commodity in the iliad again the rhapsodists knew that the ancient heroes had no corsletsthe old lays we learn never spoke of corsletsbut they made them wear corslets of much splendour footnote the reader must remember that the view of the late poets as careful adherents of tradition in usages and ideas only obtains sometimes at others the critics declare that archaeological precision is not preserved and that the ionic continuators introduced for example the military gear of their own period into a poem which represents much older weapons and equipments this theory does not help us in an uncritical age poets could not discern that their genre of romance and religion was alien from that of homer  to return to the puzzle about the careful and precise continuators of the iliad as contrasted with their heedless contemporaries the authors of the cyclic poems how nonhomeric the authors of these cyclic poems were before and after 660 bc we illustrate from examples of their left hand backslidings and right hand fallings off they introduced 1 the apotheosis of the dioscuri who in homer iliad iii 243 are merely dead men cypria 2 story of iphigenia cypria 3 story of palamedes who is killed when angling by odysseus and diomede cypria  homers heroes never fish except in stress of dire necessity in the odyssey and homers own diomede and odysseus would never stoop to assassinate a companion when engaged in the contemplative mans recreation we here see the heroes in late degraded form as on the attic stage 4 the cyclics introduce helen as daughter of nemesis and describe the flight of nemesis from zeus in various animal forms a märchen of a sort not popular with homer an ionic märchen mr leaf would say there is nothing like this in the iliad and odyssey 5 they call the son of achilles not neoptolemus as homer does but pyrrhus 6 they represent the achaean army as obtaining supplies through three magically gifted maidens who produce corn wine and oil at will as in fairy tales another ionic nonachaean märchen they bring in ghosts of heroes dead and buried such ghosts in homers opinion were impossible if the dead had been cremated all these nonhomeric absurdities save the last are from the cypria dated by sir richard jebb about 776 bc long before the odyssey was put into shape namely after 660 b c in his opinion yet the alleged late compiler of the odyssey in the seventh century never wanders thus from the homeric standard in taste what a skilled archaeologist he must have been the author of the cypria knew the iliad footnote monro odyssey vol ii p 354 but his knowledge could not keep him true to tradition 7 in the aethiopis about 776 bc men are made immortal after death and are worshipped as heroes an idea foreign to iliad and odyssey 8 there is a savage ritual of purification from blood shed by a homicide compare eumenides line 273 this is unheard of in iliad and odyssey though familiar to aeschylus 9 achilles after death is carried to the isle of leuke 10 the fate of ilium in the cyclic little iliad hangs on the palladium of which nothing is known in iliad or odyssey the little iliad is dated about 700 bc 11 the nostoi mentions molossians not named by homer which is a trifle it also mentions the asiatic city of colophon an ionian colony which is not a trivial selfbetrayal on the part of the poet he is dated about 750 bc  thus more than a century before the odyssey received its final form after 660 bc from the hands of one man according to the theory the other ionian poets who attempted epic were betraying themselves as nonhomeric on every hand footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 347383  our examples are but a few derived from the brief notices of the cyclic poets works as mentioned in ancient literature these poets probably in fact betrayed themselves constantly but their contemporaries the makers of late additions to the odyssey and the later mosaic worker who put it together never betrayed themselves to anything like the fatal extent of anachronism exhibited by the cyclic poets how if the true ancient tone taste manners and religion were lost as the cyclic poets show that they were did the contemporary ionian poets or rhapsodists know and preserve the old manner  the best face we can put on the matter is to say that all the cyclic poets were recklessly independent of tradition while all men who botched at the iliad were very learned and very careful to maintain harmony in their pictures of life and manners except when they introduced changes in burial brideprice houses iron greaves and corslets all of them things by the theory modern and when they sang in modern grammar  yet despite this conscientiousness of theirs most of the many authors of our iliad and odyssey were by the theory strolling irresponsible rhapsodists like the later jongleurs of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in mediaeval france how could these strollers keep their modern ionian ideas or their primitive recrudescent phases of belief out of their lays as far as they did keep them out while the contemporary authors of the cypria the sack of ilios and other cyclic poets were full of new ideas legends and beliefs or primitive notions revived and save when revived quite obviously late and quite unhomeric in any case  the difficulty is the greater if the cyclic poems were long poems with one author to each epic such authors were obviously men of ambition they produced serious works de longue haleine it is from them that we should naturally expect conservative and studious adhesion to the traditional models from casual strollers like the rhapsodists and chanters at festivals we look for nothing of the sort they might be expected to introduce great feats done by sergeants and privates so to speakmen of the nameless greek laos the host the foot menwho in homer are occasionally said to perish of disease or to fall under the rain of arrows but are never distinguished by name the strollers it might be thought would also be the very men to introduce fairy tales freaks of primitive ionian myth discreditable anecdotes of the princely heroes and references to the ionian colonies  but it is not so the serious laborious authors of the long cyclic poems do such unhomeric things as these the gay irresponsible strolling singers of a lay here and a lay there lays now incorporated in the iliad and odyssey scrupulously avoid such faults they never even introduce a signet ring these are difficulties in the theory of the iliad as a patchwork by many hands in many ages which nobody explains which indeed nobody seems to find difficult yet the difficulty is insuperable even if we take refuge with wilamowitz in the idea that the cyclic and homeric poems were at first mere protoplasm of lays of many ages and that they were all compiled say in the sixth century into so many narratives we come no nearer to explaining why the tone taste and ideas of two such narratives illiad and odysseyare confessedly distinct from the tone taste and ideas of all the others the cyclic poems are certainly the production of a late and changed age footnote for what manner of audience if not for readers the cyclic poems were composed is a mysterious question the iliad is not in any degree save perhaps in a few interpolated passagestouched by the influences of that late age it is not a complex of the work of four incompatible centuries as far as this point is concerned the point of legend religion ritual and conception of heroic character     chapter iii   hypotheses of epic composition  whosoever holds that the homeric poems were evolved out of the lays of many men in many places during many periods of culture must present a consistent and logical hypothesis as to how they attained their present plots and forms these could not come by accident even if the plots are not goodas all the world held that they were till after wolfs daybut very bad as some critics now assert still plot and form beyond the power of chance to produce the poems do possess nobody goes so far as to deny that and critics make hypotheses explanatory of the fact that a single ancient kernel of some 2500 lines a kernel altered at will by any one who pleased during four centuries became a constructive whole if the hypotheses fail to account for the fact we have the more reason to believe that the poems are the work of one age and mainly of one man  in criticising homeric criticism as it is today we cannot do better than begin by examining the theories of mr leaf which are offered by him merely as a working hypothesis his most erudite work is based on a wide knowledge of german homeric speculation of the exact science of grammar of archaeological discoveries and of manuscripts footnote the iliad macmillan  co 1900 1902 his volumes are i doubt not as they certainly deserve to be on the shelves of every homeric student old or young and doubtless their contents reach the higher forms in schools though there is reason to suppose that about the unity of homer schoolboys remain conservative  in this book of more than 1200 pages mr leafs space is mainly devoted to textual criticism philology and pure scholarship but his introductions notes and appendices also set forth his mature ideas about the homeric problem in general he has altered some of his opinions since the publication of his companion to the iliad1892 but the main lines of his old system are except on one crucial point unchanged his theory we shall try to state and criticise in general outline it is the current theory of separatist critics and it may fairly be treated as a good example of such theories  the system is to the following effect greek tradition in the classical period regarded the iliad and odyssey as the work of one man homer a native of one or other of the ionian colonies of asia minor but the poems show few obvious signs of origin in asia they deal with dwellers before the dorian invasion which the poet never alludes to on the continent of europe and in crete footnote if the poet sang after the tempest of war that came down with the dorians from the north he would probably have sought a topic in the achaean exploits and sorrows of that period the dorians not the trojans would have been the foes the epics of france of the eleventh and twelfth centuries dwell not on the real victories of the remote charlemagne so much as on the disasters of aliscans and roncesvauxdefeats at saracen hands saracens being the enemies of the twelfthcentury poets no saracens in fact fought at roncesvaux the lays are concerned with good old times presumably between 1500 and 1100 bc their pictures of the details of life harmonise more with what we know of the society of that period from the evidence of buildings and recent excavations than with what we know of the life and the much more rude and barbaric art of the socalled dipylon period of geometrical ornament considerably later in the dipylon age though the use of iron even for swords made on the lines of the old bronze sword was familiar art was on a most barbaric level not much above the bed indian type as far at least as painted vases bear witness the human figure is designed as in tommy traddless skeletons there is however some crude but promising idea of composition  the picture of life in the homeric poems then is more like that of say 15001100 bc than of say 1000850 bc in mr leafs opinion certainly homer describes a wealthy aristocracy subject to an overlord who rules by right divine from golden mycenae we hear of no such potentate in ionia homers accounts of contemporary art seem to be inspired by the rich art generally dated about 15001200 yet there are many traces of apparent anachronism of divergence from the more antique picture of life in these divergences are we to recognise the picture of a later development of the ancient existence of 15001200 bc or have elements of the life of a much later age of greece say 800550 bc been consciously or unconsciously introduced by the late poets here mr leaf recognises a point on which we have insisted and must keep insisting for it is of the first importance it is a priori the most probable supposition that in an uncritical age poets do not reproduce the circumstances of the old time but only clothe the old tale in the garb of their own days poets in an uncritical age always in our experience clothe old tales with the garb of their own time but mr leaf thinks that in the case of the homeric poems this idea is not wholly borne out by the facts  in fact mr leafs hypothesis like helbigs exhibits a come andgo between the theory that his late poets clung close to tradition and so kept true to ancient details of life and the theory that they did quite the reverse in many cases of this frequent examples will occur he writes the homeric period is certainly later than the shaft tombs discovered at mycenae by dr schliemann but it does not necessarily follow that it is postmycenaean it is quite possible that certain notable differences between the poems and the monuments of mycenae in burial for instance and in womens dress may be due to changes which arose within the mycenaean age itself in that later part of it of which our knowledge is defectivealmost as defective as it is of the subsequent dipylon period on the whole the resemblance to the typical mycenaean culture is more striking than the difference footnote leaf iliad vol i pp xiiixv 1900  so far mr leaf states precisely the opinion for which we argue the homeric poems describe an age later than that of the famous tombsso rich in relicsof the mycenaean acropolis and earlier than the tombs of the dipylon of athens the poems thus spring out of an age of which except from the poems themselves we know little or nothing because as is shown later no cairn burials answering to the frequent homeric descriptions have ever been discoveredso relics corroborating homeric descriptions are to seek but the age attaches itself in many ways to the age of the mycenaean tombs while in our opinion it stands quite apart from the postdorian culture  where we differ from mr leaf is in believing that the poems as wholes were composed in that late mycenaean period of which from material remains we know very little that much new was not added as he thinks in the ionian development which lasted perhaps from the ninth century bc to the seventh we cannot agree with mr leaf when he like helbig thinks that much of the detail of the ancient life in the poems had early become so stereotyped that no continuator however late dared intentionally to sap the type though he slipped from time to time into involuntary anachronism some poets are also asserted to indulge in voluntary anachronism when as mr leaf supposes they equip the ancient warriors with corslets and greaves and other body armour of bronze such as in his opinion the old heroes never knew such as never were mentioned in the oldest parts or kernel of the poems thus the traditional details of mycenaean life sometimes are regarded as stereotyped in poetic tradition sometimes as subject to modern alterations of a sweeping and revolutionary kind  as to deliberate adherence to tradition by the poets we have proved that the cyclic epic poets of 800660 bc wandered widely from the ancient models if then every minstrel or rhapsodist who anywhere added at will to the old kernel of the achilles was so far as he was able as conscientiously precise in his stereotyped archaeological details as mr leaf sometimes supposes the fact is contrary to general custom in such cases when later poets in an uncritical age take up and rehandle the poetic themes of their predecessors they always give to the stories a new costume as m gaston paris remarks in reference to thirteenth century dealings with french epics of the eleventh century but in the critics opinion the late rehandlers of old achaean lays preserved the archaic modes of life war costume weapons and so forth with conscientious care except in certain matters to be considered later when they deliberately did the very reverse sometimes the late poets devoutly follow tradition sometimes they deliberately innovate sometimes they pedantically archaise bringing in genuine but by their time forgotten mycenaean things and criticism can detect their doings in each case  though the late continuators of the iliad were able despite certain inadvertencies to keep up for some four centuries in asia the harmonious picture of ancient achaean life and society in europe critics can distinguish four separate strata the work of many different ages in the iliad of the first stratum composed in europe say about 13001150 bc i give a conjectural date under all reserves the topic was the wrath of achilles of this poem in mr leafs opinion a the first book and fifty lines of the second book remain intact or perhaps are a blend of two versions b the valour of agamemnon and defeat of the achaeans of this there are portions in book xi but they were meddled with altered and generally doctored down to the latest period namely the age of pisistratus in athens the middle of the sixth century bc c the fight in which after their defeat the achaeans try to save the ships from the torch of hector and the valour of patroclus but some critics do not accept this with his death xv xvi in parts d some eighty lines on the arming of achilles xix e perhaps an incident or two in books xx xxi f the slaying ofby achilles in books xxi xxii but some of the learned will not admit this and we shall unhappily have to prove that if mr leafs principles be correct we really know nothing about the slaying of hector in its original form  of these six elements only did the original poem consist mr leaf thinks a rigid critic will reject as original even the valour of patroclus and the death of hector but mr leaf refuses to go so far as that the original poem as detected by him is really the work of a single poet perhaps the greatest in all the worlds history if the original poet did no more than is here allotted to him especially if he left out the purpose of zeus and the person of thetis in book i we do not quite understand his unapproachable greatness he must certainly have drawn a rather commonplace achilles as we shall see and we confess to preferring the iliad as it stands  the brief narrative cut out of the mass by mr leaf then was the genuine old original poem or kernel what we commonly call the iliad on the other hand is by his theory a thing of shreds and patches combined in a manner to be later described the blend we learn has none of the masterly unity of the old original poem meanwhile as criticism of literary composition is a purely literary question critics who differ from mr leaf have a right to hold that the iliad as it stands contains and always did contain a plot of masterly perfection we need not attend here so closely to mr leafs theory in the matter of the first expansions 2 and the second expansions 3 but the latest expansions 4 give the account of the embassy to achilles with his refusal of agamemnons apologybook ix the blank space book xxiv the reconciliation of achilles and agamemnon and the funeral games of patroclus xxiii in all these parts of the poem there are we learn countless alterations additions and expansions with last of all many transitional passages the work of the editor inspired by the statesman that is of an hypothetical editor who really by the theory made our iliad being employed to that end by pistratus about 540 bc footnote leaf iliad vol ii pp x xiv 1900  mr leaf and critics who take his general view are enabled to detect the patches and tatters of many ages by various tests for example by discovering discrepancies in the narrative such as in their opinion no one sane poet could make other proofs of multiplex authorship are discovered by the critics private sense of what the poem ought to be by his instinctive knowledge of style by detection of the poets supposed errors in geography by modernisms and false archaisms in words and grammar and by the presence of many objects especially weapons and armour which the critic believes to have been unknown to the original minstrel  thus criticism can pick out the things old fairly old late and quite recent from the mass evolved through many centuries which is called the iliad  if the existing iliad is a mass of expansions added at all sorts of dates in any number of places during very different stages of culture to a single short old poem of the mycenaean age science needs an hypothesis which will account for the iliad as it stands everybody sees the need of the hypothesis how was the medley of new songs by many generations of irresponsible hands codified into a plot which used to be reckoned fine how were the manners customs and characters unus color preserved in a fairly coherent and uniform aspect how was the whole greek world throughout which all manner of discrepant versions and incongruous lays must by the theory have been current induced to accept the version which has been bequeathed to us why and for what audience or what readers did somebody in a late age of brief lyrics and of philosophic poems take the trouble to harmonise the body of discrepant wandering lays and codify them in the iliad  an hypothesis which will answer all these questions is the first thing needful and hypotheses are produced  believers like mr leaf in the development of the iliad through the changing revolutionary centuries between say 1200 and 600 bc consciously stand in need of a working hypothesis which will account above all for two facts first the relatively correct preservation of the harmony of the picture of life of ideas political and religious of the characters of the heroes of the customary law such as the brideprice in marriage and of the details as to weapons implements dress art houses and so forth when these are not according to the theory deliberately altered by late poets  next the hypothesis must explain in mr leafs own words how a single version of the iliad came to be accepted where many rival versions must from the necessity of the case have once existed side by side footnote iliad vol i p xviii 1900  three hypotheses have in fact been imagined the first suggests the preservation of the original poems in very early written texts not of course in homers autograph this view mr leaf we shall see discards the second presents the notion of one old sacred college for the maintenance of poetic uniformity mr leaf rejects this theory while supposing that there were schools for professional reciters  last there is the old hypothesis of wolf pisistratus about 540 bc was the first who had the homeric poems committed to writing and brought into that order in which we now possess them  this hypothesis now more than a century old would if it rested on good evidence explain how a single version of the various lays came to be accepted and received as authorised the greek world by the theory had only in various places various sets of incoherent chants orally current on the wrath of the public was everywhere a public of listeners who heard the lays sung on rare occasions at feasts and fairs or whenever a strolling rhapsodist took up his pitch for a day or two at a street corner there was by the theory no reading public for the homeric poetry but by the time of pisistratus a reading public was coming into existence the tyrant had the poems collected edited arranged into a continuous narrative primarily for the purpose of regulating the recitals at the panathenaic festival when once they were written copies were made and the rest of hellas adopted these for their public purposes  on a small scale we have a case analogous the old songs of scotland existed with the airs partly in human memory partly in scattered broadsheets the airs were good but the words were often silly more often they were fescenninemore dirt than wit burns rewrote the words which were published in handsome volumes with the old airs or with these airs altered and his became the authorised versions while the ancient anonymous chants were almost entirely forgotten  the parallel is fairly close but there are points of difference burns was a great lyric poet whereas we hear of no great epic poet in the age of pisistratus the old words which burnss songs superseded were wretched doggerel not such were the ancient greek heroic lays the old scottish songs had no sacred historic character they did not contain the history of the various towns and districts of scotland the heroic lays of greece were believed on the other hand to be a kind of domesday book of ancient principalities and cities and worshipped heroes thus it was much easier for a great poet like burns to supersede with his songs a mass of unconsidered sculdudery old lays in which no man or set of men had any interest than for a mere editor in the age of pisistratus to supersede a set of lays cherished in one shape or another by every state in greece this holds good even if prior to pisistratus there existed in greece no written texts of homer and no reading public a point which we shall show reasons for declining to concede  the theory of the edition of pisistratus if it rested on valid evidence would explain how a single version of the poems came to be accepted namely because the poem was now written for the first time and oral versions fell out of memory but it would not of course explain how before pisistratus during four or five centuries of change the new poets and reciters throughout the greek world each adding such fresh verses as he pleased and often introducing such modern details of life as he pleased kept up the harmony of the homeric picture of life and character and law as far as it confessedly exists  to take a single instance the poems never allude to the personal armorial bearings of the heroes they are unknown to or unnamed by homer but are very familiar on the shields in seventh century and sixth century vases and aeschylus introduces them with great poetic effect in blank space how did late continuators familiar with the serpents lions bulls heads crabs doves and so forth on the contemporary shields keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new rhapsodies in mediaeval france we shall show the epics eleventh to thirteenth centuries deal with charlemagne and his peers of the eighth century ad but they provide these heroes with the armorial bearings which came in during the eleventh to twelfth century ad the late homeric rhapsodists avoided such tempting anachronisms  wolfs theory then explains how a single version came to be accepted it was the first written version the others died out like the old scots orally repeated songs when burns published new words to the airs but wolfs theory does not explain the harmony of the picture of life the absence of post homeric ideas and ways of living in the first written version which practically is our own version  in 1892 companion to the iliad mr leaf adopted a different theory the hypothesis of a homeric school which busied itself with the tradition of the homeric poetry for there must have been some central authority to preserve the text intact when it could not be preserved in writing were there no such body to maintain a fixed standard the poems must have ended by varying indefinitely according to the caprice of their various reciters this is perfectly obvious  such a school could keep an eye on anachronisms and excise them in fact the maori priests in an infinitely more barbarous state of society had such schools for the preservation of their ancient hymns in purity the older priests insisted on a critical and verbatim rehearsal of all the ancient lore proceedings were sanctioned by human sacrifices and many mystic rites we are not told that new poems were produced and criticised it does not appear that this was the case pupils attended from three to five years and then qualified as priests or tohunga footnote white the ancient history of the maori vol i pp 8 13 suppose that the asiatic greeks like the maoris and zuñis had poetic colleges of a sacred kind admitting new poets and keeping them up to the antique standard in all respects if this were so the relative rarity of anachronisms and of modernisms in language in the homeric poems is explained but mr leaf has now entirely and with a light heart abandoned his theory of a school which is unsupported by evidence he says  the great problem he writes for those who maintain the gradual growth of the poems by a process of crystallisation has been to understand how a single version came to be accepted where many rival versions must from the necessity of the case have once existed side by side the assumption of a school or guild of singers has been made and mr leaf in 1892 made the assumption himself as some such hypothesis we are bound to make in order to explain the possibility of any theory 1892 footnote companion to the iliad pp 20 21  but now 1900 he says after mentioning the assumption of a school or guild of singers that the rare mention of greek homeridai in chios gives no support to this hypothesis which lacks any other confirmation footnote iliad vol i xviii p xix he therefore now adopts the wolfian hypothesis that an official copy of homer was made in athens at the time of solon or pisistratus from the rhapsodies existing in the memory of reciters footnote iliad vol i p xix but mr leaf had previously said footnote companion to the iliad p 190 that the legend which connects his pisistratuss name with the homeric poems is itself probably only conjectural and of late date now the evidence for pisistratus which in 1892 he thought conjectural and of late date seems to him a sufficient basis for an hypothesis of a pisistratean editor of the iliad while the evidence for an homeric school which appeared to him good enough for an hypothesis in 1892 is rejected as worthless though in each case the evidence itself remains just what it used to be  this is not very satisfactory and the pisistratean hypothesis is much less useful to a theorist than the former hypothesis of an homeric school for the pisistratean hypothesis cannot explain the harmony of the characters and the details in the iliad nor the absence of such glaring anachronisms as the cyclic poets made nor the general preodyssean character of the language and grammar by the pisistratean hypothesis there was not what mr leaf in 1892 justly deemed essential a school to maintain a fixed standard throughout the changes of four centuries and against the caprice of many generations of fresh reciters and irresponsible poets the hypothesis of a school was really that which of the two best explained the facts and there is no more valid evidence for the first making and writing out of our iliad under pisistratus than for the existence of a homeric school  the evidence for the iliad edited for pisistratus is examined in a note at the close of this chapter meanwhile mr leaf now revives wolfs old theory to account for the fact that somehow a single version of the homeric poems came to be accepted his present theory if admitted does account for the acceptation of a single version of the poems the first standard written version but fails to explain how the caprice of the different reciters as he says did not wander into every variety of anachronism in detail and in diction thus producing a chaos which no editor of about 540 ad could force into its present uniformity  such an editor is now postulated by mr leaf if his editors edition as being written was accepted by greece then we understand how a single version came to be accepted but we do not understand how the editor could possibly introduce a harmony which could only have characterised his materials as mr leaf has justly remarked if there was an homeric school to maintain a fixed standard but now such harmony in the picture of life as exists in the poems is left without any explanation we have now by the theory a crowd of rhapsodists many generations of uncontrolled wandering men who for several centuries  rave recite and madden through the land  with no written texts and with no fixed body to maintain a standard such men would certainly not adhere strictly to a stereotyped early tradition that we cannot expect from them  again no editor of about 540 bc could possibly bring harmony of manners customs and diction into such of their recitals as he took down in writing  let us think out the supposed editors situation during three centuries nine generations of strollers have worked their will on one ancient short poem the wrath of achilles this is in itself an unexampled fact poets turn to new topics they do not as a rule for centuries embroider one single situation out of the myriads which heroic legend affords strolling reciters are the least careful of men each would recite in the language and grammar of his day and introduce the newly evolved words and idioms the new and fashionable manners costume and weapons of his time when war chariots became obsolete he would bring in cavalry when there was no overlord he would not trouble himself to maintain correctly the character and situation of agamemnon he would speak of coined money in cases of buying and selling his european geography would often be wrong he would not ignore the ionian cities of asia most weapons would be of iron not bronze in his lays ionian religious ideas could not possibly be excluded nor changes in customary law civil and criminal yet we think none of these things occurs in homer  the editor of the theory had to correct all these anachronisms and discrepancies what a task in an uncritical age the editors materials would be the lays known to such strollers as happened to be gathered in athens perhaps at the panathenaic festival the répertoire of each stroller would vary indefinitely from those of all the others one man knew this chant as modified or made by himself other men knew others equally unsatisfactory  the editor must first have written down from recitation all the passages that he could collect then he was obliged to construct a narrative sequence containing a plot which he fashioned by a process of selection and rejection and then he had to combine passages alter them add as much as he thought fit remove anachronisms remove discrepancies accidentally bring in fresh discrepancies as always happens weave transitional passages look with an antiquarian eye after the too manifest modernisms in language and manners and so produce the blank space that in the sixth century bc any man undertook such a task and succeeded so well as to impose on aristotle and all the later greek critics appears to be a theory that could only occur to a modern man of letters who is thinking of the literary conditions of his own time the editor was doing and doing infinitely better what lönnrot in the nineteenth century tried in vain to achieve for the finnish kalewala footnote see comparetti the kalewala  centuries later than pisistratus in a critical age apollonius rhodius set about writing an epic of the homeric times we know how entirely he failed on all hands to restore the manner of homer the editor of 540 bc was a more scientific man can any one who sets before himself the nature of the editors task believe in him and it to the masterless floating jellyfish of old poems and new mr leaf supposes that but small and unimportant additions were made after the end of the eighth century or thereabouts especially as the creative and imaginative forces of the ionian race turned to other forms of expression to lyrics and to philosophic poems but the able pisistratean editor after all we find introduced quantities of new matter into the poemsin the middle of the sixth century that kind of industry then did not cease towards the end of the eighth century as we have been told on the other hand as we shall learn the editor contributed to the iliad among other things nestors descriptions of his youthful adventures for the purpose of flattering nestors descendant the tyrant pisistratus of athens  one hypothesis the theory of an homeric schoolwhich would answer our question how was the harmony of the picture of life in remote ages preserved in poems composed in several succeeding ages and in totally altered conditions of lifemr leaf as we know rejects we might suggest again that there were written texts handed down from an early period and preserved in new copies from generation to generation mr leaf states his doubt that there were any such texts the poems were all this time handed down orally only by tradition among the singers sic who used to wander over greece reciting them at popular festivals writing was indeed known through the whole period of epic development some four centuries at least but it is in the highest degree unlikely that it was ever employed to form a standard text of the epic or any part of it there can hardly have been any standard text at best there was a continuous tradition of those parts of the poems which were especially popular and the knowledge of which was a valuable asset to the professional reciter  now we would not contend for the existence of any blank space text much before 600 bc and i understand mr leaf not to deny now that there may have been texts of the odyssey and iliad before say 600540 bc if cities and reciters had any ancient texts then texts existed though not standard texts and by this means the harmony of thought character and detail in the poems might be preserved we do not think that it is in the highest degree unlikely that there were no texts is this one of the many points on which every savant must rely on his own sense of what is likely to this essential point the almost certain existence of written texts we return in our conclusion  what we have to account for is not only the relative lack of anachronisms in poems supposed to have been made through a period of at least four hundred years but also the harmony of the characters in subtle details some of the characters will be dealt with later meanwhile it is plain that mr leaf when he rejects both the idea of written texts prior to 600540 bc and also the idea of a school charged with the duty of maintaining a fixed standard leaves a terrible task to his supposed editor of orally transmitted poems which he saysif unpreserved by text or schoolmust have ended by varying infinitely according to the caprice of their various reciters footnote companion to the iliad p 21  on that head there can be no doubt in the supposed circumstances no harmony no unus color could have survived in the poems till the days of the sixth century editor  here then is another difficulty in the path of the theory that the iliad is the work of four centuries if it was we are not enabled to understand how it came to be what it is no editor could possibly tinker it into the whole which we possess none could steer clear of many absurd anachronisms these are found by critics but it is our hope to prove that they do not exist   note  the legend of the making of the iliad under pisistratos  it has been shown in the text that in 1892 mr leaf thought the story about the making of the iliad under pisistratus a legend without authority while he regarded the traditions concerning an homeric school as sufficient basis for an hypothesis which we are bound to make in order to explain the possibility of any theory in 1900 he entirely reversed his position the school was abandoned and the story of pisistratus was accepted one objection to accepting any of the various legends about the composing and writing out for the first time of the iliad in the sixth century the age of pisistratus was the silence of aristarchus on the subject he discussed the authenticity of lines in the iliad which according to the legend were interpolated for a political purpose by solon or pisistratus but as far as his comments have reached us in the scholia he never said a word about the tradition of athenian interpolation now aristarchus must at least have known the tradition of the political use of a disputed line for aristotle writes rhetoric i 15 that the athenians early in the sixth century quoted iliad ii 558 to prove their right to salamis aristarchus also discussed iliad ii 553 555 to which the spartans appealed on the question of supreme command against persia herodotus vii 159 again aristarchus said nothing or nothing that has reached us about athenian interpolation once more odyssey ii 631 was said by hereas a megarian writer to have been interpolated by pisistratus plutarch but the scholia that represent the teaching of aristarchus never make any reference to the alleged dealings of pisistratus with the iliad the silence of aristarchus however affords no safe ground of argument to believers or disbelievers in the original edition written out by order of pisistratus  it can never be proved that the scholiasts did not omit what aristarchus said though we do not know why they should have done so and it can never be proved that aristarchus was ignorant of the traditions about pisistratus or that he thought them unworthy of notice all is matter of conjecture on these points mr leafs conversion to belief in the story that our iliad was practically edited and first committed to writing under pisistratus appears to be due to the probability that aristarchus must have known the tradition but if he did there is no proof that he accepted it as historically authentic there is not in fact any proof even that aristarchus must have known the tradition he had probably read dieuchidas of megara for wilamowitz has shown that dieuchidas wrote in the fourth century footnote iliad vol i p xix but unluckily we do not know that dieuchidas stated that the iliad was made and first committed to writing in the sixth century bc no mortal knows what dieuchidas said and again what dieuchidas said is not evidence he wrote as a partisan in a historical dispute  the story about pisistratus and his editor the practical maker of the iliad is interwoven with a legend about an early appeal in the beginning of the sixth century bc to homer as an historical authority the athenians and megarians contending for the possession of the island of salamis the home of the hero aias are said to have laid their differences before the spartans cir 600580 bc each party quoted homer as evidence aristotle who as we saw mentions the tale rhetoric i 15 merely says that the athenians cited iliad ii 558 aias led and stationed his men where the phalanxes of the athenians were posted aristarchus condemned this line not as far as evidence goes because there was a tradition that the athenians had interpolated it to prove their point but because he thought it inconsistent with iliad iii 230 iv 251 which if i may differ from so great a critic it is not these two passages deal not with the position of the camps but of the men in the field on a certain occasion but if aristarchus had thought the tradition of athenian interpolation of ii 558 worthy of notice he might have mentioned it in support of his opinion perhaps he did no reference to his notice has reached us however this may be mr leaf mainly bases his faith in the pisistratean editor apparently we shall see an asiatic greek residing in athens on a fragmentary passage of diogenes laertius third century ad concerned with the tale of homers being cited about 600 580 bc as an authority for the early ownership of salamis in this text diogenes quotes dieuchidas as saying something about pisistratus in relation to the homeric poems but what dieuchidas really said is unknown for a part has dropped out of the text  the text of diogenes laertius runs thus solon i 57 he solon decreed that the homeric poems should be recited by rhapsodists greek text ex hypobolaes words of disputed sense so that where the first reciter left off thence should begin his successor it was rather solon then than pisistratus who brought homer to light greek text ephotisen as diogenes says in the fifth book of his megarica and the lines were especially these they who held athens c iliad ii 546558 the passage on which the athenians rested in their dispute with the megarians  and what lines were especially these mr leaf fills up the gap in the sense after pisistratus thus for it was he solon who interpolated lines in the catalogue and not pisistratus he says the natural sense of the passage as it stands in diogenes laertius is this it was not peisistratos as is generally supposed but solon who collected the scattered homer of his day for he it was who interpolated the lines in the catalogue of the ships but diogenes neither says for himself nor quotes from dieuchidas anything about collecting the scattered homer of his day that pisistratus did so is mr leafs theory but there is not a hint about anybody collecting anything in the greek ritschl indeed conjecturally supplying the gap in the text of diogenes invented the words who collected the homeric poems and inserted some things to please the athenians but mr leaf rejects that conjecture as clearly wrong then why does he adopt as the natural sense of the passage it was not peisistratos but solon who collected the scattered homer of his day footnote iliad vol i p xviii the testimony of dieuchidas as far as we can see in the state of the text refers as mr monro says to the interpolation that has just been mentioned and need not extend further back interpolation is a process that postulates a text in which the additional verses can be inserted whereas if i understand mr leaf the very first text in his opinion was that compiled by the editor for pisistratus footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 400 410 especially pp 408409 mr leaf himself dismisses the story of the athenian appeal to homer for proof of their claim as a fiction if so it does not appear that ancient commentaries on a fiction are of any value as proof that pisistratus produced the earliest edition of the iliad footnote mr leaf adds that except in one disputed line iliad ii 558 aias is not in the iliad encamped next the athenians his proofs of this odd oversight of the fraudulent interpolator who should have altered the line are iliad iv 327 ff and xii 681 ff in the former passage we find odysseus stationed next to the athenians but odysseus would have neighbours on either hand in the second passage we find the athenians stationed next to the boeotians and ionians but the athenians too had neighbours on either side the arrangement was on the achaean extreme left protesilauss command he was dead and that of aias then the boeotians and ionians with the picked men of the athenians and then odysseus on the boeotolonoathenian right or so the athenians would read the passage the texts must have seemed favourable to the fraudulent athenian interpolator denounced by the megarians or he would have altered them mr leaf however argues that line 558 of book ii cannot be original as is patent from the fact that aias in the rest of the iliad is not encamped next the athenians see iv 327 xiii 681 the megarians do not seem to have seen it or they would have cited these passages but why argue at all about the megarian story if it be a fiction mr leaf takes the brief bald mention of aias in iliad ii 558 as a mocking cry from athens over the conquest of the island of the aiakidai but as in this same catalogue aias is styled by far the best of warriors after achilles ii 768 while there is no more honourable mention made of diomede than that he had a loud war cry ii 568 or of menelaus but that he was also sonorous and while nestor the ancestor of pisistratus receives not even that amount of praise line 601 the mocking cry from athens appears a vain imagination  the lines disputed by the megarians occur in the catalogue and as to the date and original purpose of the catalogue the most various opinions prevail in mr leafs earlier edition of the iliad vol i p 37 he says that nothing convincing has been urged to show that the catalogue is of late origin we know from the story of solon and the megarians that the catalogue was considered a classical workthe domesday book of greece at a very early datesay 600 580 bc it agrees with the poems in being predorian except in lines 653670  there seems therefore to be no valid reason for doubting that it like the bulk of the iliad and odyssey was composed in achaean times and carried with the emigrants to the coast of asia minor  in his new edition vol ii p 86 mr leaf concludes that the catalogue originally formed an introduction to the whole cycle the compiling of the whole cycle being of uncertain date but very late indeed on any theory the author studiously preserves an antedorian standpoint it is admitted that there can be little doubt that some of the material at least is old  these opinions are very different from those expressed by mr leaf in 1886 he cannot now give even an approximate date for the composition of the catalogue which we conceive must be the latest thing in homer if it was composed for that portion of the whole cycle which as worked up in a separate poem was called the kypria for the kypria is obviously a very late performance done as a prelude to the iliad  i am unable to imagine how this mutilated passage of diogenes even if rightly restored proves that dieuchidas a writer of the fourth century bc alleged that pisistratus made a collection of scattered homeric poemsin fact made a standard text  the pisistratean hypothesis was not so long ago unfashionable but in the last few years a clear reaction has set in says mr leaf footnote iliad i p xix  the reaction has not affected that celebrated scholar dr blass who with teutonic frankness calls the pisistratean edition an absurd legend footnote blass die interpolationen in der odyssee pp i 2 halle 1904 meyer says that the alexandrians rejected the pisistratean story as a worthless fable differing here from mr leaf and wilamowitz and he spurns the legend saying that it is incredible that the whole greek world would allow the tyrants of athens to palm off a homer on them footnote meyer geschichte des alterthums ii 390 391 1893  mr t w allen an eminent textual scholar treats the pisistratean editor with no higher respect in an egyptian papyrus containing a fragment of julius africanus a christian chronologer mr allen finds him talking confidently of the pisistratidae they stitched together the rest of the epic but excised some magical formulae which julius africanus preserves mr allen remarks the statements about pisistratus belong to a wellestablished category that of homeric mythology the anecdotes about pisistratus and the poet himself are on a par with dares who wrote the iliad before homer footnote classical review xviii 148  the editor of pisistratus is hardly in fashion though that is of no importance of importance is the want of evidence for the editor and as we have shown the impossible character of the task allotted to him by the theory  as i suppose mr leaf to insinuate fashion has really nothing to do with the question people who disbelieve in written texts must and do oscillate between the theory of an homeric school and the wolfian theory that pisistratus or solon or somebody procured the making of the first written text at athens in the sixth centurya theory which fails to account for the harmony of the picture of life in the poems and as mr monro grote nutzhorn and many others argue lacks evidence  as mr monro reasons and as blass states the case bluntly solon or pisistratus or whoever it was put a stop at least as far as athens was concerned to the mangling of homer by the rhapsodists or reciters each anxious to choose a pet passage and not going through the whole iliad in due sequence but the unity existed before the mangling that this has been so long and so stubbornly misunderstood is no credit to german scholarship blind uncritical credulity on one side limitless and arbitrary theorising on the other we are not solitary sceptics when we decline to accept the theory of mr leaf it is neither bottomed on evidence nor does it account for the facts in the case that is to say the evidence appeals to mr leaf as valid but is thought worse than inadequate by other great scholars such as monro and blass while the fact of the harmony of the picture of life preserved through four or five centuries appears to be left without explanation  mr leaf holds that in order to organise recitations in due sequence the making of a text presenting for the first time a due sequence was necessary his opponents hold that the sequence already existed but was endangered by the desultory habits of the rhapsodists we must here judge each for himself there is no court of final appeal  i confess to feeling some uncertainty about the correctness of my statement of mr leafs opinions he and i both think an early attic recension probable or almost certain but see conclusion i regard such recension as distinct from the traditional edition of pisistratus mr leaf i learn does not regard the edition as having made the iliad yet his descriptions of the processes and methods of his pisistratean editor correspond to my idea of the making of our iliad as it stands see for example mr leafs introduction to iliad book ii he will not even insist on the early attic as the first written text if it was not its general acceptance seems to remain a puzzle he discards the idea of one homeric school of paramount authority but presumes that as recitation was a profession there must have been schools we do not hear of them or know the nature of their teaching the beauvais school of jongleurs in lent fourteenth century ad seems to have been a holiday conference of strollers     chapter iv   loose feudalism the overlord in iliad books i and ii  we now try to show that the epics present an historical unity a complete and harmonious picture of an age in its political social legal and religious aspects in its customs and in its military equipment a long epic can only present an unity of historical ideas if it be the work of one age wandering minstrels living through a succession of incompatible ages civic commercial democratic could not preserve without flaw or failure the attitude in the first place of the poet of feudal princes towards an overlord who rules them by undisputed right divine but rules weakly violently unjustly being subject to gusts of arrogance and avarice and repentance late poets not living in feudal society and unfamiliar alike with its customary law its jealousy of the overlord its conservative respect for his consecrated function would inevitably miss the proper tone and fail in some of the many blank space of the feudal situation this is all the more certain if we accept mr leafs theory that each poetrhapsodists répertoire varied from the répertoires of the rest there could be no unity of treatment in their handling of the character and position of the overlord and of the customary law that regulates his relations with his peers again no editor of 540 bc could construct an harmonious picture of the overlord in relation to the princes out of the fragmentary répertoires of strolling rhapsodists which now lay before him in written versions if the editor could do this he was a man of shakespearian genius and had minute knowledge of a dead society this becomes evident when in place of examining the iliad through microscopes looking out for discrepancies we study it in its large lines as a literary whole the question being is the iliad a literary whole or a mere literary mosaic we must ask what taking it provisionally as a literary whole are the qualities of the poet as a painter of what we may call feudal society  choosing the part of the overlord agamemnon we must not forget that he is one of several analogous figures in the national poetry and romance of other feudal ages of that great analogous figure charlemagne and of his relations with his peers in the earlier and later french mediaeval epics we shall later speak another example is arthur in some romances the blameless king in others un roi fainéant  the parallel irish case is found in the irish saga of diarmaid and grainne we read mr ogradys introduction on the position of eionn mac cumhail the legendary overlord of ireland the agamemnon of the celts fionn like many men in power is variable he is at times magnanimous at other times tyrannical and petty diarmaid oisin oscar and caoilte mac rohain are everywhere the greek kaloi kachotoi of the fenians of them we never hear anything bad footnote transactions of the ossianic society vol iii p 39  human nature eternally repeats itself in similar conditions of society french norse celtic and achaean we never hear anything bad of diomede odysseus or aias and the evil in achilless resentment up to a certain point is legal and not beyond what the poet thinks natural and pardonable in his circumstances  the poets view of agamemnon is expressed in the speeches and conduct of the peers in book i we see the bullying truculence of agamemnon wreaked first on the priest of apollo chryses then in threats against the prophet chalcas then in menaces against any prince on whom he chooses to avenge his loss of fair chryseis and finally in the seizure of briseis from achilles  this part of the first book of the iliad is confessedly original and there is no varying throughout the epic from the strong and delicate drawing of an historical situation and of a complex character agamemnon is truculent and eager to assert his authority but he is also possessed of a heavy sense of his responsibilities which often unmans him he has a legal right to a separate prize of honour geras after each capture of spoil considering the wrath of apollo for the wrong done in refusing his priests offered ransom for his daughter agamemnon will give her back if that is better rather would i see my folks whole than perishing footnote iliad i 115117  here we note points of feudal law and of kingly character the giving and taking of ransom exists as it did in the middle ages ransom is refused death is dealt as the war becomes more fierce towards its close agamemnon has sense enough to waive his right to the girlish prize for the sake of his people but is not so generous as to demand no compensation but there are no fresh spoils to apportion and the overlord threatens to take the prize of one of his peers even of achilles  thereon achilles does what was frequently done in the feudal age of western europe he renounces his fealty and will return to phthia he adds insult thou dogface the whole situation we shall show recurs again and again in the epics of feudal france the later epics of feudal discontent agamemnon replies that achilles may do as he pleases i have others by my side that shall do me honour and above all zeus lord of counsel i 175 he rules literally by divine right and we shall see that in the french feudal epics as in homer this claim of divine right is granted even in the case of an insolent and cowardly overlord achilles half draws his great sword one of the long ponderous cutandthrust bronze swords of which we have actual examples from mycenae and elsewhere he is restrained by athene visible only to him with words indeed she says revile him  hereafter shall goodly gifts come to thee yea in threefold measure  gifts of atonement for surquedry like that of agamemnon are given and received in the french epics for example in the blank space the iliad throughout exhibits much interest in such gifts and in the customary law as to their acceptance and other ritual or etiquette of reconciliation this fact it will be shown accounts for a passage which critics reject and which is tedious to our taste as it probably was tedious to the age of the supposed late poets themselves book xix but the taste of a feudal audience as of the audience of the saga men delighted in realistic descriptions of their own customs and customary law as in descriptions of costume and armour this is fortunate for students of customary law and costume but wearies hearers and readers who desire the action to advance passages of this kind would never be inserted by late poets who had neither the knowledge of nor any interest in the subjects  to return to achilles he is now within his right the moral goddess assures him of that and he is allowed to give the reins to his tongue as he does in passages to which the mediaeval epics offer many parallels in the mediaeval epics as in homer there is no idea of recourse to a duel between the overlord and his peer achilles accuses agamemnon of drunkenness greed and poltroonery he does not return home but swears by the sceptre that agamemnon shall rue his outrecuidance when hector slays the host by the law of the age achilles remains within his right his violent words are not resented by the other peers they tacitly admit as athene admits that achilles has the right being so grievously injured to renounce his fealty till agamemnon makes apology and gives gifts of atonement such plainly is the unwritten feudal law which gives to the overlord the lions share of booty the initiative in war and council and the right to command but limits him by the privilege of the peers to renounce their fealty under insufferable provocation in no book is agamemnon so direfully insulted as in the first which is admitted to be of the original kernel elsewhere the sympathy of the poet occasionally enables him to feel the elements of pathos in the position of the overtasked king of men  as concerns the apology and the gifts of atonement the poet has feudal customary law and usage clearly before his eyes he knows exactly what is due and the limits of the rights of overlord and prince matters about which the late ionian poets could only pick up information by a course of study in constitutional historythe last thing they were likely to attemptunless we suppose that they all kept their eyes on the kernel and that steadily through centuries generations of strollers worked on the lines laid down in that brief poem  thus the poet of book ixone of the latest expansions thoroughly understands the legal and constitutional situation as between agamemnon and achilles or rather all the poets who collaborated in book ix which had grown by a process of accretion footnote leaf iliad vol i p 371 understood the legal situation  returning to the poets conception of agamemnon we find in the character of agamemnon himself the key to the difficulties which critics discover in the second book the difficulty is that when zeus won over to the cause of achilles by thetis sends a false dream to agamemnon the dream tells the prince that he shall at once take troy and bids him summon the host to arms but agamemnon far from doing that summons the host to a peaceful assembly with the wellknown results of demoralisation  mr leaf explains the circumstances on his own theory of expansions compiled into a confused whole by a late editor he thinks that probably there were two varying versions even of this earliest book of the poem in one a the story went on from the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles to the holding of a general assembly to consider the altered state of affairs this is the assembly of book h but debate in version a was opened by thersites not by agamemnon and thersites proposed instant flight that was probably the earlier version  in the other early version b after the quarrel between the chiefs the story did not as in a go on straight to the assembly but achilles appealed to his mother the fair sea goddess as in our iliad and she obtained from zeus as in the actual iliad his promise to honour achilles by giving victory in his absence to the trojans the poet of version b in fact created the beautiful figure of thetis so essential to the development of the tenderness that underlies the ferocity of achilles the other and earliest poet who treated of the wrath of the author of version a neglected that opportunity with all that it involved and omitted the purpose of zeus which is mentioned in the fifth line of the epic the editor of 540 bc seeing good in both versions a and b combined his information and produced books i and ii of the iliad as they stand footnote leaf iliad vol i p 47  mr leaf suggests that there is some ground for supposing that the oldest version of the wrath of achilles did not contain the promise of zeus to thetis it was a tale played exclusively on the earthly stage footnote ibid vol i p xxiii in that case the author of the oldest form a must have been a poet very inferior indeed to the later author of b who took up and altered his work in his version book i does not end with the quarrel of the princes but achilles receives with all the courtesy of his character the unwelcome heralds of agamemnon and sends briseis with them to the overlord he then with tears appeals to his goddessmother thetis of the sea who rose from the grey mere like a mist leaving the sea deeps where she dwelt beside her father the ancient one of the waters then sat she face to face with her son as he let the tears down fall and caressed him saying child wherefore weepest thou for what sorrow of heart hide it not tell it to me that i may know it as well as thou here the poet strikes the keynote of the character of achilles the deadly in war the fierce in council who weeps for his lost lady and his wounded honour and cries for help to his mother as little children cry  such is the achilles of the iliad throughout and consistently but such he was not to the mind of mr leafs probably elder poet the author of version a thetis in version b promises to persuade zeus to honour achilles by making agamemnon rue his absence and twelve days after the quarrel wins the gods consent  in book ii zeus reflects on his promise and sends a false dream to beguile agamemnon promising that now he shall take troy agamemnon while asleep is full of hope but when he wakens he dresses in mufti in a soft doublet a cloak and sandals takes his sword swords were then worn as part of civil costume and the ancestral sceptre which he wields in peaceful assemblies day dawns and he bids the heralds a break here occurs according to the theory  here iliad book ii line 50 the kernel ceases mr leaf says and the editor of 540 bc plays his pranks for a while  the kernel or one of the two kernels we are to take up again at book ii 443483 and thence skip to xi 56 and now we have a narrative masterly in conception and smooth in execution footnote iliad vol i p 47 says mr leaf this kernel is kernel b probably the later kernel of the pair that in which achilles appeals to his lady mother who wins from zeus the promise to cause achaean defeat till achilles is duly honoured the whole epic turns on this promise of zeus as announced in the fifth sixth and seventh lines of the very first book if kernel a is the first kernel the poet left out the essence of the plot he had announced however let us first examine probable kernel b reading as advised book ii 150 blank space xi 56 ff  we left agamemnon though the dream bade him summon the host to arms dressed in civil costume his ancestral sceptre in his hand he is going to hold a deliberative assembly of the unarmed host his attire proves that fact greek prepodaes de ae stolae to epi boulaen exionti says the scholiast then if we skip as advised to ii 443483 he bids the heralds call the host not to peaceful council for which his costume is appropriate but to war the host gathers and in their midst the lord agamemnonstill in civil costume with his sceptre he has not changed his attire as far as we are told in face and eyes like zeus in waist like ares god of war in breast like poseidonyet for all that we are told entirely unarmed the host however were dressed in innumerable bronze war was sweeter to them than to depart in their ships to their dear native landso much did athene encourage them  but nobody had been speaking of flight in the kernel b that proposal was originally made by thersites in kernel a and was attributed to agamemnon in the part of book ii where the editor blends a and b this part at present mr leaf throws aside as a very late piece of compilation turning next as directed to xi 56 we find the trojans deploying in arms and the hosts encounter with furyagamemnon still for all that appears in the raiment of peace and with the sceptre of constitutional monarchy in he rushed first of all and slew bienor and many other gentlemen of troy not with his sceptre  clearly all this is the reverse of a narrative masterly in conception and smooth in execution it is an impossible narrative  mr leaf has attempted to disengage one of two forms of the old original poem from the parasitic later growths he has promised to show us a smooth and masterly narrative and the result is a narrative on which no achasan poet could have ventured in ii 50 the heralds are bidden greek kurussein that is to summon the hostto what to a peaceful assembly as agamemnons costume proves says the next line ii 51 but that is excised by mr leaf and we go on to ii 443 and the reunited passage now reads agamemnon bade the loud heralds ii 50 call the achaeans to battle ii 443 and they came in harness but their leaderwhen did he exchange chiton cloak and sceptre for helmet shield and spear a host appears in arms a king who set out with sceptre and doublet is found with a spear in bronze armour and not another word is said about the dream of agamemnon  it is perfectly obvious and certain that the two pieces of the broken kernel b do not fit together at all nor is this strange if the kernel was really broken and endured the insertion of matter enough to fill nine books ilxl if kernel b really contained book ii line 50 as mr leaf avers if agamemnon as in that line 50 bade the clearvoiced heralds do somethingwhat he bade them do was necessarily as his peaceful costume proves to summon the peaceful assembly which he was to moderate with his sceptre at such an assembly or at a preliminary council of chiefs he would assuredly speak of his dream as he does in the part excised mr leaf if he will not have a peaceful assembly as part of kernel b must begin his excision at the middle of line 42 in ii where agamemnon wakens and must make him dress not in mufti but in armour and call the host of the achaeans to arm as the dream bade him do and as he does in ii 443 perhaps we should then excise ii 45 2 45 3 with the reference to the plan of retreat for that is part of kernel a where there was no promise of zeus and no dream sent to agamemnon then from ii 483 the description of the glorious armed aspect of agamemnon mr leaf may pass to xi 56 the account of the trojans under hector of the battle of the prowess of agamemnon inspired by the dream which he contrary to homeric and french epic custom has very wisely mentioned to nobodythat is in the part not excised  this appears to be the only method by which mr leaf can restore the continuity of his kernel b  though mr leaf has failed to fit book xi to any point in book ii of course it does not follow that book xi cannot be a continuation of the original wrath of achilles version b if so we understand why agamemnon plucks up heart in book xi and is the chief cause of a temporary trojan reverse he relies on the dream sent from zeus in the opening lines of book ii the dream which was not in kernel a the dream which he communicated to nobody the dream conveying the promise that he should at once take troy this is perhaps a tenable theory though agamemnon had much reason to doubt whether the host would obey his command to arm but an alternative theory of why and wherefore agamemnon does great feats of valour in book xi will later be propounded note that the events of books xlxviii by mr leafs theory all occur on the very day after thetis according to kernel b 79 obtains from zeus his promise to honour achilles by the discomfiture of the achaeans they have suffered nothing till that moment as far as we learn from the absence of achilles and his 2500 men allowing for casualties say 2000  so far we have tracedfrom books i and ii to book xithe fortunes of kernel b of the supposed later of two versions of the opening of the iliad but there may have been a version a probably earlier we have been told in which achilles did not appeal to his mother nor she to zeus and zeus did not promise victory to the trojans and sent no false dream of success to agamemnon what were the fortunes of that oldest of all old kernels in this version a agamemnon having had no dream summoned a peaceful assembly to discuss the awkwardness caused by the mutiny of achilles the host met iliad ii 8799 here we pass from line 99 to 212242 thersites it is who opens the debate in version a insults agamemnon and advises flight the army rushed off to launch the ships as in ii 142210 and were brought back by odysseus who made a stirring speech and was well backed by agamemnon urging to battle  version a appears to us to have been a version that no heroic audience would endure a low person like thersites opens a debate in an assembly called by the overlord this could not possibly pass unchallenged among listeners living in the feudal age when a prince called an assembly he himself opened the debate as achilles does in book i 5467 that a lewd fellow the buffoon and grumbler of the host of the people nameless and silent throughout the epic should rush in and open debate in an assembly convoked by the overlord would have been regarded by feudal hearers or by any hearers with feudal traditions as an intolerable poetical license thersites would have been at once pulled down and beaten the host would not have rushed to the ships on his motion any feudal audience would know better than to endure such an impossibility they would have asked how could thersites speakwithout the sceptre  as the poem stands and ought to stand nobody less than the over lord acting within his right greek ae themis esti ii 73 could suggest the flight of the host and be obeyed  it is the absolute demoralisation of the host in consequence of the strange test of their lord agamemnon making a feigned proposal to fly and it is their confused bewildered return to the assembly under the persuasions of odysseus urged by athene that alone in the poem give thersites his unique opportunity to harangue when the overlord had called an assembly the first word of course was for to speak as he does in the poem as it stands that thersifes should rise in the arrogance bred by the recent disorderly and demoralised proceedings is one thing that he should open the debate when excitement was eager to hear agamemnon and before demoralisation set in is quite another we never hear again of thersites or of any one of the commonalty daring to open his mouth in an assembly thersites sees his one chance the chance of a life time and takes it because agamemnon by means of the testa proposal to flee homewards which succeeded it is said in the case of cortèshas reduced the host already discontented to a mob  before agamemnon thus displayed his ineptitude as he often does later thersites had no chance all this appears sufficiently obvious if we put ourselves at the point of view of the original listeners thersites merely continues in full assembly the mutinous babble which he has been pouring out to his neighbours during the confused rush to launch the ships and during the return produced by the influence of odysseus the poet says so himself iliad ii 212 the rest sat down  only thersites still chattered on no original poet could manage the situation in any other way  we have now examined mr leafs two supposed earliest versions of the beginning of the iliad his presumed earlier version a with no thetis no promise of zeus and no dream and with thersites opening debate is jejune unpoetical and omits the gentler and most winning aspect of the character of achilles while it could not possibly have been accepted by a feudal audience for the reasons already given his presumed later version b with thetis zeus and the false dream cannot be or certainly has not been brought by mr leaf into congruous connection with book xi and it results in the fighting of the unarmed agamemnon which no poet could have been so careless as to invent agamemnon could not go into battle without helmet shield and spears the other armour we need not dwell upon here and thersites could not have opened a debate when the overlord had called the assembly nor could he have moved the chiefs to prepare for flight unless as in the actual iliad they had already been demoralised by the result of the feigned proposal of flight by agamemnon and its effect upon the host probably every reader who understands heroic society temper and manners will so far agree with us  our own opinion is that the difficulties in the poem are caused partly by the poets conception of the violent wavering excitable and unstable character of agamemnon partly by some accident now indiscoverable save by conjecture which has happened to the text  the story in the actual iliad is that zeus planning disaster for the achaeans in accordance with his promise to thetis sends a false dream to tell agamemnon that he will take troy instantly he is bidden by the dream to summon the host to arms agamemnon still asleep has in his mind things not to be fulfilled him seemeth that he shall take priams town that very day ii 36 37 then he awoke ii 41 and obviously was no longer so sanguine once awake  being a man crushed by his responsibility and as commanderin chief extremely timid though personally brave he disobeys the dream dresses in civil costume and summons the host to a peaceful assembly not to war as the dream bade him do probably he thought that the host was disaffected and wanted to argue with them in place of commanding  here it is that the difficulty comes in and our perplexity is increased by our ignorance of the regular procedure in homeric times was the host not in arms and fighting every day when there was no truce there seems to have been no armistice after the mutiny of achilles for we are told that in the period between his mutiny and the day of the dream of agamemnon achilles was neither going to the assembly nor into battle but wasted his heart abiding there longing for war and the slogan i 489 492 thus it seems that war went on and that assemblies were being held in the absence of achilles it appears however that the fighting was mere skirmishing and raiding no general onslaught was attempted and from book ii 73 83 it seems to have been a matter of doubt with agamemnon and nestor whether the army would venture a pitched battle  it also appears from the passage cited i 489 492 that assemblies were being regularly held we are told that achilles did not attend them yet when we come to the assembly ii 86 100 it seems to have been a special and exciting affair to judge by the brilliant picture of the crowds the confusion and the cries nothing of the sort is indicated in the meeting of the assembly in i 545 8 why is there so much excitement at the assembly of book ii partly because it was summoned at dawn whereas the usual thing was for the host to meet in arms before fighting on the plain or going on raids assemblies were held when the days work was over the host therefore when summoned to an assembly at dawn expects to hear of something out of the commonas the mutiny of achilles suggests and is excited  we must ask then why does agamemnon after the dream has told him merely to summon the host to arma thing of daily routine call a deliberative morning assembly a thing clearly not of routine if agamemnon is really full of confidence inspired by the dream why does he determine not to do what is customary call the men to arms but as jeanne darc said to the dauphin to hold such long and weary councils mr jevons speaks of agamemnons confidence in the delusive dream as at variance with his proceedings and would excise ii 3541 the only lines which represent agamemnon as confidently believing in the dream footnote journal of hellenic studies vol vii pp 306 307 but the poet never once says that agamemnon awake did believe confidently in the dream agamemnon dwelt with hope while asleep when he wakenedhe went and called a peaceful morning assembly though the dream bade him call to arms he did not dare to risk his authority this was exactly in keeping with his character the poet should have said when he woke the dream appeared to him rather poor security for success saying so in poetic language of course and then there would be no difficulty in the summoning of an assembly at dawn but either the poet expected us to understand the difference between the hopes of agamemnon sleeping and the doubts of agamemnon waking to chill realitiesan experience common to all of us who dreamor some explanatory lines have been dropped outone or two would have cleared up the matter  if i am right the poet has not been understood people have not observed that agamemnon hopes while asleep and doubts and acts on his doubt when awake thus mr leaf writes elated by the dream as we are led to suppose agamemnon summons the armyto lead them into battle nothing of the sort he calls them to assembly footnote iliad vol ii p 46 but we ought not to have been led to suppose that the waking agamemnon was so elated as the sleeping agamemnon he was disillusioned on waking his conduct proves it he did not know what to think about the dream he did not know how the host would take the dream he doubted whether they would fight at his command so he called an assembly  mr jevons very justly cites a parallel case grote has remarked that in book vii of herodotus the dream sent by the gods to frighten xerxes when about to recede from his project has a marked parallel in the iliad thus xerxes after the defection of artabanus was despondent like agamemnon after the mutiny of achilles and was about to recede from his project to both a delusive dream is sent urging them to proceed xerxes calls an assembly however and says that he will not proceed why because says herodotus when day came he thought nothing of his dream agamemnon once awake thought doubtfully of his dream he called a privy council told the princes about his dreamof which nestor had a very dubious opinionand said that he would try the temper of the army by proposing instant flight the chiefs should restrain the men if they were eager to run away  now the epic prose narrative of herodotus is here clearly based on iliad ii which herodotus must have understood as i do but in homer there is no line to sayand one line or two would have been enoughthat agamemnon when awake doubted like xerxes though agamemnon when asleep had been confident the necessary line for all that we know still existed in the text used by herodotus homer may lose a line as well as dieuchidas of megara or rather diogenes laertius juvenal lost a whole passage rediscovered by mr winstedt in a bodleian manuscript if homer expected modern critics to note the delicate distinction between agamemnon asleep and agamemnon awake or to understand agamemnons character he expected too much footnote cf jevons journal of hellenic studies vol vii pp 306 307 the poet then treats the situation on these lines agamemnon awake and free from illusion does not obey the dream does not call the army to war he takes a middle course  in the whole passage the poets main motive as mr monro remarks with obvious truth is to let his audience become acquainted with the temper and spirit of the army as it was affected by the long siege  and by the events of the first book footnote monro iliad vol i p 261 the poet could not obtain his object if agamemnon merely gave the summons to battle and he thinks agamemnon precisely the kind of waverer who will call first the privy council of the chiefs and then an assembly herein the homesick host will display its humours as it does with a vengeance agamemnon next tells his dream to the chiefs if he had a dream of this kind he would most certainly tell it and adds as has been already stated that he will first test the spirit of the army by a feigned proposal of return to greece while the chiefs are to restrain them if they rush to launch the ships nestor hints that there is not much good in attending to dreams however this is the dream of the overlord who is the favoured of zeus  agamemnon next addressing the assembly says that posterity will think it a shameful thing that the achaeans raised the siege of a town with a population much smaller than their own army but allies from many cities help the trojans and are too strong for him whether posterity understands that or not let us flee with our ships  on this the host break up in a splendid passage of poetry and rush to launch the ships the passion of nostalgie carrying away even the chiefs it appearsa thing most natural in the circumstances but athene finds odysseus in grief neither laid he any hand upon his ship as the others did and she encouraged him to stop the flight this he does taking the sceptre of agamemnon from his unnerved hand  he goes about reminding the princes have we not heard agamemnons real intention in council ii 188197 and rating the common sort the assembly meets again in great confusion thersites seizes the chance to be insolent and is beaten by odysseus the host then arms for battle  the poet has thus shown agamemnon in the colours which he wears consistently all through the iliad he has as usual contrasted with him odysseus the type of a wise and resolute man this contrast the poet maintains without fail throughout he has shown us the temper of the weary homesick army and he has persuaded us that he knows how subtle dangerous and contagious a thing is military panic thus at least i venture to read the passage which thus read is perfectly intelligible agamemnon is no personal coward but the burden of the safety of the host overcomes him later and he keeps suggesting flight in the ships as we shall see suppose then we read on from ii 40 thus the dream left him thinking of things not to be even that on this day he shall take the town of priam but he awoke from sleep with the divine voice ringing in his ears then it seemed him that some dreams are true and some false for all do not come through the gate of horn so he arose and sat up and did on his soft tunic and his great cloak and grasped his ancestral sceptre  and bade the clearvoiced heralds summon the achaeans of the long locks to the deliberative assembly he then as in ii 5375 told his dream to the preliminary council and proposed that he should try the temper of the host by proposing flightwhich if it began the chiefs were to restrainbefore giving orders to arm the test of the temper of the host acted as it might be expected to act all rushed to launch the ships and the princes were swept away in the tide of flight agamemnon himself merely looking on helpless the panic was contagious only odysseus escaped its influence and redeemed the honour of the achaeans as he did again on a later day  the passage certainly has its difficulties but erhardt expresses the proper state of the case after giving his analysis the hearers imagination is so captured first by the dream then by the brawling assembly by the rush to the ships by the intervention of odysseus by the punishment of thersitesall these living pictures follow each other so fleetly before the eyes that we have scarcely time to make objections footnote die enstehung der homerische gedichte p 29 the poet aimed at no more and no less effect than he has produced and no more should be required by any one except by that anachronismthe analytical reader he has time to make objections the poets audience had none and he must be criticised from their point of view homer did not sing for analytical readers for the modern professor he could not possibly conceive that time would bring such a being into existence  to return to the character of agamemnon in moments of encouragement agamemnon is a valiant fighter few better spearmen yet he attains not to the first three achilles aias diomede but agamemnon is unstable as water again and again as in book ii the lives and honour of the achaeans are saved in the over lords despite by one or other of the peers the whole iliad with consistent uniformity pursues the scheme of character and conduct laid down in the two first books it is guided at once by feudal allegiance and feudal jealousy like the chansons de geste and the early sagas or romances of ireland a measure of respect for agamemnon even of sympathy is preserved he is not degraded as the kings and princes are often degraded on the attic stage and even in the cyclic poems would wandering ionian reciters at fairs have maintained this uniformity would the tyrant pisistratus have made his literary man take this view     chapter v   agamemnon in the later iliad  in the third book agamemnon receives the compliments due to his supremacy aspect and valour from the lips of helen and priam there are other warriors taller by a head and odysseus was shorter than he by a head so agamemnon was a man of middle stature he is beautiful and royal of aspect a good king and a mighty spearman says helen  the interrupted duel between menelaus and paris follows and then the treacherous wounding of menelaus by pandarus one of agamemnons most sympathetic characteristics is his intense love of his brother for whose sake he has made the war he shudders on seeing the arrow wound but consoles menelaus by the certainty that troy will fall for the trojans have broken the solemn oath of truce zeus doth fulfil at last and men make dear amends but with characteristic inconsistency he discourages menelaus by a picture of many a proud trojan leaping on his tomb while the host will return homean idea constantly present to agamemnons mind he is always the first to propose flight though he will return with shame to mycenae menelaus is of much better cheer be of good courage blank space all the host of the misprinta thing which agamemnon does habitually though he is not a personal poltroon as menelaus has only a slight flesh wound after all and as the trojans are doomed men agamemnon is now eager for glorious battle he encourages the princes but of all men rebukes odysseus as last at a fray and first at a feast such is his insolence for which men detest him  this is highly characteristic in agamemnon who has just been redeemed from ruin by odysseus rebuked by odysseus he takes back his word as usual and goes on to chide diomede as better at making speeches than at fighting but diomede made no answer having respect to the chiding of the revered king he even rebukes the son of capaneus for answering agamemnon haughtily diomede however does not forget he bides his time he now does the great deeds of his day of valour book v agamemnon meanwhile encourages the host  during books v vi agamemnons business is to bid the rest keep fighting when hector in book vii challenges any achaean nobody volunteers except menelaus who has a strong sense of honour agamemnon restrains him and lots are cast the host pray that the lot may fall on aias diomede or agamemnon vii 179 180 thus the overlord is acknowledged to be a man of his hands especially good at hurling the spear as we see again in book xxiii  a truce is proposed for the burial of the dead and paris offers to give up the wealth that he brought to troy and more if the achaeans will go home but helen he will not give up we expect agamemnon to answer as becomes him but no all are silent till diomede rises they will not return he says even if helen be restored for even a fool knows that troy is doomed because of the broken oath the rest shout acquiescence and agamemnon refuses the compromise apparently he would not have disdained it but for diomedes reply  on the following day the trojans have the better in the battle and agamemnon has no heart to stand nor have some of his peers but diomede has more courage and finally agamemnon begins to call to the host to fight but breaks down weeps and prays to zeus that we ourselves at least flee and escape he is not an encouraging commanderinchief zeus in pity sends a favourable omen aias fights well night falls and the trojans camp on the open plain  agamemnon in floods of tears calls an assembly and proposes to return to argos with dishonour let us flee with our ships to our dear native land for now shall we never take widewayed troy all are silent till diomede rises and reminds agamemnon that thou saidst i was no man of war but a coward in book v we are now in book ix zeus gave thee the honour of the sceptre above all men but valour he gave thee not go thy way thy way is before thee and thy ships stand beside the sea but all the other flowinghaired achaeans will tarry here until we waste troy  nestor advises agamemnon to set an advanced guard which that martialist had never thought of doing and to discuss matters over supper a force of 700 men under meriones and the son of nestor was posted between the foss and the wall round the camp the council met and nestor advised agamemnon to approach achilles with gentle words and gifts of atonement agamemnon full of repentance acknowledges his folly and offers enormous atonement heralds and three ambassadors are sent and how achilles received them with perfect courtesy but with absolute distrust of agamemnon and refusal of his gifts sending the message that he will fight only when fire comes to his own ships we know  achilles is now entirely in the wrong and the overlord is once more within his right he has done all or more than all that customary law demands in book ix phoenix states the case plainly if agamemnon brought thee not gifts and promised thee more hereafter  then were i not he that should bid thee cast aside thine anger and save the argives ix 515517 the case so stands that if achilles later relents and fights the gifts of atonement will no longer be due to him and he will not be held in like honour ix 604  the poet knows intimately and like his audience is keenly interested in the details of the customary law we cannot easily suppose this frame of mind and this knowledge in a late poet addressing a late ionian audience  the ambassadors return to agamemnon their evil tidings are received in despairing silence but diomede bids agamemnon take heart and fight next day with his host arrayed before the ships ix 708 this appears to counsel defensive war but in fact and for reasons when it comes to fighting they do battle in the open  the next book x is almost universally thought a late interpolation an opinion elsewhere discussed see blank space let us then say with mr leaf that the book begins with exaggerated despondency and ends with hasty exultation in consequence of a brilliant camisade wherein odysseus and diomede massacre a thracian contingent our point is that the poet carefully see the doloneia continues the study of agamemnon in despondency and later by his hasty exultation preludes to the valour which the overlord displays in book xi  the poet knows that something in the way of personal valour is due to agamemnons position he fights brilliantly receives a flesh wound retires and is soon proposing a general flight in his accustomed way when the trojans in book xiv are attacking the ships agamemnon remarks that he fears the disaffection of his whole army xiv 49 51 and as for the coming defeat that he knew it even when zeus helped the greeks they are all to perish far from argos let them drag the ships to the sea moor them with stones and fly for there is no shame in fleeing from ruin even in the night better doth he fare who flees from trouble than he that is overtaken it is now the turn of odysseus again to save the honour of the army be silent lest some other of the achaeans hear this word that no man should so much as suffer to pass through his mouth and now i wholly scorn thy thoughts such a word hast thou uttered on this agamemnon instantly repents right sharply hast thou touched my heart with thy stern reproof he has not even the courage of his nervousness  the combat is now in the hands of aias and patroclus who is slain agamemnon who is wounded does not reappear till book xix when achilles anxious to fight and avenge patroclus at once without formalities of reconciliation professes his desire to let bygones be bygones agamemnon excuses his insolence to achilles as an inspiration of ate a predestined faultnot i am the cause but zeus and destiny  odysseus to clinch the reunion and fulfil customary law advises agamemnon to bring out the gifts of atonement the gifts prepared in book ix after which the right thing is for him to give a feast of reconciliation that achilles may have nothing lacking of his right footnote book xix 179 180 the case is one which has been provided for by customary law in every detail mr leaf argues that all this part must be late because of the allusion to the gifts offered in book ix but we reply with mr monro that the ninth book is almost necessary to any achilleis the question is would a late editor or poet know all the details of customary law in such a case as a quarrel between overlord and peer would a feudal audience have been satisfied with a poem which did not wind the quarrel up in accordance with usage and would a late poet in a society no longer feudal know how to wind it up would he find any demand on the part of his audience for a long series of statements which to a modern seem to interrupt the story to ourselves it appears that a feudal audience desired the customary details to such an audience they were most interesting  this is a taste which as has been said we find in all early poetry and in the sagas hence the long runs of the celtic sagas minutely repeated descriptions of customary things the icelandic sagamen never weary though modern readers do of legal details for these reasons we reckon the passages in book xix about the reconciliation as original and think they can be nothing else it is quite natural that in a feudal society of men who were sticklers for custom the hearers should insist on having all things done duly and in orderthe giving of the gifts and the feast of reconciliationthough the passionate achilles himself desires to fight at once odysseus insists that what we may call the regular routine shall be gone through it is tedious to the modern reader but it is surely much more probable that a feudal poet thus gratified his peculiar audience he looked for no other than that a late poet with a different kind of audience thrust the reconciliation in as an afterthought footnote leaf iliad vol ii p 317 the right thing must be done odysseus assures achilles for i was born first and know more things it is not the right thing to fight at once unfed and before the solemn sacrifice by the overlord the prayer the oath of agamemnon and the reception of the gifts by achilles only after these formalities and after the army has fed can the host go forth i know more than you do you are a younger man says odysseus speaking in accordance with feudal character at the risk of wearying later unforeseen generations  this is not criticism inspired by mere literary feeling for literary feeling is on the side of achilles and wishes the story to hurry to his revenge but ours is blank space criticism we must think of the poet in relation to his audience and of their demands which we can estimate by similar demands vouched for by the supply in the early national poetry of other peoples and in the icelandic sagas  we hear no more of agamemnon till in book xxiii 3538 after the slaying of hector achilles was brought to noble agamemnon for that as odysseus said was the regular procedure by the achaean chiefs hardly persuading him thereto for his heart was wroth for his comrade here they feast achilles still full of grief and resentment he merely goes through the set forms much against his will it does appear to us that the later the poet the less he would have known or cared about the forms an early society is always much interested in forms and in funerals and funeral games so the poet indulges their taste with the last rites of patroclus the last view of agamemnon is given when at the end of the games achilles courteously presents him with the flowered lebes the prize for hurling the spear without asking him to compete since his superior skill is notorious this act of courtesy is the real reconciliation previously achilles had but gone reluctantly through the set forms in such cases provided even when agamemnon offered the gifts of atonement achilles said give them as is customary or keep them as you please xix 146 148 achilles young and passionate cares nothing for the feudal procedure  this rapid survey seems to justify the conclusion that the poet presents an uniform and historically correct picture of the over lord and of his relations with his peers a picture which no late editor could have pieced together out of the widely varying repertoires of late strolling reciters such reciters would gladly have forgotten and such an editor would gladly have cut the business of the reconciliation they would also in a democratic spirit have degraded the overlord into the tyrant but throughout however low agamemnon may fall the poet is guided by the knowledge that his right to rule is jure divino that he has qualities that his responsibilities are crushing i whom among all men zeus hath planted for ever among labours while my breath abides within me and my limbs move says the overlord x sg gosic in short the poets conception of the overlord is throughout harmonious is a contemporary conception entertained by a singer who lives among peers that own and are jealous of and obey an overlord the character and situation of agamemnon are a poetic work of one age one moment of culture     chapter vi   archaeology of the iliad burial and cremation  in archaeological discoveries we find the most convincing proofs that the iliad on the whole is the production of a single age not the patchwork of several changeful centuries this may seem an audacious statement as archaeology has been interpreted of late in such a manner as to demand precisely the opposite verdict but if we can show as we think we can that many recent interpretations of the archaeological evidence are not valid because they are not consistent our contention though unexpected will be possible it is that the combined testimony of archaeology and of the epic proves the iliad to represent as regards customs weapons and armour a definite moment of evolution a period between the age recorded in the art of the mycenaean shaft graves and the age of early iron swords and the dipylon period  before the discoveries of the material remains of the mycenzean times the evidence of archaeology was seldom appropriately invoked in discussions of the homeric question but in the thirty years since schliemann explored the buried relics of the mycenzean acropolis his grave of agamemnon a series of excavations has laid bare the interments the works of art and the weapons and ornaments of years long prior to the revolution commonly associated with the dorian invasion of about 11001000 bc the objects of all sorts which have been found in many sites of greece and the isles especially of cyprus and crete in some respects tally closely with homeric descriptions in others vary from them widely nothing can be less surprising if the heroes whose legendary feats inspired the poet lived centuries before his time as charlemagne and his paladins lived some three centuries before the composition of the earliest extant chansons de geste on their adventures there was in such a case time for much change in the details of life art weapons and implements taking the relics in the graves of the mycenaean acropolis as a starting point some things would endure into the age of the poet some would be modified some would disappear  we cannot tell how long previous to his own date the poet supposes the achaean heroes to have existed he frequently ascribes to them feats of strength which no man of such as now are could perform this gives no definite period for the interval he might be speaking of the great grandfathers of his own generation but when he regards the heroes as closely connected by descent of one or two generations with the gods and as in frequent and familiar intercourse with gods and goddesses we must suppose that he did not think their period recent the singers of the chansons de geste knew that angels visits were few and far between at the period say of the norman conquest but they allowed angels to appear in epics dealing with the earlier time almost as freely as gods intervene in homer in short the homeric poet undeniably treats the age of his heroes as having already in the phrase of thucydides won its way to the mythical and therefore as indefinitely remote  it is impossible here to discuss in detail the complex problems of mycenaean chronology if we place the mycenaean bloomtime from the seventeenth or sixteenth to the twelfth century bc footnote tsountas and manatt p 322 it is plain that there is space to spare between the poets age and that of his heroes for the rise of changes in war weapons and costume indeed there are traces enough of change even in the objects and art discovered in the bloomtime as represented by the mycenaean acropolis itself and by other mycenaean sites the art of the fragment of a silver vase in a grave on which a siege is represented is not the art the costumes are not the costumes of the inlaid bronze daggerblade the men shown on the vase and the lionhunters on the dagger both have their hair close cropped but on the vase they are naked on the dagger they wear short drawers on the vaphio cups found in a tholos chambertomb near amyclae the men are longhaired achaeans with heavy pendent locks like the man on a pyxis from knossos published by mr evans they are of another period than the closecropped men of the vase and dagger footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xvi p 102 two of the men on the silver vase are covered either with shields of a shape and size elsewhere unknown in mycenaean art or with cloaks of an unexampled form the masonry of the city wall shown on the vase in the mycenaean grave is not the ordinary masonry of mycenae itself on the vase the wall is isodomic built of cut stones in regular layers most of the mycenaean walls on the other hand are of cyclopean style in large irregular blocks  art good and very bad exists in many various stages in mycenaean relics the drawing of a god with a typical mycenaean shield in the form of a figure 8 on a painted sarcophagus from milato in crete is more crude and savage than many productions of the australian aboriginals footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xvi p 174 fig 50 grosse les debuts de lart pp 124176 the thing is on the level of red indian work meanwhile at vaphio enkomi knossos and elsewhere the art is often excellent  in one essential point the poet describes a custom without parallel among the discovered relics of the mycenaean agenamely the disposal of the bodies of the dead they are neither buried with their arms in stately tholos tombs nor in shaft graves as at mycenae whether they be princes or simple oarsmen they are cremated a pyre of wood is built on this the warriors body is laid the pyre is lighted the body is reduced to ashes the ashes are placed in a vessel or box of gold wrapped round with precious cloths no arms are buried as a general rule and a mound howe barrow or tumulus is raised over all usually a stele or pillar crowns the edifice this method is almost uniform and as far as cremation and the cairn go is universal in the iliad and odyssey whenever a burial is described now this mode of interment must be the mode of a single age in greek civilisation it is confessedly not the method of the mycenaeans of the shaft grave or of the latter tholos or stone beehiveshaped grave again the mycenaeans did not burn the dead they buried once more the homeric method is not that of the dipylon period say 900750 bc represented by the tombs outside the dipylon gate of athens the people of that age now buried now burned their dead and did not build cairns over them thus the homeric custom comes between the shaft graves and the latter tholos graves on the one hand and the dipylon custom of burning or burying with sunk or rockhewn graves on the other  the homeric poets describe the method of their own period they assuredly do not adhere to an older epic tradition of shaft graves or tholos graves though these must have been described in lays of the period when such methods of disposal of the dead were in vogue the altar above the shaftgraves in mycenae proves the cult of ancestors in mycenae of this cult in the iliad there is no trace or only a dim trace of survival in the slaughter of animals at the funeral the homeric way of thinking about the state of the dead weak shadowy things beyond the river oceanus did not permit them to be worshipped as potent beings only in a passage possibly interpolated of the odyssey do we hear that castor and polydeuces brothers of helen and sons of tyndareus through the favour of zeus have immortality and receive divine honours footnote odyssey xi 298304  these facts are so familiar that we are apt to overlook the strangeness of them in the history of religious evolution the cult of ancestral spirits begins in the lowest barbarism just above the level of the australian tribes who among the dieri show some traces of the practice at least of ghost feeding footnote howitt native tribes of southeastern australia p 448 there are also traces of propitiation in western australia ms of mrs bates sometimes as in many african tribes ancestor worship is almost the whole of practical cult usually it accompanies polytheism existing beside it on a lower plane it was prevalent in the mycenae of the shaft graves in attica it was uninterrupted it is conspicuous in greece from the ninth century onwards but it is unknown to or ignored by the homeric poets though it can hardly have died out of folk custom consequently the poems are of one age an age of cremation and of burial in barrows with no ghost worship apparently some revolution as regards burial occurred between the age of the graves of the mycenaean acropolis and the age of homer that age coming with its form of burning and its absence of the cult of the dead between two epochs of inhumation ancestor worship and absence of cairns is as certainly and definitely an age apart a peculiar period as any epoch can be  cremation with cairn burial of the ashes is then the only form of burial mentioned by homer and as far as the poet tells us the period was not one in which iron was used for swords and spears at assarlik asia minor and in thera early graves prove the use of cremation but also unlike homer of iron weapons footnote paton journal of hellenic studies viii 64ff for other references cf poulsen die dipylongräben p 2 notes leipzig 1905 in these graves the ashes are inurned there are examples of the same usage in salamis without iron in crete in graves of the period of geometrical ornament dipylon burning is more common than inhumation cremation is attested in a tholos or beehive shaped grave in argos where the vases were late mycenaean below this stratum was an older shaft grave as is usual in tholos interments it had been plundered footnote poulsen p2  the cause of the marked change from mycenaean inhumation to homeric cremation is matter of conjecture it has been suggested that burning was introduced during the migrations after the dorian invasion men could carry the ashes of their friends to the place where they finally settled footnote helbig homerische epos p83 the question may perhaps be elucidated by excavation especially in asia minor on the sites of the earliest greek colonies at colophon are many cairns unexplored by science mr ridgeway as is well known attributes the introduction of cremation to a conquering northern people the achaeans his celts it is certain that cremation and urn burial of the ashes prevailed in britain during the age of bronze and coexisted with inhumation in the great cemetery of hallstatt surviving into the age of iron footnote cf guide to antiquities of early iron age british museum 1905 by mr reginald a smith under direction of mr charles h read for a brief account of hallstatt culture others suppose a change in achaean ideas about the soul it was no longer believed to haunt the grave and grave goods and be capable of haunting the living but to be wholly set free by burning and to depart for ever to the house of hades powerless and incapable of hauntings  it is never easy to decide as to whether a given mode of burial is the result of a definite opinion about the condition of the dead or whether the explanation offered by those who practise the method is an afterthought in tasmania among the lowest savages now extinct were found monuments over cremated human remains accompanied with characters crudely marked similar to those which the aborigines tattooed on their forearms in one such grave was a spear for the dead man to fight with when he is asleep as a native explained some tasmanian tribes burned the dead and carried the ashes about in amulets others buried in hollow trees others simply inhumed some placed the dead in a hollow tree and cremated the body after lapse of time some tied the dead up tightly a common practice with inhumation and then burned him some buried the dead in an erect posture the common explanation of burning was that it prevented the dead from returning thus it has always been usual to burn the bodies of vampires did a race so backward hit on an idea unknown to the mycenaean greeks footnote ling roth the tasmanians pp 128134 reports of early discoverers if the usual explanation be correctburning prevents the return of the dead how did the homeric greeks come to substitute burning for the worship and feeding of the dead which had certainly prevailed how did the ancient method return overlapping and blent with the method of cremation as in the early dipylon interments we can only say that the homeric custom is definite and isolated and that but slight variations occur in the methods of homeric burial  1in iliad vi 4 i 6 ff andromache says that achilles slew her father yet he despoiled him not for his soul had shame of that but he burnt him in his inlaid armour and raised a barrow over him we are not told that the armour was interred with the ashes of eetion this is a peculiar case we always hear in the that the dead are burned and the ashes of princes are placed in a vessel of gold within an artificial hillock but we do not hear except in this passage that they are burned in their armour or that it is burned or that it is buried with the ashes of the dead the invariable practice is for the victor if he can to despoil the body of the fallen foe but achilles for some reason spared that indignity in the case of eetion footnote german examples of burning the amis of the cremated dead and then burying them are given by mr ridgeway early age of greece vol i pp 498 499  2 iliad vii 85 hector in his challenge to a single combat makes the conditions that the victor shall keep the arms and armour of the vanquished but shall restore his body to his friends the trojans will burn him if he falls if the achaean falls the others will do something expressed by the word greek tarchuchosi probably a word surviving from an age of embalment footnote helbig homerische epos pp 55 56 it has come to mean generally to do the funeral rites the hero is to have a barrow or artificial howe or hillock built over him beside wide hellespont a memorial of him and of hectors valour  on the river helmsdale near kildonan on the left bank there is such a hillock which has never it is believed been excavated it preserves the memory of its occupant an early celtic saint whether he was cremated or not it is impossible to say but his memory is not lost and the howe cairn or hillock in homer is desired by the heroes as a memorial  on the terms proposed by hector the arms of the dead could not be either burned or buried with him  3 iliad ix 546 phoenix says that the calydonian boar brought many to the mournful pyre all were cremated  4 iliad xxii 5055 andromache in her dirge the regret of the french mediaeval epics says that hector lies unburied by the ships and naked but she will burn raiment of his delicate and fair the work of women  to thee no profit since thou wilt never lie therein yet this shall be honour to thee from the men and women of troy her meaning is not very clear but she seems to imply that if hectors body were in troy it would be clad in garments before cremation  helbig appears to think that to clothe the dead in garments was an ionian not an ancient epic custom but in homer the dead always wear at least one garment the greek pharos a large mantle either white or purple such as agamemnon wears in peace iliad ii 43 except when like eetion and elpenor in the odyssey they are burned in their armour in iliad xxiii 69 ff the shadow of the dead unburned patroclus appears to achilles in his sleep asking for his dues of fire the whole passage with the account of the funeral of patroclus must be read carefully and compared with the funeral rites of hector at the end of book xxiv helbig in an essay of great erudition though perhaps rather fantastic in its generalisations has contrasted the burials of the two heroes patroclus is buried he says in a true portion of the old aeolic epic sir richard jebb thought the whole passage ionic though even into this the late ionian bearbeiter a spectral figure has introduced his ionian notions but the twentyfourth book itself is late and ionian helbig says not genuine early aeolian epic poetry footnote helbig zu den homerischen bestattungsgebraüchen aus den sitzungsberichten der philos philol und histor classe der kgl bayer academie der wissenschaften 1900 heft ii pp 199299 the burial of patroclus then save for ionian late interpolations easily detected by helbig is he assures us genuine kernel footnote 2 op laud p 208 while hectors burial is partly ionian and describes the destiny of the dead heroes otherwise than as in the old aeolic epos  here helbig uses that one of his two alternate theories according to which the late ionian poets do not cling to old epic tradition but bring in details of the life of their own date by helbigs other alternate theory the late poets cling to the model set in old epic tradition in their pictures of details of life  disintegrationists differ far from thinking that the late ionian poet who buried hector varied from the aeolic minstrel who buried patroclus in book xxiii mr leaf says that hectors burial is almost an abstract of that of patroclus footnote leaf iliad xxii note to 791 he adds that helbigs attempts to distinguish the older aeolic from the newer and more sceptical ionic faith seem to me visionary footnote iliad vol ii p 619 note 2 visionary indeed they do seem but they are examples of the efforts made to prove that the iliad bears marks of composition continued through several centuries we must remember that according to helbig the ionians colonists in a new country had no use for ghosts a fresh colony does not produce ghosts there is hardly an english or scottish castle without its spook spuck on the other hand you look in vain for such a thing in the united statesspiritualism apart footnote op laud p 204  this is a hasty generalisation helbig will if he looks find ghosts enough in the literature of north america while still colonial and in australia a still more newly settled country sixty years ago fishers ghost gave evidence of fishers murder evidence which as in another australian case served the ends of justice footnote see in the valets tragedy a l fishers ghost more recent australian ghosts are familiar to psychical research  this colonial theory is one of helbigs too venturous generalisations he studies the ghost or rather dreamapparition of patroclus after examining the funeral of hector but we shall begin with patroclus achilles xxiii 416 first hails his friend even in the house of hades so he believes that spirits are in hades and says that he has brought hector raw for dogs to devour and twelve trojans of good family to slaughter before thy pyre that night when achilles is asleep xxiii 65 the spirit greek psyche of patroclus appears to him says that he is forgotten and begs to be burned at once that he may pass the gates of hades for the other spirits drive him off and will not let him associate with them beyond the river and he wanders vaguely along the widegated dwelling of hades give me thy hand for never more again shall i come back from hades when ye have given me my due of fire patroclus being newly discarnate does not yet know that a spirit cannot take a living mans hand though in fact tactile hallucinations are not uncommon in the presence of phantasms of the dead lay not my bones apart from thine  let one coffer greek soros hide our bones   greek soros like larnax is a coffin sarg or what the americans call a casket in the opinion of helbig footnote op laud p217 it is an oblong receptacle of the bones and dust hector was buried in a larnax so will achilles and patroclus be when achilles falls but the dust of patroclus is kept meanwhile in a golden covered cup phialae in the quarters of achilles it is not laid in howe after his cremation xxiii 243  achilles tries to embrace patroclus but fails like odysseus with the shade of his mother in hades in the odyssey he exclaims that there remaineth then even in the house of hades a spirit and phantom of the dead albeit the life or the wits be not anywise therein for all night hath the spirit of hapless patroclus stood over me  in this speech helbig detects the hand of the late ionian poet what goes before is part of the genuine old epic the kernel done at a time when men believed that spooks could take part in the affairs of the upper world achilles therefore in his dream thought that he could embrace his friend it was the sceptical ionian in a fresh and spookless colony who knew that he could not he thinks the ghost a mere dream and introduces his scepticism in xxiii 99107 he brought in the ruling ideas of his own period the ghost says the ionian bearbeiter is intangible though in the genuine old epic the ghost himself thought otherwisehe being new to the situation and without experience this is the first sample of the critical ionian spirit later so remarkable in philosophy and natural science says helbig footnote op laud pp 233234  we need not discuss this acute critical theory the natural interpretation of the words of achilles is obvious as mr leaf remarks the words are the cry of sudden personal conviction in a matter which has hitherto been lazily accepted as an orthodox dogma footnote iliad vol ii p 620 already as we have seen achilles has made promises to patroclus in the house of hades now he exclaims there really is something in the doctrine of a feeble future life  it is vain to try to discriminate between an old epic belief in ablebodied ghosts and an ionian belief in mere futile shades in the homeric poems everywhere the dead are too feeble to be worth worshipping after they are burned but as mr leaf says with obvious truth and with modern instances men are never so inconsistent as in their beliefs about the other world we ourselves hold various beliefs simultaneously the natives of australia and of tasmania practise or did practise every conceivable way of disposing of the deadburying burning exposure in trees carrying about the bodies or parts of them eating the bodies and so forth if each such practice corresponded as archaeologists believe to a different opinion about the soul then all beliefs were held together at once and this in fact is the case there is not now one and now another hard and fast orthodoxy of belief about the dead though now we find ancestor worship prominent and now in the shade  after gifts of hair and the setting up of jars full of oil and honey achilles has the body laid on the top of the pyre in the centre bodies of sheep and oxen two dogs and four horses are strewed around why we know not for the dead is not supposed to need food the rite may be a survival for there were sacrifices at the burials of the mycenaean shaft graves achilles slays also the twelve trojans because of mine anger at thy slaying he says xxiii 23 this was his reason as far as he consciously had any reason not that his friend might have twelve thralls in hades after the pyre is alit achilles drenches it all night with wine and when the flame dies down the dead heros bones are collected and placed in the covered cup of gold the circle of the barrow is then marked out stones are set up round it we see them round highland tumuli and earth is heaped up no more is done the tomb is empty the covered cup holding the ashes is in the hut of achilles  we must note another trait after the body of patroclus was recovered it was washed anointed laid on a bier and covered from head to foot greek heano liti translated by helbig with a linen sheet cf xxiii 254 the golden cup with the ashes is next wrapped greek heano liti here mr myers renders the words with a linen veil scottish cremation burials of the bronze age retain traces of linen wrappings of the urn footnote proceedings of the scottish society of antiquaries 1905 p 552 for other cases cf leaf iliad xxiv 796 note over all a white greek pharos mantle was spread in iliad xxiv 231 twelve greek pharea with chitons single cloaks and other articles of dress are taken to achilles by priam as part of the ransom of hectors body such is the deathgarb of patroclus but helbig looking for ionian innovations in book xxiv finds that the deathgarb of hector is not the same as that of patroclus in book xxiii one difference is that when the squires of achilles took the ransom of hector from the waggon of priam they left in it two greek pharea and a wellspun chiton the women washed and anointed hectors body they clad him in the chiton and threw one greek pharos over it we are not told what they did with the other perhaps as mr leaf says it was used as a cover for the bier perhaps it was not but was laid under the body helbig all we know is that hectors body was restored to priam in a chiton and a greek pharos which do not seem to have been removed before he was burned while patroclus had no chiton in death but a greek pharos and apparently a linen sheet  to the ordinary reader this does not seem in the circumstances a strong mark of different ages and different burial customs priam did not bring any linen sheetor whatever greek heanos lis may bein the waggon as part of hectors ransom and it neither became achilles to give nor priam to receive any of achilless stuff as deathgarb for hector the squires therefore gave back to priam to clothe his dead son part of what he had brought nothing can be more natural and there we may say is an end ont they did what they could in the circumstances but helbig has observed that in a cean inscription of the fifth century bc there is a sumptuary law forbidding a corpse to wear more than three white garments a sheet under him a chiton and a mantle cast over him footnote op laud p 209 he supposes that hector wore the chiton and had one greek pharos over him and the other under him though homer does not say that the laws of solon also confined the dead man to three articles of dress footnote plutarch solon 21 in doing so solon sanctioned an old custom and that ionian custom described by the author of book xxiv bewrays him says helbig for a late ionian bearbeiter deserting true epic usages and inserting those of his own day but in some attic dipylon vases in the pictures of funerals we see no garments or sheets over the corpses  penelope also wove a greek charos against the burial of old laertes but surely she ought to have woven for him on helbigs showing hector had two patroclus had only one patroclus is in the old epic hector and laertes are in the ionian epics therefore laertes should have had two greek charea but we only hear of one penelope had to finish the greek charos and show it footnote odyssey xxiv 147 now if she wanted to delay her marriage she should have begun the second greek charos just as necessary as the first if hector with a pair of greek charea represents ionian usage but penelope never thought of what had she read helbig she would have seen to be so obvious she thought of no funeral garments for the old man but one shroud greek speiron odyssey ii 102 xix 147 yet being by the theory a character of late ionian not of genuine old aeolic epic she should have known better it is manifest that if even the acuteness and vast erudition of helbig can only find such invisible differences as these between the manners of the genuine old epic and the late ionian innovations there is really no difference beyond such trifles as diversify custom in any age  hector when burned and when his ashes have been placed in the casket is laid in a greek kapetos a ditch or trench iliad xv 356 xviii 564 but here xxiv 797 greek kapetos is a chamber covered with great stones within the howe the casket being swathed with purple robes and this was the end the ghost of hector would not revisit the sun as ghosts do freely in the cyclic poems a proof that the cyclics are later than the homeric poems footnote helbig op laud pp 240 241  if the burning of the weapons of eetion and elpenor are traces of another than the old aeolic epic faith footnote ibid p 253 they are also traces of another than the late ionic epic faith for no weapons are burned with hector in the odyssey the weapons of achilles are not burned in the iliad the armour of patroclus is not burned no victims of any kind are burned with hector possibly the poet was not anxious to repeat what he had just described his last book is already a very long book possibly the trojans did not slay victims at the burning  the howes or barrows built over the homeric dead were hillocks high enough to be good points of outlook for scouts as in the case of the barrow of aesyetes iliad ii 793 and the steep mound the howe of lithe myrine ii 814 we do not know that women were usually buried in howe but myrine was a warrior maiden of the amazons we know then minutely what the homeric mode of burial was with such variations as have been noted we have burning and howe even in the case of an obscure oarsman like elpenor it is not probable however that every peaceful mechanic had a howe all to himself he may have had a small family cairn he may not have had an expensive cremation  the interesting fact is that no barrow burial precisely of the homeric kind has ever been discovered in greek sites the old mycenaeans buried either in shaft graves or in a stately tholos and in rock chambers later in the town cemetery they did not burn the bodies the people of the dipylon period sometimes cremated sometimes inhumed but they built no barrow over the dead footnote annal de linst 1872 pp 135 147 167 plausen ut supra the dipylon was a period of early iron swords made on the lines of not the best type of bronze sword now in mr leafs opinion our homeric accounts of burial are all late the oldest parts of the poems tell us nothing footnote iliad vol ii p 619 note 2 while mr leaf says that the oldest parts of the poems tell us nothing of burial he accepts xxii 342 343 as of the oldest part these lines describe cremation and mr leaf does not think them borrowed from the later vii 79 80 but that vii 79 80 are perhaps borrowed from xxii 342 343 it follows that the oldest parts of the poems do tell us of cremation we shall show however that mr leafs kernel alludes to cremation what is late in this case it is not the dipylon period say 900750 bc it is not any later period one or two late barrow burials do not answer to the homeric descriptions the late parts of the poems therefore dealing with burials in books vi vii xix xxiii xxiv and the odyssey are of an age not in the mycenaean prime not in the dipylon period not in any later period say the seventh or sixth centuries bc and necessarily not of any subsequent period yet nobody dreams of saying that the poets describe a purely fanciful form of interment they speak of what they know in daily life if it be argued that the late poets preserve by sheer force of epic tradition a form of burial unknown in their own age we ask why did epic tradition not preserve the burial methods of the mycenaean prime the shaft grave or the tholos without cremation  mr leafs own conclusion is that the people of mycenae were spirit worshippers practising inhumation and partial mummification the second fact is dubious in the postmycenaean dipylon period we find cremation and sepulture practised side by side in the interval therefore two beliefs have come into conflict footnote all conceivable beliefs we have said about the dead are apt to coexist for every conceivable and some rather inconceivable contemporary australian modes of dealing with the dead see howitt native tribes of southeast australia spencer and gillen northern tribes of central australia it seems that the homeric poems mark this intermediate point footnote leaf iliad vol ii p 622 in that case the homeric poems are of one age or at least all of them save the original kernel are of one age namely a period subsequent to the mycenaean prime but considerably prior to the dipylon period which exhibits a mixture of custom cremation and inhumation coexisting without barrows or howes  we welcome this conclusion and note that whatever may be the case with the oldest parts of the poems which say nothing about funerals the latest expansions must be of about 11001000 bc  the poem is so early that it is prior to hero worship and ancestor worship or it might be more judicious to say that the poem is of an age that did not officially practise ancestor worship whatever may have occurred in folkcustom the homeric age is one which had outgrown ancestor and hero worship and had not like the age of the cyclics relapsed into it enfin unless we agree with helbig as to essential variations of custom the poems are the work of one age and that a brief age and an age of peculiar customs cremation and barrow burial and of a religion that stood without spirit worship between the mycenzean period and the ninth century that seems as certain as anything in prehistoric times can be unless we are to say that after the age of shaft graves and spirit worship came an age of cremation and of no spirit worship and that late poets consciously and conscientiously preserved the tradition of this period into their own ages of hero worship and inhumation though they did not preserve the tradition of the shaftgrave period we cannot accept this theory of adherence to stereotyped poetical descriptions nor can any one consistently adopt it in this case  the reason is obvious mr leaf with many other critics distinguishes several successive periods of expansion in the first stratum we have the remains of the original kernel among these remains is the slaying of hector xxii 1404 with but slight additions footnote leaf iliad vol ii p xi in the slaying of hector that hero indicates cremation as the mode of burial give them my body back again that the trojans and trojans wives grant me my due of fire after my death perhaps this allusion to cremation in the original kernel in the slaying of hector may be dismissed as a late borrowing from book vii 79 80 where hector makes conditions that the fallen hero shall be restored to his friends when he challenges the achaeans to a duel but whoever knows the curious economy by way of repetition that marks early national epics has a right to regard the allusion to cremation xxii 342343 as an example of this practice compare la chancun de williame lines 10411058 with lines 11401134 in both the dinner of a knight who has been long deprived of food is described in passages containing many identical lines the poet having found his formula uses it whenever occasion serves there are several other examples in the same epic footnote romania xxxiv pp 245 246 repetitions in homer need not indicate late additions the artifice is part of the epic as it is of the ballad manner if we are right cremation is the mode of burial even in the original kernel hector moreover in the kernel xxii 256259 makes before his final fight with achilles the same proposal as he makes in his challenge to a duel vii 85 et seqq the victor shall give back the body of the vanquished to his friends but how the friends are to bury it hector does not sayin this place when dying he does say xxii 342 343  in the kernel and all periods of expansion funeral rites are described and in all the method is cremation with a howe or a barrow thus the method of cremation had come in as early as the kernel the slaying of hector and as early as the first expansions and it lasted till the period of the latest expansions such as books xxiii xxiv  but what is the approximate date of the various expansions of the original poem on that point mr leaf gives his opinion the making of the arms of achilles books xviii xix 139 is with the funeral of patroclus xxiii 1256 in the second set of expansions and is thus two removes later than the original kernel footnote leaf iliad vol ii p xii now this is the periodthe making of the shield for achilles is at least in touch with the periodof the eminently free and naturalistic treatment which we find in the best mycenaean work in the dagger blades in the siege fragment and notably in the vaphio cups which show longhaired men not men closecropped as in the daggers and siege fragment footnote leaf iliad vol ii p 606 the poet of the age of the second expansions then is at least in touch with the work of the shaft grave and ages he need not be contemporary with that epoch but may well have had in his mind the work of artists older than himself it is vaguely possible that he may have seen an ancient shield of the mycenaean prime and may be inspired by that footnote ibid vol ii pp 606 607  moreover and still more remarkable the ordinary homeric form of cremation and howeburial is even older than the period which if not contemporary with is clearly reminiscent of the art of the shaft graves for in the period of the first expansions vii 13 i 2 the form of burial is cremation with a barrow or tumulus footnote ibid vol ii p xi and pp 606 607 thus mr leafs opinion might lead us to the conclusion that the usual homeric form of burial occurs in a period prior to an age in which the poet is apparently reminiscent of the work of two early epochsthe epoch of shaft graves and that of tholos graves if this be so cremation and urn burial in cairns may be nearly as old as the mycenaean shaft graves or as old as the tholos graves and they endure into the age of the latest expansions  we must not press however opinions founded on the apparent technical resemblance of the free style and coloured metal work on the shield of achilles to the coloured metal work and free design on the daggers of the mycenaean shaft graves it is enough for us to note that the passages concerning burial from the kernel itself and also from the earliest to the latest expansions are all perfectly harmonious and of a single ageunless we are convinced by helbigs objections that age must have been brief indeed for before it arrives the period of tholos graves as at vaphio must expire on one hand while the blending of cremation with inhumation in the dipylon age must have been evolved after the cremation age passed on the other that brief intervening age however was the age of the iliad and odyssey this conclusion can only be avoided by alleging that late poets however recent and revolutionary carefully copied the oldest epic model of burial while they innovated in almost every other point so we are told we can go no further till we find an unrifled cairn burial answering to homeric descriptions we have indeed in thessaly a large tumulus which contained a silver urn with burned remains but the accompanying pottery dated it in the second century bc footnote ridgeway early age of greece vol i p 491 journal of hellenic studies vol xx pp 2025 it is possible enough that all tumuli of the homeric period have been robbed by grave plunderers in the course of the ages as the vikings are said to have robbed the cairns of sutherlandshire in which they were not likely to find a rich reward for their labours a conspicuous howe invites robberythe heroes of the saga like grettir occasionally rob a howeand the fact is unlucky for the homeric archaeologist  we have now tried to show that as regards 1 to the absence from homer of new religious and ritual ideas or of very old ideas revived in ionia 2 as concerns the clear conception of a loose form of feudalism with an overlord and 3 in the matter of burial the iliad and odyssey are selfconsistent and bear the impress of a single and peculiar moment of culture  the fact if accepted is incompatible with the theory that the poets both introduced the peculiar conditions of their own later ages and also on other occasions consciously and consistently archaised not only is such archaising inconsistent with the art of an uncritical age but a careful archaiser with all the resources of alexandrian criticism at his command could not archaise successfully we refer to quintus smyrnaeus author of the post homerica in fourteen books quintus does his best but we never observe in him that naïf delight in describing weapons and works of art and details of law and custom which are so conspicuous in homer and in other early poets he does give us penthesileas great sword with a hilt of ivory and silver but of what metal was the blade we are not told and the reader of quintus will observe that though he knows greek chalkos bronze as a synonym for weapons he scarcely ever if ever says that a sword or spear or arrowhead was of bronzea point on which homer constantly insists when he names the military metal quintus usually speaks of iron he has no interest in the constitutional and legal sides of heroic life so attractive to homer  yet quintus consciously archaises in a critical age with homer as his model any one who believes that in an uncritical age rhapsodists archaised with such success as the presumed late poets of the iliad must have done may try his hand in our critical age at a ballad in the style of the border ballads if he succeeds in producing nothing that will at once mark his work as modern he will be more successful than any poet who has made the experiment and more successful than the most ingenious modern forgers of gems jewels and terracottas they seldom deceive experts and when they do other experts detect the deceit     chapter vii   homeric armour  tested by their ideas their picture of political society and their descriptions of burial rites the presumed authors of the alleged expansions of the iliad all lived in one and the same period of culture but according to the prevalent critical theory we read in the iliad not only large expansions of many dates but also briefer interpolations inserted by the strolling reciters or rhapsodists until the final literary redaction had come says mr leafthat is about 540 bcwe cannot feel sure that any details even of the oldest work were secure from the touch of the latest poet footnote leaf iliad vol ii p ix  here we are far from mr leafs own opinion that the whole scenery of the poems the details of armour palaces dress decoration  had become stereotyped and formed a foundation which the epic poet dared not intentionally sap footnote ibid vol i p xv we now find footnote ibid vol ii p ix that the latest poet saps as much as he pleases down to the middle of the sixth century bc moreover in the middle of the sixth century bc the supposed editor employed by hsistratus made constant additions of transitional passages and added many speeches by nestor an ancestor of pisistratus  did these very late interlopers down to the sixth century introduce modern details into the picture of life did they blur the unus color we hope to prove that if they did so at all it was but slightly that the poems however with a mycenaean or submycenaean basis of actual custom and usage contain numerous contaminations from the usage of centuries as late as the seventh is the view of mr leaf and reichel and his followers footnote homerische waffen von wolfgang reichel wien 1901  reichels hypothesis is that the heroes of the original poet had no defensive armour except the great mycenaean shields that the ponderous shield made the use of chariots imperatively necessary that after the mycenaean age a small buckler and a corslet superseded the unwieldy shield that chariots were no longer used that by the seventh century bc a warrior could not be thought of without a breastplate and that new poets thrust corslets and greaves into songs both new and old  how the new poets could conceive of warriors as always in chariots whereas in practice they knew no war chariots and yet could not conceive of them without corslets which the original poet never saw is reichels secret the new poets had in the old lays a plain example to follow they did follow it as to chariots and shields as to corslets and greaves they reversed it such is the reichelian theory   the shield  as regards armour controversy is waged over the shield corslet and bronze greaves in homer the shield is of leather plated with bronze and of bronze is the corslet no shields of bronze plating and no bronze corslets have been found in mycenaean excavations  we have to ask do the homeric descriptions of shields tally with the representations of shields in works of art discovered in the graves of mycenae spata in attica vaphio in sparta and elsewhere if the descriptions in homer vary from these relics to what extent do they vary and do the differences arise from the fact that the poet describes consistently what he sees in his own age or are the variations caused by late rhapsodists in the iron age who keep the great obsolete shields and bronze weapons yet introduce the other military gear of their day say 800600 bc gear unknown to the early singers  it may be best to inquire first what does the poet or what do the poets say about shields and next to examine the evidence of representations of shields in mycenaean art always remembering that the poet does not pretend to live and beyond all doubt does not live in the mycenaean prime and that the testimony of the tombs is liable to be altered by fresh discoveries  in iliad ii 388 the shield aspis is spoken of as covering a man about greek amphibrotae while in the heat of battle the baldric telamon or belt of the shield shall be wet with sweat the shield then is not an ionian buckler worn on the left arm but is suspended by a belt and covers a man or most of him just as mycenaean shields are suspended by belts shown in works of art and cover the body and legs this ii 388 is a general description applying to the shields of all men who fight from chariots their great shield answers to the great mediaeval shield of the knights of the twelfth century the double targe worn suspended from the neck by a belt such a shield covers a mounted knights body from mouth to stirrup in an ivory chessman of the eleventh to twelfth century ad footnote catalogue of scottish national antiquities p 375 so also in the bayeux tapestry footnote gautier chanson de roland seventh edition pp 393 394 and on seals dismounted men have the same shield p 132  the shield of menelaus iii 348 is equal in all directions which we might conceive to mean mathematically circular as the words do mean that a shield is said to have circles and a spear which grazes a shielda shield which was greek panton eesae every way equalrends both circles the outer circle of bronze and the inner circle of leather iliad xx 273281 but the passage is not unjustly believed to be late and we cannot rely on it as proof that homer knew circular shields among others the epithet greek eukuklykos of good circle is commonly given to the shields but does not mean that the shield was circular we are told but merely that it was made of circular plates footnote leaf iliad vol i p 573 as for the shield of menelaus and other shields described in the same words every way equal the epithet is not now allowed to mean circular mr leaf annotating iliad i 306 says that this sense is intolerably mathematical and prosaic and translates greek panton eesae as well balanced on every side helbig renders the epithets in the natural sense as circular footnote helbig homerische epos p 315 cf on the other hand p 317 note i  to the rendering circular it is objected that a circular shield of say four feet and a half in diameter would be intolerably heavy and superfluously wide while the shields represented in mycenaean art are not circles but rather resemble a figure of eight in some cases or a section of a cylinder in others or again a door fig 5 p 130  what homer really meant by such epithets as equal every way very circular of a good circle cannot be ascertained since homeric epithets of the shield which were previously rendered circular of good circle and so on are now translated in quite other senses in order that homeric descriptions may be made to tally with mycenaean representations of shields which are never circular as represented in works of art in this position of affairs we are unable to determine the shape or shapes of the shields known to homer  a scholars rendering of homers epithets applied to the shield is obliged to vary with the variations of his theory about the shield thus in 1883 mr leaf wrote the poet often calls the shield by names which seem to imply that it was round and yet indicates that it was large enough to cover the whole body of a man in descriptions the round shape is always implied the words which indicated that the shield or one shield really looked like a tower and really reached from neck to ankles in two or three cases were received by the poet from the earlier achaean lays but to homer the warriors appeared as using the later small round shield his belief in the heroic strength of the men of old time made it quite natural to speak of them as bearing a shield which at once combined the later circular shape and the old heroic expanse footnote journal of hellenic studies iv pp 283285  here the homeric words which naturally mean circular or round are accepted as meaning round or circular homer it is supposed in practice only knows the round shields of the later age 700 bc so he calls shields round but obedient to tradition he conceives of them as very large  but after the appearance of reichels speculations the homeric words for round and circular have been explained as meaning something else and mr leaf in place of maintaining that homer knew no shields but round shields now writes 1900 the small circular shield of later timesis equally unknown to homer with a very few curious exceptions which reichel discovered erroneously as we shall later try to show footnote leaf iliad vol i p 575  thus does science fluctuate now homer knows in practice none but light round bucklers dating from about 700 bc again he does not know them at all though they were habitually used in the period at which the later parts of his epic were composed we shall have to ask how did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them constantly  some scholars then believe that the old original poet always described mycenaean shields which are of various shapes but never circular in mycenaean art if there are any circular shields in the poems these they say must have been introduced by poets accustomed in a much later age to seeing circular bucklers therefore homeric words hitherto understood as meaning circular must now mean something elseeven if the reasoning seems circular  other scholars believe that the poet in real life saw various types of shields in use and that some of them were survivals of the mycenaean shields semicylindrical or shaped like figures of 8 or like a door others were circular and these scholars presume that homer meant circular when he said circular neither school will convert the other and we cannot decide between them we do not pretend to be certain as to whether the original poet saw shields of various types including the round shape in use though that is possible or whether he saw only the mycenaean types  as regards size homer certainly describes in several cases shields very much larger than most which we know for certain to have been common after say 700 bc he speaks of shields reaching from neck to ankles and covering the body of a man about whether he was also familiar with smaller shields of various types is uncertain he does not explicitly say that any small bucklers were used by the chiefs nor does he explicitly say that all shields were of the largest type it is possible that at the time when the epic was composed various types of shield were being tried while the vast ancient shield was far from obsolete  to return to the size of the shield in a feigned tale of odysseus odyssey xiv 474477 men in a wintry ambush place their shields over their shoulders as they lie on the ground to be a protection against snow but any sort of shield large or small would protect the shoulders of men in a recumbent position quite a large shield may seem to be indicated in iliad xiii 400405 where idomeneus curls up his whole person behind his shield he was hidden by it yet as any one can see by experiment a man who crouched low would be protected entirely by a highland targe of less than thirty inches in diameter so nothing about the size of the shield is ascertained in this passage on a blackfigured vase in the british museum b 325 the entire body of a crouching warrior is defended by a large boeotian buckler oval and with échancrures in the sides the same remark applies to zadsic xxii 273275 hector watches the spear of achilles as it flies he crouches and the spear flies over him robert takes this as an old mycenaean dodgeto duck down to the bottom of the shield footnote studien zur ilias p 21 the avoidance by ducking can be managed with no shield or with a common highland targe which would cover a man in a crouching posture as when glenbuckets targe was peppered by bullets at clifton 746 and cluny shouted what the devil is this the assailants firing unexpectedly from a ditch a few moments of experiment we repeat prove that a round targe can protect a man in hectors attitude and that the homeric texts here throw no light on the size of the shield  the shield of hector was of black bullshide and as large and long as any represented in mycenaean art so that as he walked the rim knocked against his neck and ankles the shape is not mentioned despite its size he walked under it from the plain and field of battle into troy iliad vi 116118 this must be remembered as reichel footnote reichel 38 39 father browne handbook p 230 writes in odyssey xiv 475 odysseus says he slept within the shield he says under arms odyssey xiv 474 but cf xiv 479 maintains that a man could not walk under shield or only for a short way wherefore the war chariot was invented he says to carry the fighting man from point to point leaf iliad vol i p 573 mr leaf elaborates these points why did not the homeric heroes ride because no man could carry such a shield on horseback footnote iliad vol i p 573 we reply that men could and did carry such shields on horseback as we know on the evidence of works of art and poetry of the eleventh to twelfth centuries ad mr ridgeway has explained the introduction of chariots as the result of horses too small to carry a heavy and heavilyarmed man as a cavalier  the shield greek aspis we are told by followers of reichel was only worn by princes who could afford to keep chariots charioteers and squires of the body to arm and disarm them but this can scarcely be true for all the comrades of diomede had the shield greek aspis iliad x 152 and the whole host of pandarus of troy a noted bowman were shieldbearers greek aspistaon laon iliad iv 90 and some of them held their shields greek sakae in front of pandarus when he took a treacherous shot at menelaus iv 113 the whole host could not have chariots and squires we may presume so the chariot was not indispensable to the écuyer or shieldbearing man  the objections to this conjecture of reichel are conspicuous as we now prove  no mycenaean work of art shows us a shielded man in a chariot the men with the monstrous shields are always depicted on foot the only modern peoples who to our knowledge used a leather shield of the mycenaean size and even of a mycenaean shape had no horses and chariots as we shall show the ancient eastern peoples such as the khita and egyptians who fought from chariots carried small shields of various forms as in the wellknown picture of a battle between the khita armed with spears and the bowmen of rameses ii who kill horse and man with arrows from their chariots and carry no spears while the khita who have no bows merely spears are shot down as they advance footnote maspero hist ancienne ii p 225 egyptians and khita who fight from chariots use small bucklers whence it follows that war chariots were not invented or at least were not retained in use for the purpose of giving mobility to men wearing gigantic shields under which they could not hurry from point to point war chariots did not cease to be used in egypt when men used small shields  moreover homeric warriors can make marches under shield while there is no mention of chariots to carry them to the point where they are to lie in ambush odyssey xiv 470510 if the shield was so heavy as to render a chariot necessary would homer make hector trudge a considerable distance under shield while achilles under shield sprints thrice round the whole circumference of troy helbig notices several other cases of long runs under shield either reichel is wrong when he said that the huge shield made the use of the war chariot necessary or the poet is late he is a man who never saw a large shield like hectors and though he speaks of such shields he thinks that men could walk and run under them when men did walk or run under shield or ride if they ever rode they would hang it over the left side like the lionhunters on the famous inlaid dagger of mycenae footnote for the chariots cf reichel homerische waffen 120ff wien 1901 or the warrior on the chessman referred to above p 111  aias again the big brave stupid porthos of the iliad has the largest shield of all like a tower this shield cannot have been circular and is recognised by his shield but he never enters a chariot and like odysseus has none of his own because both men come from rugged islands unfit for chariot driving odysseus has plenty of shields in his house in ithaca as we learn from the account of the battle with the wooers in the odyssey yet in ithaca as at troy he kept no chariot here then we have nations who fight from chariots yet use small shields and heroes who wear enormous shields yet never own a chariot clearly the great shield cannot have been the cause of the use of the war chariot as in the theory of reichel  aias and his shield we meet in iliad vii 206220 he clothed himself upon his flesh in all his armour greek teuchea to quote mr leafs translation but the poet only describes his shield his towerlike shield of bronze with sevenfold oxhide that tychius wrought him cunningly tychius the best of curriers that had his home in hyle who made for him his glancing shield of sevenfold hides of stalwart bulls and overlaid the seven with bronze  the shield known to homer then is in this case so tall as to resemble a tower and has bronze plating over bulls hide by tradition from an age of leather shields the currier is still the shieldmaker though now the shield has metal plating it is fairly clear that greek tradition regarded the shield of aias as of the kind which covered the body from chin to ankles and resembled a bellying sail or an umbrella unfurled and drawn in at the sides in the middle so as to offer the semblance of two bellies or of one pinched in at or near the centre this is probable because the coins of salamis where aias was worshipped as a local hero of great influence display this shield as the badge of the aeginetan dynasty claiming descent from aias the shield is bossed or bellied out with two halfmoons cut in the centre representing the waist or pinchedin part of the ancient mycenaean shield the same device occurs on a mycenaean ring from aegina in the british museum footnote evans journal of hellenic studies xiii 213216  in a duel with aias the spear of hector pierced the bronze and six layers of hide on his shield but stuck in the seventh the spear of aias went through the circular or every way balanced huge shield of hector and through his corslet and chiton but hector had doubled himself up laterally greek eklinthae vii 254 and was not wounded the next stroke of aias pierced his shield and wounded his neck hector replied with a boulder that lighted on the centre of the shield of aias on the boss whether that means a mere ornament or knob or whether it was the genuine bosswhich is disputed aias broke in the shield of hector with another stone and the gentle and joyous passage of arms was stopped  the shield of agamemnon was of the kind that cover all the body of a man and was every way equal or circular it was plated with twelve circles of bronze and had twenty greek omphaloi or ornamental knobs of tin and the centre was of black cyanus xi 3134 there was also a head of the gorgon with fear and panic the description is not intelligible and i do not discuss it  a man could be stabbed in the middle of the belly under his shield xi 424425 not an easy thing to do if shields covered the whole body to the feet but when a hero was leaping from his chariot as in this case no doubt a spear could be pushed up under the shield the ancient irish romances tell of a gae bulg a spear held in the warriors toes and jerked up under the shield of his enemy shields could be held up on high in an attack on a wall garrisoned by archers xii 139 the great norman shield also could be thus lifted  the locrians light armed infantry had no shields nor bronze helmets nor spears but slings and bows xiii 714 mr leaf suspects that this is a piece of false archaism but we do not think that early poets in an uncritical age are ever archaeologists good or bad the poet is aware that some men have larger some smaller shields just as some have longer and some shorter spears xiv 370377 but this does not prove that the shields were of different types a tall man might inherit the shield of a short father or versa  a man in turning to fly might trip on the rim of his shield which proves how large it was it reached to his feet this accident of tripping occurred to periphetes of mycenae but it might have happened to hector whose shield reached from neck to ankles footnote iliad xv 645646  achilles must have been a large man for he knew nobody whose armour would fit him when he lost his own though his armour fitted patroclus he could however make shift with the tower like shield of aias he said  illustration 1 the vase of aristonothos  the evidence of the iliad then is mainly to the effect that the heroes carried huge shields suspended by belts covering the body and legs if homer means by the epithets already cited of good circle and every way equal that some shields of these vast dimensions were circular we have one example in early greek art which corroborates his description this is the vase of aristonothos signed by that painter and supposed to be of the seventh century fig 1 on one side the companions of odysseus are boring out the eye of the cyclops on the other a galley is being rowed to the attack of a ship on the raised deck of the galley stand three warriors helmeted and bearing spears the artist has represented their shields as covering their right sides probably for the purpose of showing their devices or blazons their shields are small round bucklers on the ship are three warriors whose shields though circular cover the body from chin to ankles as in homer one shield bears a bulls head the next has three crosses the third blazon is a crab footnote mon dell inst is pl 4  such personal armorial bearings are never mentioned by homer it is not usually safe to argue from his silence that he is ignorant of anything he never mentions seals or signet rings yet they cannot but have been familiar to his time odysseus does not seal the chest with the phaeacian presents he ties it up with a cunning knot there are no rings named among the things wrought by hephaestus nor among the offerings of the wooers of penelope footnote helbig citing odyssey viii 445448 iliad xviii 401 odyssey xviii 292301  but if we are to admit that homer knew not rings and seals which lasted to the latest mycenaean times through the dipylon age to the very late aeginetan treasure 800 bc in the british museum and appear again in the earliest dawn of the classical age and in a cyclic poem it is plain that all the expansionists lived in one and that a most peculiar ringless age this view suits our argument to a wish but it is not credible that rings and seals and engraved stones so very common in mycenaean and later times should have vanished wholly in the homeric time the poet never mentions them just as shakespeare never mentions a thing so familiar to him as tobacco how often are finger rings mentioned in the whole mass of attic tragic poetry we remember no example and instances are certainly rare liddell and scott give none yet the tragedians were of course familiar with rings and seals  manifestly we cannot say that homer knew no seals because he mentions none but armorial blazons on shields could be ignored by no poet of war if they existed  meanwhile the shields of the warriors on the vase being circular and covering body and legs answer most closely to homers descriptions helbig is reduced to suggest first that these shields are worn by men aboard ship as if warriors had one sort of shield when aboard ship and another when fighting on land and as if the men in the other vessel were not equally engaged in a sea fight no evidence in favour of such difference of practice by sea and land is offered again helbig does not trust the artist in this case though the artist is usually trusted to draw what he sees and why should he give the men in the other ship or boat small bucklers genuine while bedecking the warriors in the adverse vessel with large purely imaginary shields footnote helbig das homerische epos ii pp 313314 it is not in the least probable as helbig suggests that the artist is shirking the trouble of drawing the figure  reichel supposes that round bucklers were novelties when the vase was painted seventh century and that the artist did not understand how to depict them footnote homerische waffen p 47 but he depicted them very well as regards the men in the galley save that for obvious aesthetic reasons he chose to assume that the men in the galley were lefthanded and wore their shields on their right arms his desire being to display the blazons of both parties footnote see the same arrangement in a dipylon vase baumeister denkmaler iii p 1945 we thus see if the artist may be trusted that shields which both reached to the feet and were circular existed in his time the seventh century so that possibly they may have existed in homers time and survived into the age of small bucklers tyrtaeus late seventh century as helbig remarks speaks of a wide shield covering thighs shins breast and shoulders footnote tyrtaeus xi 23 helbig das homerische epos ii p 315 note 2  nothing can be more like the large shields of the vase of aristonothos thus the huge circular shield seems to have been a practicable shield in actual use if so when homer spoke of large circular shields he may have meant large circular shields on the dodwell pyxis of 650 to 620 bc a man wears an oval shield covering him from the base of the neck to the ankles he wears it on his left arm footnote walters ancient pottery p 316  of shields certainly small and light worn by the chiefs there is not a notice in the iliad unless there be a hint to that effect in the accounts of heroes running walking considerable distances and stepping lightly under shields supposed by the critics to be of crushing weight in such passages the poet may be carried away by his own verve or the heroes of ancient times may be deemed capable of exertions beyond those of the poets contemporaries as he often tells us that in fact the old heroes were a poet is not a scientific military writer and in the epic poetry of all other early races very gross exaggeration is permitted as in the blank space the old celtic romances and of course the huge epics of india in homer the skill of the poet makes things impossible convincing aristotle says and it is a critical error to insist on taking homer absolutely and always au pied de la lettre he seems undeniably to have large bodycovering shields present to his mind as in common use  small shields of the greek historic period are unknown to homer mr leaf says with a very few curious exceptions footnote iliad vol i p 575 detected by reichel in book x 15 footnote ibid vol i p 569 fig 2 where diomedes men sleep with their heads resting on their shields whereas a big bellied mycenaean shield rises he says too high for a pillow but some mycenzean shields were perfectly flat while again nothing could be more comfortable as a headrest than the hollow between the upper and lower bulges of the mycenzean huge shield the zulu wooden headrest is of the same character thus this passage in book x does not prove that small circular shields were known to homer nor does x 5 13 526530 an obscure text in which it is uncertain whether diomede and odysseus ride or drive the horses of rhesus they could ride as every one must see even though equipped with great bodycovering shields true the shielded hero could neither put his shield at his back nor in front of him when he rode but he could hang it sidewise when it would cover his left side as in the early middle ages 10601160 ad  the taking of the shield from a mans shoulders xi 374 does not prove the shield to be small the shield hung by the belt telamon from the shoulder footnote on the other side see reichel homerische waffen pp 4044 wien 1901 we have replied to his arguments above  so far we have the results that homer seems most familiar with vast bodycovering shields that such shields were suspended by a baldric not worn on the left arm that they were made of layers of hide plated with bronze and that such a shield as aias wore must have been tall doubtless oblong like a tower possibly it was semicylindrical whether the epithets denoting roundness refer to circular shields or to the double targe gshaped of mycenaean times is uncertain  we thus come to a puzzle of unusual magnitude if homer does not know small circular shields but refers always to huge shields whereas from the eighth century bc onwards such shields were not in use disregarding tyrtaeus and the vase of aristonothos on which they appear conspicuously and the dodwell pyxis where are we either we have a harmonious picture of war from a very ancient date of large shields or late poets did not introduce the light round buckler of their own period meanwhile they are accused of introducing the bronze corslets and other defensive armour of their own period defensive armour was unknown we are told in the mycenaean prime which if true does not affect the question homer did not live in or describe the mycenaean prime with its stone arrowtips why did the late poets act so inconsistently why were they ignorant of small circular shields which they saw every day or why if they knew them did they not introduce them in the poems which we are told they were filling with non mycenaean greaves and corslets  this is one of the dilemmas which constantly arise to confront the advocates of the theory that the iliad is a patchwork of many generations late poets if really late certainly in everyday life knew small parrying bucklers worn on the left arm and huge bodycovering shields perhaps they rarely saw in use they also knew and the original poet we are told did not know bronze corslets and greaves the theory of critics is that late poets introduced the bronze corslets and greaves with which they were familiar into the poems but scrupulously abstained from alluding to the equally familiar small shields why are they so recklessly anachronistic and uptodate with the corslets and greaves and so staunchly but inconsistently conservative about keeping the huge shields  mr leaf explains thus the groundwork of the epos is mycenaean in the arrangement of the house in the prevalence of copper as compared with iron and as reichel has shown in armour yet in many points the poems are certainly later than the prime at least of the mycenaean agewhich we are the last to deny is it that the poets are deliberately trying to present the conditions of an age anterior to their own or are they depicting the circumstances by which they are surroundedcircumstances which slowly change during the period of the development of the epos cauer decides for the latter alternative the only one which is really conceivable footnote then how is the alleged archaeology of the poet of book x conceivable in an age whose views are in many ways so naïve as the poems themselves prove them to have been footnote classical review ix pp 463 464  here we entirely side with mr leaf no poet no painter no sculptor in a naïf uncritical age ever represents in art anything but what he sees daily in costume customs weapons armour and ways of life mr leaf however on the other hand occasionally chides pieces of deliberate archaeological pedantry in the poets in spite of his opinion that they are always depicting the circumstances by which they are surrounded but as huge mancovering shields are not among the circumstances by which the supposed late poets were surrounded why do they depict them here mr leaf corrects himself and his argument departs from the statement that only one theory is conceivable namely that the poets depict their own surroundings and we are introduced to a new proposition or rather we must recognise everywhere a compromise between two opposing principles the singer on the one hand has to be conservatively tenacious of the old material which serves as the substance of his song on the other hand he has to be vivid and actual in the contributions which he himself makes to the common stock footnote ibid ix pp 463 464  the conduct of such singers is so weirdly inconsistent as not to be easily credible but probably they went further for it is possible that the allusions to the corslet may have been introduced in the course of successive modernisation such as the oldest parts of the iliad seem in many cases to have passed through but in fact iliad xi 234 is the only mention of a corslet in any of the oldest strata so far as we can distinguish them and here reichel translates thorex shield footnote leaf iliad vol i p 578 mr leafs statement we understand to mean that when the singer or reciter was delivering an ancient lay he did not introduce any of the military gearlight round bucklers greaves and corslets with which his audience were familiar but when the singer delivers a new lay which he himself has added to the kernel then he is vivid and actual and speaks of greaves and corslets though he still cleaves in his new lay to the obsolete chariot the enormous shield and in an age of iron to weapons of bronze he is a sadly inconsistent new poet  meanwhile sixteen allusions to the corslet can be cut out as probably some or all these are additions to the text made at a time when it seemed absurd to think of a man in full armour without a corslet footnote ibid vol i p 577 thus the reciters after all did not spare the old material in the matter of corslets the late singers have thus been conservatively tenacious in clinging to chariots weapons of bronze and obsolete enormous shields while they have also been vivid and actual and up to date in the way of introducing everywhere bronze corslets greaves and other armour unknown by the theory in the old material which is the substance of their song by the way they have not even spared the shield of the old material for it was of leather or wood we have no trace of metal plating on the old mycenaean shields and the singer while retaining the size of it has added a plating of bronze which we have every reason to suppose that mycenaean shields of the prime did not present to the stoneheaded arrow  this theory of singers who are at once conservatively tenacious of the old and impudently radical in pushing in the new appears to us to be logically untenable we have in chapter i observed the same inconsistency in helbig and shall have occasion to remark again on its presence in the work of that great archaeologist the inconsistency is inseparable from theories of expansion through several centuries many a method says mr leaf has been proposed which up to a certain point seemed irresistible but there has always been a residuum which returned to plague the inventor footnote iliad vol ii p x this is very true and our explanation is that no method which starts from the hypothesis that the poems are the product of several centuries will work the residuum is the element which cannot be fitted into any such hypothesis but try the hypothesis that the poems are the product of a single age and all is harmonious there is no baffling residuum the poet describes the details of a definite age not that of the mycenaean bloom not that of 900600 ad  we cannot then suppose that many generations of irresponsible reciters at fairs and public festivals conservatively adhered to the huge size of the shield while altering its material and also that the same men for the sake of being actual and up to date dragged bronze corslets and greaves not only into new lays but into passages of lays by old poets who had never heard of such things consequently the poetic descriptions of arms and armour must be explained on some other theory if the poet again as others supposemr ridgeway for oneknew such bronzecovered circular shields as are common in central and western europe of the bronze age why did he sometimes represent them as extending from neck to ankles whereas the known bronze circular shields are not of more than 2 feet 2 inches to 2 feet 6 inches in diameter footnote ridgeway early age of greece vol i pp 453 471 such a shield without the wood or leather weighed 5 lbs 2 ozs footnote ibid vol i p 462 and a strong man might walk or run under it homers shields would be twice as heavy at least though even then not too heavy for a hector or an aias or achilles i do not see that the round bronze shields of limerick yetholm beith lincolnshire and tarquinii cited by mr ridgeway answer to homers descriptions of huge shields they are too small but it is perfectly possible or rather highly probable that in the poets day shields of various sizes and patterns coexisted   archaeology of the shields  turning to archaeological evidence we find no remains in the graves of the mycenaean prime of the bronze which covered the ox hides of homeric shields though we do find gold ornaments supposed to have been attached to shields there is no evidence that the mycenaean shield was plated with bronze but if we judge from their shape as represented in works of mycenaean art some of the mycenaean shields were not of wood but of hide in works of art such as engraved rings and a bronze dagger fig 2 with pictures inlaid in other metals the shield covering the whole body is of the form of a bellying sail or a huge umbrella up and pinched at both sides near the centre or is like a door or a section of a cylinder only one sort of shield resembles a big bellied figure of 8 ivory models of shields indicate the same figure footnote schuchardt schliemanns excavations p 192 a gold necklet found at enkomi in cyprus consists of a line of models of this mycenaean shield footnote excavations in cyprus pl vii fig 604 a s murray 1900  illustration fig 2 dagger with lionhunters  illustration fig 3  there also exists a set of small mycenaean relics called palladia found at mycenae spata and in the earliest strata of the acropolis at athens they resemble two circles joined together so as to intersect one another slightly or a long oval pinched in at the middle they vary in size from six inches to half an inch and are of ivory glazed ware or glass several such shields are engraved on mycenaean gems one in gold is attached to a silver vase the ornamentation shown on them occurs too on mycenaean shields in works of art in short these little objects are representations in miniature of the big doublebellied mycenaean shield mr ernest gardner concludes that these objects are the schematised reductions of an armed human figure only the shield which covered the whole body is left they are talismans symbolising an armed divinity pallas or another a dipylon vase fig 3 shows a man with a shield possibly evolved out of this kind much scooped out at the waist and reaching from neck to knees the shield covers his side not his back or front footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xiii pp 21 24  illustration fig 4  one may guess that the original pinch at the waist of the mycenaean shield was evolved later into the two deep scoops to enable the warrior to use his arms more freely while the shield hanging from his neck by a belt covered the front of his body fig 4 shows shields of 10601160 ad equally designed to cover body and legs men wore shields if we believe the artists of mycenae when lionhunting a sport in which speed of foot is desirable so they cannot have been very weighty the shield then was hung over one side and running was not so very difficult as if it hung over back or front cf fig 5 the shields sometimes reach only from the shoulders to the calf of the leg footnote reichel p 3 fig 5 grave iii at mycenae the wearer of the largest kind could only be got at by a swordstab over the rim into the throat footnote ibid p 2 fig 2 fig 5 some shields of this shape were quite small if an engraved rockcrystal is

they wear round leather caps their enemies have helmets on a mycenaean painted stele apparently of the same relatively late period the costume is similar and the shieldovalreaches from neck to knee footnote ridgeway vol i p 314 the homeric shields do not answer to the smaller of these late and ugly representations while in their bronze plating homeric shields seem to differ from the leather shields of the mycenaean prime  finally at enkomi near salamis in cyprus an ivory carving in the british museum shows a fighting man whose perfectly circular shield reaches from neck to knee this is one of several figures in which mr arthur evans finds a most valuable illustration of the typical homeric armour footnote journal of the anthropological institute vol xxx pp 209214 figs 5 6 9 the shield however is not so huge as those of aias hector and periphetes  i can only conclude that homer describes intermediate types of shield as large as the mycenaean but plated with bronze for a reason to be given later this kind of shield the kind known to homer was not the invention of late poets living in an age of circular bucklers worn on the left arm and these supposed late poets never introduce into the epics such bucklers  what manner of military needs prompted the invention of the great mycenaean shields which by homers time were differentiated by the addition of metal plating  illustration fig 6 fragments of warrior vase  the process of evolution of the huge mycenaean shields and of the homeric shields covering the body from chin to ankles can easily be traced the nature of the attack expected may be inferred from the nature of the defence employed bodycovering shields were obviously at first defences against showers of arrows tipped with stone in the earlier mycenaean times the arrowhead of obsidian alone appears as in mycenaean grave iv in the upper strata of mycenae and in the later tombs the arrowhead is usually of bronze footnote tsountas and manatt p 206 no man going into battle naked without body armour like the mycenaeans if they had none could protect himself with a small shield or even with a round buckler of twentysix inches in diameter against the rain of shafts in a fight on the other hand where man singled out man and spears were the missiles and when the warriors had body armour or even when they had not a small shield sufficed as we see among the spearthrowing zulus and the spearthrowing aborigines of australia unacquainted with bows and arrows who mainly use shields scarcely broader than a bat on the other hand the archers of the algonquins in their wars with the iroquois about 1610 used clubs and tomahawks but no spears no missiles but arrows and their leather shield was precisely the greek amphibrotae aspis of homer covering the whole of a man it is curious to see in contemporary drawings 1620 mycenaean shields on red indian shoulders  in champlains sketches of fights between french and algonquins against iroquois 16101620 we see the algonquins outside the iroquois stockade which is defended by archers sheltering under huge shields shaped like the mycenaean tower shield though less cylindrical in fact more like the shield of the fallen hunter depicted on the dagger of mycenae these algonquin shields partially cover the sides as well as the front of the warrior who stoops behind them resting the lower rim of the shield on the ground the shields are oblong and rounded at the top much like that of achilles footnote iliad vol ii p 605 in mr leafs restoration the sides curve inward another shield oval in

homeric and mycenaean shields therefore as the achaeans in homer wore but flimsy corslets this we are going to prove the great body covering shield of the mycenaean prime did not go out of vogue in homers time when bronze had superseded stone arrowheads but was strengthened by bronze plating over the leather in a later age the bow was more and more neglected in greek warfare and consequently large shields went out after the close of the mycenaean age and round parrying bucklers came into use  the greeks appear never to have been great archers for some vases show even the old heroes

armourthin corslets and archery is frequent but somewhat despised the homeric age 3 the parrying shield of the latest mycenaean age infantry with body armour 4 the ionian hoplites with body armour and small circular bucklers  it appears then that the monstrous mycenaean shield is a survival of an age when bows and arrows played the same great part as they did in the wars of the algonquins and iroquois the celebrated picture of a siege on a silver vase of which fragments were found in grave iv shows archers skirmishing there is an archer in the lion hunt on the dagger blade thirtyfive obsidian arrowheads were discovered in grave iv while in the upper strata of mycenae and in the later tombs the arrowhead is usually of bronze though instances of obsidian still occur in 1895 dr tsountas found twenty arrowheads of bronze ten in each bundle in a mycenaean chamber tomb messrs tsountas and manatt say in the acropolis graves at mycenae the spearheads were but few arrowheads on the contrary are comparatively abundant they infer that picked men used shield and spear the rank and file doubtless fought simply with bow and sling footnote tsountas and manatt zog sic the great mycenaean shield was obviously evolved as a defence against arrows and slingstones flying too freely to be parried with a small buckler what other purpose could it have served but other defensive armour was needed and was evolved by homers men as also we shall see by the algonquins and iroquois the algonquins and iroquois thus prove that men who thought their huge shields very efficient yet felt the desirableness of the protection afforded by corslets for they wore in addition to their shields such corslets as they were able to manufacture made of cotton and corresponding to the homeric greek linothoraex footnote in the interior of some shields perhaps of all were two greek kanones viii 193 xiii 407 these have been understood as meaning a brace through which the left arm went and another brace which the left hand grasped herodotus says that the carians first used shield grips and that previously shields were suspended by belts from the neck and left shoulder herodotus i 171 it would be interesting to know how he learned these factsperhaps from homer but certainly the homeric shield is often described as suspended by a belt mr leaf used to explain the greek kanones xiii 407 as serving to attach the two ends of the baldrick to the shield hellenic societys journal iv 291 as does mr ridgeway but now he thinks that they were two pieces of wood crossing each other and making the framework on which the leather of the shield was stretched the hero could grasp the crossbar at the centre of gravity in his left hand rest the lower rim of the shield on the ground and crouch behind it xi 593 xiii 157 in neither passage cited is anything said about resting the lower rim on the ground and in the second passage the warrior is actually advancing in this attitude howevergrounding the lower rim of the great bodycovering shield and crouching behind itwe see algonquin warriors of about 1610 in champlains drawings of red indian warfare  mr leaf indeed when reviewing reichel says that the use of the mycenaean shield is inconsistent with that of the metal breastplate the shield covers the wearer in a way which makes a breastplate an useless encumbrance or rather it is ignorance of the breastplate which alone can explain the use of such frightfully cumbrous gear as the huge shield footnote classical review ix p 55 1895  but the algonquins and iroquois wore such breastplates as they could manufacture though they also used shields of great size suspended in mycenaean fashion from the neck and shoulder by a telamon or belt the knights of the eleventh century ad in addition to very large shields wore ponderous hauberks or byrnies as we shall prove presently as this combination of great shield with corslet was common and natural we cannot agree with mr leaf when he says it follows that the homeric warriors wore no metal breastplate and that all the passages where the greek thoraes is mentioned are either later interpolations or refer to some other sort of armour which ex hypothesi would itself be superfluous given the bodycovering shield  shields never make corslets superfluous when men can manufacture corslets  the facts speak for themselves the largest shields are not exclusive so to speak of corslets the homeric warriors used both just as did red indians and the mediaeval chivalry of europe the use of the aspis in homer therefore throws no suspicion on the concomitant use of the corslet the really surprising fact would be if late poets who knew only small round bucklers never introduced them into the poems but always spoke of enormous shields while they at the same time did introduce corslets unknown to the early poems which they continued clearly reichels theory is ill inspired and inconsistent this becomes plain as soon as we trace the evolution of shields and corslets in ages when the bow played a great part in war the homeric bronze plated shield and bronze corslet are defences of a given moment in military evolution they are improvements on the large leather shield of mycenaean art but as the arrows still fly in clouds the time for the small parrying buckler has not yet come  by the age of the dipylon vases with human figures the shield had been developed into forms unknown to homer in fig 3 p 131 we see one warrior with a fantastic shield slim at the waist with horns as it were above and below the greater part of the shield is expended uselessly covering nothing in particular in form this targe seems to be a burlesque parody of the figure of a mycenaean shield the next man has a short oblong shield rather broad for its lengthperhaps a reduction of the mycenaean door shaped shield the third warrior has a round buckler all these shields are manifestly posthomeric the first type is the most common in the dipylon art the third survived in the eighth century buckler  illustration fig 9gold corslet     chapter viii   the breastplate  no practicable breastplates hauberks corslets or any things of the kind have so far been discovered in graves of the mycenaean prime a corpse in grave v at mycenae had however a golden breastplate with oval bosses representing the nipples and with prettily interlaced spirals all over the remainder of the gold fig 9 another corpse had a plain gold breastplate with the nipples indicated footnote schuchardt schliemanns excavations pp 254257 fig 256 these decorative corslets of gold were probably funereal symbols of practicable breastplates of bronze but no such pieces of armour are worn by the fightingmen on the gems and other works of art of mycenae and none are found in mycenaean graves but does this prove anything legguards broad metal bands clasping the leg below the knee are found in the mycenaean shaft graves but are never represented in mycenaean art footnote leaf iliad vol i p 575 meanwhile bronze corslets are very frequently mentioned in the rarely alluded to says mr leaf footnote iliad vol i p 576 but this must be a slip of the pen connected with the breastplate or thorex greek thoraex is the verb greek thoraesso thoraessethai which means to arm or equip in general  the achaeans are constantly styled in the iliad and in the odyssey chalkochitones with bronze chitons epics have therefore boldly argued that by bronze chitons the poet pleasantly alludes to shields but as the mycenaeans seem scarcely to have worn any chitons in battle as far as we are aware from their art and are not known to have had any bronze shields the argument evaporates as mr ridgeway has pointed out nothing can be less like a chiton or smock loose or tight than either the doublebellied huge shield the towershaped cylindrical shield or the flat doorlike shield covering body and legs in mycenaean art the bronze chiton says helbig is only a poetic phrase for the corslet  reichel and mr leaf however think that bronze chitoned is probably a picturesque expression and refers to the bronze covered shield footnote leaf iliad i 578 the breastplate covered the upper part of the chiton and so might be called a bronze chiton above all if it had been evolved as corselets usually have been out of a real chiton interwoven with small plates or rings of bronze the process of evolution might be from a padded linen chiton greek linothooraes worn by teucer and on the trojan side by amphius as by nervous protestants during oatess popish plot to a leathern chiton strengthened by rings or studs or scales of bronze and thence to plates footnote ridgeway early age of greece vol i pp 309 310 here in this armoured chiton would be an object that a poet might readily call a chiton of bronze but that if he lived in the mycenaean age when so far as art shows chitons were not worn at all or very little and scarcely ever in battle and when we know nothing of bronzeplating on shields the poet should constantly call a monstrous double bellied leather shield or any other mycemean type of shield a bronze chiton seems almost unthinkable a leather cloak would be a better term for such shields if cloaks were in fashion  according to mr myres 1899 the stock line in the iliad about piercing a greek poludaidalos thoraex or corslet was inserted to satisfy the practical criticisms of a corsletwearing age the age of the later poets the age of iron but why did not such practical critics object to the constant presence in the poems of bronze weapons in their age out of date if they objected to the absence from the poems of the corslets with which they were familiar mr myres supposes that the line about the greek poludaidalos corslet was already old but had merely meant manyglittering body clothinggarments set with the golden discs and other ornaments found in mycemean graves the bronze corslet he says would not be many glittering but would reflect a single star of light footnote journal of hellenic studies 1899 now first even if the star were a single star it would be as many glittering when the warrior was in rapid and changeful motion as the star that danced when beatrix was born secondly if the contemporary corslets of the iron age were not many glittering practical corsletwearing critics would ask the poet why do you call corslets many glittering thirdly greek poludaidalos may surely be translated a thing of much art and greek corslets were incised with ornamental designs thus messrs hogarth and bosanquet report a very remarkable mycemean bronze breastplate from crete which shows four female draped figures the two central ones holding a wreath over a bird below which is a sacred tree the two outer figures are apparently dancing it is probably a ritual scene and may help to elucidate the nature of early aegean cults footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xx p 322 1899 here greek poludaidalosif that word means artistically wrought helbig thinks the epics silent about the gold spangles on dresses footnote helbig p 71  mr myres applauds reichels theory that blank space first meant a mans chest if thorex means a mans breast then thorex in a secondary sense one thinks would mean breastplate as waist of a woman means first her waist next her blouse american but mr myres and reichel say that the secondary sense of thorex is not breastplate but body clothing as if a man were all breast or wore only a breast covering whereas mycenaean art shows men wearing nothing on their breasts merely drawers or loincloths which could not be called thorex as they cover the antipodes of the breast  the verb greek thoraesestai the theory runs on merely meant to put on body clothing which mycenaeans in works of art if correctly represented do not usually put on they fought naked or in bathing drawers surely we might as well argue that a waistcoat might come to mean body clothing in general as that a word for the male breast became first a synonym for the covering of the male buttocks and for apparel in general and next for a bronze breastplate these arguments appear rather unconvincing footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xx pp 149 150 nor does mycenaean art instruct us that men went into battle dressed in body clothing which was thickly set with many glittering gold ornaments and was called a many glittering thorex  further if we follow reichel and mr leaf the mycenaeans wore chitons and called them chitons they also used bronzeplated shields though of this we have no evidence taking the bronzeplated  shield to stand poetically for the chiton the poet spoke of the bronzechitoned achaeans but if we follow mr myres the mycenaeans also applied the word thorex to body clothing at large in place of the word chiton and when a warrior was transfixed by a spear they said that his manyglittering goldstudded thorex that is his body clothing in general was pierced it does seem simpler to hold that chiton meant chiton that thorex meant first breast then breastplate whether of linen or plaited leather or bronze and that to pierce a man through his greek poludaidalos thoraex meant to pierce him through his handsome corslet no mortal ever dreamt that this was so till reichel tried to make out that the original poet describes no armour except the large mycenaean shield and the mitrê and that all corslets in the poems were of much later introduction possibly they were but they had plenty of time wherein to be evolved long before the eighth century reichels date for corslets  the argument is that a man with a large shield needs no body armour or uses the shield because he has no body armour  but the possession and use of a large shield did not in the middle ages or among the iroquois and algonquins make men dispense with corslets even when the shield was worn as in homer slung round the neck by a telamon guige in old french belt or baldric  we turn to a french chanson de gestela chancun de willem of the twelfth century ad to judge by the handwriting one of the heroes girard having failed to rescue vivien in battle throws down his weapons and armour blaming each piece for having failed him down goes the heavy lance down goes the ponderous shield suspended by a telamon ohitarge grant cume peises al col down goes the plated byrnie ohi grant broine cum me vas apesant footnote la chancun de willame lines 716726  the mediaeval warrior has a heavy byrnie as well as a great shield suspended from his neck it will be remarked also that the algonquins and iroquois of the beginning of the seventeenth century as described by champlain give us the whole line of mycenaean evolution of armour up to a certain point not only had they arrowproof bodycovering shields of buffalo hide but when champlain used his arquebus against the iroquois in battle they were struck amazed that two of their number should have been killed so promptly seeing that they wore a sort of armour woven of cotton thread and carried arrowproof shields we have already alluded to this passage but must add that parkman describing from french archives a battle of illinois against iroquois in 1680 speaks of corslets of tough twigs interwoven with cordage footnote discovery of the great iv misprint 1869 golden in his five nations writes of the red indians as wearing a kind of cuirass made of pieces of wood joined together footnote dix champlion misprint  to the kindness of mr hill tout i also owe a description of the armour of the indian tribes of northwest america from a work of his own he says for protective purposes in warfare they employed shields and coatarmour the shields varied in form and material from tribe to tribe among the interior salish they were commonly made of wood which was afterwards covered with hide sometimes they consisted of several thicknesses of hide only the hides most commonly used were those of the elk buffalo or bear after the advent of the hudsons bay co some of the indians used to beat out the large copper kettles they obtained from the traders and make polished circular shields of these in some centres long rectangular shields made from a single or double hide were employed these were often from 4 to 5 feet in length and from 3 to 4 feet in widthlarge enough to cover the whole body among the déné tribes sikanis the shield was generally made of closelywoven wickerwork and was of an ovaloid form exact size not given  the coat armour was everywhere used and varied in form and style in almost every centre there were two ways in which this was most commonly made one of these was the slatted cuirass or corslet which was formed of a series of narrow slats of wood set side by side vertically and fastened in place by interfacings of raw hide it went all round the body being hung from the shoulders with straps the other was a kind of shirt of double or treble elk hide fastened at the side with thongs another kind of armour less common than that just described was the long elk hide tunic which reached to and even below the knees and was sleeved to the elbow  mr hill touts minute description with the other facts cited leaves no doubt that even in an early stage as in later stages of culture the use of the great shield does not exclude the use of such body armour as the means of the warriors enable them to construct to take another instance pausanias describes the corslets of the neolithic sarmatae which he saw dedicated in the temple of asclepius at athens corslets these bowmen and users of the lasso possessed though they did not use the metals they fashioned very elegant corslets out of horses hoofs cutting them into scales like those of a pine cone and sewing them on to cloth footnote pausanias i 211 misprint 6  certain small thin perforated discs of stone found in scotland have been ingeniously explained as plates to be strung together on a garment of cloth a neolithic chiton however this may be since iroquois and algonquins and déné had some sort of woven or plaited or wooden or buff corslet in addition to their great shields we may suppose that the achaeans would not be less inventive they would pass from the greek linothoraex answering to the cotton corslet of the iroquois to a sort of jack or jaseran with rings scales or plates and thence to bronzeplate corslets represented only by the golden breastplates of the mycenaean grave even if the mycenaeans did not evolve the corslet there is no reason why in the homeric times it should not have been evolved  for linen corslets such as homer mentions in actual use and represented in works of art we consult mr leaf on the armour of homeric heroes he finds memnon in a white corslet on a blackfigured vase in the british museum there is another white corsleted footnote journal of hellenic studies vol iv pp 82 83 85 memnon figured in the vases peints of the duc de luynes plate xii mr leaf suggests that the white colour represents a corslet not of metal but of linen and cites iliad ii 529 5 30 xenophon mentions linen corslets as being worn by the chalybes anabasis iv 15 two linen corslets sent from egypt to sparta by king amasis are recorded by herodotus ii 182 iii 47 the corslets were of linen embroidered in cotton and gold such a piece of armour or attire might easily develop into the greek streptos chitoon of iliad v 113 in which aristarchus appears to have recognised chain or scale armour but we find no such object represented in mycenaean art which of course does not depict homeric armour or costume and it seems probable that the bronze corslets mentioned by homer were plate armour the linen corslet lasted into the early sixth century bc in the poem called stasiotica alcaeus no 5 speaks of his helmets bronze greaves and corslets of linen choorakes te neoi linoo as a defence against arrows  meanwhile a bronze chiton or corslet would turn spent arrows and spent spears and be very useful to a warrior whose shield left him exposed to shafts shot or spears thrown from a distance again such a bronze chiton might stop a spear of which the impetus was spent in penetrating the shield but homeric corslets did not as a rule avail to keep out a spear driven by the hand at close quarters or powerfully thrown from a short distance even the later greek corslets do not look as if they could resist a heavy spear wielded by a strong hand  i proceed to show that the homeric corslet did not avail against a spear at close quarters but could turn an arrow point once and could sometimes turn a spear which had perforated a shield so far and not further the homeric corslet was serviceable but if a warriors breast or back was not covered by the shield and received a thrust at close quarters the corslet was pierced more easily than the pad of paper which was said to have been used as secret armour in a duel by the master of sinclair 1708 footnote proceedings in court marshal held upon john master of sinclair sir walter scott roxburghe club date of event 1708 it is desirable to prove this feebleness of the corslet because the poet often says that a man was smitten with the spear in breast or back when unprotected by the shield without mentioning the corslet whence it is argued by the critics that corslets were not worn when the original lays were fashioned and that they have only been sporadically introduced in an after age when the corslet was universal by modernising later rhapsodists aiming at the uptodate  a weak point is the argument that homer says back or breast was pierced without mentioning the corslet whence it follows that he knew no corslets quintus smyrnaeus does the same thing of course quintus knew all about corslets yet book i 248 256 257 he makes his heroes drive spear or sword through breast or belly without mentioning the resistance of the corslet even when i 144 594 he has assured us that the victim was wearing a corslet these facts are not due to inconsistent interpolation of corslets into the work of this postchristian poet quintus footnote i find a similar omission in the chanson de roland  corslets in homer are flimsy that of lycaon worn by paris is pierced by a spear which has also perforated his shield though the spear came only from the weak hand of menelaus iliad iii 357 358 the arrow of pandarus whistles through the corslet of menelaus iv 136 the same archer pierces with an arrow the corslet of diomede v 99 100 the corslet of diomede however avails to stop a spear which has traversed his shield v 281 the spear of idomeneus pierces the corslet of othryoneus and the spear of antilochus perforates the corslet of a charioteer xiii 371 397 a few lines later diomedes spear reaches the midriff of hypsenor no corslet is here mentioned but neither is the shield mentioned this constantly occurs and we cannot argue that hypsenor wore no corslet unless we are also to contend that he wore no shield or a small shield idomeneus drives his spear through the bronze chiton of alcathöus xiii 439 440 mr leaf reckons these lines probably an interpolation to turn the linen chiton the rending of which is the sign of triumph into a bronze corslet but we ask why if an editor or rhapsodist went through the iliad introducing corslets he so often left them out where the critics detect their absence because they are not mentioned  the spear of idomeneus pierces another feeble corslet over the victims belly xiii 506508 it is quite a surprise when a corslet does for once avail to turn an arrow xiii 586587 but aias drives his spear through the corslet of phorcys into his belly xvii 311312 thus the corslet scarcely ever by itself protects a hero it never protects him against an unspent spear even when his shield stands between his corslet and the spear both are sometimes perforated yet occasionally the corslet saves a man when the spear has gone through the shield the poet therefore sometimes gives us a man pierced in a part which the corslet covers without mentioning the flimsy article that could not keep out a spear  reichel himself came to see before his regretted death that he could not explain away the thorex or corslet on his original lines as a mere general name for a piece of armour and he inclined to think that jacks with metal plates sewn on did exist before the ionian corslet footnote homerische waffen pp 9394 1901 the gold breastplates of the mycenaean graves pointed in this direction but his general argument is that corslets were interpolated into the old lays by poets of a corsletwearing age and mr leaf holds that corslets may have filtered in during the course of successive modernisation such as the oldest parts of the iliad seem in many cases to have passed through footnote leaf iliad i p 578 though the new poets were for all that conservatively tenacious of the old material we have already pointed out the difficulty  the poets who did not introduce the new small bucklers with which they were familiar did stuff the iliad full of corslets unknown by the theory to the original poet but familiar to rhapsodists living centuries later why if they were bent on modernising did they not modernise the shields and how if they modernised unconsciously as all uncritical poets do did the shield fail to be unconsciously brought up to date it seems probable that homer lived at a period when both huge shield and rather feeble corslet were in vogue  we shall now examine some of the passages in which mr leaf mainly following reichel raises difficulties about corslets we do not know their mechanism they were composed of greek guala presumed to be a backplate and a breastplate the word gualon appears to mean a hollow or the converse something convex we cannot understand the mechanism see a young man putting on a corslet on an amphora by euthymides walter vol ii p 176 but if late poets familiar with such corslets did not understand how they worked they were very dull men when their descriptions puzzle us that is more probably because we are not at the point of view than because poets interpolated mentions of pieces of armour which they did not understand and therefore cannot have been familiar with and in that case would not introduce  mr leaf starts with a passage in the iliad iii 357360 it recurs in another case through the bright shield went the ponderous spear and through the inwrought very artfully wrought greek poludaidalou breastplate it pressed on and straight beside his flank it rent the tunic but he swerved and escaped black death mr leaf says it is obvious that after a spear has passed through a breastplate there is no longer any possibility for the wearer to bend aside and so to avoid the point but i suppose that the wearer by a motion very natural doubled up sideways so to speak and so the spear merely grazed his flesh that is what i suppose the poet to intend the more he knew of corslets the less would he mention an impossible circumstance in connection with a corslet  again in many cases the late poets by the theorythough it is they who bring the corslets inleave the corslets out a man without shield helmet and spear calls himself naked why did not these late poets it is asked make him take off his corslet if he had one as well as his shield the case occurs in xxii 111113124125 hector thinks of laying aside helmet spear and shield and of parleying with achilles but then he will slay me naked that is unarmed he still had his corslet the critics say so how could he be naked or if he had no corslet this is a passage uncontaminated by the late poets of the corslet age now certainly hector was wearing a corslet which he had taken from patroclus that is the essence of the story he would however be naked or unprotected if he laid aside helmet spear and shield because achilles could hit him in the head or neck as he did or lightly drive the spear through the corslet which we have proved was no sound defence against a spear at close quarters though useful against chance arrows and occasionally against spears spent by traversing the shield  we next learn that no corslet occurs in the odyssey or in iliad book x called very late mr leaf suggests that it is of the seventh century bc but if the odyssey and iliad book x are really very late their authors and interpolators were perfectly familiar with ionian corslets why did they leave corslets out while their predecessors and contemporaries were introducing them all up and down the iliad in fact in book x no prince is regularly equipped they have been called up to deliberate in the dead of night and when two go as spies they wear casual borrowed gear it is more important that no corslet is mentioned in nestors arms in his tent but are we to explain this and the absence of mention of corslets in the odyssey where there is little about regular fighting on the ground that the author of iliad book x and all the many authors and editors of the odyssey happened to be profound archaeologists and unlike their contemporaries the later poets and interpolators of the iliad had formed the theory that corslets were not known at the time of the siege of troy and therefore must not be mentioned this is quite incredible no hypothesis can be more improbable we cannot imagine late ionian rhapsodists listening to the iliad and saying these poets of the iliad are all wrong at the date of the mycenaean prime as every educated man knows corslets were not yet in fashion so we must have no corslets in the odyssey  a modern critic who thinks this possible is bringing the practice of archaising poets of the late nineteenth century into the minds of rhapsodists of the eighth century before christ artists of the middle of the sixteenth century always depict jeanne darc in the armour and costume of their own time wholly unlike those of 1430 this is the regular rule late rhapsodists would not delve in the archaeology of the mycenaean prime indeed one does not see how they could discover in asia that corslets were not worn five centuries earlier on the other side of the sea  we are told that aias and some other heroes are never spoken of as wearing corslets but aias certainly did put on a set of pieces of armour and did not trust to his shield alone towerlike as it was the description runs thus the achaeans have disarmed before the duel of aias and hector aias draws the lucky lot he is to meet hector and bids the others pray to zeus while i clothe me in my armour of battle while they prayed aias arrayed himself in flashing bronze and when he had now clothed upon his flesh all his pieces of armour greek panta teuchae he went forth to fight if aias wore only a shield as on mr leafs hypothesis he could sling it on before the achaeans could breathe a pater noster his sword he would not have taken off swords were always worn what then are all his pieces of armour vii 193 206  carl robert cites passages in which the greek teuchea taken from the shoulders include corslets and are late and ionian with other passages which are mycenaean with no corslet involved he adds about twenty more passages in which greek teuchea include corslets among these references two are from the doloneia x 254 272 where reichel finds no mention of corslets how robert can tell greek teuchea which mean corslets from greek teuchea which exclude corslets is not obvious but at all events he does see corslets as in vii 122 where reichel sees none footnote robert studien zur ilias pp 2021 and he is obviously right  it is a strong point with mr leaf that we never hear of the corslet in the case of aias footnote leaf iliad vol i p 576 robert however like ourselves detects the corslet among al the greek teuchea which aias puts on for his duel with hector iliad vii 193 206207  in the same book vii 101103 122 the same difficulty occurs menelaus offers to fight hector and says i will put on my harness greek thooraxomai and does put on his fair pieces of armour greek teuchea kala agamemnon forbids him to fight and his friends joyfully take his pieces of armour greek teuchea from his shoulders iliad vii 206207 they take off pieces of armour in the plural and a shield cannot be spoken of in the plural while the sword would not be taken offit was worn even in peaceful costume  idomeneus is never named as wearing a corslet but he remarks that he has plenty of corslets xiii 264 and in this and many cases opponents of corslets prove their case by cutting out the lines which disprove it anything may be demonstrated if we may excise whatever passage does not suit our hypothesis it is impossible to argue against this logical device especially when the critic not satisfied with a clean cut supposes that some late enthusiast for corslets altered the prayer of thetis to hephaestus for the very purpose of dragging in a corslet footnote leaf note to iliad xviii 460 461 if there is no objection to a line except that a corslet occurs in it where is the logic in excising the line because one happens to think that corslets are later than the oldest parts of the iliad  another plan is to maintain that if the poet does not in any case mention a corslet there was no corslet thus in v 99 an arrow strikes diomede hard by the right shoulder the plate of the corslet thirteen lines later v 112 113 sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through out of diomedes shoulder and the blood darted up through the pliant chiton we do not know what the word here translated pliant greek streptos means and aristarchus seems to have thought it was a coat of mail chain or scale armour if so here is the corslet but in this case if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or rings of bronze be meant gualon cannot mean a large plate as it does mr ridgeway says it seems certain that greek streptos chitoon means as aristarchus held a shirt of mail footnote early age of greece vol i p 306 mr leaf says just the reverse as usual we come to a deadlock a clash of learned opinion but any one can see that in the space of thirteen lines no poet or interpolator who wrote v i 12 i 13 could forget that diomede was said to be wearing a corslet in v 99 and even if the poet could forget which is out of the question the editor of 540 bc was simply defrauding his employer piaistratus if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the poet when this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a corslet it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it though as we have seen a man is occasionally smitten in the midriff say without any remark on the flimsy piece of mail  that corslets are usually taken for granted as present by the poet even when they are not explicitly named seems certain he constantly represents the heroes as stripping the pieces of mail greek teuchea when they have time and opportunity from fallen foes if only the shield is taken if there is nothing else in the way of bronze body armour to take why have we the plural greek teuchea the corslet as well as the shield must be intended the stripping is usually from the shoulders and it is from his shoulders that hector hopes to strip the corslet of diomede iliad viii 195 in a passage to be sure which the critics think interpolated however this may be the stripping of the same greek characters cannot be the mere seizure of the shield but must refer to other pieces of armour all the pieces of armour so other pieces of defensive armour besides the shield are throughout taken for granted if they were not there they could not be stripped it is the chitons that agamemnon does something to in the case of two fallen foes iliad xi 100 and aristarchus thought that these chitons were corslets but the passage is obscure in iliad xi 373 when diomede strips helmet from head shield from shoulder corslet from breast of agastrophus reichel was for excising the corslet because it was not mentioned when the hero was struck on the hip joint i do not see that an inefficient corslet would protect the hip joint to do that in our eighteenth century cavalry armour was the business of a zoster as may be seen in a portrait of the chevalier de st george in youth it is a thick ribbed zoster that protects the hip joints of the king  finally mr evans observes that the western invaders of egypt under rameses iii are armed on the monuments with cuirasses formed of a succession of plates horizontal or rising in a double curve while the enkomi ivories already referred to corroborate the existence of corslet zoster and zoma as articles of defensive armour footnote journal of anthropological institute xxx p 213 recent discoveries says mr evans thus supply a double corroboration of the homeric tradition which carries back the use of the round shield and the cuirass or greek thoraex to the earlier epic period with such a representation before us a series of homeric passages on which dr reichel has exhausted his powers of destructive criticism becomes readily intelligible footnote ibid p 214  homer then describes armour later than that of the mycenaean prime when as far as works of art show only a huge leathern shield was carried though the gold breastplates of the corpses in the grave suggest that corslets existed homers men on the other hand have at least in certain cases quoted above large bronzeplated shields and bronze cuirasses of no great resisting power perhaps in various stages of evolution from the byrnie with scales or small plates of bronze to the breastplate and backplate though the plates for breast and back certainly appear to be usually worn  it seems that some critics cannot divest themselves of the idea that the original poet of the kernel was contemporary with them who slept in the shaft graves of mycenae covered with golden ornaments and that for body armour he only knew their monstrous shields mr leaf writes the armour of homeric heroes corresponds closely to that of the mykenaean age as we learn it from the monuments the heroes wore no breastplate their only defensive armour was the enormous mykenaean shield  this is only true if we excise all the passages which contradict the statement and go on with mr leaf to say by the seventh century bc or thereabouts the idea of a panoply without a breastplate had become absurd by that time the epic poems had almost ceased to grow but they still admitted a few minor episodes in which the round shield where  and corslet played a part as well as the interpolation of a certain number of lines and couplets in which the new armament was mechanically introduced into narratives which originally knew nothing of it footnote iliad vol i p 568  on the other hand mr leaf says that the small circular shield of later times is unknown to homer with a very few curious exceptions in which the shields are not said to be small or circular footnote iliad vol i p 575  surely this is rather arbitrary dealing we start from our theory that the original poet described the armour of the monuments though they are of the prime while he professedly lived long after the primelived in an age when there must have been changes in military equipment we then cut out as of the seventh century whatever passages do not suit our theory anybody can prove anything by this method we might say that the siege scene on the mycenaean silver vase represents the mycenaean prime and that as there is but one jersey among eight men otherwise stark naked we must cut out seveneighths of the chitons in the iliad these having been interpolated by late poets who did not run about with nothing on we might call the whole poem late because the authors know nothing of the mycenaean bathingdrawers so common on the monuments the argument compels mr leaf to assume that a shield can be called greek teuchea in the plural so in iliad vii 122 when the squires of menelaus take the greek teuchea from his shoulders we are assured that the shield aspis was for the chiefs alone we have seen that all the host of pandarus wore shields for those who could keep a chariot to carry them and squires to assist them in taking off this ponderous defence see vii 122 footnote iliad vol i p 583  we do see vii 122 and find that not a single shield but pieces of gear in the plural number were taken off menelaus the feeblest warrior without any assistance could stoop his head and put it through the belt of his shield as an angler takes off his fishing creel and there he was totally disarmed no squire was needed to disarm him any more than to disarm girard in the chancun de willame nobody explains why a shield is spoken of as a number of things in the plural and that constantly and in lines where if the poet means a shield prosody permits him to say a shield greek therapontes ap oopoon aspid elonto  it really does appear that reichels logic his power of visualising simple things and processes and his knowledge of the evolution of defensive armour everywhere were not equal to his industry and classical erudition homer seems to describe what he saw shields often of great size made of leather plated with bronze and suspended by belts and for body armour feeble bronze corslets and zosters there is nothing inconsistent in all this there was no more reason why an homeric warrior should not wear a corslet as well as a shield than there was reason why a mediaeval knight who carried a targe should not also wear a hauberk or why an iroquois with a shield should not also wear his cotton or wickerwork armour defensive gear kept pace with offensive weapons a big leather shield could keep out stonetipped arrows but as bronzetipped arrows came in and also heavy bronzepointed spears defensive armour was necessarily strengthened the shield was plated with bronze and if it did not exist before the bronze corslet was developed  to keep out stonetipped arrows was the business of the mycenaean wooden or leather shield bronze arrowheads so common in the iliad are never found says schuchardt speaking of schliemanns mycenaean excavations footnote schuchardt p 237  there was thus as far as arrows went no reason why mycenaean shields should be plated with bronze if the piece of wood in grave v was a shield as seems probable what has become of its bronze plates if it had any footnote schuchardt p 269 gold ornaments which could only belong to shields footnote ibid p 237 were found but bronze shield plates never the inference is certain the mycenaean shields of the prime were originally wooden or leather defences against stoneheaded arrows homers shields are bronzeplated shields to keep out bronze headed or even perhaps ironpointed arrows of primitive construction iv 123 homer describes armour based on mycenaean lines but developed and advanced as the means of attack improved  where everything is so natural it seems fantastic to explain the circumstances by the theory that poets in a late age sometimes did and sometimes did not interpolate the military gear of four centuries posterior to the things known by the original singer these rhapsodists we reiterate are now said to be anxiously conservative of mycenaean detail and even to be deeply learned archaeologists footnote leaf iliad vol ii p 629 at other times they are said to introduce recklessly part of the military gear of their own age the corslets while sternly excluding the bucklers all depends on what the theory of very late developments of the epic may happen to demand at this or that moment  again mr leaf informs us that the first rhapsodies were born in the bronze age in the day of the ponderous mycenaean shield the last in the iron age when men armed themselves with breastplate and light round buckler footnote ibid vol ii p x we cannot guess how he found these things out for corslets are as common in one rhapsody as in another when circumstances call for the mention of corslets and are entirely unnamed in the odyssey save that the achaeans are bronzechitoned while the odyssey is alleged to be much later than the iliad as for the iron age no rhapsodist introduces so much as one iron spear point it is argued that he speaks of bronze in deference to tradition then why does he scout tradition in the matter of greaves and corslets while he sometimes actually goes behind tradition to find mycenaean things unknown to the original poets  these theories appear too strangely inconsistent really these theories cannot possibly be accepted the late poets of the theory are in the iron age and are of course familiar with iron weapons yet in conservative deference to tradition they keep them absolutely out of their rhapsodies they are equally familiar with bronze corslets so reckless this time of tradition they thrust them even into rhapsodies which are centuries older than their own day they are no less familiar with small bucklers yet they say nothing about them and cling to the traditional bodycovering shield the source of the inconsistent theories which we have been examining is easily discovered the scholars who hold these opinions see that several things in the homeric picture of life are based on mycenaean facts for example the size of the shields and their suspension by baldrics but the scholars also do steadfastly believe following the wolfian tradition that there could be no long epic in the early period therefore the greater part much the greater part of the iliad must necessarily they say be the work of continuators through several centuries critics are fortified in this belief by the discovery of inconsistencies in the epic which they assume can only be explained as the result of a compilation of the patchwork of ages but as on this theory many men in many lands and ages made the epic their contributions cannot but be marked by the inevitable changes in manners customs beliefs implements laws weapons and so on which could not but arise in the long process of time yet traces of change in law religion manners and customs are scarcely if at all to be detected whence it logically follows that a dozen generations of irresponsible minstrels and vagrant reciters were learned conscientious and staunchly conservative of the archaic tone their erudite conservatism for example induced them in deference to the traditions of the bronze age to describe all weapons as of bronze though many of the poets were living in an age of weapons of iron it also prompted them to describe all shields as made on the faraway old mycenaean model though they were themselves used to small circular bucklers with a bracer and a grip worn on the left arm  but at this point the learning and conservatism of the late poets deserted them and into their new lays also into the old lays they eagerly introduced many unwarrantable corslets and greaves things of the ninth to seventh centuries we shall find helbig stating on the same page that in the matter of usages the epic poets shunned as far as possible all that was recent and also that for fear of puzzling their military audiences they did the reverse they probably kept account of the arms and armour of their own day footnote la question mycénienne p 50 cf note i now the late poets on this showing must have puzzled warriors who used iron weapons by always speaking of bronze weapons they pleased the critical warriors on the other hand by introducing the corslets and greaves which every military man of their late age possessed but again the poets startled an audience which used light bucklers worn on the left arm by talking of enormous targes slung round the neck  all these inconsistencies of theory follow from the assumption that the iliad must be a hotchpotch of many ages if we assume that on the whole it is the work of one age we see that the poet describes the usages which obtained in his own day the dead are cremated not as in the mycenaean prime inhumed the shield has been strengthened to meet bronze not stonetipped arrows by bronze plates corslets and greaves have been elaborated bronze however is still the metal for swords and spears and even occasionally for tools and implements though these are often of iron in short we have in homer a picture of a transitional age of culture we have not a medley of old and new of obsolete and modern the poets do not describe inhumation as they should do if they are conservative archaeologists in that case though they burn they would have made their heroes bury their dead as they did at mycenas they do not introduce iron swords and spears as they must do if being late poets they keep in touch with the armament of their time if they speak of huge shields only because they are conservative archaeologists then on the other hand they speak of corslets and greaves because they are also reckless innovators  they cannot be both at once they are depicting a single age a single moment in culture that age is certainly sundered from the mycenaean prime by the century or two in which changing ideas led to the superseding of burial by burning or it is sundered from the mycenaean prime by a foreign conquest a revolution and the years in which the foreign conquerors acquired the language of their subjects  in either alternative and one or other must be actual there was time enough for many changes in the culture of the mycenaean prime to be evolved these changes we say are represented by the descriptions of culture in the iliad that hypothesis explains simply and readily all the facts the other hypothesis that the iliad was begun near the mycenaean prime and was continued throughout four or five centuries cannot first explain how the iliad was composed and next it wanders among apparent contradictories and through a maze of inconsistencies     the zoster zoma and mitre   we are far from contending that it is always possible to understand homers descriptions of defensive armour but as we have never seen the actual objects perhaps the poets phrases were clear enough to his audience and are only difficult to us i do not for example profess to be sure of what happened when pandarus shot at menelaus the arrow lighted where the golden buckles of the zoster were clasped and the doubled breastplate met them so the bitter arrow alighted upon the firm zoster through the wrought zoster it sped and through the curiously wrought breastplate it pressed on and through the mitre he wore to shield his flesh a barrier against darts and this best shielded him yet it passed on even through this and grazed the heros flesh iliad iv i 32 seq menelaus next says that the glistering zoster in front stayed the dart and the zoma beneath and the mitrê that the coppersmiths fashioned iv 185187 then the surgeon machaon loosed the glistering zoster and the zoma and the mitrê beneath that the coppersmiths fashioned iv 215 216  reading as a mere student of poetry i take this to mean that the corslet was of two pieces fastening in the middle of the back and the middle of the front of a man though mr monro thinks that the plates met and the zoster was buckled at the side that the zoster a mailed belt buckled just above the place where the plates of the corslet met that the arrow went through the meetingplace of the belt buckles through the place where the plates of the corslet met and then through the mitrê a piece of bronze armour worn under the corslet though the nature of this mitrê and of the zoma i do not know was the mitrê a separate article or a continuation of the breastplate lower down struck by a dropping arrow  in 1883 mr leaf wrote i take it that the zoma means the waist of the cuirass which is covered by the zoster and has the upper edge of the mitrê or plated apron beneath it fastened round the warriors body  this view is strongly supported by all the archaic vase paintings i have been able to find footnote journal of hellenic studies vol iv pp 7475 we see a corslet with a projecting rim that rim is called zoma and holds the zoster the hips and upper part of the thighs were protected either by a belt of leather sometimes plated called the mitrê or else only by the lower part of the chiton and this corresponds exactly with homeric description footnote journal of hellenic studies pp 76 77  at this time in days before reichel mr leaf believed in bronze corslets whether of plates or plated jacks he also believed we have seen that the huge shields as of aias were survivals in poetry that homer saw small round bucklers in use and supposed that the old warriors were muscular enough to wear circular shields as great as those in the vase of aristonothos already described footnote ibid vol iv p 285  on the corslet as we have seen mr leaf now writes as a disciple of reichel but as to the mitrê he rejects helbigs and mr ridgeways opinion that it was a band of metal a foot wide in front and very narrow behind such things have been found in euboea and in italy mr ridgeway mentions examples from bologna corneto este hallstatt and hungary footnote early age of greece p 31 i the zoster is now in mr leafs opinion a girdle holding up the waistcloth zoma so characteristic of mycenaean dress reichels arguments against corslets militate just as strongly against the presence of such a mitrê which is in fact just the lower half of a corslet the conclusion is that the metallic mitrê is just as much an intruder into the armament of the epos as the corslet the process of evolution was mr leaf suggests first the abandonment of the huge shield with the introduction of small round bucklers in its place then second a man naturally felt very unprotected and put on the metallic mitrê of helbig which covered a foot of him in front and three inches behind only as technical skill improved could the final stage that of the elaborate cuirass be attained  this appears to us an improbable sequence of processes while arrows were flying thick as they do fly in the iliad men would not reject bodycovering shields for small bucklers while they were still wholly destitute of body armour nor would men arm only their stomachs when if they had skill enough to make a metallic mitrê they could not have been so unskilled as to be unable to make corslets of some more or less serviceable type probably they began with huge shields added the linothorex like the iroquois cotton thorex and next as a rule superseded that with the bronze thorex while retaining the huge shield because the bronze thorex was so inadequate to its purpose of defence then when archery ceased to be of so much importance as coming to the shock with heavy spears and as the bronze thorex really could sometimes keep out an arrow they reduced the size of their shields and retained surface enough for parrying spears and meeting point and edge of the sword that appears to be a natural set of sequences but i cannot pretend to guess how the corslet fastened or what the mitrê and zoster really were beyond being guards of the stomach and lower part of the trunk     helmets greaves spears   no helmets of metal such as homer mentions have been found in mycenaean graves a quantity of boars teeth sixty in all were discovered in grave v and may have adorned and strengthened leather caps now mouldered into dust an ivory head from mycenae shows a conical cap set with what may be boars tusks with a band of the same round the chin and an earpiece which was perhaps of bronze spata and the graves of the lower town of mycenae and the enkomi ivories show similar headgear footnote tsountas and manatt pp 196 197  this kind of cap set with boars tusks is described in iliad book x in the account of the hasty arraying of two spies in the night of terror after the defeat and retreat to the ships the trojan spy dolon also wears a leather cap the three spies put on no corslets as far as we can affirm their object being to remain inconspicuous and unburdened with glittering bronze greaves and corslets the trojan camp was brilliantly lit up with fires and there may have been a moon so the less bronze the better in these circumstances alone the heroes of the iliad are unequipped certainly with bronze helmets corslets and bronze greaves dislocated footnote evans journal of the anthropological institute xxx pp 209215 footnote iliad x 255265  the author of book x is now regarded as a precise archaeologist who knew that corslets and bronze helmets were not used in agamemnons time but that leather caps with boars tusks were in fashion while again as we shall see he is said to know nothing about heroic costume cf the doloneia as a fact he has to describe an incident which occurs nowhere else in homer though it may often have occurred in practicea hurried council during a demoralised night and the hasty arraying of two spies who wish to be lightfooted and inconspicuous the authors evidence as to the leather cap and its garnishing of boars tusks testifies to a survival of such gear in an age of bronze battlehelmets not to his own minute antiquarian research     greaves   bronze greaves are not found so far in mycenaean tombs in greece and reichel argued that the original homer knew none the greaves greek kunmides were gaiters of stuff or leather the one mention of bronze greaves is stuff and nonsense interpolated vii 41 but why did men who were interpolating bronze corslets freely introduce bronze so seldom if at all as the material of greaves  bronze greaves however have been found in a cypromycenaean grave at enkomi tomb xv accompanied by an early type of bronze dagger while bronze greaves adorned with mycenaean ornament are discovered in the balkan peninsula at glassinavç footnote evans journal of the anthropological institute pp 214 215 figs 10 11 thus all homers description of arms is here corroborated by archaeology and cannot be cut out by what mr evans calls the procrustean method of dr reichel  a curious feature about the spear may be noticed in book x while the men of diomede slept their spears were driven into the ground erect on the spikes of the butts x 153 aristotle mentions that this was still the usage of the illyrians in his day footnote poctica 25 though the word for the spike in the butt sauroter does not elsewhere occur in the iliad the practice of sticking the spears erect in the ground during a truce is mentioned in iii 135 they lean upon their shields clearly large high shields and the tall spears are planted by their sides no buttspikes have been found in graves of the mycenaean prime the sauroter was still used or still existed in the days of herodotus footnote tsountas and manatt p 205 ridgeway vol i pp 306 307  on the whole homer does not offer a medley of the military gear of four centuriesthat view we hope to have shown to be a mass of inconsistenciesbut describes a state of military equipment in advance of that of the most famous mycenaean graves but other than that of the late warrior vase he is also very familiar with some uses of iron of which as we shall see scarcely any has been found in mycenaean graves of the central period save in the shape of rings homer never mentions rings of any metal     chapter ix   bronze and iron  taking the iliad and odyssey just as they have reached us they give with the exception of one line an entirely harmonious account of the contemporary uses of bronze and iron bronze is employed in the making of weapons and armour with cups ornaments c iron is employed and bronze is also used in the making of tools and implements such as knives axes adzes axles of a chariot that of hera mortals use an axle tree of oak and the various implements of agricultural and pastoral life meanwhile iron is a substance perfectly familiar to the poets it is far indeed from being a priceless rarity it is impossible to trace homeric stages of advance in knowledge of iron and it yields epithets indicating strength permanence and stubborn endurance these epithets are more frequent in the odyssey and the later books of the iliad than in the earlier books of the iliad but as articles made of iron the odyssey happens to mention only one set of axes which is spoken of ten timesaxes and adzes as a classand iron bonds where iron probably means strong not to be broken footnote in these circumstances it is curious that mr monro should have written thus in homer as is well known iron is rarely mentioned in comparison with bronze but the proportion is greater in the odyssey 25 iron 80 bronze than in the iliad 23 iron 279 bronzemonro odyssey vol ii p 339 these statistics obviously do not prove that at the date of the composition of the odyssey the use of iron was becoming more common or that the use of bronze was becoming more rare than when the iliad was put together bronze is in the poems the military metal the iliad is a military poem while the odyssey is an epic of peace consequently the iliad is much more copious in references to bronze than the odyssey has any occasion to be wives are far more frequently mentioned in the odyssey than in the iliad but nobody will argue that therefore marriage had recently come more into vogue again the method of counting up references to iron in the odyssey is quite misleading when we remember that ten out of the twenty references are only one reference to one and the same set of iron toolsaxes mr monro also proposed to leave six references to iron in the iliad out of the reckoning as all of them are in lines which can be omitted without detriment to the sense most of the six are in a recurrent epic formula descriptive of a wealthy man who possesses iron as well as bronze gold and women the existence of the formula proves familiarity with iron and to excise it merely because it contradicts a theory is purely arbitrarymonro odyssey vol ii p 339 the statement of facts given here is much akin to helbigs account of the uses of bronze and iron in homer footnote helbig das homerischi epos pp 330 331 1887 helbig writes it is notable that in the epic there is much more frequent mention of iron implements than of iron weapons of war he then gives examples which we produce later and especially remarks on what achilles says when he offers a mass of iron as a prize in the funeral games of patroclus the iron says achilles will serve for the purposes of the ploughman and shepherd a surprising speech from the son of peleus from whom we rather expect an allusion to the military uses of the metal of course if iron weapons were not in vogue while iron was the metal for tools and implements the words of achilles are appropriate and intelligible  the facts being as we and helbig agree in stating them we suppose that the homeric poets sing of the usages of their own time it is an age when iron though quite familiar is not yet employed for armour or for swords or spears which must be of excellent temper without great weight in proportion to their length and size iron is only employed in homer for some knives which are never said to be used in battle not even for dealing the final stab like the mediaeval poniard the miséricorde for axes which have a short cutting edge and may be thick and weighty behind the edge and for the rough implements of the shepherd and ploughman such as tips of ploughshares of goads and so forth  as far as archaeological excavations and discoveries enlighten us these relative uses of bronze and iron did not exist in the ages of mycenaean culture which are represented in the tholos of vaphio and the graves earlier and later of mycenae even in the later mycenaean graves iron is found only in the form of finger rings iron rings were common in late greece footnote tsountas and manatt pp 72 146 165 iron was scarce in the cypro mycenaean graves of enkomi a small knife with a carved handle had left traces of an iron blade a couple of lumps of iron one of them apparently the head of a club were found in schliemanns burned city at hissarlik for the rest swords spearheads knives and axes are all of bronze in the age called mycenaean but we do not know whether iron implements may not yet be found in the sepulchres of thetes and other poor and landless men the latest discoveries in minoan graves in crete exhibit tools of bronze  iron we repeat is in the poems a perfectly familiar metal ownership of bronze gold and iron which requires much labour in the smithying or smelting appears regularly in the recurrent epic formula for describing a man of wealth footnote iliad vi 48 ix 365366 x 379 xi 133 odyssey xiv 324 xxi 10 iron bronze slaves and hides are bartered for seaborne wine at the siege of troy footnote iliad vii 472475 athene disguised as mentes is carrying a cargo of iron to temesa tamasus in cyprus to barter for copper the poets are certainly not describing an age in which only a man of wealth might indulge in the rare and extravagant luxury of an iron ring iron was a common commodity like cattle hides slaves bronze and other such matters common as it was homer never once mentions its use for defensive armour or for swords and spears  only in two cases does homer describe any weapon as of iron there is to be sure the iron the knife with which antilochus fears achilles will cut his own throat footnote iliad xviii 34 but no knife is ever used as a weapon of war knives are employed in cutting the throats of victims see iliad iii 271 and xxiii 30 the knife is said to be of iron in this last passage also patroclus uses the knife to cut the arrowhead out of the flesh of a wounded friend footnote iliad xi 844 it is the knife of achilles that is called the iron and on the iron perish the cattle in iliad xxiii 30 mr leaf says that by the usual use the metal iron is confined to tools of small size footnote leaf iliad xxiii 30 note this is incorrect the odyssey speaks of great axes habitually made of iron footnote odyssey ix 391 but we do find a knife of bronze that of agamemnon used in sacrificing victims at least so i infer from iliad iii 271292  the only two specimens of weapons named by homer as of iron are one arrowhead used by pandarus footnote iliad iv 123 and one mace borne before nestors time by areithöus to fight with an iron mace was an amiable and apparently unique eccentricity of areithbus and caused his death on account of his peculiar practice he was named the mace man footnote iliad vii 141 the case is mentioned by nestor as curious and unusual   mr leaf gets rid of this solitary iron casse tête in a pleasant way since he wrote his companion to the iliad 1902 he has become converted as we saw to the theory demolished by mr monro nutzhorn and grote and denounced by blass that the origin of our homer is a text edited by some literary retainer of pisistratus of athens about 560540 bc the editor arranged current lays altered freely and wrote in as much as he pleased probably he wrote this passage in which nestor describes the man of the iron mace for the tales of nestors youthful exploits all of which bear the mark of late work are introduced with no special applicability to the context but rather with the intention of glorifying the ancestor of pisistratus footnote iliad 1900 vii 149 note if pisistratus was pleased with the ancestral portrait nobody has a right to interfere but we need hardly linger over this hypothesis cf pp 281288   iron axes are offered as prizes by achilles footnote iliad xxiii 850 and we have the iron axes of odysseus who shot an arrow through the apertures in the blades at the close of the odyssey but all these axes as we shall show were not weapons but peaceful implements   as a matter of certain fact the swords and spears of homers warriors are invariably said by the poet to be of bronze not of iron in cases where the metal of the weapons is specified  except for an arrowhead to which we shall return and the one iron mace noted as an eccentricity no weapon in homer is ever said to be of iron  the richest men use swords of bronze not one chooses to indulge in a sword said to be of iron the god hephaestus makes a bronze sword for achilles whose own bronze sword was lent to patroclus and lost by him to hector footnote iliad xvi 136 xix 372373 this bronze sword at least achilles uses after receiving the divine armour of the god the sword of paris is of bronze as is the sword of odysseus in the odyssey footnote iliad iii 334335 bronze is the sword which he brought from troy and bronze is the sword presented to him by euryalus in phaeacia and bronze is the spear with which he fought under the walls of ilios footnote odyssey x 162 261262 there are other examples of bronze swords while spears are invariably said to be of bronze when the metal of the spear is specified  here we are on the ground of solid certainty we see that the homeric warrior has regularly spear and sword of bronze if any man used a spear or sword of iron homer never once mentions the fact if the poets in an age of iron weapons always spoke of bronze out of deference to tradition they must have puzzled their ironusing military patrons  thus as regards weapons the homeric heroes are in the age of bronze like them who slept in the tombs of the mycenaean age when homer speaks of the use of cutting instruments of iron he is always concerned except in the two cases given not with blank space but with implements which really were of iron the wheelwright fells a tree with the iron that is with an axe antilochus fears that achilles will cut his own throat with the iron that is with his knife a thing never used in battle the cattle struggle when slain with the iron that is the butchers knife and odysseus shoots through the iron that is through the holes in the blade of the iron axes footnote for this peculiar kind of mycenaean axe with holes in the blade see the design of a bronze example from vaphio in tsountas and manatt the mycenaean age p 207 fig 94 thus homer never says that this or that was done with the iron in the case of any but one weapon of war pandarus drew the bowstring to his breast and to the bow footnote iliad w 123 whoever wrote that line was writing in an age we may think when arrowheads were commonly of iron but in homer when the metal of the arrowhead is mentioned except in this one case it is always bronze the iron arrowtip of pandarus was of an early type the shaft did not run into the socket of the arrowhead the tang of the arrowhead on the other hand entered the shaft and was whipped on with sinew iliad iv 151 pretty primitive this method still the iron is an advance on the uniform bronze of homer the line about pandarus and the iron arrowhead may really be early enough for the arrowhead is of a primitive kindsocketlessand primitive is the attitude of the archer he drew the arrow to his breast on the mycenaean silver bowl representing a siege the archers draw to the breast in the primitive style as does the archer on the bronze dagger with a representation of a lion hunt the assyrians and khita drew to the ear as the monuments prove and so does the cypromycenaean archer of the ivory draughtbox from enkomi footnote evans journal of the anthropological institute vol xxx p 210 in these circumstances we cannot deny that the poet may have known iron arrowheads  we now take the case of axes we never hear from homer of the use of an iron axe in battle and warlike use of an axe only occurs twice in iliad xv 711 in a battle at and on the ships they were fighting with sharp axes and battleaxes greek text axinai and with great swords and spears armed at butt and tip at and on the ships men would set hand to whatever tool of cutting edge was accessible seiler thinks that only the trojans used the battleaxe perhaps for damaging the ships he follows the scholiast greek text axinae however footnote iliad xiii 611 may perhaps be rendered battleaxe as a trojan peisandros fights with an greek text axinae and this is the only place in the iliad except xv 711 where the thing is said to be used as a weapon but it is not an iron axe it is of fine bronze only one bronze battleaxe according to dr joseph anderson is known to have been found in scotland though there are many bronze heads of axes which were tools  axes greek text pelekeis were implements tools of the carpenter woodcutter shipwright and so on they were not weapons of war of the achaeans  as implements they are with very rare exceptions of iron the wheelwright fells trees with the gleaming iron iron being a synonym for axe and for knife footnote iliad iv 485 in iliad xiii 391 the shipwrights cut timber with axes in iliad xxiii 114 woodcutters axes are employed in treefelling but the results are said to be produced greek text tanaaekei chalcho by the longedged bronze where the word greek text tanaaekaes is borrowed from the usual epithet of swords the long edge is quite inappropriate to a woodcutters axe on calypsos isle calypso gives to odysseus a bronze axe for his raftmaking butchers work is done with an axe footnote iliad xvii 520 odyssey iii 442449 the axes offered by achilles as a prize for archers and the axes through which odysseus shot are implements of iron footnote iliad xxiii 850 odyssey xxi 3 81 97  in the odyssey when the poet describes the process of tempering iron we read as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in chill water for thus men temper iron footnote odyssey ix 391393 he is not using iron to make a sword or spear but a tooladze or axe the poet is perfectly consistent there are also examples both of bronze axes and apparently of bronze knives thus though the woodcutters or carpenters axe is of bronze in two passages cited iron is the usual material of the axe or adze again we saw when achilles gives a mass of iron as a prize in the games he does not mean the armourer to fashion it into sword or spear but says that it will serve the shepherd or ploughman for domestic implements footnote leaf iliad 1902 xxiii line 30 note so that the men need not on an upland farm go to the city for iron implements in commenting upon this mr leaf is scarcely at the proper point of view he says footnote iliad xxiii 835 note the idea of a state of things when the ploughman and shepherd forge their own tools from a lump of raw iron has a suspicious appearance of a deliberate attempt to represent from the inner consciousness an archaic state of civilisation in homeric times the greek chalceus is already specialised as a worker in metals however homer does not say that the ploughman and shepherd forge their own tools a homeric chief far from a town would have his own smithy just as the laird of runraurie now urrard had his smithy at the time of the battle of killicrankie 1689 mackays forces left their impedimenta at the lairds smithy says an eyewitness footnote napiers life of dundee iii p 724  the idea of a late homeric poet trying to reconstruct from his fancy a prehistoric state of civilisation is out of the question even historical novelists of the eighteenth century ad scarcely attempted such an effort  this was the regular state of things in the highlands during the eighteenth century when many chiefs and most of the clans lived far from any town but these rural smiths did not make sword blades which prince charles as late as 1750 bought on the continent the andrea ferraramarked broadsword blades of the clans were of foreign manufacture the highland smiths did such rough iron work as was needed for rural purposes perhaps the homeric chief may have sometimes been a craftsman like the heroes of the sagas great swordsmiths odysseus himself notably an excellent carpenter may have been as good a swordsmith but every hero was not so accomplished  in searching with microscopes for homeric discrepancies and interpolations critics are apt to forget the ways of old rural society  the homeric poems whether composed in one age or throughout five centuries are thus entirely uniform in allotting bronze as the material for all sorts of warlike gear down to the solitary battleaxe mentioned and iron as the usual metal for heavy tools knives carpenters axes adzes and agricultural implements with the rare exceptions which we have cited in the case of bronze knives and axes either this distinctioniron for tools and implements bronze for armour swords and spearsprevailed throughout the period of the homeric poets or poet or the poets invented such a stage of culture or poets some centuries later deliberately kept bronze for weapons only while introducing iron for implements in that case they were showing archaeological conscientiousness in following the presumed earlier poets of the bronze age the age of the mycenaean graves  now early poets are never studious archaeologists examining the blank space certainly based on old lays and legends which survive in the edda we find that the poets of the nibelungenlied introduce chivalrous and christian manners they do not archaeologise the poets of the french chansons de geste eleventh to thirteenth centuries bring their own weapons and even armorial bearings into the remote age of charlemagne which they know from legends and cantilènes again the later remanieurs of the earliest chansons de geste modernise the details of these poems but per impossibile and for the sake of argument suppose that the later interpolators and continuators of the homeric lays were antiquarian precisians or on the other hand deliberately attempted to reproduce from their inner consciousness an archaic state of civilisation suppose that though they lived in an age of iron weapons they knew as hesiod knew that the old heroes had warlike gear of bronze and ploughed with bronze and there was no black iron footnote hesiod works and days pp 250 251 in that case why did the later interpolating poets introduce iron as the special material of tools and implements knives and axes in an age when they knew that there was no iron savants such as by this theory the later poets of the fullblown age of iron were they must have known that the knives and axes of the old heroes were made of bronze in old votive offerings in temples and in any mycenaean graves which might be opened the learned poets of 800600 bc saw with their eyes knives and axes of bronze footnote early age of greece i 413416 the knife of agamemnon greek machaira which hangs from his girdle beside his sword footnote iliad iii 271 xix 252 corresponds to the knives found in grave iv at mycenae the handles of these dirks have a ring for suspension footnote tsountas and manatt p 204 but these knives in mycenaean graves are of bronze and of bronze are the axes in the mycenaean deposits and the dagger of enkomi footnote ibid pp 145 207 208 256 evans journal of the anthropological institute vol xxx p 214  why then did the late poetic interpolators who knew that the spears and swords of the old warriors were of bronze and who describe them as of bronze not know that their knives and axes were also of bronze why did they describe the old knives and axes as of iron while hesiod knew and could have told themdid tell them in factthat they were of bronze clearly the theory that homeric poets were archaeological precisians is impossible they describe arms as of bronze tools usually as of iron because they see them to be such in practice  the poems in fact depict a very extraordinary condition of affairs such as no poets could invent and adhere to with uniformity we are accustomed in archaeology to seeing the bronze sword pass by a gradual transition into the iron sword but in homer people with abundance of iron never in any one specified case use iron sword blades or spears the greatest chiefs men said to be rich in gold and iron always use swords and spears of bronze in iliad and odyssey  the usual process of transition from bronze to iron swords in a prehistoric european age is traced by mr ridgeway at hallstatt in the heart of the austrian alps where a thousand old graves have been explored the swords pass from bronze to iron with bronze hilts and finally are wholly of iron weapons of bronze are fitted with iron edges axes of iron were much more common than axes of bronze footnote early age of greece i 413416 the axes were fashioned in the old shapes of the age of bronze were not of the bipennis mycenaean modelthe double axenor of the shape of the letter d very thick with two round apertures in the blade like the bronze axe of vaphio footnote monro odyssey vol ii 176 probably the axes through which odysseus shot an arrow were of this kind as mr monro and much earlier mr butcher and i have argued footnote ibid 1901 vol ii book xix line 572 note butcher and lang odyssey appendix 1891  at hallstatt there was the normal evolution from bronze swords and axes to iron swords and axes why then had homers men in his time not made this step seeing that they were familiar with the use of iron why do they use bronze for swords and spears iron for tools the obvious answer is that they could temper bronze for military purposes much better than they could temper iron now mr ridgeway quotes polybius ii 30 ii 33 for the truly execrable quality of the iron of the celtic invaders of italy as late as 225 bc their swords were as bad as or worse than british bayonets they always doubled up their long iron swords were easily bent and could only give one downward stroke with any effect but after this the edges got so turned and the blades so bent that unless they had time to straighten them with the foot against the ground they could not deliver a second blow footnote early age of greece vol i 408 if the heroes in homers time possessed iron as badly tempered as that of the celts of 225 bc they had every reason to prefer as they did excellent bronze for all their military weapons while reserving iron for pacific purposes a woodcutters axe might have any amount of weight and thickness of iron behind the edge not so a sword blade or a spear point footnote monsieur salomon reinach suggests to me that the story of polybius may be a myth swords and spearheads in graves are often found doubled up possibly they are thus made dead like the owner and their spirits are thus set free to be of use to his spirit finding doubled up iron swords in celtic graves the romans m beinach suggests may have explained their useless condition by the theory that they doubled up in battle leaving their owners easy victims and this myth was accepted as fact by polybius but he was not addicted to myth nor very remote from the events which he chronicles again though bronze graveweapons in our museum are often doubled up the myth is not told of the warriors of the age of bronze we later give examples of the doubling up in battle of scandinavian iron swords as late as 1000 ad  in the iliad we hear of swords breaking at the hilt in dealing a stroke at shield or helmet a thing most incident to bronze swords especially of the early type with a thin bronze tang inserted in a hilt of wood ivory or amber or with a slight shelf of the bronze hilt riveted with three nails on to the bronze blade  lycaon struck peneleos on the socket of his helmet crest and his sword brake at the hilt footnote iliad xvi 339 the sword of menelaus broke into three or four pieces when he smote the helmet ridge of paris footnote iliad iii 349 380 iron of the celtic sort described by polybius would have bent not broken there is no doubt on that head if polybius is not romancing the celtic sword of 225 bc doubled up at every stroke like a piece of hoop iron but mr leaf tells us that by primitive modes of smelting iron is made hard and brittle like cast iron if so it would be even less trustworthy for a sword than bronze footnote iliad 1900 book vi line 48 note perhaps the celts of 225 bc did not smelt iron by primitive methods but discovered some process for making it not hard and brittle but flabby  the swords of the mycenaean graves we know were all of bronze and in three intaglios on rings from the graves the point not the edge is used footnote tsountas and manatt p 199 once against a lion once over the rim of a shield which covers the whole body of an enemy and once at too close quarters to permit the use of the edge it does not follow from these three cases as critics argue that no bronze sword could be used for a swashing blow and there are just half as many thrusts as strokes with the bronze sword in the iliad footnote twentyfour cuts to eleven lunges in the iliad as the poet constantly dwells on the long edge of the bronze swords and makes heroes use both point and edge how can we argue that homeric swords were of iron and ill fitted to give point the highlanders at clifton 1746 were obliged contrary to their common practice to use the point against cumberlands dragoons they like the achaeans had heavy cut and thrust swords but theirs were of steel  if the achaeans had thoroughly excellent bronze and had iron as bad as that of the celts a thousand years later their preference for bronze over iron for weapons is explained in homer the fighters do not very often come to sword strokes they fight mainly with the spear except in pursuit now and then but when they do strike they cleave heads and cut off arms they could not do this with bronze rapiers such as those with which men give point over the rim of the shield on two mycenaean gems but mr myres writes from the shaft graves of mycenae onwards there are two types of swords in the mycenaean worldone an exaggerated dagger riveted into the front end of the hilt the other with a flat flanged tang running the whole length of the hilt and covered on either face by ornamental grip plates riveted on this sword though still of bronze can deal a very effective cut and as the mycenaeans had no armour for body or head  the danger of breaking or bending the sword on a cuirass or helmet did not arise footnote classical review xvi 72 the danger did exist in homers time as we have seen but a bronze sword published by tsountas and manatt mycenaean age p 199 fig 88 is emphatically meant to give both point and edge having a solid handlea continuation of the bladeand a very broad blade coming to a very fine point even in grave v at mycenae we have a sword blade so massive at the top that it was certainly capable of a swashing blow footnote schuchardt schliemanns excavations p 265 fig 269 the sword of the charioteer on the stêlê of grave v is equally good for cut and thrust a pleasanter cut and thrust bronze sword than the one found at ialysus no gentleman could wish to handle footnote furtwängler und loeschke myk va taf d homer in any case says that his heroes used bronze swords well adapted to strike if his age had really good bronze and iron as bad as that of the celts of polybius a thousand years later their preference of bronze over iron for weapons needs no explanation if their iron was not so bad as that of the celts their military conservatism might retain bronze for weapons while in civil life they often used iron for implements  the uniform evidence of the homeric poems can only be explained on the supposition that men had plenty of iron but while they used it for implements did not yet with a natural conservatism trust life and victory to iron spears and swords unluckily we cannot test the temper of the earliest known iron swords found in greece for rust hath consumed them and i know not that the temper of the mycenaean bronze swords has been tested against helmets of bronze i can thus give no evidence from experiment  there is just one line in homer which disregards the distinction iron for implements bronze for weapons it is in odyssey xvi 294 xix 13 telemachus is told to remove the warlike harness of odysseus from the hall lest the wooers use it in the coming fray he is to explain the removal by saying that it has been done lest you fall to strife in your cups and harm each other and shame the feast and this wooing for iron of himself draweth a man to him the proverb is manifestly of an age when iron was almost universally used for weapons and thus was as in thucydides synonymous with all warlike gear but throughout the poems no single article of warlike gear is of iron except one eccentric mace and one arrowhead of primitive type the line in the odyssey must therefore be a very late addition it may be removed without injuring the sense of the passage in which it occurs footnote this fact in itself is of course no proof of interpolation cf helbig op cit p 331 he thinks the line very late if on the other hand the line be as old as the oldest parts of the poem the author for once forgets his usual antiquarian precision  we are thus led to the conclusion that either there was in early greece an age when weapons were all of bronze while implements were often of iron or that the poet or crowd of poets invented that state of things now early poets never invent in this way singing to an audience of warriors critical on such a point they speak of what the warriors know to be actual except when in a recognised form of decorative exaggeration they introduce  masts of the beaten gold  and sails of taffetie  our theory is then that in the age when the homeric poems were composed iron though well known was on its probation men of the sword preferred bronze for all their military purposes just as fifteenthcentury soldiers found the longbow and crossbow much more effective than guns or as the duke of wellington forbade the arming of all our men with rifles in place of muskets  for reasons not devoid of plausibility  sir john evans supposes that in the seventh century the carian and ionian invaders of egypt were still using offensive arms of bronze not of iron footnote ancient bronze implements p 8 1881 citing herodotus ii c 112 sir john is not sure that achaean spearheads were not of copper for they twice double up against a shield iliad iii 348 vii 259 evans p 13 sir john remarks that for a considerable time after the homeric period bronze remained in use for offensive weapons especially for spears lances and arrows hesiod quite unlike his contemporaries the later poets of iliad and odyssey gives to heracles an iron helmet and sword footnote scutum herculis pp 122138 hesiod knew better but was not a consistent archaiser sir john thinks that as early as 500 or even 600 bc iron and steel were in common use for weapons in greece but not yet had they altogether superseded bronze battleaxes and spears footnote evans p 18 by sir johns showing iron for offensive weapons superseded bronze very slowly indeed in greece and if my argument be correct it had not done so when the homeric poems were composed iron merely served for utensils and the poems reflect that stage of transition which no poet could dream of inventing  these pages had been written before my attention was directed to m bérards book les pheniciens et lodyssée paris 1902 m bérard has anticipated and rather outrun my ideas i might almost say he remarks that iron is the popular metal native and rustic the shepherd and ploughman can extract and work it without going to the town the chiefs smith could work iron if he had iron to work and this iron achilles gave as a prize with rustic methods of working it iron is always impure it has straws in it and is brittle it may be the metal for peace and for implements in our fields we see the reaper sit down and repair his sickle in war is needed a metal less hard perhaps but more tough and not so easily broken you cannot sit down in the field of battle as in a field of barley to beat your sword straight footnote bérard i 435  so the celts found if we believe polybius  on the other hand iron swords did supersede bronze swords in the long run apparently they had not done so in the age of the poet but iron had certainly ceased to be a precious metal knives and woodcutters axes are never made of a metal that is precious and rare i am thus led on a general view to suppose that the poems took shape when iron was very well known but was not yet as in the dipylon period in crete commonly used by swordsmiths  the ideas here stated are not unlike those of paul cauer footnote grundfrager des homerkritik pp 183187 leipsic 1895 i do not however find the mentions of iron useful as a test of early and late lays which it is his theory that they are thus he says  1 iron is often mentioned as part of a mans personal property while we are not told how he means to use it it is named with bronze gold and girls the poet has no definite picture before his eyes he is vague about iron but we reply his picture of iron in these passages is neither more nor less definite than his mental picture of the other commodities he calls iron hard to smithy grey darkhued he knows in fact all about it he does not tell us what the owner is going to do with the gold and the bronze and the girls any more than he tells us what is to be done with the iron such information was rather in the nature of a luxury than a necessity every hearer knew the uses of all four commodities this does not seem to have occurred to cauer  2 iron is spoken of as an emblem of hard things as to take a modern example in mr swinburnes armed and iron maidenhood  said of atalanta hearts are iron strength is iron flesh is not iron an iron noise goes up to the heaven of bronze it may not follow cauer thinks from these phrases that iron was used in any way men are supposed to marvel at its strange properties it was new and rare i see no ground for this inference  3 we have the iron gates of tartarus and the iron bonds in which odysseus was possibly lying it does not follow that chains or gates were made of iron any more than that gates were of chrysoprase in the days of st john  4 next we have mention of implements not weapons of irona remarkable trait of culture greek ploughs and axes were made of iron before spears and swords were of iron  5 we have mention of iron weapons namely the unique iron mace of areithous and the solitary iron arrowhead of pandarus and what cauer calls the iron swords more probably knives of achilles and others it is objected to the iron of achilles that antilochus fears he will cut his throat with it on hearing of the death of patroclus while there is no other mention of suicide in the iliad it does not follow that suicide was unheard of indeed achilles may be thinking of suicide presently in xiii 98 when he says to his mother let me die at once since it was not my lot to succour my comrade  6 we have the ironmaking spoken of in book ix 393 of the odyssey  it does not appear to us that the use of iron as an epithet bespeaks an age when iron was a mysterious thing known mainly by reputation a costly possession the epithets iron strength and so on may as readily be used in our own age or any other if iron were at first a precious metal it is odd that homeric men first used it as cauer sees that they did to make points to ploughshares and tools of agriculture and handiwork then people took to working iron for weapons just so but we cannot divide the iliad into earlier and later portions in proportion to the various mentions of iron in various books these statistics are of no value for separatist purposes it is impossible to believe that men when they spoke of iron strength iron hearts grey iron iron hard to smithy did so because iron was first an almost unknown legendary mineral next a precious metal then the metal of drudgery and finally the metal of weapons  the real point of interest is as cauer sees that domestic preceded military uses of iron among the achaeans he seems however to think that the confinement of the use of bronze to weapons is a matter of traditional style footnote nur die sprache der dichter hielt an dem gebrauch der bronze fest die in den jahrhunderten während deren der epische stil erwachsen war allein geherrscht hatte but in the early days of the waxing epics tools as well as weapons were as in homer they occasionally are of bronze why then do the supposed late continuators represent tools not weapons as of iron why do they not cleave to the traditional termbronzein the case of tools as the same men do in the case of weapons  helbig offers an apparently untenable explanation of this fact he has proposed an interpretation of the uses of bronze and iron in the poems entirely different from that which i offer footnote sur la question mycénienne 1896 unfortunately one can scarcely criticise his theory without entering again into the whole question of the construction of the epics he thinks that the origin of the poems dates from the mycenaean period and that the later continuators of the poems retained the traditions of that remote age thus they thrice call mycenae golden though in the changed economic conditions of their own period mycenae could no longer be golden and i presume that if possible the city would have issued a papyrus currency without a metallic basis however this may be in the description of customs the epic poets did their best to avoid everything modern here we have again that unprecedented phenomenonearly poets who are archaeologically precise  we have first to suppose that the kernel of the iliad originated in the mycenaean age the age of bronze we are next to believe that this kernel was expanded into the actual epic in later and changed times but that the later poets adhered in their descriptions to the mycenaean standard avoiding everything modern that poets of an uncritical period when treating of the themes of ancient legend or song carefully avoid everything modern is an opinion not warranted by the usage of the authors of the chansons de geste of beowulf and of the nibelungenlied these poets we must repeat invariably introduce in their chants concerning ancient days the customs costume armour religion and weapons of their own time dr helbig supposes that the late greek poets however who added to the iliad carefully avoided doing what other poets of uncritical ages have always done footnote la question mycénienne p 50  this is his position in his text p 50 in his note 1 to page 50 however he occupies the precisely contrary position the epic poems were chanted as a rule in the houses of more or less warlike chiefs it is then à priori probable that the later poets took into account the contemporary military state of things their audience would have been much perturbed bien chequés if they had heard the poet mention nothing but arms and forms of attack and defence to which they were unaccustomed if so when iron weapons came in the poets would substitute iron for bronze in lays new and old but they never do however this is helbigs opinion in his note but in his text he says that the poets carefully avoiding the contemporary the modern make the heroes fight not on horseback but from chariots their listeners according to his note must have been bien chequés for there came a time when they were not accustomed to war chariots  thus the poets who in dr helbigs text avoid as far as possible all that is modern in his note on the same page take account of the contemporary state of things and are as modern as possible where weapons are concerned their audience would be sadly put out bien chequés if they heard talk only of arms  to which they were unaccustomed talk of large suspended shields of uncorsleted heroes and of bronze weapons they had to endure it whether they liked it or not teste reichel dr helbig seems to speak correctly in his note in his text his contradictory opinion appears to be wrong experience teaches us that the poets of an uncritical ageshakespeare for example introduce the weapons of their own period into works dealing with remote ages hamlet uses the elizabethan rapier  in his argument on bronze and iron unluckily dr helbig deserts the judicious opinions of his note for the opposite theory of his text his late poets in the age of iron always say that the weapons of the heroes are made of bronze footnote op laud p 51 they thus as far as possible avoid what is modern but of course warriors of the age of iron when they heard the poet talk only of weapons of bronze aurient été bien choqués as dr helbig truly says in his note on hearing of nothing but armes auxquels ils nétaient pas habituésarms always of bronze  though dr helbig in his text is of the opposite opinion i must agree entirely with the view which he states so clearly in his note it follows that if a poet speaks invariably of weapons of bronze he is living in an age when weapons are made of no other material in his text however dr helbig maintains that the poets of later ages as far as possible avoid everything modern and therefore mention none but bronze weapons but as he has pointed out they do mention iron tools and implements why do they desert the traditional bronze because it occasionally happened that a poet when thinking of an entirely new subject wholly emancipated himself from traditional forms footnote op laud pp 51 52  the examples given in proof are the offer by achilles of a lump of iron as the prize for archerythe iron as we saw being destined for the manufacture of pastoral and agricultural implements in which dr helbig includes the lances of shepherds and ploughmen though the poet never says that they were of iron footnote iliad xxiii 826 835 odyssey xiv 531 xiii 225 there are also the axes through which odysseus shoots his arrow footnote odyssey xix 587 xxi 3 x 97 114 127 138 xxiv 168 177 cf xxi 61 the poet here treated an entirely new subject in the development of which he had perfect liberty so he speaks freely of iron but we exclaim tools and implements axes and knives are not a perfectly new subject they were extremely familiar to the age of bronze the mycenaean age examples of bronze tools arrowheads and implements are discovered in excavations on mycenaean sites there was nothing new about bronze tools and implements men had bronze tips to their ploughshares bronze knives bronze axes bronze arrowheads before they used iron  perhaps we are to understand that feats of archery nonmilitary contests in bowmanship are un sujet à fait nouveau a theme so very modern that a poet in singing of it could let himself go and dare to speak of iron implements but where was the novelty all peoples who use the bow in war practise archery in time of peace the poet moreover speaks of bronze tools axes and knives in other parts of the iliad neither tools nor bronze tools constitute un sujet tout à fait nouveau there was nothing new in shooting with a bow and nothing new in the existence of axes bows and axes were as familiar to the age of stone and to the age of bronze as to the age of iron dr helbigs explanation therefore explains nothing and unless a better explanation is offered we return to the theory rejected by dr helbig that implements and tools were often not always of iron while weapons were of bronze in the age of the poet dr helbig rejects this opinion he writes we cannot in any way admit that at a period when the socks of the plough the lance points of shepherds which the poet never describes as of iron and axe heads were of iron warriors still used weapons of bronze footnote op laud p 53 but it is logically possible to admit that this was the real state of affairs while it is logically impossible to admit that bows and tools were new subjects and that late poets when they sang of military gear tenaient compte de larmement contemporain carefully avoiding the peril of bewildering their hearers by speaking of antiquated arms and at the same time spoke of nothing but antiquated armsweapons of bronzeand of war chariots to fighting men who did not use war chariots and did use weapons of iron  these logical contradictions beset all arguments in which it is maintained that the late poets are anxious archaisers and at the same time are eagerly introducing the armour and equipment of their own age the critics are in the same quandary as to iron and bronze as traps them in the case of large shields small bucklers greaves and corslets they are obliged to assign contradictory attitudes to their late poets it does not seem possible to admit that a poet who often describes axes as of iron in various passages does so in his account of a peaceful contest in bowmanship because contests in bowmanship are un sujet tout à fait nouveau and so he feels at liberty to describe axes as of iron while he adheres to bronze as the metal for weapons he or one of the odyssean poets had already asserted odyssey ix 391 that iron was the metal for adzes and axes  dr helbigs argument footnote la question mycénienne p 54 does not explain the facts the bow of eurytus and the uses to which odysseus is to put it have been in the poets mind all through the conduct of his plot and there is nothing to suggest that the exploit of bowmanship is a very new lay tacked on to the odyssey  after writing this chapter i observed that my opinion had been anticipated by s h naber footnote quaestiones homericae p 60 amsterdam van der post 1897 quod herodoti diserto testimonio novimus homeri restate ferruminatio nondum inventa erat necdum bene noverant mortales uti opinor acuere ferrum hinc pauperes homines ubi possunt ferro utuntur sed in plerisque rebus turn domi turn militiae imprimis coguntur uti aere  the theory of mr ridgeway as to the relative uses of iron and bronze is not by myself very easily to be understood the homeric warrior  has regularly as we have seen spear and sword of iron footnote early age of greece vol i p 301 as no spear or sword of iron is ever mentioned in the iliad or odyssey as both weapons are always of bronze when the metal is specified i have not seen that they are regularly or ever of iron in proof mr ridgeway cites the axes and knives already mentionedwhich are not spears or swords and are sometimes of bronze he also quotes the line in the odyssey iron of itself doth attract a man but if this line is genuine and original it does not apply to the state of things in the iliad while it contradicts the whole odyssey in which swords and spears are always of bronze when their metal is mentioned if the line reveals the true state of things then throughout the odyssey if not throughout the iliad the poets when they invariably speak of bronze swords and spears invariably say what they do not mean if they do this how are we to know when they mean what they say and of what value can their evidence on points of culture be reckoned they may always be retaining traditional terms as to usages and customs in an age when these are obsolete  if the achaeans were as in mr ridgeways theory a northern peopleceltswho conquered with iron weapons a pelasgian bronzeusing mycenaean people it is not credible to me that achaean or pelasgian poets habitually used the traditional pelasgian term for the metal of weapons namely bronze in songs chanted before victors who had won their triumph with iron the traditional phrase of a conquered bronzeusing race could not thus survive and flourish in the poetry of an outlandish ironusing race of conquerors  mr ridgeway cites the odyssey wherein we are told that euryalus the phaeacian presented to odysseus a bronze sword though as we have seen mr ridgeway has seen the usual material for all such weapons is iron but the phoeacians both belonged to the older race and lived in a remote island and therefore swords of bronze may well have continued in use in such outoftheworld places long after iron swords were in use everywhere else in greece the man who could not afford iron had to be satisfied with bronze footnote early age of greece p 305 here the poet is allowed to mean what he says the phaeacian sword is really of bronze with silver studs probably on the hilt odyssey viii 401407 which was of ivory the outoftheworld islanders could afford ivory not iron but when the same poet tells us that the sword which odysseus brought from troy was a great silverstudded bronze sword odyssey x 261 262 then mr ridgeway does not allow the poet to mean what he says the poet is now using an epic formula older than the age of iron swords  that mr ridgeway adopts helbigs theorythe poet says bronze by a survival of the diction of the bronze age when he means ironi infer from the following passage chalkos is the name for the older metal of which cutting weapons were made and it thus lingered in many phrases of the epic dialect to smite with the chalkos was equivalent to our phrase to smite with the steel footnote early age of greece i 295 but we certainly do smite with the steel while the question is did homers men smite with the iron homer says not he does not merely use an epic phrase to smite with the chalkos but he carefully describes swords spears and usually arrowheads as being of bronze chalkos while axes adzes and knives are frequently described by him as of iron  mr ridgeway has an illustrative argument with some one who says the dress and weapons of the saxons given in the lay of beowulf fitted exactly the bronze weapons in england for they had shields and spears and battleaxes and swords if you pointed out to him that the saxon poem spoke of these weapons as made of iron he would say i admit that it is a difficulty but the resemblances are so many that the discrepancies may be jettisoned footnote ridgeway i 83 84  now if the supposed controversialist were a homeric critic he would not admit any difficulty he would say yes in beowulf the weapons are said to be of iron but that is the work of the christian remanieur or bearbeiter who introduced all the christian morality into the old heathen lay and who also not to puzzle his ironusing audience changed the bronze into iron weapons  we may prove anything if we argue now that the poets retain the tradition of obsolete things now that they modernise as much as they please into this method of reasoning after duly considering it i am unable to come with enthusiasm being wedded to the belief that the poets say what they mean were it otherwise did they not mean what they say their evidence would be of no value they might be dealing throughout in terms for things which were unrepresented in their own age to prove this possible it would be necessary to adduce convincing and sufficient examples of early national poets who habitually use the terminology of an age long prior to their own in descriptions of objects customs and usages meanwhile it is obvious that my whole argument has no archaeological support we may find mycenaean corslets and greaves but they are not in cremation burials no homeric cairn with homeric contents has ever been discovered and if we did find examples of homeric cairns it appears from the poems that they would very seldom contain the arms of the dead  nowhere again do we find graves containing bronze swords and iron axes and adzes i know nothing nearer in discoveries to my supposed age of bronze weapons and iron tools than a grave of the early iron and geometrical ornament age of cretea tholos tomb with a bronze spearhead and a set of iron tools among others a double axe and a pick of iron but these were in company with iron swords to myself the crowning mystery is what has become of the homeric tumuli with their contents one can but say that only within the last thirty years have we found or finding have recognised mycenaean burial records as to the badness of the iron of the north for military purposes and the probable badness of all early iron weapons we have testimony two thousand years later than homer and some twelve hundred years later than polybius in the eyrbyggja saga morris and maguússon chap xxiv we read that steinthor was girt with a sword that was cunningly wrought the hilts were white with silver and the grip wrapped round with the same but the strings thereof were gilded this was a splendid sword described with the homeric delight in such things but the battlecry arises and then the fair wrought sword bit not when it smote armour and steinthor must straighten it under his foot messrs morris and maguússon add in a note this is a very common experience in scandinavian weapons and for the first time heard of at the battle of aquae sextiae between marius and the teutons footnote the reference is erroneous in the north weapon smiths who knew how to forge tempered or steellaminated weapons were if not unknown at least very rare when such skill was unknown or rare in homers time nothing was more natural than that bronze should hold its own as the metal for swords and spears after iron was commonly used for axes and ploughshares     chapter x   the homeric house  if the homeric poems be as we maintain the work of a peculiar age the homeric house will also in all likelihood be peculiar it will not be the hellenic house of classical times manifestly the dwelling of a militaryprince in the heroic age would be evolved to meet his needs which were not the needs of later hellenic citizens in time of peace the later greeks are weaponless men not surrounded by and entertaining throngs of armed retainers like the homeric chief the women of later greece moreover are in the background of life dwelling in the womens chambers behind those of the men in seclusion the homeric women also at least in the house of odysseus have their separate chambers which the men seem not to enter except on invitation though the ladies freely honour by their presence the hall of the warriors the circumstances however were peculiar penelope being unprotected in the absence of her lord  the whole domestic situation in the homeric poemsthe free equality of the women the military conditions the life of the chiefs and retainersclosely resembles allowing for differences of climate that of the rich landowners of early iceland as described in the sagas there can be no doubt that the house of the icelandic chief was analogous to the house of the homeric prince societies remarkably similar in mode of life were accommodated in dwellings similarly arranged though the icelanders owned no overlord and indeed left their native scandinavia to escape the sway of harold fairhair yet each wealthy and powerful chief lived in the manner of a homeric king his lands and thralls horses and cattle occupied his attention when he did not chance to be on viking adventure bearing bane to alien men he always carried sword and spear and often had occasion to use them he entertained many guests and needed a large hall and ample sleeping accommodation for strangers and servants his women were as free and as much respected as the ladies in homer and for a husband to slap a wife was to run the risk of her deadly feud thus far away in the frosts of the north the life of the chief was like that of the homeric prince and their houses were alike  it is our intention to use this parallel in the discussion of the homeric house all icelandic chiefs houses in the tenth and eleventh centuries were not precisely uniform in structure and accommodation and saga writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries living more comfortably than their forefathers sometimes confuse matters by introducing the arrangements of their own into the tale of past times but in any case one icelandic house of the tenth or eleventh century might differ from another in certain details it is not safe therefore to argue that difference of detail in homers accounts of various houses means that the varying descriptions were composed in different ages in the odyssey the plot demands that the poet must enter into domestic details much more freely than he ever has occasion to do in the iliad he may mention upper chambers freely for example it will not follow that in the iliad upper chambers do not exist because they are only mentioned twice in that epic  it is even more important to note that in the house of odysseus we have an unparalleled domestic situation the lady of the house is beset by more than a hundred wooerssorning on her in the old scots legal phrasemaking it impossible for her to inhabit her own hall and desirable to keep the women as much as possible apart from the men thus the homeric house of which we know most that of odysseus is a house in a most abnormal condition  for the sake of brevity we omit the old theory that the homeric house was practically that of historical greece with the mens hall approached by a door from the courtyard while a door at the upper end of the mens hall yields direct access to the quarters where the women dwelt apart at the rear of the mens hall  that opinion has not survived the essay by mr j l myres on the plan of the homeric house footnote journal of hellenic studies vol xx 128150 quite apart from arguments that rest on the ground plans of palaces at mycenae and tiryns mr myres has proved by an exact reading of the poets words that the descriptions in the odyssey cannot be made intelligible on the theory that the poet has in his mind a house of the hellenic pattern but in his essay he hardly touches on any homeric house except that of odysseus in which the circumstances were unusual a later critic ferdinand noack has demonstrated that we must take other homeric houses into consideration footnote homerische paläste teubner leipzig 1903 the praemycenaean house is according to mr myres on the whole of the same plan as the hellenic house of historic days between these comes the mycenaean and homeric house so that the mycenaean house stands out as an intrusive phenomenon of comparatively late arrival and short of duration footnote myres journal of hellenic studies vol xx p 149 noack goes further he draws a line between the mycenaean houses on one hand and the houses described by homer on the other while he thinks that the late homeric house that of the closing books of the odyssey is widely sundered from the homeric house of the iliad and from the houses of menelaus and alcinous in earlier books of the odyssey footnote noack p 73  in this case the iliadic and earlier odyssean houses are those of a single definite age neither mycenaean of the prime nor hellenica fact which entirely suits our argument but it is not so certain that the house of odysseus is severed from the other homeric houses by the later addition of an upper storey as noack supposes and of womens quarters and of separate sleeping chambers for the heads of the family  the iliad save in two passages and earlier books of the odyssey may not mention upper storeys because they have no occasion or only rare occasion to do so and some houses may have had upper sleeping chambers while others of the same period had not as we shall prove from the icelandic parallel  mr myress idea of the homeric house or at least of the house of odysseus is that the women had a meguron or common hall apart from that of the men with other chambers these did not lie to the direct rear of the mens hall nor were they entered by a door that opened in the back wall of the mens hall penelope has a chamber in which she sleeps and does womans work upstairs her connubial chamber unoccupied during her lords absence is certainly on the ground floor the womens rooms are severed from the mens hall by a courtyard in the courtyard are chambers telemachus has his greek thalamos or chamber in the mens courtyard all this appears plain from the poets words and mr myres corroborates by the ground plans of the palaces of tiryns and mycenae a point on which mr monro had doubts as regards tiryns while he accepted it for mycenae footnote monro odyssey ii 497 journal of hellenic studies xx 136  noack footnote noack p 39 does not however agree  there appears to be no doubt that in the centre of the great halls of tiryns and of mycenae as of the houses in homer was the hearth with two tall pillars on each side supporting a louvre higher than the rest of the roof and permitting some at least of the smoke of the fire to escape beside the fire were the seats of the master and mistress of the house of the minstrel and of honoured guests the place of honour was not on a dais at the inmost end of the hall like the high table in college halls mr myres holds that in the homeric house the greek prodomos or forehouse was a chamber and was not identical with the greek aethousa or portico though he admits that the two words are used indifferently to describe the sleeping place of a guest footnote journal of hellenic studies xx 144 155 this was the case at tiryns and in the house of the father of phoenix in the iliad the prodomos or forehouse and the aethousa or portico are certainly separate things iliad ix 473 noack does not accept the tiryns evidence for the homeric house  on mr myress showing the women in the house of odysseus had distinct and separate quarters into which no man goes uninvited odysseus when at home has with his wife a separate bedroom and in his absence penelope sleeps upstairs where there are several chambers for various purposes  granting that all this is so how do the pictures of the house given in the final part of the odyssey compare with those in the blank space and with the accounts of the dwellings of menelaus and alcinous in the odyssey noack argues that the house of odysseus is unlike the other homeric houses because in these he reasons the women have no separate quarters and the lord and lady of the house sleep in the great hall and have no other bedroom while there are no upper chambers in the houses of the iliad except in two passages dismissed as late  if all this be so then the homeric period as regards houses and domestic life belongs to an age apart not truly mycenaean and still less later hellenic  it must be remembered that noack regards the odyssey as a composite and in parts very late mosaic a view on which i have said what i think in homer and the epic according to this theory kirchhoff is the exponent of a popular form thereof the first book of the odyssey belongs to the latest stratum and is the copy of the general workerup whether he was the editor employed by pisistratus or a laborious amateur this theory is opposed by sittl who makes his point by cutting out as interpolations whatever passages do not suit his ideas and do suit kirchhoffsthis is the regular method of homeric criticism the whole cruise of telemachus book iv is also regarded as a late addition on this point english scholars hitherto have been of the opposite opinion footnote cf monro odyssey vol ii 313317  the method of all parties is to regard repetitions of phrases as examples of borrowing except of course in the case of the earliest poet from whom the others pilfer and in other cases of praehomeric surviving epic formulae critics then dispute as to which recurrent passage is the earlier deciding of course as may happen to suit their own general theory in our opinion these passages are traditional formulae as in our own old ballads and in the chansons de geste and noack also takes this view every now and then they may well be older in many cases than iliad and odyssey or the poet having found his own formula economically used it wherever similar circumstances occurred such passages so considered are no tests of earlier composition in one place of later composition in another  we now look into noacks theory of the homeric house where do the lord and lady sleep not he says as odysseus and penelope do when odysseus is at home in a separate chamber thalamos on the ground floor nor like gunnar and halgerda njals saga in an upper chamber they sleep mucho domou that is not in a separate recess in the house but in a recess of the great hall or megaron thus in the hall of alcinous the whole space runs from the threshold to the muchos the innermost part odyssey vii 8796 in the hall of odysseus the wooers retreat to the muchos the innermost part of the hall odyssey xxii 270 the muchos in homer never denotes a separate chamber footnote noack p 45 cf monro note to odyssey xxii 270  in odyssey xi 373 alcinous says it is not yet time to sleep ev megaro in the hall alcinous and arete his wife sleep in the recess of the lofty domos that is in the recess of the hall not of the house odyssey vii 346 the same words are used of helen and menelaus odyssey iv 304 but when menelaus goes forth next morning he goes ek thalamoio out of his chamber odyssey iv 310 but this says noack is a mere borrowing of odyssey ii 2 5 where the same words are used of telemachus leaving his chamber which undeniably was a separate chamber in the court eurycleia lighted him thither at night odyssey i 428 in odyssey iv 121 helen enters the hall from her fragrant lofty chamber so she had a chamber not in the hall but says noack this verse is not original the late poet of odyssey iv has cribbed it from the early poet who composed odyssey xix 53 in that passage penelope comes from her chamber like artemis or golden aphrodite penelope had a chamberbeing a lone lorn woman who could not sleep in a hall where the wooers sat up late drinkingand the latest poet transfers this chamber to helen but however late and larcenous he may have been the poet of iv 121 certainly did not crib the words of the poet of xix 53 for he says helen came out of her fragrant highroofed chamber the hall was not precisely fragrant however noack supposes that the late poet of book iv let helen have a chamber apart to lead up to the striking scene of her entry to the hall where her guests are sitting may helen not even have a boudoir in odyssey iv 263 helen speaks remorsefully of having abandoned her chamber and husband and child with paris but the late poet says this according to noack because he finds that he is in for a chamber so to speak at all events as a result of his having previously cribbed the word chamber from odyssey xix 53 otherwise we presume helen would have said that she regretted having left the recess of the lofty hall where she really did sleep footnote noack pp 4748  the merit of this method of arguing may be left to the judgment of the reader who will remark that wedded pairs are not described as leaving the hall when they go to bed they sleep in a recess of the lofty house the innermost part is this the same as the recess of the hall or is it an innermost part of the house who can be certain  the bridal chamber built so cunningly with the trunk of a tree for the support of the bed by odysseus odyssey xxiii 177204 is according to noack an exception a solitary freak of odysseus but we may reply that the thalamos the separate chamber is no freak the freak by knowledge of which odysseus proves his identity is the use of the tree in the construction of the bed blank space was highly original  that separate chambers are needed for grownup children because the parents sleep in the hall is no strong argument if the parents had a separate chamber the young people unless they slept in the hall would still need their own the girls of course could not sleep in the hall and in the absence of both penelope and odysseus from the hall ever since telemachus was a baby telemachus could have slept there but it will be replied that the wooers did not beset the hall and penelope did not retire to a separate chamber till telemachus was a big boy of sixteen noack argues that he had a separate chamber though the hall was free tradition footnote noack p 49  where does noack think that in a normal homeric house the girls of the family slept they could not sleep in the hall and on the two occasions when the iliad has to mention the chambers of the young ladies they are upper chambers as is natural but as noack wants to prove the house of odysseus with its upper chambers to be a late peculiar house he of course expunges the two mentions of girls upper chambers in the odyssey the process is simple and easy  we find iliad xvii 36 that a son wedding in his fathers and mothers lifetime has a thalamos built for him and a muchos in the thalamos where he leaves his wife when he goes to war this dwelling of grownup married children as in the case of the sons of priam has a thalamos or doma and a courtyardis a house in fact iliad vi 3 16 here we seem to distinguish the bedchamber from the doma which is the hall noack objects that when odysseus fumigates his house after slaying the wooers he thus treats the megaron and the doma and the courtyard therefore noack argues the megaron or hall is one thing the doma is another mr monro writes doma usually means megaron and he supposes a slip from another reading thalamon for megaron which is not satisfactory but if doma here be not equivalent to megaron what room can it possibly be who was killed in another place what place therefore needed purification except the hall and courtyard no other places needed purifying there is therefore clearly a defect in the lines which cannot be used in the argument  noack in any case maintains that paris has but one place to live in by day and to sleep in by nighthis greek talamos there he sleeps eats and polishes his weapons and armour there hector finds him looking to his gear helen and the maids are all there iliad vi 321323 is this quite certain are helen and the maids in the greek talamos where paris is polishing his corslet and looking to his bow or in an adjacent room if not in another room why when hector is in the room talking to paris does helen ask him to come in iliad vi 354 he is in is there another room whence she can hear him  the minuteness of these inquiries is tedious  in iliad iii 125 iris finds helen in the hall weaving she summons her to come to priam on the gate helen dresses in outdoor costume and goes forth from the chamber greek talamos iii 141142 are hall and chamber the same room or did not helen dress in the chamber in the same book iii 174 she repents having left the greek talamos of menelaus not his hall the passage is not a repetition in words of her speech in the odyssey  the gods of course are lodged like men when we find that zeus has really a separate sleeping chamber built by hephaestus as odysseus has iliad xiv 166167 we are told that this is a late interpolation mr leaf who has a high opinion of this scene the beguiling of zeus places it in the second expansions he finds no late odyssean elements in the language in iliad i 608611 zeus departed to his couch he seems not to have stayed and slept in the hall  here a quaint problem occurs of all late things in the odyssey the latest is said to be the song of demodocus about the loves of ares and aphrodite in the house of hephaestus footnote odyssey viii 266300 we shall show that this opinion is far from certainly correct hephaestus sets a snare round the bed in his greek talamos and catches the guilty lovers now was his greek talamos or bedroom also his diningroom if so the author of the song though so late knows what noack knows and what the poets who assign sleeping chambers to wedded folks do not know namely that neither married gods nor married men have separate bedrooms this is plain for he makes hephaestus stand at the front door of his house and shout to the gods to come and see the sinful lovers footnote ibid vi 304305 they all come and look on from the front door odyssey vii 325 which leads into the greek megaron the hall if the lovers are in bed in the hall then hall and bedroom are all one and the terribly late poet who made this lay knows it though the late poets of the odyssey and iliad do not  it would appear that the author of the lay is not late as we shall prove in another case  noack then will not allow man or god to have a separate wedding chamber nor women before the late parts of the odyssey to have separate quarters except in the house of odysseus womens chambers do not exist in the homeric house footnote noack p 50 if so how remote is the true homeric house from the house of historical greece  as for upper chambers those of the daughter of the house iliad ii 514 xvi 184 both passages are late as we saw noack pblank space in the odyssey penelope both sleeps and works at the shroud in an upper chamber but the whole arrangement of upper chambers as womens apartments is as late says noack as the time of the poets and redactors whoever they may have been of the odyssey xxi xxii xxiii footnote noack p 68 at the earliest these books are said to be of the eighth century bc here the late poets have their innings at last and do modernise the homeric house  to prove the absence of upper rooms in the iliad we have to abolish ii 514 where astyoche meets her divine lover in her upper chamber and xvi 184 where polymêlê celebrates her amour with hermes in the upper chambers the places where these two passages occur catalogue book ii and the catalogue of the myrmidons book xvi are indeed both called late but the author of the latter knows the early law of brideprice which is supposed to be unknown to the authors of late passages in the odyssey xvi 190  stated briefly such are the ideas of noack they leave us at least with permission to hold that the whole of the epics except books xxi xxii and xxiii of the odyssey bear as regards the house the marks of a distinct peculiar age coming between the period of mycenae and tiryns on one hand and the eighth century bc on the other  this is the point for which we have contended and this suits our argument very well though we are sorry to see that odyssey books xxi xxii and xxiii are no older than the eighth century bc but we have not been quite convinced that helen had not her separate chamber that zeus had not his separate chamber and that the upper chambers of the daughters of the house in the iliad are late where if not in upper chambers did the young princesses repose again the marked separation of the women in the house of odysseus may be the result of penelopes care in unusual circumstances though she certainly would not build a separate hall for them there are over a hundred handsome young scoundrels in her house all day long and deep into the night she would vainly do her best to keep her girls apart  it stands to reason that young girls of princely families would have bedrooms in the house not in the courtyardbedrooms out of the way of enterprising young men what safer place could be found for them than in upper chambers as in the iliad but if their lovers were gods we know that none can see a god coming or going against his will the arrangements of houses may and do vary in different cases in the same age  as examples we turn to the parallel afforded by the icelandic sagas and their pictures of houses of the eleventh century bc the present author long ago pointed out the parallel of the houses in the sagas and in homer footnote the house butcher and lang translation of the odyssey he took his facts from dasents translation of the njal saga 1861 vol i pp xcviii ciii with diagrams as far as he is aware no critic looked into the matter till mr monro 1901 being apparently unacquainted with dasents researches found similar lore in works by dr valtyr gudmundsson footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 491495 cf gudmundsson der islandske bottg i fristats tiden 1894 cf dasent oxford essays 1858 the roof of the hall is supported by four rows of columns the two inner rows are taller and between them is the hearth with seats of honour for the chief guests and the lord the fire was in a kind of trench down the hall and in very cold weather we learn from dasent long fires could be lit through the extent of the hall the chief had a raised seat the guests sat on benches the high seats were at the centre not till later times on the dais as in a college hall the tables were relatively small and as in homer could be removed after a meal the part of the hall with the dais in later days was partitioned off as a stofa or parlour in early times cooking was done in the hall  dr gudmundsson if i understand him varies from dasent in some respects i quote an abstract of his statement  about the year 1000 houses generally consisted of at least four rooms often a fifth was added the socalled bathroom the oldest form for houses was that of one long line or row of separate rooms united by wooden or clay corridors or partitions and each covered with a roof later this was considered unpractical and they began building some of the houses or rooms behind the others which facilitated the access from one to another and diminished the number of outer doors and corridors  towards the latter part of the tenth century the skaal was used as common sleepingroom for the whole family including servants and serfs it was fitted up in the same way as the hall like this it was divided in three naves by rows of wooden pillars the middle floor was lower than that of the two side naves in these were placed the socalled saet or bed places not running the whole length of the blank space from gable to gable but sideways filling about a third part each saet was enclosed by broad strong planks joined into the pillars but not nailed on so they might easily be taken out these planks called sattestokke could also be turned sideways and used as benches during the day they were often beautifully carved and consequently highly valued  when settling abroad the people took away with them these planks and put them up in their new home as a symbol of domestic happiness the saet was occupied by the servants of the farm as sleepingrooms generally it was screened by hangings and low panels which partitioned it off like huge separate boxes used as beds  all beds were filled with hay or straw servants and serfs slept on this without any bedclothes sometimes a sleepingbag was used or they covered themselves with deerskins or a mantle the family had bedclothes but only in very wealthy houses were they also provided for the servants moveable beds were extremely rare but are sometimes mentioned generally two people slept in each bed  in the further end of the skaal facing the door opened out one or several small bedrooms destined for the husband with wife and children besides other members of the family including guests of a higher standing these small dormitories were separated by partitions of planks into bedrooms with one or several beds and shut away from the outer skaal either by a slidingdoor in the wall or by an ordinary door shutting with a hasp sometimes only a hanging covered the opening  in some farms were found underground passages leading from the masters bedside to an outside house or even as far as a wood or another sheltered place in the neighbourhood to enable the inhabitants to save themselves during a night attack for the same reason each man had his arms suspended over his bed  ildhus or firehouse was the kitchen often used besides as a sleepingroom when the farms were very small this was quite abolished after the year 1000  buret was the provision house  the bathroom was heated from a stone oven the stones were heated redhot and cold water thrown upon them which developed a quantity of vapour as the heat and the steam mounted the people men and womencrawled up to a shelf under the roof and remained there as in a turkish bath  in large and wealthy houses there was also a womens room with a fireplace built low down in the middle as in the hall where the women used to sit with their handiwork all day the men were allowed to come in and talk to them also beggarwomen and other vagabonds who brought them the news from other places towards evening and for meals all assembled together in the hall  on this showing people did not sleep in cabins partitioned off the dininghall but in the skaale and two similar and similarly situated rooms one the common dininghall the other the common sleepinghall have been confused by writers on the sagas footnote gudmundsson p 14 note i can there be a similar confusion in the uses of megaron doma and domos  in the eyrbyggja saga we have descriptions of the firehall skáli or eldhús the firehall was the common sleepingroom in icelandic

dwellers p 145 thorgunna had a berth apparently partitioned off in the hall footnote ibid 137140 as in homer the hall was entered from the courtyard in which were separate rooms for stores and other purposes in the courtyard also in the houses of gunnar of lithend and gisli at hawkdale and doubtless in other cases were the dyngfur or ladies chambers their bowers thalamos like that of telemachus in the courtyard where they sat spinning and gossiping the dyngja was originally called búr our bower the ballads say in bower and hall in the ballad of margaret her parents are said to put her in the way of deadly sin by building her a bower apparently separate from the main building she would have been safer in an upper chamber though even there not safeat least if a god wooed her it does not appear that all houses had these chambers for ladies apart from the main building you did not enter the main hall in iceland from the court directly in front but by the mans door at the west side whence you walked through the porch or outer hall prodomos aithonsa in the centre of which to the right were the doors of the hall the women entered by the womens door at the eastern extremity  guests did not sleep as in homer in the prodomos or the porticothe climate did not permit itbut in one or other hall the hall was wainscotted the walls were hung with shields and weapons like the hall of odysseus the heads of the family usually slept in the aisles in chambers entered through the wainscot of the hall such a chamber might be called muchos it was private from the hall though under the same roof it appears not improbable that some homeric halls had sleeping places of this kind such a muchos in iceland seems to have had windows footnote story of burnt njal i 242   gunnar himself however slept with his wife halegerda in an upper chamber his mother who lived with him also had a room upstairs  in njals house too there was an upper chamber wherein the foes of njal threw fire footnoteibid ii 173 but njal and bergthora his wife when all hope was ended went into their own bridechamber in the separate aisle of the hall and gave over their souls into gods hand under a hide they lay and when men raised up the hide after the fire had done its work they were unburnt under it all praised god for that and thought it was a great token in this house was a weaving room for the women footnoteibid ii 195  it thus appears that icelandic houses of the heroic age as regards structural arrangements were practically identical with the house of odysseus allowing for a separate sleepinghall while the differences between that and other homeric houses may be no more than the differences between various icelandic dwellings the parents might sleep in bedchambers off the hall or in upper chambers ladies might have bowers in the courtyard or might have none the greek lauraeeach passage outside the hallyielded sleeping rooms for servants and there were storerooms behind the passage at the top end of the hall as well as separate chambers for stores in the courtyard mr leaf judiciously reconstructs the homeric house in its public rooms of which we hear most while he leaves the residential portion with details and limits probably very variable footnote iliad vol i pp 586 589 with diagram based on the palace of tiryns  given variability which is natural and to be expected and given the absence of detail about the residential portion of other houses than that of odysseus in the poems it does not seem to us that this house is conspicuously late still less that it is the house of historical greece manifestly in all respects it more resembles the houses of njal and gunnar of lithend in the heroic age of iceland  in the house as in the uses of iron and bronze the weapons armour relations of the sexes customary laws and everything else homer gives us an harmonious picture of a single and peculiar age we find no stronger mark of change than in the odyssean house if that be changed which we show reason to doubt     chapter xi   notes of change in the odyssey  if the homeric descriptions of details of life contain anachronisms points of detail inserted in later progressive ages these must be peculiarly conspicuous in the odyssey longinus regarded it as the work of homers advanced life the sunset of his genius and nobody denies that it assumes the existence of the iliad and is posterior to that epic in the odyssey then we are to look if anywhere for indications of a changed society that the language of the odyssey and of four books of the iliad ix x xxiii xxiv exhibits signs of change is a critical commonplace but the language is matter for a separate discussion we are here concerned with the ideas manners customary laws weapons implements and so forth of the epics  taking as a text mr monros essay the relation of the odyssey to the iliad footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 324 seqq we examine the notes of difference which he finds between the twin epics as to the passages in which he discovers borrowing or close imitation of passages in the iliad by the poet of the odyssey we shall not dwell on the matter because we know so little about the laws regulating the repetition of epic formulae it is tempting indeed to criticise mr monros list of twentyfour odyssean borrowings and we might arrive at some curious results for example we could show that the klôthes the spinning women who spae the fate of each newborn child are not later but as less abstract are if anything earlier than the simple aisa of the iliad footnote odyssey vii 197 iliad xx 127 but our proof would require an excursion into the beliefs of savage and barbaric peoples who have their klôthes spaewomen attending each birth but who are not known to have developed the idea of aisa or fate  we might also urge that to send a spear through the back of a stag is not as mr monro thought an improbable feat and that a man wounded to death as leiocritus was wounded would not as mr monro argued fall backwards he supposes that the poet of the odyssey borrowed the forward fall from a passage in the iliad where the fall is in keeping but to make good our proof it might be necessary to spear a human being in the same way as leiocritus was speared footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 239 230  the repetitions of the epic at all events are not the result of the weakness of a poet who had to steal his expressions like a schoolboy they have some other cause than the indolence or inefficiency of a centomaking undergraduate indeed a poet who used the many terms in the odyssey which do not occur in the iliad was not constrained to borrow from any predecessor  it is needless to dwell on the odyssean novelties in vocabulary which were naturally employed by a poet who had to sing of peace not of war and whose epic as aristotle says is ethical not military the poets rich vocabulary is appropriate to his novel subject that is all  coming to religion i we find mr leaf assigning to his original achilleisthe kernelthe very same religious ideas as mr monro takes to be marks of lateness and of advance when he finds them in the odyssey  in the original oldest part of the iliad says mr leaf the gods show themselves just so much as to let us know what are the powers which control mankind from heaven their interference is such as becomes the rulers of the world not partisans in the battle footnote leaf iliad vol ii pp xii xiii it is the later poets of the iliad in mr leafs view who introduce the meddlesome undignified and extremely unsportsmanlike gods the original early poet of the iliad had the nobler religious conceptions  in that casethe odyssey being later than the original kernel of the iliadthe odyssey ought to give us gods as undignified and unworthy as those exhibited by the later continuators of the iliad  but the reverse is the case the gods behave fairly well in book xxiv of the iliad which we are to believe is the latest or nearly the latest portion they are all wroth with the abominable behaviour of achilles to dead hector xxiv 134 they console and protect priam as for the odyssey mr monro finds that in this late epic the gods are just what mr leaf proclaims them to have been in his old original kernel there is now an olympian concert that carries on something like a moral government of the world it is very different in the iliad footnote monro odyssey ii 335  but it was not very different it was just the same in mr leafs genuine old original germ of the iliad in fact the gods are very much like you and me when their ichor is up they misbehave as we do when our blood is up during the fury of war when hector is dead and when the war is over the gods give play to their higher nature as men do there is no difference of religious conception to sever the odyssey from the later but not from the original parts of the iliad it is all an affair of the circumstances in each case  the odyssey is calmer more reflective more religious than the iliad being a poem of peace the iliad a poem of war is more mythological than the odyssey the gods in the iliad are excited like the men by the great war and behave accordingly that neither gods nor men show any real sense of the moral weakness of agamemnon or achilles or of the moral superiority of hector is an unacceptable statement footnote monro odyssey vol ii p 336 even achilles and agamemnon are judged by men and by the poet according to their own standard of ethics and of customary law there is really no doubt on this point too much 2 is made of the supposed different views of olympusa mountain in thessaly in the iliad a snowless windless supramundane place in odyssey v 4147 footnote ibid ii 396 of the odyssean passage mr merry justly says the actual description is not irreconcilable with the general homeric picture of olympus it is an idealised mountain and conceptions of it vary with the variations which are essential to and inseparable from all mythological ideas as mr leaf says footnote note to iliad v 750 heaven ouranos and olympus if not identical are at least closely connected in v 753 the poet regarded the summit of olympus as a halfway stage between heaven and earth thus departing from the oldest homeric tradition which made the earthly mountain olympus and not any aerial region the dwelling of the gods but precisely the same confusion of mythical ideas occurs among a people so backward as the australian southeastern tribes whose all father is now seated on a hilltop and now above the sky in iliad viii 25 26 the poet is again said to have entirely lost the real epic conception of olympus as a mountain in thessaly and to follow the later conception which removed it from earth to heaven in iliad xi 184 from heaven means from the summit of olympus which though homer does not identify it with oupavos still as a mountain reached into heaven leaf the poet of iliad xi 184 says plainly that zeus descended from heaven to mount ida in fact all that is said of olympus of heaven of the home of the gods is poetical is mythical and so is necessarily subject to the variations of conception inseparable from mythology this is certain if there be any certainty in mythological science and here no hard and fast line can be drawn between odyssey and iliad  3 the next point of difference is that we hear no more of iris as the messenger of zeus in the odyssey the agent of the will of zeus is now hermes as in the twentyfourth book of the iliad a late odyssean book but what does that matter seeing that iliad book viii is declared to be one of the latest additions yet in book viii iris not hermes is the messenger viii 409425 if in late times hermes not iris is the messenger why in a very late book viii is iris the messenger not hermes iliad book xxiii is also a late odyssean book but here iris goes on her messages xxiii 199 moved merely by the prayers of achilles in the late odyssean book xxiv of the iliad iris runs on messages from zeus both to priam and to achilles if iris in odyssean times had resigned office and been succeeded by hermes why did achilles pray not to hermes but to iris there is nothing in the argument about hermes and iris there is nothing in the facts but the variability of mythical and poetical conceptions moreover the conception of iris as the messenger certainly existed through the age of the odyssey and later in the odyssey the beggar man is called irus a male iris because he carries messages and iris does her usual duty as messenger in the homeric hymns as well as in the socalled late odyssean books of the iliad the poet of the odyssey knew all about iris there had arisen no change of belief he merely employed hermes as messenger not of the one god but of the divine assembly  4 another difference is that in the iliad the wife of hephaestus is one of the graces in the odyssey she is aphrodite footnote monro odyssey vol ii p 336 this is one of the inconsistencies which are the essence of mythology mr leaf points out that when hephaestus is about exercising his craft in making arms for achilles charis is made wife of hephaestus by a more transparent allegory than we find elsewhere in homer whereas when aphrodite appears in a comic song by demodocus odyssey viii 266366 that passage is later and unhomeric footnote leaf iliad vol ii p 246  of this we do not accept the doctrine that the lay is unhomeric the difference comes to no more than that the accustomed discrepancy of mythology of storytelling about the gods but as to the lay of demodocus being unhomeric and late the poet at least knows the regular homeric practice of the brideprice and its return by the brides father to the husband of an adulterous wife odyssey viii 318 319 the poet of this lay which mr merry defends as homeric was intimately familiar with homeric customary law now according to paul cauer as we shall see other odyssean poets were living in an age of changed law later than that of the author of the lay of demodocus all these so called differences between iliad and odyssey do not point to the fact that the odyssey belongs to a late and changed period of culture of belief and customs there is nothing in the evidence to prove that contention  there 5 are two references to local oracles in the odyssey that of dodona xiv 327 xix 296 and that of pytho viii 80 this is the old name of delphi pytho occurs in iliad ix 404 as a very rich temple of apollothe oracle is not named but the oracle brought in the treasures achilles xvi 233 prays to pelasgian zeus of dodona whose priests were thickly tabued but says nothing of the oracle of dodona neither when in leaguer round troy nor when wandering in fairy lands forlorn had the achaeans or odysseus much to do with the local oracles of greece perhaps not in homers time so important as they were later and little indeed is said about them in either epic  6 the geographical knowledge shown in the odyssey goes beyond that of the iliad  especially in regard to egypt and sicily but a poet of a widely wandering hero of western greece has naturally more occasion than the poet of a fixed army in asia to show geographical knowledge egyptian thebes is named in iliad ix as a city very rich especially in chariots while in the odyssey the poet has occasion to show more knowledge of the way to egypt and of viking descents from crete on the coast odyssey iii 300 iv 351 xiv 257 xvii 426 archaeology shows that the mycenaean age was in close commercial relation with egypt and that the mycenaean civilisation extended to most mediterranean lands and islands and to italy and sicily footnote ridgeway early age of greece i 69 there is nothing suspicious as late in the mention of sicily by odysseus in ithaca odyssey xx 383 xxiv 307 in the same way if the poet of a western poem does not dilate on the troad and the people of asia minor as the poet of the iliad does that is simply because the scene of the iliad is in asia and the scene of the odyssey is in the west when it is not in no mans land from the same cause the poet of seafaring has more occasion to speak of the phoenicians great seafarers than the poet of the trojan leaguer  7 we know so little about land tenure in homeric timesand indeed early land tenure is a subject so complex and obscure that it is not easy to prove advance towards separate property in the odysseybeyond what was the rule in the time of the iliad in the making of the arms xviii 541549 we find many men ploughing a field and this may have been a common field but in what sense many ploughs were at work at once on a scottish runrig field and each farmer had his own strip on several common fields but each farmer held by rent or by rent and services from the laird these common fields were not common property in xii 422 we have a common field and men measuring a strip and quarrelling about the markingstones across the baulk but it does not follow that they are owners they may be tenants such quarrels were common in scotland when the runrig system of common fields each man with his strip prevailed footnote grey graham social life in scotland in the eighteenth century i 157  a man had a greek klaeros or lot iliad xv 448 but what was a lot at first probably a share in land periodically shifted partage noir of the russian peasants kings and men who deserve public gratitude receive a greek temenos a piece of public land as bellerophon did from the lycians vi 194 in the case of melager such an estate is offered to him but by whom not by the people at large but by the greek gerontes ix 574  who are the greek gerontes they are not ordinary men of the people they are in fact the gentry in an age so advanced from tribal conditions as is the homeric timefar advanced beyond ancient tribal scotland or irelandwe conceive that as in these countries during the tribal period the greek gerontes in celtic the flaith held in possession if not in accordance with the letter of the law as property much more land than a single lot the irish tribal freeman had a right to a lot redistributed by rotation wealth consisted of cattle and a bogire a man of many kine let them out to tenants such a rich man a flatha would in accordance with human nature use his influence with kineless dependents to acquire in possession several lots avoid the partition and keep the lots in possession though not legally in property such men were the irish flaith gentry under the ri or king his greek gerontes each with his ciniod or near kinsmen to back his cause  flaith seems clearly to mean landowners or squires says sir james ramsay footnote foundations of england i 16 note 4 if land contrary to the tribal ideal came into private hands in early ireland we can hardly suppose that in the more advanced and settled homeric society no man but the king held land equivalent in extent to a number of lots the greek gerontes the gentry the chariotowning warriors of whom there are hundreds not of kingly rank in homer as in ireland there were many flaith to one ri probably in an informal but tight grip held considerable lands when we note their position in the iliad high above the nameless host can we imagine that they did not hold more land than the simple perhaps periodically shifting lot there were lotless men odyssey xl 490 lotless freemen and what had become of their lots had they not fallen into the hands of the greek gerontes or the flaith  mr ridgeway in a very able essay footnote journal of hellenic studies vi 319339 holds different opinions he points out that among a mans possessions in the iliad we hear only of personal property and live stock it is in one passage only in the odyssey xiv 211 that we meet with men holding several lots of land but they we remark occur in cretean isle as we know of very advanced civilisation from of old  mr ridgeway also asks whether the lotless men may not be outsiders such as are attached to certain villages of central and southern india footnote maine village communities p 127 or they may answer to the fuidhir or broken men of early ireland fugitives from one to another tribe they would be settled on the waste lands of a community if so they would not be lotless they would have new lots footnote journal of hellenic studies vi 322 323  laertes though a king is supposed to have won his farm by his own labours from the waste odyssey xxiv 207 mr monro says the land having thus been won from the wastes the greek gae aklaeros te kai aktitos of h ven 123 was a greek temenos or separate possession of laertes the passage is in the rejected conclusion of the odyssey and if any man might go and squat in the waste any man might have a lot or better than one lot in iliad xxiii 832835 achilles says that his offered prize of iron will be useful to a man whose rich fields are very remote from any town teucer and meriones compete for the prize probably they had such rich remote fields not each a mere lot in a common field these remote fields they are supposed to hold in perpetuity apart from the temenos which in mr ridgeways opinion reverted on the death of each holder to the community save where kingship was hereditary now if greek klaeros had come to mean a lot of land as we say a building lot obviously men like teucer and meriones had many lots rich fields which at death might sometimes pass to their heirs thus there was separate landed property in the iliad but the passage is denounced though not by mr ridgeway as late  the absence of enclosures greek herkos arouraes proves nothing about absence of several property in land in scotland the lairds lands were unenclosed till deep in the eighteenth century  my own case for land in private possession in homeric times rests mainly on human nature in such an advanced society such possession as i plead for is in accordance with human nature in a society so distinguished by degrees of wealth as is the homeric  unless we are able to suppose that all the gentry of the iliad held no rich fields remote from towns each having but one rotatory lot apiece there is no difference in iliadic and odyssean land tenure though we get clearer lights on it in the odyssey  the position of the man of several lots may have been indefensible if the ideal of tribal law were ever made real but wealth in growing societies universally tends to override such law mr keller footnote homeric society p 192 1902 justly warns us against the attempt to apply universally certain fixed rules of property development the passages in homer upon which opinions diverge most are isolated ones occurring in similes and fragmentary descriptions under such conditions the formulation of theories or the attempt rigorously to classify can be little more than an intellectual exercise  we have not the materials for a scientific knowledge of homeric real property and with all our materials in irish law books how hard it is for us to understand the early state of such affairs in ireland but does any one seriously suppose that the knightly class of the iliad the chariotdriving gentlemen held no more landlegally or by permitted customthan the two homeric swains who vituperate each other across a baulk about the right to a few feet of a strip of a runrig field whosoever can believe that may also believe that the practice of adding lot to lot began in the period between the finished composition of the iliad or of the parts of it which allude to land tenure and the beginning of the odyssey or of the parts of it which refer to land tenure the inference is that though the fact is not explicitly stated in the iliad there were men who held more lots than one in iliadic times as well as in the odyssean times when in a solitary passage of the odyssey we do hear of such men in crete but whosoever has pored over early european land tenures knows how dim our knowledge is and will not rush to employ his lore in discriminating between the date of the iliad and the date of the odyssey  not much proof of change in institutions between iliadic and odyssean times can be extracted from two passages about the ethna or brideprice of penelope the rule in both iliad and odyssey is that the wooer gives a brideprice to the father of the bride ethna this was the rule known even to that painfully late and unhomeric poet who made the song of demodocus about the loves of ares and aphrodite in that song the injured husband hephaestus claims back the brideprice which he had paid to the father of his wife zeus footnote odyssey viii 318 this is the accepted custom throughout the odyssey vi 159 xvi 77 xx 335 xxi 162 xv 17 c so far there is no change of manners no introduction of the later practice a dowry given with the bride in place of a brideprice given to the father by the bridegroom but penelope was neither maid wife nor widow her husbands fate alive or dead was uncertain and her son was so anxious to get her out of the house that he says he offered gifts with her xx 342 in the same way to buy back the goodwill of achilles agamemnon offers to give him his daughter without brideprice and to add great gifts iliad ix l47the term for the gifts is greek mailia people of course could make their own bargain take as much for their daughter as they could get or let the gifts go from husband to bride and then return to the husbands home with her as in germany in the time of tacitus germania 18 or do that and throw in more gifts but in odyssey ii 53 telemachus says that the wooers shrink from going to the house of penelopes father icarius who would endow  his daughter greek eednoosaito and again odyssey i 277 ii 196 her fathers folk will furnish a bridal feast and array the greek heedna many such as should accompany a dear daughter some critics think that the gifts here are dowry a later institution than brideprice others that the father of the dear daughter merely chose to be generous and returned the brideprice or its equivalent in whole or part footnote merry odyssey vol i p 50 note to book i 277 if the former view be correct these passages in odyssey i ii are later than the exceedingly late song of demodocus if the latter theory be correct the father is merely showing goodwill and doing as the germans did when they were in a stage of culture much earlier than the homeric  the position of penelope is very unstable and legally perplexing has her father her marriage has her son her marriage is she not perhaps still a married woman with a living husband telemachus would give much to have her off his hands but he refuses to send her to her fathers house where the old man might be ready enough to return the brideprice to her new husband and get rid of her with honour for if telemachus sends his mother away against her will he will have to pay a heavy fine to her father and to thole his mothers curse and lose his character among men odyssey ii 130138 the icelanders of the saga period gave dowries with their daughters but when njal wanted hildigunna for his foster son hauskuld he offered to give greek hedna i will lay down as much money as will seem fitting to thy niece and thyself he says to flosi if thou wilt think of making this match footnote story of burnt njal ii p 81  circumstances alter cases and we must be hard pressed to discover signs of change of manners in the odyssey as compared with the iliad if we have to rely on a solitary mention of men of many lots in crete and on the perplexed proposals for the second marriage of penelope footnote for the alleged alteration of old customs see cauer grundfragen der homerkritik pp 193194 we must not be told that the many other supposed signs of change iris olympus and the rest have cumulative weight if we have disposed of each individual supposed note of change in beliefs and manners in its turn then these proofs have in each case no individual weight and cumulatively are not more ponderous than a feather     chapter xii   linguistic proofs of various dates  the great strength of the theory that the poems are the work of several ages is the existence in them of various strata of languages earlier and later  not to speak of differences of vocabulary mr monro and mr leaf with many scholars detect two strata of earlier and later grammar in iliad and odyssey in the iliad four or five books are infected by the later grammar while the odyssey in general seems to be contaminated mr leafs words are when we regard the epos in large masses we see that we can roughly arrange the inconsistent elements towards one end or the other of a line of development both linguistic and historical the main division that of iliad and odyssey shows a distinct advance along this line and the distinction is still more marked if we group with the odyssey four books of the iliad whose odyssean physiognomy is well marked taking as our main guide the dissection of the plot as shown in its episodes we find that marks of lateness though nowhere entirely absent group themselves most numerously in the later additions  footnote iliad vol ii p x we are here concerned with linguistic examples of lateness the four books whose odyssean physiognomy and language seem well marked are ix x xxiii xxiv here mr leaf mr monro and many authorities are agreed but to these four odyssean books of the iliad mr leaf adds iliad xi 664772 probably a later addition says mr monro it is notably odyssean in character says mr leaf and the author is ignorant of the geography of the western peloponnesus no doubt the author was an asiatic greek footnote iliad vol i pp 465466 note on book xi 756 the value of this discovery is elsewhere discussed see the interpolations of nestor  the odyssean notes in this passage of a hundred lines iliad xi 670762 are the occurrence of a purely odyssean word 677 an attic form of an epic word and a forbidden trochaic caesura in the fourth foot an odyssean word for carving meat applied in a nonodyssean sense 688 a verb for insulting not elsewhere found in the iliad though the noun is in the iliad 695 an odyssean epithet of the sun four times in the odyssey 735 it is also possible that there is an allusion to a fourhorse chariot 699  these are the proofs of odyssean lateness  the real difficulty about odyssean words and grammar in the iliad is that if they were in vigorous poetic existence down to the time of pisistratus as the odysseanism of the asiatic editor proves that they were and if every rhapsodist could add to and alter the materials at the disposal of the pisistratean editor at will we are not told how the fashionable odysseanisms were kept on the whole out of twenty books of the iliad  this is a point on which we cannot insist too strongly as an argument against the theory that till the middle of the sixth century bc the iliad scarcely survived save in the memory of strolling rhapsodists if that were so all the books of the iliad would in the course of recitation of old and composition of new passages be equally contaminated with late odyssean linguistic style it could not be otherwise all the books would be equally modified in passing through the lips of modern reciters and composers therefore if twenty out of twenty four books are pure or pure in the main from odysseanisms while four are deeply stained with them the twenty must not only be earlier than the four but must have been specially preserved and kept uncontaminated in some manner inconsistent with the theory that all alike scarcely existed save in the memory or invention of late strolling reciters  how the twenty books relatively pure in grammatical forms in syntax and in vocabulary could be kept thus clean without the aid of written texts i am unable to imagine if left merely to human memory and at the mercy of reciters and new poets they would have become stained with the defining articleand indeed an employment of the article which startles grammarians appears even in the eleventh line of the first book of the iliad footnote exact placing uncertain cf monro and leaf on iliad i 1112   left merely to human memory and the human voice the twenty more or less innocent books would have abounded like the odyssey in greek amphi with the dative meaning about and with greek ex in consequence of and the extension of the use of greek ei clauses as final and objective clauses and similar marks of lateness so interesting to grammarians footnote monro odyssey ii pp 331333 but the twenty books are almost or quite inoffensive in these respects  now even in ages of writing it has been found difficult or impossible to keep linguistic novelties and novelties of metre out of old epics we later refer archaeology of the epic to the chancun de willame of which an unknown benefactor printed two hundred copies in 1903 mr raymond weeks in romania describes willame as taking a place beside the chanson de roland in the earliest rank of chansons de geste if the text can be entirely restored the poem will appear as the most primitive of french epics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries but it has passed from copy to copy in the course of generations the methods of versification change and after line 2647 there are traces of change in the language the word ço followed by a vowel hitherto frequent never again reappears the vowel i of li nominative masculine of the article li reis the king never occurs in the text after line 2647 up to that point it is elided or not at pleasure there is a progressive tendency towards hiatus after line 1980 the system of assonance changes an and en have been kept distinct hitherto this ceases to be the case footnote romania xxxiv pp 240246  the poem is also notable like the iliad for textual repetition of passages but that is common to all early poetry which many homeric critics appear not to understand in this example we see how apt novelties in grammar and metre are to steal into even written copies of epics composed in and handed down through uncritical ages and we are confirmed in the opinion that the relatively pure and orthodox grammar and metre of the twenty books must have been preserved by written texts carefully executed the other four books if equally old were less fortunate their grammar and metre we learn belong to a later stratum of language  these opinions of grammarians are not compatible with the hypothesis that all of the iliad even the earliest parts are loaded with interpolations forced in at different places and in any age from 1000 bc to 540 bc for if that theory were true the whole of the iliad would equally be infected with the later odyssean grammar according to mr monro and sir richard jebb it is not  but suppose on the other hand that the later odyssean grammar abounds all through the whole iliad then that grammar is not more odyssean than it is iliadic the alleged distinction of early iliadic grammar late odyssean grammar in that case vanishes mr leaf is more keen than mr monro and sir richard jebb in detecting late grammar in the iliad beyond the bounds of books ix x xxiii xxiv but he does not carry these discoveries so far as to make the late grammar no less iliadic than odyssean in book viii of the iliad which he thinks was only made for the purpose of introducing book ix footnote iliad vol i p 332 1900 we ought to find the late odyssean grammar just as much as we do in book ix for it is of the very same date and probably by one or more of the same authors as book ix but we do not find the odyssean grammar in book viii  mr leaf says the peculiar character of book viii is easily understood when we recognise the fact that book viii is intended to serve only as a means for the introduction of book ix which is late and odyssean then book viii intended to introduce book ix must be at least as late as book ix and might be expected to be at least as odyssean indeed one would think it could not be otherwise yet it is not so  mr leafs theory has thus to face the difficulty that while the whole iliad by his view for more than four centuries was stuffed with late interpolations in the course of oral recital through all greek lands and was crammed with original copy by a sycophant of pisistratus about 540 bc the late grammar concentrated itself in only some four books till some reasonable answer is given to this questionhow did twenty books of the iliad preserve so creditably the ancient grammar through centuries of change and of recitation by rhapsodists who used the odyssean grammar which infected the four other books and the whole of the odysseyit seems hardly worth while to discuss this linguistic test  any scholar who looks at these pages knows all about the proofs of grammar of a late date in the odyssey and the four contaminated books of the iliad but it may be well to give a few specimens for the enlightenment of less learned readers of homer  the use of greek amfi with the dative meaning about when thinking or speaking about odysseus or anything else is peculiar to the odyssey but how has it not crept into the four odyssean contaminated books of the iliad   greek peri with the genitive follows verbs meaning to speak or know about a person but only in the odyssey what preposition follows such verbs in the iliad  here again we ask how did the contaminated books of the iliad escape the stain of greek peri with the genitive after verbs meaning to speak or know what phrase do they use in the iliad for speaking or asking about anybody footnote exact placing uncertain monro homeric grammar see index under iliad p 339   greek meta with the genitive meaning among or with comes twice in the odyssey x 320 xvi 140 and thrice in the iliad xiii 700 xxi 458 xxiv 400 but all these passages in the iliad are disposed of as late parts of the poem   greek epi with the accusative meaning towards a person comes often in the iliad once in the odyssey but it comes four times in iliad book x which almost every critic scouts as very late indeed if so why does the late odyssey not deal in this grammatical usage so common in the late book x of the iliad   greek epi with the accusative meaning extent without motion is chiefly found in the odyssey and in the iliad ix x xxiv on consulting grammarians one thinks that there is not much in this   greek proti with the dative meaning in addition to occurs only once odyssey x 68 if it occurs only once there is little to be learned from the circumstance   greek ana with the genitive is only in odyssey only thrice always of going on board a ship there are not many ship farings in the iliad odysseus and his men are not described as going on board their ship in so many words in iliad book i the usage occurs in the poem where the incidents of seafaring occur frequently as is to be expected it is not worth while to persevere with these tithes of mint and cummin if neglect of position be commonerlike hiatus in the bucolic diaeresisin the odyssey and in iliad xxiii xxiv why do the failings not beset iliad ix x these being such extremely late books as to the later use of the article in the odyssey and the odyssean books of the iliad it appears to us that book i of the iliad uses the article as it is used in book x but on this topic we must refer to a special treatise on the language of iliad book x which is promised  turning to the vocabulary words expressive of civilisation are bound to be more frequent as they are in the odyssey a poem of peaceful life than in a poem about an army in action like the iliad out of all this no clue to the distance of years dividing the two poems can be found as to words concerning religion the same holds good the odyssey is more frequently religious see the case of eumaeus than the iliad  in morals the term greek dikaios is more used in the odyssey also greek atemistos just and lawless but that is partly because the odyssey has to contrast civilised just with wild outlandish peoplecyclopes and laestrygons who are lawless the iliad has no occasion to touch on savages but as the greek hybris of the wooers is a standing topic in the odyssey an ethical poem says aristotle the word greek hybris is of frequent occurrence in the odyssey in just the same sense as it bears in iliad i 214the insolence of agamemnon yet when achilles has occasion to speak of agamemnons insolence in iliad book ix he does not use the word greek hybris though book ix is so very late and odyssean it would be easy to go through the words for moral ideas in the odyssey and to show that they occur in the numerous moral situations which do not arise or arise much less frequently in the iliad there is not difference enough in the moral standard of the two poems to justify us in assuming that centuries of ethical progress had intervened between their dates of composition if the iliad again were really like the odyssey a thing of growth through several centuries which overlapped the centuries in which the odyssey grew the moral ideas of the iliad and odyssey would necessarily be much the same would be indistinguishable but as a matter of fact it would be easy to show that the moral standard of the iliad is higher in many places than the moral standard of the odyssey and that therefore by the critical hypothesis the iliad is the later poem of the twain for example the behaviour of achilles is most obnoxious to the moralist in iliad book ix where he refuses gifts of conciliation but by the critical hypothesis this is not the fault of the iliad for book ix is declared to be late and of the same date as late parts of the odyssey achilles is not less open to moral reproach in his abominable cruelty and impiety as shown in his sacrifice of prisoners of war and his treatment of dead hector in iliad xxiii xxiv but these books also are said to be as late as the odyssey  the solitary realistic or naturalistic passage in homer with which a lover of modern problem novels feels happy and at home is the story of phoenix about his seduction of his fathers mistress at the request of his mother what a charming situation but that occurs in an odyssean book of the iliad book ix and thus odyssean seems lower not more advanced than iliadic taste in morals to be sure the poet disapproves of all these immoralities  in the odyssey the hero to the delight of athene lies often and freely and with glee the achilles of the iliad hates a liar like the gates of hades but he says so in an odyssean book book ix so there were obviously different standards in odyssean ethics  as to the odyssey being the work of a milder age consider the hanging of penelopes maids and the abominable torture of melanthius there is no torturing in the blank space for the iliad happens not to deal with treacherous thralls  enfin there is no appreciable moral advance in the odyssey on the moral standard of the iliad it is rather the other way odysseus in the odyssey tries to procure poison for his arrowheads the person to whom he applies is too moral to oblige him we never learn that a hero of the iliad would use poisoned arrows the poet himself obviously disapproves in both poems the poet is always on the side of morality and of the highest ethical standard of his age the standard in both epics is the same in both some heroes fall short of the standard  to return to linguistic tests it is hard indeed to discover what mr leafs opinion of the value of linguistic tests of lateness really is it is on such fundamental discrepanciesas he has found in books ix xvithat we can depend and on these alone when we come to dissect the iliad  some critics have attempted to base their analysis on evidences from language but i do not think they are sufficient to bear the superstructure which has been raised on them footnote companion p 25  he goes on still placing a low value on linguistic tests alone to say it is on the broad grounds of the construction and motives of the poem and not on any merely linguistic considerations that a decision must be sought footnote ibid p x  but he contradicts these comfortable words when he comes to the latest expansions such as books xxiii xxiv the latest expansions are thoroughly in the spirit of those which precede them on account of linguistic evidence which definitely classes them with the odyssey rather than the rest of the iliad footnote iliad vol ii p xiv  now as mr leaf has told us that we must depend on fundamental discrepancies on these alone when we want to dissect the iliad as he has told us that linguistic tests alone are not sufficient to bear the superstructure c how can we lop off two books only on account of linguistic evidence it would appear that on this point as on others mr leaf has entirely changed his mind but even in the companion p 388 he had amputated book xxiv for no fundamental discrepancy but because of its close kinship to the odyssey as in the whole language of the book  here as in many other passages if we are to account for discrepancies by the theory of multiplex authorship we must decide that mr leafs books are the work of several critics not of one critic only but there is excellent evidence to prove that here we would be mistaken  confessedly and regretfully no grammarian i remain unable in face of what seem contradictory assertions about the value of linguistic tests to ascertain what they are really worth and what if anything they really prove  mr monro allows much for the long insensible influence of attic recitation upon the homeric text  many attic peculiarities may be noted so much so that aristarchus thought homer must have been an athenian the poems suffered a gradual and unsystematic because generally unconscious process of modernising the chief agents in which were the rhapsodists reciters in a later democratic age who wandered over all parts of greece and were likely to be influenced by all the chief forms of literature footnote monro homeric grammar pp 394396 1891  then wherefore insist so much on tests of language  mr monro was not only a great grammarian he had a keen appreciation of poetry thus he was conspicuously uneasy in his hypothesis based on words and grammar that the two last books of the iliad are by a late hand after quoting shelleys remark that in these two books homer truly begins to be himself mr monro writes in face of such testimony can we say that the book in which the climax is reached in which the last discords of the iliad are dissolved in chivalrous pity and regret is not the work of the original poet but of some homerid or rhapsodist  mr monro with a struggle finally voted for grammar and other indications of lateness against shelley and against his own sense of poetry in a letter to me of may 1905 mr monro sketched a theory that book ix without which he said that he deemed an achilleis hardly possible might be a remanié representative of an earlier lay to the same general effect some greek shakespeare then treated an older poem on the theme of book ix as shakespeare treated old plays namely as a canvas to work over with a masters hand probably mr monro would not have gone so far in the case of book xxiv the repentance of achilles he thought it in too keen contrast with the brutality of book xxii obviously forgetting that in book xxiv achilles is infinitely more brutal than in book xxii and thought it inconsistent with the refusal of achilles to grant burial at the prayer of the dying hector and with his criminal treatment of the dead body of his chivalrous enemy but in book xxiv his ferocity is increased mr leaf shares mr monros view but mr leaf thinks that a greek audience forgave achilles because he was doing the will of heaven and fighting the great fight of hellenism against barbarism footnote leaf iliad volii p 429 1902 but the achzeans were not puritans of the sixteenth century moreover the trojans are as hellenic as the achzeans they converse clearly in the same language they worship the same gods the achzeans cannot regard them unless on account of the breach of truce by no trojan but an ally as the covenanters regarded malignants their name for loyal cavaliers whom they also styled amalekites and treated as samuel treated agag the achaeans to whom homer sang had none of this sanguinary pharisaism  others must decide on the exact value and import of odyssean grammar as a test of lateness and must estimate the probable amount of time required for the development of such linguistic differences as they find in the odyssey and iliad in undertaking this task they may compare the literary language of america as it was before 1860 and as it is now the language of english literature has also been greatly modified in the last forty years but our times are actively progressive in many directions linguistic variations might arise more slowly in the greece of the epics we have already shown in the more appropriate instance of the chancun de willame that considerable varieties in diction and metre occur in a single ms of that poem a ms written probably within less than a century of the date of the poems composition  we can also trace in remaniements of the chanson de roland comparatively rapid and quite revolutionary variations from the oldestthe oxfordmanuscript rhyme is substituted for assonance the process entails frequent modernisations and yet the basis of thirteenthcentury texts continues to be the version of the eleventh century it may be worth the while of scholars to consider these parallels carefully as regards the language and prosody of the odyssean books of the iliad and to ask themselves whether the processes of alteration in the course of transmission which we know to have occurred in the history of the old french may not also have affected the iliad though why the effect is mainly confined to four books remains a puzzle it is enough for us to have shown that if odyssean varies from iliadic language in all other respects the two poems bear the marks of the same age meanwhile a homeric scholar so eminent as mr t w allen says that the linguistic attack upon their age that of the homeric poems may be said to have at last definitely failed and archaeology has erected an apparently indestructible buttress for their defence footnote classical review may 1906 p 194     chapter xiii   the doloneia  iliad book x  of all books in the blank space book x called the doloneia is most generally scouted and rejected the book in fact could be omitted and only a minutely analytic reader would perceive the lacuna he would remark that in iliad ix 65 84 certain military preparations are made which if we suppress book x lead up to nothing and that in iliad xiv 911 we find nestor with the shield of his son thrasymedes while thrasymedes has his fathers shield a fact not explained though the poet certainly meant something by it the explanation in both cases is found in book x which may also be thought to explain why the achaeans so disconsolate in book ix and why agamemnon so demoralised so gaily assume the offensive in book xi some ancient critics scholiast t and eustathius attributed the doloneia to homer but supposed it to have been a separate composition of his added to the iliad by pisistratus this merely proves that they did not find any necessity for the existence of the doloneia mr allen who thinks that it always held its present place says the doloneia is persistently written down footnote classical review may 1906 p 194  to understand the problem of the doloneia we must make a summary of its contents in book ix 6584 at the end of the disastrous fighting of book viii the achaeans by nestors advice station an advanced guard of the young men between the fosse and wall 700 youths are posted there under meriones the squire of idomeneus and thrasymedes the son of nestor all this is preparation for book x as mr leaf remarks footnote companion p 174 though in any case an advanced guard was needed their business is to remain awake under arms in case the trojans who are encamped on the plain attempt a night attack at their station the young men will be under arms till dawn they light fires and cook their provisions the trojans also surround their own watchfires  the achaean chiefs then hold council and agamemnon sends the embassy to achilles the envoys bring back his bitter answer and all men go to sleep in their huts deeply discouraged as even odysseus avowed  here the tenth book begins and it is manifest that the poet is thoroughly well acquainted with the ninth book without the arrangements made in the ninth book and without the despairing situation of that book his lay is impossible it will be seen that critics suppose him alternately to have quite failed to realise the conditions of life of the heroes of whom he sang that is if certain lines are genuine and also to be a peculiarly learned archaeologist and a valuable authority on weapons he is addicted to introducing fanciful touches of heroic simplicity says mr leaf and is altogether a puzzling personage to the critics  the book opens with the picture of agamemnon sleepless from anxiety while the other chiefs save menelaus are sleeping he hears the music of the joyous trojan pipes and flutes and sees the reflected glow of their campfires we must suppose for he could not see the fires themselves through the new wall of his own camp as critics very wisely remark he tears out his hair before zeus no one else does so in the iliad but no one else is agamemnon alone and in despair  he rises to consult nestor throwing a lions skin over his chiton and grasping a spear much noise is made about the furs such as this lions pelt which the heroes in book x throw about their shoulders when suddenly aroused that sportsmen like the heroes should keep the pelts of animals slain by them for use as coverlets and should throw on one of the pelts when aroused in a hurry is a marvellous thing to the critics they know that fleeces were used for coverlets of beds ix 661 and pelts of wild animals slain by anchises cover his bed in the hymn to aphrodite  but the facts do not enlighten critics yet no facts could be more natural a scientific critic moreover never reflects that the poet is dealing with an unexampled situationheroes wakened and called into the cold air in a night of dread but not called to battle thus reichel says the poet knows so little about true heroic costume that he drapes the princes in skins of lions and panthers like giants but about a corslet he never thinks footnote reichel p70  the simple explanation is that the poet has not hitherto had to tell us about men who are called up not to fight on a night that must have been chilly in war they do not wear skins though paris in archers equipment wears a pards skin iii 17 naturally the men throw over themselves their fur coverlets but nestor a chilly veteran prefers a chiton and a wide doublefolded fleecy purple cloak the cloak lay ready to his hand for such cloaks were used as blankets xxiv 646 odyssey iii 349 351 iv 299 ii 189 we hear more of such bed coverings in the odyssey than in the merely because in the odyssey we have more references to beds and to people in bed that a sportsman may have as many folk have now a fur coverlet and may throw it over him as a kind of dressinggown or bedgown is a simple circumstance which bewilders the critical mind and perplexed reichel  if the poet knew so little as reichel supposed his omission of corslets is explained living in an age of corslets seventh century he being a literary man knew nothing about corslets or as he is also an acute archaeologist he knew too much he knew that they were not worn in the mycenaean prime so he did not introduce them the science of this remarkable ignoramus in this view accounts for his being aware that pelts of animals were in vogue as coverlets just as fur dressinggowns were worn in the sixteenth century and he introduces them precisely as he leaves corslets out because he knows that pelts of fur were in use and that in the mycenaean prime corslets were not worn  in speaking to nestor agamemnon awakens sympathy me of all the achaeans zeus has set in toil and labour ceaselessly they are almost the very words of charlemagne in the chanson de roland deus dist li reis si peneuse est ma vie the author of the doloneia consistently conforms to the character of agamemnon as drawn in the rest of the iliad he is overanxious he is demoralising in his fits of gloom but all the burden of the host hangs on himsipeneuse est ma via  to turn to higher things menelaus too was awake anxious about the argives who risked their lives in his cause alone he got up put on a pards skin and a bronze helmet here the poet forgets what he ought to have known that no bronze helmets have been found in the mycenaean graves menelaus takes a spear and goes to look for agamemnon whom he finds arming himself beside his ship he discovers that agamemnon means to get nestor to go and speak to the advanced guard as his son is their commander and they will obey nestor agamemnons pride has fallen very low he tells menelaus to waken the other chief with all possible formal courtesy for brutally rude when in high heart at present agamemnon cowers to everybody he himself finds nestor in bed his shield two spears and helmet beside him also his glittering zoster his corslet is not named perhaps the poet knew that the zoster or broad metallic belt had been evolved but that the corslet had not been invented or perhaps he knows so little about the costume of the heroes that he is unaware of the existence of corslets nestor asks agamemnon what he wants and agamemnon says that his is a toilsome life that he cannot sleep that his knees tremble and that he wants nestor to come and visit the outposts  there is really nothing absurd in this napoleon often visited his outposts in the night before waterloo and cromwell rode along his lines all through the night before dunbar biting his lips till the blood dropped on his linen bands in all three cases hostile armies were arrayed within striking distance of each other and the generals were careworn  nestor admits that it is an anxious night and rather blames menelaus for not rousing the other chiefs but agamemnon explains and defends his brother nestor then puts on the comfortable cloak already described and picks up a spear blank space in his quarters  as for odysseus he merely throws a shield over his shoulders the company of diomede are sleeping with their heads on their shields thence reichel see the shield infers that the late poet of book x gave them small ionian round bucklers but it has been shown that no such inference is legitimate their spears were erect by their sides fixed in the ground by the sauroter or buttspike used by the men of the late warrior vase found at mycenae to arrange the spears thus we have seen was a point of drill that in aristotles time survived among the illyrians footnote poetics xxv the practice is also alluded to in iliad iii 135 during a truce the tall spears are planted by their sides the poet whether ignorant or learned knew that point of war later obsolete in greece but still extant in illyria  nestor aroused diomede whose night apparel was the pelt of a lion he took his spear and they came to the outposts where the men were awake and kept a keen watch on all movements among the trojans nestor praised them and the princes taking nestors son thrasymedes and meriones with them went out into the open in view of the trojan camp sat down and held a consultation  nestor asked if any one would volunteer to go as a spy among the trojans and pick up intelligence his reward will be a black ewe with her lamb at her foot from their chiefsnothing like her for valueand he will be remembered in songs at feasts or will be admitted to feasts and wine parties of the chiefs footnote leaf note on x 215 the proposal is very odd what do the princes want with black ewes while at feasts they always have honoured places can nestor be thinking of sending out any brave swiftfooted young member of the outpost party to whom the reward would be appropriate  after silence diomede volunteers to go with a comrade though this kind of work is very seldom undertaken in any army of any age by a chief and by his remark about admission to wine parties it is clear that nestor was not thinking of a princely spy many others volunteer but agamemnon bids diomede choose his own companion with a very broad hint not to take menelaus his death agamemnon knows would mean the disgraceful return of the host to greece besides he is throughout the iliad deeply attached to his brother  the poet of book x however late knows the iliad well for he keeps up the uniform treatment of the character of the overlord as he knows the iliad well how can he be ignorant of the conditions of life of the heroes how can he dream of introducing a note of heroic simplicity mr leafs phrase when he must be as well aware as we are of the way in which the heroes lived we cannot explain the black ewes if meant as a princely reward but we do not know everything about homeric life  diomede chooses odysseus whom pallas athene loveth she was also the patroness of diomede himself in books v vi  as they are unarmedall of the chiefs hastily aroused were unarmed save for a spear there or a sword herethrasymedes gives to diomede his twoedged sword his shield and a helm of bulls hide without horns or crest that is called a skullcap knapskull and keeps the heads of strong young men all the advanced guard were young men as we saw in book ix 77 obviously thrasymedes must then send back to camp though we are not told it for another shield sword and helmet as he is to lie all night under arms we shall hear of the shield later  meriones who is an archer xiii 650 lends to odysseus his bow and quiver and a sword he also gives him a helm made of leather and with many a thong it was stiffly wrought within while without the white teeth of a boar of flashing tusks were arrayed thick set on either side well and cunningly  here reichel perceives that the ignorant poet is describing a piece of ancient headgear represented in mycenaean art while the boars teeth were found by schliemann to the number of sixty in grave iv at mycenae each of them had the reverse side cut perfectly flat and with the borings to attach them to some other object they were in a veritable funereal armoury the manner of setting the tusks on the cap is shown on an ivory head of a warrior from mycenae footnote tsountas and manatt 196197  reichel recognises that the poets description in book x is excellent ebenso klar als eingehend he publishes another ivory head from spata with the same helmet set with boars tusks footnote reichel pp 102104 mr leaf decides that this description by the poet wholly ignorant of heroic costume as reichel thinks him must be another instance of the archaic and archaeologising tendency so notable in book x footnote iliad vol ii p 629  at the same time according to reichel and mr leaf the poet of book x introduces the small round ionian buckler thus showing his utter ignorance of the great mycenaean shield the ignorance was most unusual and quite inexcusable for any one who reads the rest of the iliad which the poet of book x knew well is aware that the homeric shields were huge often covering body and legs this fact the poet of book x did not know in reichels opinion footnote leaf iliad vol i p 575  how are we to understand this poet he is such an erudite archaeologist that in the seventh century he knows and carefully describes a helmet of the mycenaean prime did he excavate it and had the leather interior lasted with the felt cap through seven centuries or did he see a sample in an old temple of the mycenaean prime or in a museum of his own period or had he heard of it in a lost mycenaean poem yet careful as he was so pedantic that he must have puzzled his seventhcentury audience who never saw such caps the poet knew nothing of the shields and costumes of the heroes though he might have found out all that is known about them in the then existing iliadic lays with which he was perfectly familiarsee his portrait of agamemnon he was well aware that corslets were in homeric poetry anachronisms for he gave nestor none yet he fully believed in his ignorance that small ionian bucklers loveth which need the aid of corslets badly were the only wear among the heroes  criticism has as we often observe no right to throw the first stone at the inconsistencies of homer as we cannot possibly believe that one poet knew so much which his contemporaries did not know and how in the seventh century could he know it and that he also knew so little knew nothing in fact we take our own view the poet of book x sings of a fresh topic a confused night of dread of young men wearing the headgear which he says young men do wear of pelts of fur such as suddenly wakened men roused but not roused for battle would be likely to throw over their bodies against the chill air he describes things of his own day things with which he is familiar he is said to take quite a peculiar delight in the minute description of dress and weapons footnote leaf iliad vol i p 423 we do not observe that he does describe weapons or shields minutely but homer always loves to describe weapons and costumescores of examples prove itand here he happens to be describing such costume as he nowhere else has occasion to mention by an accident of archaeological discovery we find that there were such caps set with boars tusks as he introduces they had survived for young men on night duty into the poets age we really cannot believe that a poet of the seventh century had made excavations in mycenaean graves if he did and put the results into his lay his audiencenot wearing boars tuskswould have asked what nonsense is the man talking  erhardt remarking on the furs which the heroes throw over their shoulders when aroused says that this kind of wrap is very late it was peisander who in the second half of the seventh century clothed herakles in a lions skin peisander brought this costume into poetry and the author of the doloneia knew no better than to follow peisander footnote die enstehung der homerischen gedichte pp 163164 the poet of the doloneia was thus much better acquainted with peisander than with the homeric lays which could have taught him that a hero would never wear a fur coverlet when arousednot to fight from slumber yet he knew about leathern caps set with boars tusks he must have been an erudite excavator but in literature a reader only of recent minor poetry  having procured arms without corslets with corslets according to carl robertwhether if they had none because the poet knew that corslets were anachronisms or because spies usually go as lightly burdened as possibleodysseus and diomede approach the trojan camp the hour is the darkest hour before dawn they hear but do not see a heron sent by athene as an omen and pray to the goddess with promise of sacrifice  in the trojan camp hector has called a council and asked for a volunteer spy to seek intelligence among the achaeans he offers no black ewes as a reward but the best horses of the enemy this allures dolon son of a rich trojan an only son among five sisters a poltroon a weak lad ugly but swift of foot and an enthusiastic lover of horses he asks for the steeds of achilles which hector swears to give him and to be lightly clad he takes merely spear and bow and a cap of ferret skin with the pelt of a wolf for covering odysseus sees him approach he and diomede lie down among the dead till dolon passes then they chase him towards the achaean camp and catch him he offers ransom which before these last days of the war was often accepted odysseus replies evasively and asks for information dolon thinking that the bitterness of death is past explains that only the trojans have watchfires the allies more careless have none at the extreme flank of the host sleep the newly arrived thracians under their king rhesus who has golden armour and the fairest horses that ever i beheld the ruling passion for horses is strong in dolon and the greatest whiter than snow and for speed like the winds  having learned all that he needs to know diomede ruthlessly slays dolon odysseus thanks athene and hides the poor spoils of the dead marking the place they then creep into the dark camp of the sleeping thracians and as diomede slays them odysseus drags each body aside to leave a clear path for the horses that they may not plunge and tremble when they are led forth for they were not yet used to dead men no line in homer shows more intimate knowledge and realisation of horses and of war odysseus drives the horses of rhesus out of the camp with the bow of meriones he has forgotten to take the whip from the chariot diomede having slain king rhesus asleep thinks whether he shall lift out the chariot war chariots were very light or drag it by the pole but athene warns him to be going he springs upon the steeds and they make for their camp it is not clearly indicated whether they ride or drive x 5 i 3 527528 541 but suppose that they ride are we to conclude that the fact proves lateness the heroes always drive in homer but it is inconceivable that they could not ride in cases of necessity as here if diomede has thought it wiser not to bring out the chariot and harness the horses riding is mentioned in iliad xv 679 in a simile again in a simile odyssey v 37 i it is not the custom for heroes to ride the chariot is used in war and in travelling but when there are horses and no chariot men could not be so imbecile as not to mount the horses nor could the poet be so pedantic as not to make them do so  the shields would cause no difficulty they would be slung sideways like the shields of knights in the early middle ages the pair picking up dolons spoils as they pass hurry back to the chiefs where nestor welcomes them the others laugh and are encouraged to encourage them and his audience is the aim of the poet while the pair go to diomedes quarters wash off the blood and sweat from their limbs in the sea and then enter the polished baths common in the odyssey unnamed in the iliad but on no other occasion in the iliad are we admitted to view this part of heroic toilette nowhere else in fact do we accompany a hero to his quarters and his tub after the days work is over achilles however refuses to wash after fighting in his grief for patroclus though plenty of water was being heated for the purpose and it is to be presumed that a bath was ready for the water iliad xxiii 40 see too for hectors bath xxii 444  the two heroes then refresh themselves breakfast in fact and drink as is natural by this time the dawn must have been in the sky and in book xi men are stirring with the dawn such is the story of book x the reader may decide as to whether it is very late barely homeric or a late and deliberate piece of burlesque footnote henry classical review march 1906 or whether it is very homeric though the whole set of situationsa night of terror an anxious chief a nocturnal adventureare unexampled in the poem  the poets audience of warriors must have been familiar with such situations and must have appreciated the humorous ruthless treatment of dolon the spoiled only brother of five sisters mr monro admitted that dolon is shakespearian but added too shakespearian for homer one may as well say that agincourt in henry v is too homeric for shakespeare  mr monro argued that the tenth book comes in awkwardly after the ninth nitzsche thinks just the reverse the patriotic warrior audience would delight in the doloneia after the anguish of book ix would laugh with odysseus at the close of his adventure and rejoice with the other achaeans x 505  the introductory part of the book is cumbrous says mr monro to us it is if we wish to get straight to the adventure just as the customary delays in book xix before achilles is allowed to fight are tedious to us but the poets audience did not necessarily share our tastes and might take pleasure as i do in the curious details of the opening of book x the poet was thinking of his audience not of modern professors  we hear no more of rhesus and his thracians of rhesus there was no more to hear and his people probably went home like glenbuckies stewarts after the mysterious death of their chief in ampriors house of leny before prestonpans 1745 glenbuckie was mysteriously pistolled in the night the style and tone is unlike that of the iliad  it is rather akin to comedy of a rough farcical kind but it was time for comic relief if the story of dolon be comic it is comic with the practical humour of the sagas in an isolated nocturnal adventure and massacre we cannot expect the style of an heroic battle under the sunlight is the poet not to be allowed to be various and is the scene of the porter in macbeth in style and tone like the rest of the drama macbeth act ii sc 3 here of course shakespeare indulges infinitely more in comedy of a rough practical kind than does the author of the doloneia  the humour and the cruelty do not exceed what is exhibited in many of the gabes or insulting boasts of heroes over dead foes in other parts of the iliad such as the taunting comparison of a warrior falling from his chariot to a diver after oysters or as one of the argives hath caught the spear in his flesh and leaning thereon for a staff methinks that he will go down within the house of hades xiv 455457 the iliad like the sagas is rich in this extremely practical humour  mr leaf says that the book must have been composed before the iliad had reached its present form for it cannot have been meant to follow on book ix it is rather another case of a parallel rival to that book coupled with it only in the final literary redaction which mr leaf dates in the middle of the sixth century the book must have been composed before the iliad had reached its present form footnote iliad vol i p 424 it is not easy to understand this decision for as mr leaf had previously written about book ix 6068 the posting of the watch is at least not necessary to the story and it has a suspicious air of being merely a preparation for the next book which is much later and which turns entirely upon a visit to the sentinels footnote companion p174  now a military audience would not have pardoned the poet of book ix if in the circumstances of defeat with a confident enemy encamped within striking distance he had not made the achaeans throw forth their outposts the thing was inevitable and is not suspicious but the poet purposely makes the advanced guard consist of young men under nestors son and meriones he needs them for book x therefore the poet of book ix is the poet of book x preparing his effect in advance or the poet of book x is a man who cleverly takes advantage of book ix or he composed his poem of a night of terror and adventure in the air and the editor of 540 bc having heard it recited and copied it out went back to book ix and inserted the advanced guard under thrasymedes and meriones to lead up to book x  on mr leafs present theory footnote iliad vol i p424 book x we presume was meant not to follow book ix but to follow the end of book vii being an alternative to book viii composed he says to lead up to book ix and book ix but book vii closes with the achaean refusal of the compromise offered by paristhe restoration of the property but not of the wife of menelaus the trojans and achaeans feast all night the trojans feast in the city there is therefore no place here for book x after book vii and the achaeans cannot roam about all night as they are feasting nor can agamemnon be in the state of anxiety exhibited by him in book x  book x could not exist without book ix and must have been meant to follow on it mr leaf sees that in his preface to book ix footnote iliad vol i p 371 the placing of sentinels in book ix 80 84 is needed as an introduction to book x but has nothing to do with this book ix but we have said it was inevitable given the new situation in book ix an achaean repulse and the enemy camped in front that an advanced guard must be placed even if there proved to be no need of their services we presume that mr leafs literary editor finding that book x existed and that the advanced guard was a necessity of its action went back to book ix and introduced an advanced guard of young men with its captains thrasymedes and meriones even after this the editor had much to do if book ix originally exhibited agamemnon as not in terror and despair as it now does  we need not throw the burden of all this work on the editor as mr leaf elsewhere writes in a different mind the tenth book is obviously adapted to its present place in the iliad for it assumes a moment when achilles is absent from the field and when the greeks are in deep dejection from a recent defeat these conditions are exactly fulfilled by the situation at the end of book ix footnote companion p 190  this is certainly the case the tenth book could not exist without the ninth yet mr leafs new opinion is that it cannot have been meant to follow on book ix footnote iliad vol i p 424 he was better inspired when he held the precisely opposite opinion  dr adolf kiene footnote die epen des homer zweiter theil pp 9094 hanover 1884 accepts book xi as originally composed to fill its present place in the iliad he points out the despondency of the chiefs after receiving the reply of achilles and supposes that even diomede ix 708 only urges agamemnon to array before the ships thy folk and horsemen for defensive battle but encouraged by the success of the night adventure agamemnon next day assumes the offensive to consider thus is perhaps to consider too curiously but it is clear that the achaeans have been much encouraged by the events of book x especially agamemnon whose character as kiene observes is very subtly and consistently treated and lies near the poets heart this is the point which we keep urging agamemnons care for menelaus is strictly preserved in book x  nitzsche i 897 writes between book ix and book xi there is a gap that gap the doloneia fills it must have been composed to be part of the iliad but he thinks that the doloneia has taken the place of an earlier lay which filled the gap footnote die echtheit der doloneia p 32 programme des k k staats gymnasium zu marburg 1877 that the book is never referred to later in the iliad even if it be true is no great argument against its authenticity for when later references are made to book ix they are dismissed as clever late interpolations if the horses of rhesus took part as they do not in the sports at the funeral of patroclus the passage would be called a clever interpolation in fact diomede had better horses divine horses to run however it is certainly remarkable that the interpolation was not made by one of the interpolators of critical theory  meanwhile there is we think a reference to book x in book xiv footnote this was pointed out to me by mr shewan to whose great knowledge of homer i am here much indebted  in iliad xiv 911 we read that nestor in his quarters with the wounded machaon on the day following the night of dolons death hears the cry of battle and goes out to see what is happening he took the wellwrought shield of his son horse taming thrasymedes which was lying in the hut all glistening with bronze but the son had the shield of his father  why had thrasymedes the shield of his father at about 3 am before dawn the shield of nestor was lying beside him in his own bedroom book x 76 and at the same moment his son thrasymedes was on outpost duty and had his own shield with him book ix 81  when then did father and son exchange shields and why mr leaf says it is useless to inquire why father and son had thus changed shields as the scholiasts of course do  the scholiasts merely babble homer of course meant something by this exchange of shields which occurred late in the night of book ix or very early in the following day that of books xixvi  let us follow again the sequence of events on the night before the day when nestor had thrasymedes shield and thrasymedes had nestors thrasymedes was sent out with shield and all in command of one of the seven companies of an advanced guard posted between fosse and wall in case of a camisade by the trojans who were encamped on the plain ix 81 with him in command were meriones and five other young men less notable they had supplies with them and whatever was needed they cooked supper in bivouac  in the doloneia the wakeful princes after inspecting the advanced guard go forward within view of the trojan ranks and consult with them they take nestors son thrasymedes and meriones x 196 the two young men being on active service are armed the princes are not diomede having been suddenly roused out of sleep with no intention to fight merely threw on his dressinggown a lions skin nestor wore a thick double purple dressinggown odysseus had cast his shield about his shoulders it was decided that odysseus and diomede should enter the trojan camp and prove a jeopardy diomede had no weapon but his spear so thrasymedes who is armed as we saw lends him his bullshide cap that keeps the heads of stalwart youths his sword for that of diomede was left at the ships and his shield  diomede and odysseus successfully achieve their adventure and return to the chiefs where they talk with nestor and then they go to diomedes hut and drink the outposts remain of course at their stations  meanwhile thrasymedes having lent his shield to diomede has none of his own naturally as he was to pass the night under arms he would send to his fathers quarters for the old mans shield a sword and a helmet he would remain at his post his men had provisions till the general reveillez at dawn and would then breakfast at his post and go into the fray nestor therefore missing his shield would send round to diomedes quarters for the shield of thrasymedes which had been lent overnight to diomede would take it into the fight and would bring it back to his own hut when he carried the wounded machaon thither out of the battle when he arms to go out and seek for information he picks up the shield of thrasymedes  nothing can be more obvious the poet being a man of imagination not a professor sees it all and casually mentions that the son had the fathers and the father had the sons shield his audience men of the sword see the case as clearly as the poet does only we moderns and the scholiasts almost as modern as ourselves are puzzled  it may also be argued though we lay no stress on it that in book xi 312 when agamemnon has been wounded we find odysseus and diomede alone together without their contingents because they have not separated since they breakfasted together after returning from the adventure of book x and thus they have come rather late to the field they find the achaeans demoralised by the wounding of agamemnon and they make a stand what ails us asks odysseus that we forget our impetuous valour the passage appears to take up the companionship of odysseus and diomede who were left breakfasting together at the end of book x and are not mentioned till we meet them again in this scene of book xi as if they had just come on the field  as to the linguistic tests of lateness there are exceptionally numerous traces of later formation says mr monro while fick tout contraire writes clumsy ionisms are not common and as a rule occur in these parts which on older grounds show themselves to be late interpolations the cases of agreement between fick and mr monro are few and the passages thus condemned are not more numerous in the doloneia than in any average book footnote jevons journal of hellenic studies vii p 302 the six examples of a posthomeric use of the article do not seem so very posthomeric to an ordinary intelligenceparallels occur in book iand perfects in greek ka from derivative verbs do not destroy the impression of antiquity and unity which is left by the treatment of character by the celebrated cap with boars tusks which no human being could archaeologically reconstruct in the seventh century and by the homeric vigour in such touches as the horses unused to dead men as the iliad certainly passed through centuries in which its language could not but be affected by linguistic changes as it could not escape from remaniements consciously or unconsciously introduced by reciters and copyists the linguistic objections are not strongly felt by us an unphilological reader of homer notes that duntzer thinks the doloneia older than the oldest portion of the odyssey while gemoll thinks that the author of the doloneia was familiar with the odyssey footnote duntzer homer abhanglungen p 324 gemoll hermes xv 557 ff  meanwhile one thing seems plain to us when the author of book ix posted the guards under thrasymedes he was deliberately leading up to book x while the casual remark in book xiv about the exchange of shields between father and son nestor and thrasymedes glances back at book x and possibly refers to some lost and more explicit statement  it is not always remembered that if things could drop into the interpolations things could also drop out of the iliad causing lacunae during the dark backward of its early existence  if the doloneia be barely homeric as father browne holds this opinion was not shared by the listeners or readers of the sixth century the vase painters often illustrate the doloneia but it does not follow that the story was fresh because it was popular as mr leaf suggests and was treated as public property in a different way namely in a comic way from the consecrated early legends iliad ii 424 425 the sixth century vase painters illustrated many passages in homer not the doloneia alone the comic way was the ruthless humour of two strong warriors capturing one weak coward much later wild caricature was applied in vase painting to the most romantic scenes in the odyssey which were consecrated enough     chapter xiv   the interpolations of nestor  that several of the passages in which nestor speaks are very late interpolations meant to glorify pisistratus himself of nestors line is a critical opinion to which we have more than once alluded the first example is in iliad ii 530568 this passage is meant at once to present nestor as the leading counsellor of the greek army and to introduce the coming catalogue footnote leaf iliad vol i p 70 now the catalogue originally formed an introduction to the whole cycle footnote ibid vol i p 87 but to repeat an earlier observation surely the whole cycle was much later than the period of pisistratus and his sons that is the compilation of the homeric and cyclic poems into one body of verse named the cycle is believed to have been much later  it is objected that nestors advice in this passage separate thy warriors by tribes and clans greek phyla phraetras is out of place in the last year of the war but this suggestion for military reorganisation may be admitted as a mere piece of poetical perspective like helens description of the achaean chiefs in book iii or nestor may wish to return to an obsolete system of clan regiments the athenians had tribes and clans political institutions and nestors advice is noted as a touch of late attic influence but about the nature and origin of these social divisions we know so little that it is vain to argue about them the advice of nestor is an appeal to the clan spirita very serviceable military spirit as the highlanders have often proved but we have no information as to whether it existed in achaean times nestor speaks as the aged lochiel spoke to claverhouse before killiecrankie did the athenian army of the sixth century fight in clan regiments the device seems to belong to an earlier civilisation whether it survived in sixth century athens or not it is of course notorious that tribes and clans are most flourishing among the most backward people though they were welded into the constitution of athens the passage therefore cannot with any certainty be dismissed as very late for the words for tribe and clan could not be novel athenian inventions the institutions designated being of prehistoric origin  nestor shows his tactics again in iv 303309 offers his inopportune tactical lucubrations doubtless under athenian pisistratean influence the poet is here denied a sense of humour that a veteran military polonius should talk as inopportunely about tactics as dugald dalgetty does about the sconce of drumsnab is an essential part of the humour of the character of nestor this is what nestors critics do not see the inopportune nature of his tactical remarks is the point of them just as in the case of the laird of drumthwacket that should be scott knew little of homer but coincided in the nestorian humour by mere congruity of genius the pisistratidze must have been humourless if they did not see that the poet smiled as he composed nestors speeches glorifying old deeds of his own and old ways of fighting he arrays his pylians with chariots in front footmen in the rear in the blank space the princely heroes dismounted to fight the chariots following close behind them footnote iliad xi 4856 in the same way during the hundred years war the english knights dismounted and defeated the french chivalry till under jeanne darc and la hire the french learned the lesson and imitated the english practice on the other hand egyptian wallpaintings show the egyptian chariotry advancing in neat lines and serried squadrons according to nestor these had of old been the achaean tactics and he preferred the old way nestors advice in book iv is not to dismount or break the line of chariots these he says were the old tactics even so is the far better way thus moreover did men of old time lay low cities and walls there was to be no rushing of individuals from the ranks no dismounting nestors were not the tactics of the heroesthey usually dismount and do single valiances but nestor commanding his local contingent recommends the methods of the old school greek hoi pretoroi what can be more natural and characteristic  the poets meaning seems quite clear he is not flattering pisistratus but with quiet humour offers the portrait of a vain worthy veteran it is difficult to see how this point can be missed it never was missed before nestors speeches seemed serviceable to the pisistratean theory of the composition of the iliad in his first edition mr leaf regarded the interpolations as intended to glorify nestor without reference to pisistratus whom mr leaf did not then recognise as the master of a sycophantic editor the passages are really meant to display the old mans habit of glorifying himself and past times pisistratus could not feel flattered by passages intended to exhibit his ancestor as a conceited and inopportune old babbler i ventured in 1896 to suggest that the interpolator was trying to please pisistratus but this was said in a spirit of mockery  of all the characters in homer that of nestor is most familiar to the unlearned world merely because nestors is a character part very broadly drawn  the third interpolation of flattery to pisistratus in the person of nestor is found in vii 125160 the achaean chiefs are loath to accept the challenge of hector to single combat only menelaus rises and arms himself moved by the strong sense of honour which distinguishes a warrior notoriously deficient in bodily strength agamemnon refuses to let him fight the other peers make no movement and nestor rebukes them it is entirely in nature that he should fall back on his memory of a similar situation in his youth when the arcadian champion ereuthalion challenged any prince of the pylians and when no man plucked up heart to meet him except nestor himself had there never been any pisistratus any poet who created the part of a worthy and wordy veteran must have made nestor speak just as he does speak ereuthalion was the tallest and strongest of men that i have slain and nestor being what he is offers copious and interesting details about the armour of ereuthalion and about its former owners the passage is like those in which the icelandic sagamen dwelt lovingly on the history of a good sword or the maoris on the old possessors of an ancient jade patu an objection is now taken to nestors geography he is said not to know the towns and burns of his own country he speaks of the swift stream keladon the streams of iardanus and the walls of pheia pheia is no doubt the same as pheai footnote monro note on odyssey xv 297 odyssey xv 297 but that was a maritime town not near arkadia there is nothing known of a keladon or iardanus anywhere near it now didymus schol a is said to have read greek phaeraes for greek pheias following pherekydes footnote leaf iliad vol i 308 m victor bérard who has made an elaborate study of elian topography says that pheia is a cape not a town and adopts the reading phera the greek pherae of the journey of telemachus in the odyssey he thinks that the greek pherae of nestor is the aliphera of polybius and believes that the topography of nestor and of the journey of telemachus is correct the keladon is now the river or burn of saint isidore the iardanus is at the foot of mount kaiapha keladon has obviously the same sense as the gaelic altgarbh the rough and brawling stream iardanus is also a stream in crete and mr leaf thinks it semiticyarden from yarad to flow but the semites did not give the yar to the yarrow nor to the australian yarra yarra  the country says m bérard is a network of rivers burns and rivulets and we cannot have any certainty we may add as the same river and burn names recur in many parts of the same country footnote bérard les phéniciens et lodyssée 108113 1902 many of them in england are plainly praeceltic  while the correct geography may on this showing be that of homer we cannot give up homers claim to nestors speech as to nestors tale about the armour of ereuthalion it is manifest that the first owner of the armour of ereuthalion namely areithous the maceman so called because he had the singularity of fighting with an iron cassetête as nestor explains vii 138140 was a famous character in legendary history he appears as prince areithous the maceman father or grandfather of an areithous slain by hector vii 810 in greece it was not unusual for the grandson to bear the grandfathers name and if the maceman was grandfather of hectors victim there is no chronological difficulty the chronological difficulty in any case if hectors victim is the son of the maceman is not at all beyond a poetic narrators possibility of error in genealogy if nestors speech is a late interpolation if its late author borrowed his vivid account of the maceman and his casse tête from the mere word maceman in vii 9 he must be credited with a lively poetic imagination  few or none of these reminiscences of nestor are really inapplicable to the context here the context demands encouragement for heroes who shun a challenge nestor mentions an applicable and apposite instance of similar want of courage and as his character demands he is the hero of his own story his brag or gabe about he was the tallest and strongest of all the men i ever slew is deliciously in keeping and reminds us of the college don who said of the czar he is the nicest emperor i ever met the poet is sketching an innocent vanity he is not flattering pisistratus  the next case is the long narrative of nestor to the hurried patroclus who has been sent by achilles to bring news of the wounded machaon xi 604702 nestor on this occasion has useful advice to give namely that achilles if he will not fight should send his men under patroclus to turn the tide of trojan victory but the poet wishes to provide an interval of time and of yet more dire disaster before the return of patroclus to achilles by an obvious literary artifice he makes nestor detain the reluctant patroclus with a long story of his own early feats of arms it is a story of a hottrod so called in border law the eleians had driven a creagh of cattle from the pylians who pursued and nestor killed the eleian leader itymoneus the speech is an achaean parallel to the border ballad of jamie telfer of the fair dodhead in editing which scott has been accused of making a singular and most obvious and puzzling blunder in the topography of his own sheriffdom of the forest on scotts showing the scene of the raid is in upper ettrickdale not as critics aver in upper teviotdale thus the narrative of the ballad would be impossible footnote in fact both sites on the two dodburns are impossible the fault lay with the balladmaker not with scott  the pisistratean editor is accused of a similar error no doubt he was an asiatic greek completely ignorant of the peloponnesus footnote iliad note to xi 756 and to the catalogue ii 615617 it is something to know that pisistratus employed an editor or that his editor employed a collaborator who was an asiatic greek  meanwhile nothing is less secure than arguments based on the catalogue we have already shown how mr leafs opinions as to the date and historical merits of the catalogue have widely varied while m bérard appears to have vindicated the topography of nestor of the catalogue mr allen writes as a table according to regions of agamemnons forces it bears every mark of venerable antiquity showing a state of things which never recurred in later history and which no one had any interest to invent or even the means for inventing he makes a vigorous defence of the catalogue as regards the dominion of achilles against mr leaf footnote classical review may 1906 pp x94201 into the details we need not go but it is not questions of homeric topography obscure as they are that can shake our faith in the humorous portrait of old nestor or make us suppose that the sympathetic mockery of the poet is the sycophantic adulation of the editor to his statesman employer pisistratus if any question may be left to literary discrimination it is the authentic originality of the portrayal of nestor     chapter xv   the comparative study of early epics  though comparison is the method of science the comparative study of the national poetry of warlike aristocracies its conditions of growth and decadence has been much neglected by homeric critics sir richard jebb touched on the theme and after devoting four pages to a sketch of sanskrit finnish persian and early teutonic heroic poetry and saga decided that in our country as in others we fail to find any true parallel to the case of the homeric poems these poems must be studied in themselves without looking for aid in this sense to the comparative method footnote homer p 135 part of this conclusion seems to us rather hasty in a brief manual sir richard had not space for a thorough comparative study of old heroic poetry at large his quoted sources are for india lassen for france mr saintsburys short history of french literature sixteen pages on this topic and a work unknown to me by m paul for iceland he only quoted the encyclopedia britannica mr edmund gosse for germany lachmann and bartsch for the finnish kalewala the encyclopedia britannica mr sime and mr keltie and for england a primer of english literature by mr stopford brooke  these sources appear less than adequate and celtic heroic romance is entirely omitted a much deeper and wider comparative criticism of early heroic national poetry is needed before any one has a right to say that the study cannot aid our critical examination of the homeric problem many peoples have passed through a stage of culture closely analogous to that of achaean society as described in the iliad and odyssey every society of this kind has had its ruling military class its ancient legends and its minstrels who on these legends have based their songs the similarity of human nature under similar conditions makes it certain that comparison will discover useful parallels between the poetry of societies separated in time and space but practically identical in culture it is not much to the credit of modern criticism that a topic so rich and interesting has been at least in england almost entirely neglected by homeric scholars  meanwhile it is perfectly correct to say as sir richard observes that we fail to find any true parallel to the case of the homeric poems for we nowhere find the legends of an heroic age handled by a very great poetthe greatest of all poets except in the iliad and odyssey but on the other hand the critics refuse to believe that in the iliad and odyssey we possess the heroic achaean legends handled by one great poet they find a composite by many hands good and bad and of many ages they say sometimes the whole composition and part of the poems are ascribed to a late littérateur now to that supposed state of things we do find several true parallels in germany in finland in ireland but the results of work by these many hands in many ages are anything but a true parallel to the results which lie before us in the iliad and odyssey where the processes of composite authorship throughout many ages certainly occur as in germany and ireland there we find no true parallel to the homeric poems it follows that in all probability no such processes as the critics postulate produced the iliad and odyssey for where the processes existed beyond doubt they failed egregiously to produce the results  sir richards argument would have been logical if many efforts by many hands in many ages in england finland ireland iceland and germany did actually produce true parallels to the achaean epics they did not and why not simply because these other races had no homer all the other necessary conditions were present the legendary material the heroic society the court minstrels all except the great poet in all the countries mentioned except finland there existed military aristocracies with their courts castles and minstrels while the minstrels had rich material in legendary history and in myth and märchen and old songs but none of the minstrels was adequate to the production of an english german or irish iliad or odyssey or even of a true artistic equivalent in france  we have tried to show that the critics rejecting a homer have been unable to advance any adequate hypothesis to account for the existence of the iliad and odyssey now we see that where such conditions of production as they postulate existed but where there was no great epic genius they can find no true parallels to the epics their logic thus breaks down at both ends  it may be replied that in nongreek lands one condition found in greek society failed the succession of a reading age to an age of heroic listeners but this is not so in france and germany an age of readers duly began but they did not mainly read copies of the old heroic poems they turned to lyric poetry as in greece and they recast the heroic songs into modern and popular forms in verse and prose when they took any notice of the old heroic poems at all  one merit of the greek epics is a picture of a certain phase of early civilisation and that picture is a naturally harmonious whole with unity of impression says sir richard jebb footnote homer p 37 certainly we can find no true parallel on an homeric scale to this harmonious picture in the epics of germany and england or in the early literature of ireland sir richard for england omits notice of beowulf but we know that beowulf a long heroic poem is a mass of anachronismsa heathen legend in a christian setting the hero that great heathen champion has his epic filled full of christian allusions and christian morals because the clerical redactor in christian england could not but intrude these things into old pagan legends evolved by the continental ancestors of our race he had no painful anxiety like the supposed ionic continuators of the achaean poems when they are not said to have done precisely the reverse to preserve harmony of ancient ideas such archaeological anxieties are purely modern  if we take the nibelungenlied footnote see chapter on the nibelungenlied in homer and the epic pp 382 404 we find that it is a thing of many rehandlings even in existing manuscripts for example the greeks clung to the hexameter in homer not so did the germans adhere to old metres the poem that in the oldest ms is written in assonances in later mss is reduced to regular rhymes and is retouched in many essential respects the matter of the nibelungenlied is of heathen origin we see the real state of heathen affairs in the icelandic versions of the same tale for the icelanders were peculiar in preserving ancient lays and when these were woven into a prose saga the archaic and heathen features were retained had the postchristian prose author of the volsunga been a great poet we might find in his work a true parallel to the iliad but though he preserves the harmony of his picture of prechristian princely life save in the savage beginnings of his story he is not a poet so the true parallel to the greek epic fails noble as is the saga in many passages in the german nibelungenlied all is modernised the characters are christian the manners are chivalrous and märchen older than homer are forced into a wandering mediaeval chroniclepoem the germans in short had no early poet of genius and therefore could not produce a true parallel to iliad or odyssey the mediaeval poets of course never dreamed of archaeological anxiety as the supposed ionian continuators are sometimes said to have done any more than did the french and late welsh handlers of the ancient celtic arthurian materials the late german bearbeiter of the nibelungenlied has no idea of unity of plotenfin germany having excellent and ancient legendary material for an epic but producing no parallel to iliad and odyssey only proves how absolutely essential a homer was to the greek epics  if any inference could properly be drawn from the edda the icelandic collection of heroic lays says sir richard jebb it would be that short separate poems on cognate subjects can long exist as a collection without coalescing into such an artistic whole as the iliad or the odyssey footnote homer p 33  it is our own argument that sir richard states short separate poems on cognate subjects can certainly coexist for long anywhere but they cannot automatically and they cannot by aid of an editor become a long epic nobody can stitch and vamp them into a poem like the iliad or odyssey to produce a poem like either of these a great poetic genius must arise and fuse the ancient materials as hephaestus fused copper and tin and then cast the mass into a mould of his own making a small poet may reduce the legends and lays into a very inartistic whole a very inharmonious whole as in the nibelungenlied but a controlling poet not a mere redactor or editor is needed to perform even that feat  where a man who is not a poet undertakes to produce the coalescence as dr lönnrot 18351849 did in the case of the peasant not courtly lays of finland he fails to prove that mere combining and editing can form an artistic whole out of originally distinct songs even though concerned with closely related themes says sir richard jebb footnote homer p 134 135  this is perfectly true much as lönnrot botched and vamped the finnish lays he made no epic out of them but as it is true how did the late athenian drudge of pisistratus succeed where lönnrot failed in the dovetailing of the odyssey we see the work of one mind says sir richard footnote homer p 129 this mind cannot have been the property of any one but a great poet obviously as the odyssey is confessedly an artistic whole consequently the disintegrators of the odyssey when they are logical are reduced to averring that the poem is an exceedingly inartistic whole a whole not artistic at all while mr leaf calls it a model of skilful construction wilamowitz mollendorff denounces it as the work of a slenderlygifted botcher of about 650 bc a century previous to mr leafs athenian editor  thus we come after all to a crisis in which mere literary appreciation is the only test of the truth about a work of literature the odyssey is an admirable piece of artistic composition or it is the very reverse blass mr leaf sir richard jebb and the opinion of the ages declare that the composition is excellent a crowd of german critics and father browne sj hold that the composition is feeble the criterion is the literary taste of each party to the dispute kirchhoff and wilamowitz möllendorff see a late bad patchwork where mr leaf sir richard jebb blass wolf and the verdict of all mankind see a masterpiece of excellent construction the world has judged the odyssey is a marvel of construction therefore is not the work of a late botcher of disparate materials but of a great early poet yet sir richard jebb while recognising the odyssey as an artistic whole and an harmonious picture and recognising lönnrots failure to prove that mere combining and editing can form an artistic whole out of originally distinct songs even though concerned with closely related themes thinks that kirchhoff has made the essence of his theory of late combination of distinct strata of poetical material from different sources and periods in the odyssey in the highest degree probable footnote homer p 131  it is of course possible that mr leaf who has not edited the odyssey may now in deference to his belief in the pisistratean editor have changed his opinion of the merits of the poem if the odyssey like the iliad was till about 540 bc a chaos of lays of all ages variously known in various répertoires of the rhapsodists and patched up by the pisistratean editor then of two things oneeither mr leaf abides by his enthusiastic belief in the excellency of the composition or he does not if he does still believe that the composition of the odyssey is a masterpiece then the pisistratean editor was a great master of construction if he now on the other hand agrees with wilamowitz möllendorff that the odyssey is cobblers work then his literary opinions are unstable     chapter xvi   homer and the french mediaeval epics  sir richard jebb remarks with truth that before any definite solution of the homeric problem could derive scientific support from such analogies with epics of other peoples it would be necessary to show that the particular conditions under which the homeric poems appear in early greece had been reproduced with sufficient closeness elsewhere footnote homer pp 131 132 now we can show that the particular conditions under which the homeric poems confessedly arose were reproduced with sufficient closeness elsewhere except that no really great poet was elsewhere present  this occurred among the germanic aristocracy the franks of france in the eleventh twelfth and early thirteenth centuries of our era the closeness of the whole parallel allowing for the admitted absence in france of a very great and truly artistic poet is astonishing  we have first in france answering to the achaean aristocracy the frankish noblesse of warriors dwelling in princely courts and strong castles dominating an older population owing a practically doubtful fealty to an overlord the king passing their days in the chace in private war or in revolt against the overlord and for all literary entertainment depending on the recitations of epic poems by jongleurs who in some cases are of gentle birth and are the authors of the poems which they recite  this national poetry says m gaston paris was born and mainly developed among the warlike class princes lords and their courts at first no doubt some of these men of the sword themselves composed and chanted lays like achilles but soon there arose a special class of poets  they went from court to court from castle  later when the townsfolk began to be interested in their chants they sank a degree and took their stand in public open places  footnote literature française au moyen age pp 36 37 1898  in the iliad we hear of no minstrels in camp in the odyssey a prince has a minstrel among his retainers demodocus at the court of phaeacia phemius in the house of odysseus in ionia when princes had passed away rhapsodists recited for gain in marketplaces and at fairs the parallel with france is so far complete  the french national epics like those of the achaeans deal mainly with legends of a long past legendary age to the french authors the greatness and the fortunes of the emperor charles and other heroic heads of great houses provide a theme the topics of song are his wars and the prowess and the quarrels of his peers with the emperor and among themselves these are seen magnified through a mist of legend saracens are substituted for gascon foes and the great charles so nobly venerable a figure in the oldest french epic the chanson de roland circ 10501070 in its earliest extant form is more degraded in the later epics than agamemnon himself the machinery of the gods in homer is replaced by the machinery of angels but the machinery of dreams is in vogue as in the iliad and odyssey the sources are traditional and legendary  we know that brief early lays of charles and other heroes had existed and they may have been familiar to the french epic poets but they were not merely patched into the epics the form of verse is not balladlike but a series of laisses of decasyllabic lines each laisse presenting one assonance not rhyme as time went on rhyme and alexandrine lines were introduced and the old epics were expanded altered condensed remaniés with progressive changes in taste metre language manners and ways of life  finally an age of cyclic poems began authors took new characters whom they attached by false genealogies to the older heroes and they chanted the adventures of the sons of the former heroes like the cyclic poet who sang of the son of odysseus by circe all these conditions are undeniably true parallels to the conditions under which the homeric poems appeared the only obvious point of difference vanishes if we admit with sir richard jebb and m salomon reinach the possibility of the existence of written texts in the greece of the early iron age  we do not mean texts prepared for a reading public in france such a public demanding texts for reading did not arise till the decadence of the epic the oldest french texts of their epics are small volumes each page containing some thirty lines in one column such volumes were carried about by the jongleurs who chanted their own or other mens verses they were not in the hands of readers footnote Épopées françaises léon gautier vol i pp 226228 1878  an example of an authorreciter jendeus de brie he was the maker of the first version of the bataille loquifer twelfth century is instructive of jendeus de brie it is said that he wrote the poem kept it very carefully taught it to no man made much gain out of it in sicily where he sojourned and left it to his son when he died similar statements are made in renaus de montauban the existing late version is of the thirteenth century about huon de villeneuve who would not part with his poem for horses or furs or for any price and about other poets footnote Épopées françaises léon gautier vol i p 215 note i  these early jongleurs were men of position and distinction their theme was the gestes of princes they were not under the ban with which the church pursued vulgar strollers men like the greek rhapsodists pindars story that homer wrote the cypria footnote pindari opera vol iii p 654 boeckh and gave the copy as the dowry of his daughter to stasinus who married her could only have arisen in greece in circumstances exactly like those of jendeus de brie jendeus lived on his poem by reciting it and left it to his son when he died the story of homer and stasinus could only have been invented in an age when the possession of the solitary text of a poem was a source of maintenance to the poet this condition of things could not exist either when there were no written texts or when such texts were multiplied to serve the wants of a reading public  again a poet in the fortunate position of jendeus would not teach his epic in a school of reciters unless he were extremely well paid in later years after his death his poem came through copies good or bad into circulation  late in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we hear of a school of jongleurs at beauvais in lent they might not ply their profession so they gathered at beauvais where they could learn cantilenae new lays footnote Épopées françaises léon gautier vol ii pp 174 175 but by that time the epic was decadent and dying  the audiences of the jongleurs too were no longer by that time what they had been the rich and great now had library copies of the epics not small jongleurs copies but folios richly illuminated and bound with two or three columns of matter on each page footnote ibid vol i p 228 see too photographs of an illuminated doublecolumned library copy in la chancun de willame london 1903  the age of recitations from a text in princely halls was ending or ended the age of a reading public was begun the earlier condition of the jongleur who was his own poet and carefully guarded his copyright in spite of all temptations to permit the copying of his ms is regarded by sir richard jebb as quite a possible feature of early greece he thinks that there was no wide circulation of writings by numerous copies for a reading public before the end of the fifth century bc as greek mercenaries could write and write well in the seventh to sixth centuries i incline to think that there may then and earlier have been a reading public however long before that a man might commit his poems to writing wolf allows that some men did as early at least as 776 bc the verses might never be read by anybody except himself the author or those to whom he privately bequeathed them as jendeus de brie bequeathed his poem to his son but his end would have been gained footnote homer p 113  recent discoveries as to the very early date of linear non phoenician writing in crete of course increase the probability of this opinion which is corroborated by the story of the cypria given as a dowry with the authors daughter thus the particular conditions under which the homeric poems appeared been reproduced with sufficient closeness in every respect with surprising closeness in the france of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries the social conditions are the same the legendary materials are of identical character the method of publication by recitation is identical the cyclic decadence occurs in both cases the monomanie cyclique in the greece of homer we have the four necessary conditions of the epic as found by m léon gautier in mediaeval france we have  1 an uncritical age confusing history by legend  2 we have a national milieu with religious uniformity  3 we have poems dealing with   old unhappy faroff things  and battles long ago  4 we have representative heroes the overlord and his peers or paladins footnote Épopées françaises léon gautier vol i pp 69  it may be added that in greece as in france some poets adapt into the adventures of their heroes worldold märchen as in the odyssey and in the cycle of the parents of charles  in the french as in the greek epics we have such early traits of poetry as the textual repetition of speeches and the recurring epithets swiftfooted achilles charles of the white beard blameless heroes however blamable ladies however old are always of the clear face thus the technical manners of the french and greek epics are closely parallel they only differ in the exquisite art of homer to which no approach is made by the french poets  the french authors of epic even more than homer abound in episodes much more distracting than those of the iliad of blood and wounds of course both the french and the greek are profuse they were writing for men of the sword not for modern critics indeed the battle pieces of france almost translate those of homer the achaean does on his goodly corslet the french knight sur ses espalles son halberc li colad the achaean with his great sword shears off an arm at the shoulder the french knight  trenchad le braz  parmi leschine sun grant espee li passe  the huge shield of aias becomes cele grant targe duble in france and the warriors boast over their slain in france as in the iliad in france as in greece a favourite epic theme was the wrath of a hero of achilles of roland of ganelon of odysseus and achilles wrangling at a feast to the joy of agamemnon glad that the bravest of his peers were at strife footnote odyssey viii 757s sic  of all the many parallels between the greek and french epics the most extraordinary is the coincidence between charles with his peers and agamemnon with his princes the same historical conditions occurred at an interval of more than two thousand years agamemnon is the bretwalda the overlord as mr freeman used to say of the achaeans he is the suzerain charles in the french epics holds the same position but the french poets regard him in different lights in the earliest epic the chanson de roland a divinity doth hedge the famous emperor whom jeanne darc styled st charlemagne he was in fact a man of thirty seven at the date of the disaster of roncesvaux where roland fell 778 ad but in the tradition that has reached the poet of the chanson he is a whitebearded warrior as vigorous as he is venerable as he rules by advice of his council he bids them deliberate on the proposals of the paynim king marsileto accept or refuse them roland the counterpart of achilles in all respects oliver is his patroclus is for refusing ganelon appears to have the rest with him when he speaks in favour of peace and return to france out of spain so in the iliad ii the achaeans lend a ready ear to agamemnon when he proposes the abandonment of the siege of troy each host french and achaean is heartily homesick  ganelons advice prevailing it is necessary to send an envoy to the saracen court it is a dangerous mission other envoys have been sent and been murdered the peers however volunteer beginning with the aged naismes the nestor of the franks his offer is not accepted nor are those of oliver roland and turpin roland then proposes that ganelon shall be sent and hence arises the wrath of ganelon which was the ruin of roland and the peers who stood by him the warriors attack each other in speeches of homeric fury charles preserves his dignity and ganelon departs on his mission he deliberately sells himself and seals the fate of the peers whom he detests the surprise of the rearguard under roland the deadly battle and the revenge of charles make up the rest of the poem not even in victory is charles allowed repose the trumpet again summons him to war he is of those whom heaven has called to endless combat  their whole lives long to be winding  skeins of grievous wars till every soul of them perish  in the words of diomede  such is the picture of the imperial charles in one of the oldest of the french epics the heart of the poet is with the aged but unbroken and truly imperial figure of st charlemagnewise just and brave a true shepherd of the people regarded as the conqueror of all the known kingdoms of the world he is among his fierce paladins like the conscience of a knight among his warring members the greatness of charlemagne has entered even into his name but as time went on and the feudal princes began the long struggle against the french king the poets gratified their patrons by degrading the character of the emperor they created a second type of charles and it is the second type that on the whole most resembles the agamemnon of the iliad  we ask why the widely ruling lord of golden mycenae is so skilfully and persistently represented as respectable indeed by reason of his office but detestable on the whole in character  the answer is that just as the second type of charles is the result of feudal jealousies of the king so the character of agamemnon reflects the princely hatreds of what we may call the feudal age of greece the masterly portrait of agamemnon could only have been designed to win the sympathies of feudal listeners princes with an overlord whom they cannot repudiate for whose office they have a traditional reverence but whose power they submit to with no good will and whose person and character some of them can barely tolerate   blank space an historical unity the poem deals with what may be called a feudal society and the attitudes of the achaean bretwalda and of his peers are from beginning to end of the iliad and in every book of it those of the peers and king in the later chansons de geste  returning to the decadent charles of the french epics we lay no stress on the story of his incest with his sister gilain whence sprang roland the house of thyestes whence agamemnon sprang is marked by even blacker legends the scandal is mythical like the same scandal about the king arthur who in romance is so much inferior to his knights a reflection of feudal jealousies and hatreds in places the reproaches hurled by the peers at charles read like paraphrases of those which the achaean princes cast at agamemnon even naismes the nestor of the french epics cries it is for you that we have left our lands and fiefs our fair wives and our children  but by the apostle to whom they pray in rome were it not that we should be guilty before god we would go back to sweet france and thin would be your host footnote chevalerie ogier 15101529 Épopées françaises léon gautier vol iii pp 156157 in the lines quoted we seem to hear the voice of the angered achilles we came not hither in our own quarrel thou shameless one but to please thee but now go i back to phthia with my shipsthe better part footnote iliad i 158169  agamemnon answers that zeus is on his side just as even the angry naismes admits that duty to god demands obedience to charles there cannot be parallels more close and true than these between poems born at a distance from each other of more than two thousand years but born in similar historical conditions  in guide bourgogne a poem of the twelfth century ogier cries they say that charlemagne is the conqueror of kingdoms they lie it is roland who conquers them with oliver naismes of the long beard and myself as to charles he eats compare achilles to agamemnon thou heavy with wine with dogs eyes and heart of deer never hast thou dared to arm thee for war with the host  footnote iliad i 227 228 gui de bourgogne pp 3741 it is achilles or roland who stakes his life in war and captures cities it is agamemnon or charles who camps by the wine charles in the chanson de saisnes abases himself before herapois even more abjectly than agamemnon in his offer of atonement to achilles footnote Épopées françaises léon gautier vol iii p 158 charles is as arrogant as agamemnon he strikes roland with his glove for an uncommanded victory and then he loses heart and weeps as copiously as the penitent agamemnon often does when he rues his arrogance footnote entrée en espagne  the poet of the iliad is a great and sober artist he does not make agamemnon endure the lowest disgraces which the latest french epic poets heap on charles but we see how close is the parallel between agamemnon and the charles of the decadent type both characters are reflections of feudal jealousy of the over lord both reflect real antique historical conditions and these were the conditions of the achaeans in europe not of the ionians in asia  the treatment of agamemnons character is harmonious throughout it is not as if in the original poem agamemnon were revered like st charlemagne in the chanson de roland and in the later parts of the iliad were reduced to the contemptible estate of the charles of the decadent chanson de geste in the iliad agamemnons character is consistently presented from beginning to end presented i think as it could only be by a great poet of the feudal achaean society in europe the ionians democratic to the core says mr leafwould either have taken no interest in the figure of the overlord or would have utterly degraded him below the level of the charles of the latest chansons or the late rhapsodists in their irresponsible lays would have presented a wavering and worthless portrait  the conditions under which the chansons arose were truly parallel to the conditions under which the homeric poems arose and the poems french and achaean are also true parallels except in genius the french have no homer cared vate sacro it follows that a homer was necessary to the evolution of the greek epics  it may perhaps be replied to this argument that our iliad is only a very late remaniement like the fourteenth century chansons de geste of something much earlier and nobler but in france in the age of remaniement even the versification had changed from assonance to rhyme from the decasyllabic line to the alexandrine in the decadence while a plentiful lack of seriousness and a love of purely fanciful adventures in fairyland take the place of the austere spirit of war ladies in a coming on humour abound and charles is involved with his paladins in gauloiseries of a rabelaisian cast the french language has become a new thing through and through and manners and weapons are of a new sort but the high seriousness of the iliad is maintained throughout except in the burlesque battle of the gods the versification is the stately hexameter linguistic alterations are present extant but inconspicuous that the armour and weapons are uniform in character throughout we have tried to prove while the state of society and of religion is certainly throughout harmonious our parallel then between the french and the greek national epics appears as perfect as such a thing can be surprisingly perfect while the great point of difference in degree of art is accounted for by the existence of an achaean poet of supreme genius not such certainly were the composers of the cyclic poems men contemporary with the supposed later poets of the iliad     chapter xvii   conclusion  the conclusion at which we arrive is that the iliad as a whole is the work of one age that it has reached us without interpolations and lacunae and remaniements perhaps no person of ordinary sense will allege but that the mass of the epic is of one age appears to be a natural inference from the breakdown of the hypotheses which attempt to explain it as a late mosaic we have also endeavoured to prove quite apart from the failure of theories of expansion and compilation that the iliad presents an historical unity unity of character unity of customary law and unity in its archaeology if we are right we must have an opinion as to how the epic was preserved  if we had evidence for an homeric school we might imagine that the epic was composed by dint of memory and preserved like the sanskrit hymns of the rig veda and the hymns of the maoris the zuñis and other peoples in the lower or middle stage of barbarism by the exertions and teaching of schools but religious hymns and mythical hymnsthe care of a priesthoodare one thing a great secular epic is another priests will not devote themselves from age to age to its conservation it cannot be conserved with its unity of tone and character and on the whole even of language by generations of paid strollers who recite new lays of their own as well as any old lays that they may remember which they alter at pleasure  we are thus driven back to the theory of early written texts not intended to meet the wants of a reading public but for the use of the poet himself and of those to whom he may bequeath his work that this has been a method in which orally published epics were composed and preserved in a nonreading age we have proved in our chapter on the french chansons de geste unhappily the argument that what was done in mediaeval france might be done in submycenaean greece is based on probabilities and these are differently estimated by critics of different schools all seems to depend on each individuals sense of what is likely in that case science has nothing to make in the matter nitzsche thought that writing might go back to the time of homer mr monro thought it probable enough that writing even if known at the time of homer was not used for literary purposes footnote iliad vol i p xxxv sir richard jebb as we saw took a much more favourable view of the probability of early written texts m salomon reinach arguing from the linear written clay tablets of knossos and from a knossian cup with writing on it in ink thinks that there may have existed whole minoan libraries manuscripts executed on perishable materials palm leaves papyrus or parchment footnote lanthropologie vol xv pp 292 293 mr leaf while admitting that writing was known in some form through the whole period of epic development holds that it is in the highest degree unlikely that it was ever employed to form a standard text of the epic or any portion of it at best there was a continuous tradition of those portions of the poems which were especially popular  footnote iliad vol i pp xvi xvii father browne dates the employment of writing for the preservation of the epic from the sixth century onwards footnote handbook of homeric study p 134 he also says that it is difficult to suppose that the mycenaeans who were certainly in contact with this form of writing the cretan linear should not have used it much more freely than our direct evidence warrants us in asserting he then mentions the knossian cup with writing inscribed on it apparently in pen and ink  the conclusion is that ordinary writing was in use but that the materials probably palm leaves have disappeared footnote ibid pp 258 259  why it should be unlikely that a people confessedly familiar with writing used it for the preservation of literature when we know that even the red indians preserve their songs by means of pictographs while west african tribes use incised characters is certainly not obvious many sorts of praephoenician writing were current during the mycenaean age in asia egypt assyria and in cyprus as these other peoples used writing of their own sort for literary purposes it is not easy to see why the cretans for example should not have done the same thing indeed father browne supposes that the mycenaeans used ordinary writing and used it freely nevertheless the epic was not written he says till the sixth century bc cauer indeed remarks that the finnish epic existed unwritten till lbnnrot its pisistratus first collected it from oral recitation footnote grundfragen der homerkritik p 94 but there is not and never was any finnish epic there were cosmogonic songs as among the maoris and zuñissongs of the beginnings of things there were magical songs songs of weddings a song based on the same popular tale that underlies the legend of the argonauts there were songs of the culture hero songs of burial and feast and of labour lönnrot collected these and tried by interpolations to make an epic out of them but the point as comparetti has proved is that he failed there is no finnish epic only a mass of volkslieder cauers other argument that the german popular tales grimms tales were unwritten till 1812 is as remote from the point at issue nothing can be less like an epic than a volume of märchen  as usual we are driven back upon a literary judgment is the iliad a patchwork of metrical märchen or is it an epic nobly constructed if it is the former writing was not needed if it is the latter in the absence of homeric guilds or colleges only writing can account for its preservation  it is impossible to argue against a critics subjective sense of what is likely possibly that sense is born of the feeling that the cretan linear script for example or the cyprian syllabary looks very odd and outlandish the critics imagination boggles at the idea of an epic written in such scripts in that case his is not the scientific imagination he is checked merely by the unfamiliar or his sense of unlikelihood may be a subconscious survival of wolfs opinion formed by him at a time when the existence of the many scripts of the old world was unknown  our own sense of probability leads us to the conclusion that in an age when people could write people wrote down the epic if they applied their art to literature then the preservation of the epic is explained written first in a praephoenician script it continued to be written in the greek adaptation of the phoenician alphabet there was not yet probably a reading public but there were a few clerkly men  that the cretans at least could write long before the age of homer mr arthur evans has demonstrated by his discoveries prom my remote undergraduate days i was of the opinion which he has proved to be correct starting like him from what i knew about savage pictographs footnote cretan pictographs and praephoenician script london 1905 annual of british school of athens 19001901 p 10 journal of hellenic studies 1897 pp 327395  m reinach and mr evans have pointed out that in this matter tradition joins hands with discovery diodorus siculus speaking of the cretan zeus and probably on cretan authority says as to those who hold that the syrians invented letters from whom the phoenicians received them and handed them on to the greeks  and that for this reason the greeks call letters phoenician some reply that the phoenicians did not blank space letters but merely modified transposed 3 the forms of the letters and that most men use this form of script and thus letters came to be styled phoenician footnote diodorus siculus v 74 lanthropologie vol xi pp 497502 in fact the alphabet is a collection of signs of palaeolithic antiquity and of vast diffusion footnote origins of the alphabet a l fortnightly review 1904 pp 634645  thus the use of writing for the conservation of the epic cannot seem to me to be unlikely but rather probable and here one must leave the question as the subjective element plays so great a part in every mans sense of what is likely or unlikely that writing cannot have been used for this literary purpose that the thing is impossible nobody will now assert  my supposition is then that the text of the epic existed in aegean script till greece adapted to her own tongue the phoenician letters which i think she did not later than the ninth to eighth centuries at the beginning of the ninth century says professor bury footnote history of greece vol i p 78 1902 this may seem an audaciously early date but when we find vases of the eighth to seventh centuries bearing inscriptions we may infer that a knowledge of reading and writing was reasonably common when such a humble class of hirelings or slaves as the potpainters can sign their work expecting their signatures to be read reading and writing must be very common accomplishments among the more fortunate classes  if mr gardner is right in dating a number of incised inscriptions on early pottery at naucratis before the middle of the seventh century we reach the same conclusion in fact if these inscriptions be of a century earlier than the abu simbel inscriptions of date 590 bc we reach 690 bc wherefore as writing does not become common in a moment it must have existed in the eighth century bc we are not dealing here with a special learned class but with ordinary persons who could write footnote the early ionic alphabet journal of hellenic studies vol vii pp 220239 roberts introduction to greek epigraphy pp 31 151 159 164 165167  interesting for our purpose is the verse incised on a dipylon vase found at athens in 1880 it is of an ordinary creamjug shape with a neck a handle a spout and a round belly on the neck within a zigzag geometrical pattern is a doe feeding and a tall waterfowl on the shoulder is scratched with a point in very antique attic characters

dating from the seventh century roberts op cit vol i p 74 at least as far back as the seventh century p 75  taking the vase with mr walters as of the eighth century i do not suppose that the amateur who gave it to a dancer and scratched the hexameter was of a later generation than the jug itself the vase may have cost him sixpence he would give his friend a new vase it is improbable that old jugs were sold at curiosity shops in these days and given by amateurs to artists the inscription proves that in the eighth to seventh centuries at a time of very archaic characters the alpha is lying down on its side the aspirate is an oblong with closed ends and a stroke across the middle and the iota is curved at each end people could write with ease and would put verse into writing the general accomplishment of reading is taken for granted  reading is also taken for granted by the gortyn cretan inscription of twelve columns long boustrophedon running alternately from left to right and from right to left in this inscribed code of laws incised on stone money is not mentioned in the more ancient part but fines and prices are calculated in chalders and bolls greek lebaetes and greek tripodes as in scotland when coin was scarce indeed whether the law contemplated the value of the vessels themselves or as in scotland of their contents in grain i know not the later inscriptions deal with coined money if coin came in about 650 bc the older parts of the inscription may easily be of 700 bc  the gortyn inscription implies the power of writing out a long code of laws and it implies that persons about to go to law could read the public inscription as we can read a proclamation posted up on a wall or could have it read to them footnote roberts vol i pp 5255  the alphabets inscribed on vases of the seventh century abecedaria with the archaic greek forms of every one of the twentytwo phoenician letters arranged precisely in the received semitic order were one supposes gifts for boys and girls who were learning to read just like our english alphabets on gingerbread footnote for abecedaria cf roberts vol i pp 1621  among inscriptions on tombstones of the end of the seventh century there is the epitaph of a daughter of a potter footnote roberts vol i p 76 these writings testify to the general knowledge of reading just as much as our epitaphs testify to the same state of education the athenian potters daughter of the seventh century bc had her epitaph but the gravestones of highlanders chiefs or commoners were usually uninscribed till about the end of the eighteenth century in deference to custom itself arising from the illiteracy of the highlanders in times past footnote ramsay scotland and scotsmen ii p 426 1888 i find no difficulty therefore in supposing that there were some greek readers and writers in the eighth century and that primary education was common in the seventh in these circumstances my sense of the probable is not revolted by the idea of a written epic in blank space characters even in the eighth century but the notion that there was no such thing till the middle of the sixth century seems highly improbable all the conditions were present which make for the composition and preservation of literary works in written texts that there were many early written copies of homer in the eighth century i am not inclined to believe the greeks were early a people who could read but were not a reading people setting newspapers aside there is no such thing as a reading people  the greeks preferred to listen to recitations but my hypothesis is that the rhapsodists who recited had texts like the jongleurs books of their epics in france and that they occasionally for definite purposes interpolated matter into their texts there were also texts known in later times as city texts greek ai kata poleis which aristarchus knew but he did not adopt the various readings footnote monro odyssey vol ii p 435  athens had a text in solons time if he entered the decree that the whole epic should be recited in due order every five years at the panathenaic festival footnote ibid vol ii p 395 this implies the possession of a complete text footnote ibid vol ii p 403  cauer remarks that the possibility of interpolation began only after the fixing of the text by pisistratus footnote grundfragen p 205 but surely if every poet and reciter could thrust any new lines which he chose to make into any old lays which he happened to know that was interpolation whether he had a book of the words or had none such interpolations would fill the orally recited lays which the supposed pisistratean editor must have written down from recitation before he began his colossal task of making the iliad out of them if on the other hand reciters had books of the words they could interpolate at pleasure into them and such books may have been among the materials used in the construction of a text for the athenian book market but if our theory be right there must always have been a few copies of better texts than those of the late reciters books and the effort of the editors for the book market would be to keep the parts in which most manuscripts were agreed  but how did athens or any other city come to possess a text one can only conjecture but my conjecture is that there had always been textscopied out in successive generationsin the hands of the curious for example in the hands of the cyclic poets who knew our iliad as the late french cyclic poets knew the earlier chansons de geste they certainly knew it for they avoided interference with it they worked at epics which led up to it as in the cypria they borrowed motifs from hints and references in the iliad footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 350 351 and they carried on the story from the death of hector in the aethiopis of arctinus of miletus this epic ended with the death of achilles when the little iliad produced the tale to the bringing in of the wooden horse arctinus goes on with his sack of ilios others wrote of the return of the heroes and the telegonia is a sequel to the odyssey the authors of these poems knew the iliad then as a whole and how could they have known it thus if it only existed in the casual repertoire of strolling reciters the cyclic poets more probably had texts of homer and themselves wrote their own poemshow it paid whether they recited them and collected rewards or not is of course unknown  the cyclic poems to quote sir richard jebb help to fix the lowest limit for the age of the homeric poems footnote homer pp 151 154 the earliest cyclic poems dating from about 776 bc presuppose the iliad being planned to introduce or continue it it would appear then that the iliad must have existed in something like its present compass as early as 800 bc indeed a considerably earlier date will seem probable if due time is allowed for the poem to have grown into such fame as would incite the effort to continue it and to prelude to it  sir richard then takes the point on which we have already insisted namely that the cyclic poets of the eighth century bc live in an age of ideas religions ritual and so forth which are absent from the iliad footnote homer pp 154 155  thus the iliad existed with its characteristics that are prior to 800 bc and in its present compass and was renowned before 800 bc as it could not possibly have thus existed in the repertoire of irresponsible strolling minstrels and reciters and as there is no evidence for a college school or guild which preserved the epic by a system of mnemonic teaching while no one can deny at least the possibility of written texts we are driven to the hypothesis that written texts there were whence descended for example the text of athens  we can scarcely suppose however that such texts were perfect in all respects for we know how several centuries later in a reading age papyrus fragments of the iliad display unwarrantable interpolation footnote monro odyssey vol ii pp 422426 but platos frequent quotations of course made at an earlier date show that whatever interpolated texts of homer were then current the copy from which plato quoted was not one of them footnote ibid p 429 plato had something much better  when a reading public for homer aroseand from the evidences of the widespread early knowledge of reading such a small public may have come into existence sooner than is commonly supposedathens was the centre of the book trade to athens must be due the prae alexandrian vulgate or prevalent text practically the same as our own some person or persons must have made that textnot by taking down from recitation all the lays which they could collect as herd scott mrs brown and others collected much of the border minstrelsy and not by then tacking the lays into a newlycomposed whole they must have done their best with such texts as were accessible to them and among these were probably the copies used by reciters and rhapsodists answering to the ms books of the mediaeval jongleurs  mr jevons has justly and acutely remarked that we do not know and there is no external evidence of any description which leads us to suppose that the iliad was ever expanded j h s vii 291308  that it was expanded is a mere hypothesis based on the idea that if there was an iliad at all in the ninth century its length must have been such as was compatible with the conditions of an oral deliverya poem or poems short enough to be recited at a single sitting  but we have proved with mr jevons and blass and by the analogy of the chansons that given a court audience and a court audience is granted there were no such narrow limits imposed on the length of a poem orally recited from night to night  the length of the iliad yields therefore no argument for expansions throughout several centuries that theory suggested by the notion that the original poem must have been short is next supposed to be warranted by the inconsistencies and discrepancies but we argue that these are only visible as a rule to the analytical reader for whom the poet certainly was not composing that they occur in all long works of fictitious narrative that the discrepancies often are not discrepancies and finally that they are not nearly so glaring as the inconsistencies in the theories of each separatist critic a theory in such matter as this is itself an explanatory myth or the plot of a story which the critic invents to account for the facts in the case these critical plots we have shown do not account for the facts of the case for the critics do not excel in constructing plots they wander into unperceived self contradictions which they would not pardon in the poet these contradictions are visible to the analytical reader who concludes that a very early poet may have been though homer seldom is as inconsistent as a modern critic  meanwhile though we have no external evidence that the iliad was ever expandedthat it was expanded is an explanatory myth of the criticswe do know on good evidence says mr jevons that the iliad was rhapsodised the rhapsodists were men as a rule of one day recitations though at a prolonged festival at athens there was time for the whole iliad to be recited they chose for recitation such incidents as could be readily detached were interesting in themselves and did not take too long to recite mr jevons suggests that the many brief poems collected in the homeric hymns are invocations which the rhapsodists preluded to their recitals the practice seems to have been for the rhapsodist first to pay his reverence to the god to begin from the god at whose festival the recitation was being given the short proems collected in the hymns pay this reverence and then proceed with his rhapsodywith his selected passage from the iliad beginning with thee the god of the festival i will go on to another lay that is to his selection from the epic another conclusion of the proem often is i will be mindful both of thee and of another lay meaning says mr jevons that the local deity will figure in the recitation from homer which the rhapsodist is about to deliver  these explanations at all events yield good sense the invocation of athene hymns xi xxviii would serve as the proem of invocation to the recital of iliad v vi 1311 the day of valour of diomede spurred on by the wanton rebuke of agamemnon and aided by athene the invocation of hephaestus hymn xx would prelude to a recital of the making of the awns of achilles and so on  but the rhapsodist may be reciting at a festival of dionysus about whom there is practically nothing said in the iliad for it is a proof of the antiquity of the iliad that when it was composed dionysus had not been raised to the olympian peerage being still a folkgod only the rhapsodist at a feast of dionysus in later times has to introduce the god into his recitation the god is not in his text but he adds him footnoteibid vi 130141  why should any mortal have made this interpolation mr jevonss theory supplies the answer the rhapsodist added the passages to suit the dionysus feast at which he was reciting  the same explanation is offered for the long story of the birth of blank space which agamemnon tells in his speech of apology and reconciliation footnoteibid xix 136 there is an invocation to heracles hymns xv and the author may have added this speech to his rhapsody of the reconciliation recited at a feast of heracles perhaps the remark of mr leaf offers the real explanation of the presence of this long story in the speech of agamemnon many speakers with a bad case take refuge in telling stories agamemnon shows says mr leaf the peevish nervousness of a man who feels that he has been in the wrong and who follows a frank speaker like achilles only eager for agamemnon to give the word to form and charge so agamemnon takes refuge in a long story throwing the blame of his conduct on destiny  we do not need then the theory of a rhapsodists interpolation but it is quite plausible in itself  local heroes as well as gods had their feasts in posthomeric times and a reciter at a feast of aeneas or of his mother aphrodite may have foisted in the very futile discourse of achilles and aeneas footnoteibid xx 213250 with its reference to erichthonius an athenian hero  in other cases the rhapsodist rounded off his selected passage by a few lines as in iliad xiii 656659 where a hero is brought to follow his sons dead body to the grave though the father had been killed in v 576 it is really such a slip as is often made by authors who write says mr leaf and in esmond thackeray makes similar errors the passage in xvi 6980 about which so much is said as if it contradicted book ix the embassy to achilles is also mr jevons thinks to be explained as inserted by a rhapsodist wishing to make his extract complete in itself another examplethe confusion in the beginning of book iiwe have already discussed see chapter iv and do not think that any explanation is needed when we understand that agamemnon once wideawake had no confidence in his dream however mr jevons thinks that rhapsodists anxious to recite straight on from the dream to the battle added ii 3541 the only lines which represent agamemnon as believing confidently in his dream we have argued that he only believed till he awoke and then as always wavered  thus in our way of looking at these things interpolations by rhapsodists are not often needed as explanations of difficulties still granted that the rhapsodists like the jongleurs had texts and that these were studied by the makers of the vulgate interpolations and errors might creep in by this way as to changes in language a poetical dialect is liable to be gradually modified by the influence of the everchanging colloquial speech and in the early times when writing was little used this influence would be especially operative footnote monro odyssey vol ii p 461  to conclude the hypothesis of a school of mnemonic teaching of the iliad would account for the preservation of so long a poem in an age destitute of writing when memory would be well cultivated there may have been such schools we only lack evidence for their existence but against the hypothesis of the existence of early texts there is nothing except the feeling of some critics that it is not likely they are dangerous guides the feelings  in any case the opinion that the iliad was a whole centuries before pisistratus is the hypothesis which is by far the least fertile in difficulties and consequently in inconsistent solutions of the problems which the theory of expansion first raises and then like an unskilled magician fails to lay
