92073245	an oldfashioned girl  by louisa m alcott     preface  as a preface is the only place where an author can with propriety explain a purpose or apologize for shortcomings i venture to avail myself of the privilege to make a statement for the benefit of my readers  as the first part of an oldfashioned girl was written in 1869 the demand for a sequel in beseeching little letters that made refusal impossible rendered it necessary to carry my heroine boldly forward some six or seven years into the future the domestic nature of the story makes this audacious proceeding possible while the lively fancies of my young readers will supply all deficiencies and overlook all discrepancies  this explanation will i trust relieve those wellregulated minds who cannot conceive of such literary lawlessness from the bewilderment which they suffered when the same experiment was tried in a former book  the oldfashioned girl is not intended as a perfect model but as a possible improvement upon page the girl of the period who seems sorrowfully ignorant or ashamed of the good old fashions which make woman truly beautiful and honored and through her render home what it should bea happy place where parents and children brothers and sisters learn to love and know and help one another  if the history of pollys girlish experiences suggests a hint or insinuates a lesson i shall feel that in spite of many obstacles i have not entirely neglected my duty toward the little men and women for whom it is an honor and a pleasure to write since in them i have always found my kindest patrons gentlest critics warmest friends  l m a     contents       chapter 1 polly arrives      chapter 2 new fashions      chapter 3 pollys troubles      chapter 4 little things      chapter 5 scrapes

left if i went out such a day as this and i want to look nice when polly comes  you dont expect me to go and bring home a strange girl alone do you and tom looked as much alarmed as if his sister had proposed to him to escort the wild woman of australia  of course i do it s your place to go and get her and if you was nt a bear you d like it  well i call that mean i supposed i d got to go but you said you d go too catch me bothering about your friends another time no sir and tom rose from the sofa with an air of indignant resolution the impressive effect of which was somewhat damaged by a tousled head and the hunched appearance of his garments generally  now dont be cross and i ll get mamma to let you have that horrid ned miller that you are so fond of come and make you a visit after polly s gone said fanny hoping to soothe his ruffled feelings  how long is she going to stay demanded tom making his toilet by a promiscuous shake  a month or two maybe she s ever so nice and i shall keep her as long as she s happy  she wont stay long then if i can help it muttered tom who regarded girls as a very unnecessary portion of creation boys of fourteen are apt to think so and perhaps it is a wise arrangement for being fond of turning somersaults they have an opportunity of indulging in a good one metaphorically speaking when three or four years later they become the abject slaves of those bothering girls  look here how am i going to know the creature i never saw her and she never saw me you ll have to come too fan he added pausing on his way to the door arrested by the awful idea that he might have to address several strange girls before he got the right one  you ll find her easy enough she ll probably be standing round looking for us i dare say she ll know you though i m not there because i ve described you to her  guess she wont then and tom gave a hasty smooth to his curly pate and a glance at the mirror feeling sure that his sister had nt done him justice sisters never do as we fellows know too well  do go along or you ll be too late and then what will polly think of me cried fanny with the impatient poke which is peculiarly aggravating to masculine dignity  she ll think you cared more about your frizzles than your friends and she ll be about right too  feeling that he said rather a neat and cutting thing tom sauntered leisurely away perfectly conscious that it was late but bent on not being hurried while in sight though he ran himself off his legs to make up for it afterward  if i was the president i d make a law to shut up all boys till they were grown for they certainly are the most provoking toads in the world said fanny as she watched the slouchy figure of her brother strolling down the street she might have changed her mind however if she had followed him for as soon as he turned the corner his whole aspect altered his hands came out of his pockets he stopped whistling buttoned his jacket gave his cap a pull and went off at a great pace  the train was just in when he reached the station panting like a racehorse and as red as a lobster with the wind and the run  suppose she ll wear a topknot and a thingumbob like every one else and however shall i know her too bad of fan to make me come alone thought tom as he stood watching the crowd stream through the depot and feeling rather daunted at the array of young ladies who passed as none of them seemed looking for any one he did not accost them but eyed each new batch with the air of a martyr that s her he said to himself as he presently caught sight of a girl in gorgeous array standing with her hands folded and a very small hat perched on the top of a very large chignon as tom pronounced it i suppose i ve got to speak to her so here goes and nerving himself to the task tom slowly approached the damsel who looked as if the wind had blown her clothes into rags such a flapping of sashes scallops ruffles curls and feathers was there  i say if you please is your name polly milton meekly asked tom pausing before the breezy stranger  no it is nt answered the young lady with a cool stare that utterly quenched him  where in thunder is she growled tom walking off in high dudgeon the quick tap of feet behind him made him turn in time to see a freshfaced little girl running down the long station and looking as if she rather liked it as she smiled and waved her bag at him he stopped and waited for her saying to himself hullo i wonder if that s polly  up came the little girl with her hand out and a halfshy halfmerry look in her blue eyes as she said inquiringly this is tom is nt it  yes how did you know and tom got over the ordeal of handshaking without thinking of it he was so surprised  oh fan told me you d got curly hair and a funny nose and kept whistling and wore a gray cap pulled over your eyes so i knew you directly and polly nodded at him in the most friendly manner having politely refrained from calling the hair red the nose a pug and the cap old all of which facts fanny had carefully impressed upon her memory  where are your trunks asked tom as he was reminded of his duty by her handing him the bag which he had not offered to take  father told me not to wait for any one else i d lose my chance of a hack so i gave my check to a man and there he is with my trunk and polly walked off after her one modest piece of baggage followed by tom who felt a trifle depressed by his own remissness in polite attentions she is nt a bit of a young lady thank goodness fan did nt tell me she was pretty dont look like city girls nor act like em neither he thought trudging in the rear and eyeing with favor the brown curls bobbing along in front  as the carriage drove off polly gave a little bounce on the springy seat and laughed like a delighted child i do like to ride in these nice hacks and see all the fine things and have a good time dont you she said composing herself the next minute as if it suddenly occurred to her that she was going avisiting  not much said tom not minding what he said for the fact that he was shut up with the strange girl suddenly oppressed his soul  how s fan why did nt she come too asked polly trying to look demure while her eyes danced in spite of her  afraid of spoiling her crinkles and tom smiled for this base betrayal of confidence made him feel his own man again  you and i dont mind dampness i m much obliged to you for coming to take care of me  it was kind of polly to say that and tom felt it for his red crop was a tender point and to be associated with pollys pretty brown curls seemed to lessen its coppery glow then he had nt done anything for her but carry the bag a few steps yet she thanked him he felt grateful and in a burst of confidence offered a handful of peanuts for his pockets were always supplied with this agreeable delicacy and he might be traced anywhere by the trail of shells he left behind him  as soon as he had done it he remembered that fanny considered them vulgar and felt that he had disgraced his family so he stuck his head out of the window and kept it there so long that polly asked if anything was the matter pooh who cares for a countrified little thing like her said tom manfully to himself and then the spirit of mischief entered in and took possession of him  he s pretty drunk but i guess he can hold his horses replied this evilminded boy with an air of calm resignation  is the man tipsy oh dear let s get out are the horses bad it s very steep here do you think it s safe cried poor polly making a cocked hat of her little beaver by thrusting it out of the halfopen window on her side  there s plenty of folks to pick us up if anything happens but perhaps it would be safer if i got out and sat with the man and tom quite beamed with the brilliancy of this sudden mode of relief  oh do if you aint afraid mother would be so anxious if anything should happen to me so far away cried polly much distressed  dont you be worried i ll manage the old chap and the horses too and opening the door tom vanished aloft leaving poor victimized polly to quake inside while he placidly revelled in freedom and peanuts outside with the staid old driver  fanny came flying down to meet her darling polly as tom presented her with the graceful remark i ve got her and the air of a dauntless hunter producing the trophies of his skill polly was instantly whisked up stairs and having danced a doubleshuffle on the doormat tom retired to the diningroom to restore exhausted nature with half a dozen cookies  aint you tired to death dont you want to lie down said fanny sitting on the side of the bed in pollys room and chattering hard while she examined everything her friend had on  not a bit i had a nice time coming and no trouble except the tipsy coachman but tom got out and kept him in order so i was nt much frightened answered innocent polly taking off her roughandready coat and the plain hat without a bit of a feather  fiddlestick he was nt tipsy and tom only did it to get out of the way he cant bear girls said fanny with a superior air  cant he why i thought he was very pleasant and kind and polly opened her eyes with a surprised expression  he s an awful boy my dear and if you have anything to do with him he ll torment you to death boys are all horrid but he s the horridest one i ever saw  fanny went to a fashionable school where the young ladies were so busy with their french german and italian that there was no time for good english feeling her confidence much shaken in the youth polly privately resolved to let him alone and changed the conversation by saying as she looked admiringly about the large handsome room how splendid it is i never slept in a bed with curtains before or had such a fine toilettable as this  i m glad you like it but dont for mercy sake say such things before the other girls replied fanny wishing polly would wear earrings as every one else did  why not asked the country mouse of the city mouse wondering what harm there was in liking other peoples pretty things and saying so oh they laugh at everything the least bit odd and that is nt pleasant fanny did nt say countrified but she meant it and polly felt uncomfortable so she shook out her little black silk apron with a thoughtful face and resolved not to allude to her own home if she could help it  i m so poorly mamma says i need nt go to school regularly while you are here only two or three times a week just to keep up my music and french you can go too if you like papa said so do it s such fun cried fanny quite surprising her friend by this unexpected fondness for school  i should be afraid if all the girls dress as finely as you do and know as much said polly beginning to feel shy at the thought  la child you need nt mind that i ll take care of you and fix you up so you wont look odd  am i odd asked polly struck by the word and hoping it did nt mean anything very bad  you are a dear and ever so much prettier than you were last summer only you ve been brought up differently from us so your ways aint like ours you see began fanny finding it rather hard to explain  how different asked polly again for she liked to understand things  well you dress like a little girl for one thing  i am a little girl so why should nt i and polly looked at her simple blue merino frock stout boots and short hair with a puzzled air  you are fourteen and we consider ourselves young ladies at that age continued fanny surveying with complacency the pile of hair on the top of her head with a fringe of fuzz round her forehead and a wavy lock streaming down her back likewise her scarletandblack suit with its big sash little pannier bright buttons points rosettes and heaven knows what there was a locket on her neck earrings tinkling in her ears watch and chain at her belt and several rings on a pair of hands that would have been improved by soap and water  pollys eye went from one little figure to the other and she thought that fanny looked the oddest of the two for polly lived in a quiet country town and knew very little of city fashions she was rather impressed by the elegance about her never having seen fannys home before as they got acquainted while fanny paid a visit to a friend who lived near polly but she did nt let the contrast between herself and fan trouble her for in a minute she laughed and said contentedly my mother likes me to dress simply and i dont mind i should nt know what to do rigged up as you are dont you ever forget to lift your sash and fix those puffy things when you sit down  before fanny could answer a scream from below made both listen it s only maud she fusses all day long began fanny and the words were hardly out of her mouth when the door was thrown open and a little girl of six or seven came roaring in she stopped at sight of polly stared a minute then took up her roar just where she left it and cast herself into fannys lap exclaiming wrathfully tom s laughing at me make him stop  what did you do to set him going dont scream so you ll frighten polly and fan gave the cherub a shake which produced an explanation  i only said we had cold cweam at the party last night and he laughed  icecream child and fanny followed toms reprehensible example  i dont care it was cold and i warmed mine at the wegister and then it was nice only willy bliss spilt it on my new gabwielle and maud wailed again over her accumulated woes  do go to katy you re as cross as a little bear today said fanny pushing her away  katy dont amoose me and i must be amoosed cause i m fwactious mamma said i was sobbed maud evidently laboring under the delusion that fractiousness was some interesting malady  come down and have dinner that will amuse you and fanny got up pluming herself as a bird does before its flight  polly hoped the dreadful boy would not be present but he was and stared at her all dinnertime in a most trying manner mr shaw a busylooking gentleman said how do you do my dear hope you ll enjoy yourself and then appeared to forget her entirely mrs shaw a pale nervous woman greeted her little guest kindly and took care that she wanted for nothing madam shaw a quiet old lady with an imposing cap exclaimed on seeing polly bless my heart the image of her mother a sweet woman how is she dear and kept peering at the newcomer over her glasses till between madam and tom poor polly lost her appetite  fanny chatted like a magpie and maud fidgeted till tom proposed to put her under the big dishcover which produced such an explosion that the young lady was borne screaming away by the muchenduring katy it was altogether an uncomfortable dinner and polly was very glad when it was over they all went about their own affairs and after doing the honors of the house fan was called to the dressmaker leaving polly to amuse herself in the great drawingroom  polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes and having examined all the pretty things about her began to walk up and down over the soft flowery carpet humming to herself as the daylight faded and only the ruddy glow of the fire filled the room presently madam came slowly in and sat down in her armchair saying that s a fine old tune sing it to me my dear i have nt heard it this many a day polly did nt like to sing before strangers for she had had no teaching but such as her busy mother could give her but she had been taught the utmost respect for old people and having no reason for refusing she directly went to the piano and did as she was bid  that s the sort of music it s a pleasure to hear sing some more dear said madam in her gentle way when she had done  pleased with this praise polly sang away in a fresh little voice that went straight to the listeners heart and nestled there the sweet old tunes that one is never tired of were all pollys store and her favorites were scotch airs such as yellowhaired laddie jock o hazeldean down among the heather and birks of aberfeldie the more she sung the better she did it and when she wound up with a health to king charlie the room quite rung with the stirring music made by the big piano and the little maid  by george that s a jolly tune sing it again please cried toms voice and there was toms red head bobbing up over the high back of the chair where he had hidden himself  it gave polly quite a turn for she thought no one was hearing her but the old lady dozing by the fire i cant sing any more i m tired she said and walked away to madam in the other room the red head vanished like a meteor for pollys tone had been decidedly cool  the old lady put out her hand and drawing polly to her knee looked into her face with such kind eyes that polly forgot the impressive cap and smiled at her confidingly for she saw that her simple music had pleased her listener and she felt glad to know it  you must nt mind my staring dear said madam softly pinching her rosy cheek i have nt seen a little girl for so long it does my old eyes good to look at you  polly thought that a very odd speech and could nt help saying are nt fan and maud little girls too  oh dear no not what i call little girls fan has been a young lady this two years and maud is a spoiled baby your mother s a very sensible woman my child  what a very queer old lady thought polly but she said yes m respectfully and looked at the fire  you dont understand what i mean do you asked madam still holding her by the chin  no m not quite  well dear i ll tell you in my day children of fourteen and fifteen did nt dress in the height of the fashion go to parties as nearly like those of grown people as it s possible to make them lead idle giddy unhealthy lives and get blasé at twenty we were little folks till eighteen or so worked and studied dressed and played like children honored our parents and our days were much longer in the land than now it seems to me  the old lady appeared to forget polly at the end of her speech for she sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own and looking up at a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue  was he your father madam  yes dear my honored father i did up his frills to the day of his death and the first money i ever earned was five dollars which he offered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the handsomest darn in his silk stockings  how proud you must have been cried polly leaning on the old ladys knee with an interested face  yes and we all learned to make bread and cook and wore little chintz gowns and were as gay and hearty as kittens all lived to be grandmothers and fathers and i m the last seventy next birthday my dear and not worn out yet though daughter shaw is an invalid at forty  that s the way i was brought up and that s why fan calls me oldfashioned i suppose tell more about your papa please i like it said polly  say father we never called him papa and if one of my brothers had addressed him as governor as boys do now i really think he d have him cut off with a shilling  madam raised her voice in saying this and nodded significantly but a mild snore from the other room seemed to assure her that it was a waste of shot to fire in that direction  before she could continue in came fanny with the joyful news that clara bird had invited them both to go to the theatre with her that very evening and would call for them at seven oclock polly was so excited by this sudden plunge into the dissipations of city life that she flew about like a distracted butterfly and hardly knew what happened till she found herself seated before the great green curtain in the brilliant theatre old mr bird sat on one side fanny on the other and both let her alone for which she was very grateful as her whole attention was so absorbed in the scene around her that she could nt talk  polly had never been much to the theatre and the few plays she had seen were the good old fairy tales dramatized to suit young beholders lively bright and full of the harmless nonsense which brings the laugh without the blush that night she saw one of the new spectacles which have lately become the rage and run for hundreds of nights dazzling exciting and demoralizing the spectator by every allurement french ingenuity can invent and american prodigality execute never mind what its name was it was very gorgeous very vulgar and very fashionable so of course it was much admired and every one went to see it at first polly thought she had got into fairyland and saw only the sparkling creatures who danced and sung in a world of light and beauty but presently she began to listen to the songs and conversation and then the illusion vanished for the lovely phantoms sang negro melodies talked slang and were a disgrace to the good oldfashioned elves whom she knew and loved so well  our little girl was too innocent to understand half the jokes and often wondered what people were laughing at but as the first enchantment subsided polly began to feel uncomfortable to be sure her mother would nt like to have her there and to wish she had nt come somehow things seemed to get worse and worse as the play went on for our small spectator was being rapidly enlightened by the gossip going on all about her as well as by her own quick eyes and girlish instincts when fourandtwenty girls dressed as jockeys came prancing on to the stage cracking their whips stamping the heels of their topboots and winking at the audience polly did not think it at all funny but looked disgusted and was glad when they were gone but when another set appeared in a costume consisting of gauze wings and a bit of gold fringe round the waist poor unfashionable polly did nt know what to do for she felt both frightened and indignant and sat with her eyes on her playbill and her cheeks getting hotter and hotter every minute  what are you blushing so for asked fanny as the painted sylphs vanished  i m so ashamed of those girls whispered polly taking a long breath of relief  you little goose it s just the way it was done in paris and the dancing is splendid it seems queer at first but you ll get used to it as i did  i ll never come again said polly decidedly for her innocent nature rebelled against the spectacle which as yet gave her more pain than pleasure she did not know how easy it was to get used to it as fanny did and it was well for her that the temptation was not often offered she could not explain the feeling but she was glad when the play was done and they were safe at home where kind grandma was waiting to see them comfortably into bed  did you have a good time dear she asked looking at pollys feverish cheeks and excited eyes  i dont wish to be rude but i did nt answered polly some of it was splendid but a good deal of it made me want to go under the seat people seemed to like it but i dont think it was proper  as polly freed her mind and emphasized her opinion with a decided rap of the boot she had just taken off fanny laughed and said while she pirouetted about the room like mademoiselle therese polly was shocked grandma her eyes were as big as saucers her face as red as my sash and once i thought she was going to cry some of it was rather queer but of course it was proper or all our set would nt go i heard mrs smythe perkins say it was charming so like dear paris and she has lived abroad so of course she knows what is what  i dont care if she has i know it was nt proper for little girls to see or i should nt have been so ashamed cried sturdy polly perplexed but not convinced even by mrs smythe perkins  i think you are right my dear but you have lived in the country and have nt yet learned that modesty has gone out of fashion and with a goodnight kiss grandma left polly to dream dreadfully of dancing in jockey costume on a great stage while tom played a big drum in the orchestra and the audience all wore the faces of her father and mother looking sorrowfully at her with eyes like saucers and faces as red as fannys sash     chapter ii new fashions   i m going to school this morning so come up and get ready said fanny a day or two after as she left the late breakfasttable  you look very nice what have you got to do asked polly following her into the hall  prink half an hour and put on her wad answered the irreverent tom whose preparations for school consisted in flinging his cap on to his head and strapping up several big books that looked as if they were sometimes used as weapons of defence  what is a wad asked polly while fanny marched up without deigning any reply  somebodys hair on the top of her head in the place where it ought not to be and tom went whistling away with an air of sublime indifference as to the state of his own curly pow  why must you be so fine to go to school asked polly watching fan arrange the little frizzles on her forehead and settle the various streamers and festoons belonging to her dress  all the girls do and it s proper for you never know who you may meet i m going to walk after my lessons so i wish you d wear your best hat and sack answered fanny trying to stick her own hat on at an angle which defied all the laws of gravitation  i will if you dont think this is nice enough i like the other best because it has a feather but this is warmer so i wear it every day and polly ran into her own room to prink also fearing that her friend might be ashamed of her plain costume wont your hands be cold in kid gloves she said as they went down the snowy street with a north wind blowing in their faces  yes horrid cold but my muff is so big i wont carry it mamma wont have it cut up and my ermine one must be kept for best and fanny smoothed her bismark kids with an injured air  i suppose my gray squirrel is ever so much too big but it s nice and cosy and you may warm your hands in it if you want to said polly surveying her new woollen gloves with a dissatisfied look though she had thought them quite elegant before  perhaps i will by and by now polly dont you be shy i ll only introduce two or three of the girls and you need nt mind old monsieur a bit or read if you dont want to we shall be in the anteroom so you ll only see about a dozen and they will be so busy they wont mind you much  i guess i wont read but sit and look on i like to watch people everything is so new and queer here  but polly did feel and look very shy when she was ushered into a room full of young ladies as they seemed to her all very much dressed all talking together and all turning to examine the newcomer with a cool stare which seemed to be as much the fashion as eyeglasses they nodded affably when fanny introduced her said something civil and made room for her at the table round which they sat waiting for monsieur several of the more frolicsome were imitating the grecian bend some were putting their heads together over little notes nearly all were eating confectionery and the entire twelve chattered like magpies being politely supplied with caramels polly sat looking and listening feeling very young and countrified among these elegant young ladies  girls do you know that carrie has gone abroad there has been so much talk her father could nt bear it and took the whole family off is nt that gay said one lively damsel who had just come in  i should think they d better go my mamma says if i d been going to that school she d have taken me straight away answered another girl with an important air  carrie ran away with an italian musicteacher and it got into the papers and made a great stir explained the first speaker to polly who looked mystified  how dreadful cried polly  i think it was fun she was only sixteen and he was perfectly splendid and she has plenty of money and every one talked about it and when she went anywhere people looked you know and she liked it but her papa is an old poke so he s sent them all away it s too bad for she was the jolliest thing i ever knew  polly had nothing to say to lively miss belle but fanny observed i like to read about such things but it s so inconvenient to have it happen right here because it makes it harder for us i wish you could have heard my papa go on he threatened to send a maid to school with me every day as they do in new york to be sure i come all right did you ever that s because it came out that carrie used to forge excuses in her mammas name and go promenading with her oreste when they thought her safe at school oh was nt she a sly minx cried belle as if she rather admired the trick  i think a little fun is all right and there s no need of making a talk if now and then some one does run off like carrie boys do as they like and i dont see why girls need to be kept so dreadfully close i d like to see anybody watching and guarding me added another dashing young lady  it would take a policeman to do that trix or a little man in a tall hat said fanny slyly which caused a general laugh and made beatrice toss her head coquettishly  oh have you read the phantom bride it s perfectly thrilling there s a regular rush for it at the library but some prefer breaking a butterfly which do you like best asked a pale girl of polly in one of the momentary lulls which occurred  i have nt read either  you must then i adore guy livingstons books and yatess ouidas are my delight only they are so long i get worn out before i m through  i have nt read anything but one of the muhlbach novels since i came i like those because there is history in them said polly glad to have a word to say for herself  those are well enough for improving reading but i like real exciting novels dont you  polly was spared the mortification of owning that she had never read any by the appearance of monsieur a grayheaded old frenchman who went through his task with the resigned air of one who was used to being the victim of giggling schoolgirls the young ladies gabbled over the lesson wrote an exercise and read a little french history but it did not seem to make much impression upon them though monsieur was very ready to explain and polly quite blushed for her friend when on being asked what famous frenchman fought in our revolution she answered lamartine instead of lafayette  the hour was soon over and when fan had taken a music lesson in another room while polly looked on it was time for recess the younger girls walked up and down the court arm in arm eating bread an butter others stayed in the schoolroom to read and gossip but belle trix and fanny went to lunch at a fashionable icecream saloon near by and polly meekly followed not daring to hint at the gingerbread grandma had put in her pocket for luncheon so the honest brown cookies crumbled away in obscurity while polly tried to satisfy her hearty appetite on one ice and three macaroons  the girls seemed in great spirits particularly after they were joined by a short gentleman with such a young face that polly would have called him a boy if he had not worn a tall beaver escorted by this impressive youth fanny left her unfortunate friends to return to school and went to walk as she called a slow promenade down the most crowded streets polly discreetly fell behind and amused herself looking into shopwindows till fanny mindful of her manners even at such an interesting time took her into a picture gallery and bade her enjoy the works of art while they rested obedient polly went through the room several times apparently examining the pictures with the interest of a connoisseur and trying not to hear the mild prattle of the pair on the round seat but she could nt help wondering what fan found so absorbing in an account of a recent german and why she need promise so solemnly not to forget the concert that afternoon  when fanny rose at last pollys tired face reproached her and taking a hasty leave of the small gentleman she turned homeward saying confidentially as she put one hand in pollys muff now my dear you must nt say a word about frank moore or papa will take my head off i dont care a bit for him and he likes trix only they have quarrelled and he wants to make her mad by flirting a little with me i scolded him well and he promised to make up with her we all go to the afternoon concerts and have a gay time and belle and trix are to be there today so just keep quiet and everything will be all right  i m afraid it wont began polly who not being used to secrets found it very hard to keep even a small one  dont worry child it s none of our business so we can go and enjoy the music and if other people flirt it wont be our fault said fanny impatiently  of course not but then if your father dont like you to do so ought you to go  i tell mamma and she dont care papa is fussy and grandma makes a stir about every blessed thing i do you will hold your tongue wont you  yes i truly will i never tell tales and polly kept her word feeling sure fan did nt mean to deceive her father since she told her mother everything  who are you going with asked mrs shaw when fanny mentioned that it was concertday just before three oclock  only polly she likes music and it was so stormy i could nt go last week you know answered fan adding as they left the house again if any one meets us on the way i cant help it can i  you can tell them not to cant you  that s rude dear me here s belles brother gus he always goes is my hair all right and my hat  before polly could answer mr gus joined them as a matter of course and polly soon found herself trotting on behind feeling that things were not all right though she did nt know how to mend them being fond of music she ignorantly supposed that every one else went for that alone and was much disturbed by the whispering that went on among the young people round her belle and trix were there in full dress and in the pauses between different pieces messrs frank and gus with several other splendid fellows regaled the young ladies with college gossip and bits of news full of interest to judge from the close attention paid to their eloquent remarks polly regarded these noble beings with awe and they recognized her existence with the condescension of their sex but they evidently considered her only a quiet little thing and finding her not up to society talk blandly ignored the pretty child and devoted themselves to the young ladies fortunately for polly she forgot all about them in her enjoyment of the fine music which she felt rather than understood and sat listening with such a happy face that several true musiclovers watched her smilingly for her heart gave a blithe welcome to the melody which put the little instrument in tune it was dusk when they went out and polly was much relieved to find the carriage waiting for them because playing third fiddle was not to her taste and she had had enough of it for one day  i m glad those men are gone they did worry me so talking when i wanted to hear said polly as they rolled away  which did you like best asked fanny with a languid air of superiority  the plain one who did nt say much he picked up my muff when it tumbled down and took care of me in the crowd the others did nt mind anything about me  they thought you were a little girl i suppose  my mother says a real gentleman is as polite to a little girl as to a woman so i like mr sydney best because he was kind to me  what a sharp child you are polly i should nt have thought you d mind things like that said fanny beginning to understand that there may be a good deal of womanliness even in a little girl  i m used to good manners though i do live in the country replied polly rather warmly for she did nt like to be patronized even by her friends  grandma says your mother is a perfect lady and you are just like her so dont get in a passion with those poor fellows and i ll see that they behave better next time tom has no manners at all and you dont complain of him added fan with a laugh  i dont care if he has nt he s a boy and acts like one and i can get on with him a great deal better than i can with those men  fanny was just going to take polly to task for saying those men in such a disrespectful tone when both were startled by a smothered cockadoodledoo from under the opposite seat  it s tom cried fanny and with the words out tumbled that incorrigible boy red in the face and breathless with suppressed laughter seating himself he surveyed the girls as if well satisfied with the success of his prank and waiting to be congratulated upon it did you hear what we were saying demanded fanny uneasily  oh did nt i every word and tom exulted over them visibly  did you ever see such a provoking toad polly now i suppose you ll go and tell papa a great story  praps i shall and praps i shant how polly did hop when i crowed i heard her squeal and saw her cuddle up her feet  and you heard us praise your manners did nt you asked polly slyly  yes and you liked em so i wont tell on you said tom with a reassuring nod  there s nothing to tell  aint there though what do you suppose the governor will say to you girls going on so with those dandies i saw you  what has the governor of massachusetts to do with us asked polly trying to look as if she meant what she said  pooh you know who i mean so you need nt try to catch me up as grandma does  tom i ll make a bargain with you cried fanny eagerly it was nt my fault that gus and frank were there and i could nt help their speaking to me i do as well as i can and papa need nt be angry for i behave ever so much better than some of the girls dont i polly  bargain observed tom with an eye to business  if you wont go and make a fuss telling what you d no right to hear it was so mean to hide and listen i should think you d be ashamed of it i ll help you tease for your velocipede and wont say a word against it when mamma and granny beg papa not to let you have it  will you and tom paused to consider the offer in all its bearings  yes and polly will help wont you  i d rather not have anything to do with it but i ll be quiet and not do any harm  why wont you asked tom curiously  because it seems like deceiving  well papa need nt be so fussy said fan petulantly  after hearing about that carrie and the rest i dont wonder he is fussy why dont you tell right out and not do it any more if he dont want you to said polly persuasively  do you go and tell your father and mother everything right out  yes i do and it saves ever so much trouble  aint you afraid of them  of course i m not it s hard to tell sometimes but it s so comfortable when it s over  let s was toms brief advice  mercy me what a fuss about nothing said fanny ready to cry with vexation  t is nt nothing you know you are forbidden to go gallivanting round with those chaps and that s the reason you re in a pucker now i wont make any bargain and i will tell returned tom seized with a sudden fit of moral firmness  will you if i promise never never to do so any more asked fanny meekly for when thomas took matters into his own hands his sister usually submitted in spite of herself  i ll think about it and if you behave maybe i wont do it at all i can watch you better than papa can so if you try it again it s all up with you miss said tom finding it impossible to resist the pleasure of tyrannizing a little when he got the chance  she wont dont plague her any more and she will be good to you when you get into scrapes answered polly with her arm round fan  i never do and if i did i should nt ask a girl to help me out  why not i d ask you in a minute if i was in trouble said polly in her confiding way  would you well i d put you through as sure as my name s tom shaw now then dont slip polly and mr thomas helped them out with unusual politeness for that friendly little speech gratified him he felt that one person appreciated him and it had a good effect upon manners and temper made rough and belligerent by constant snubbing and opposition  after tea that evening fanny proposed that polly should show her how to make molasses candy as it was cooks holiday and the coast would be clear hoping to propitiate her tormentor fan invited tom to join in the revel and polly begged that maud might sit up and see the fun so all four descended to the big kitchen armed with aprons hammers spoons and pans and polly assumed command of the forces tom was set to cracking nuts and maud to picking out the meats for the candy was to be tiptop fan waited on polly cook who hovered over the kettle of boiling molasses till her face was the color of a peony now put in the nuts she said at last and tom emptied his plate into the foamy syrup while the others watched with deep interest the mysterious concoction of this wellbeloved sweetmeat i pour it into the buttered pan you see and it cools and then we can eat it explained polly suiting the action to the word  why it s all full of shells exclaimed maud peering into the pan  oh thunder i must have put em in by mistake and ate up the meats without thinking said tom trying to conceal his naughty satisfaction as the girls hung over the pan with faces full of disappointment and despair  you did it on purpose you horrid boy i ll never let you have anything to do with my fun again cried fan in a passion trying to catch and shake him while he dodged and chuckled in high glee  maud began to wail over her lost delight and polly gravely poked at the mess which was quite spoilt but her attention was speedily diverted by the squabble going on in the corner for fanny forgetful of her youngladyism and her sixteen years had boxed toms ears and tom resenting the insult had forcibly seated her in the coalhod where he held her with one hand while he returned the compliment with the other both were very angry and kept twitting one another with every aggravation they could invent as they scolded and scuffled presenting a most unlovely spectacle  polly was not a model girl by any means and had her little pets and tempers like the rest of us but she did nt fight scream and squabble with her brothers and sisters in this disgraceful way and was much surprised to see her elegant friend in such a passion oh dont please dont you ll hurt her tom let him go fanny it s no matter about the candy we can make some more cried polly trying to part them and looking so distressed that they stopped ashamed and in a minute sorry that she should see such a display of temper  i aint going to be hustled round so you d better let me alone fan said tom drawing off with a threatening wag of the head adding in a different tone i only put the shells in for fun polly you cook another kettleful and i ll pick you some meats all fair will you  it s pretty hot work and it s a pity to waste things but i ll try again if you want me to said polly with a patient sigh for her arms were tired and her face uncomfortably hot  we dont want you get away said maud shaking a sticky spoon at him  keep quiet crybaby i m going to stay and help may nt i polly  bears like sweet things so you want some candy i guess where is the molasses we ve used up all there was in the jug said polly goodnaturedly beginning again  down cellar i ll get it and taking the lamp and jug tom departed bent on doing his duty now like a saint  the moment his light vanished fanny bolted the door saying spitefully now we are safe from any more tricks let him thump and call it only serves him right and when the candy is done we ll let the rascal out  how can we make it without molasses asked polly thinking that would settle the matter  there s plenty in the storeroom no you shant let him up till i m ready he s got to learn that i m not to be shaken by a little chit like him make your candy and let him alone or i ll go and tell papa and then tom will get a lecture  polly thought it was nt fair but maud clamored for her candy and finding she could do nothing to appease fan polly devoted her mind to her cookery till the nuts were safely in and a nice panful set in the yard to cool a few bangs at the locked door a few threats of vengeance from the prisoner such as setting the house on fire drinking up the wine and mashing the jellypots and then all was so quiet that the girls forgot him in the exciting crisis of their work  he cant possibly get out anywhere and as soon we ve cut up the candy we ll unbolt the door and run come and get a nice dish to put it in said fan when polly proposed to go halves with tom lest he should come bursting in somehow and seize the whole  when they came down with the dish in which to set forth their treat and opened the backdoor to find it imagine their dismay on discovering that it was gone pan candy and all utterly and mysteriously gone  a general lament arose when a careful rummage left no hopes for the fates had evidently decreed at candy was not to prosper on this unpropitious night  the hot pan has melted and sunk in the snow perhaps said fanny digging into the drift where it was left  those old cats have got it i guess suggested maud too much overwhelmed by this second blow to howl as usual  the gate is nt locked and some beggar has stolen it i hope it will do him good added polly turning from her exploring expedition  if tom could get out i should think he d carried it off but not being a rat he cant go through the bits of windows so it was nt him said fanny disconsolately for she began to think this double loss a punishment for letting angry passions rise let s open the door and tell him about it proposed polly  he ll crow over us no we ll open it and go to bed and he can come out when he likes provoking boy if he had nt plagued us so we should have had a nice time  unbolting the cellar door the girls announced to the invisible captive that they were through and then departed much depressed halfway up the second flight they all stopped as suddenly as if they had seen a ghost for looking over the banisters was toms face crocky but triumphant and in either hand a junk of candy which he waved above them as he vanished with the tantalizing remark dont you wish you had some  how in the world did he get out cried fanny steadying herself after a start that nearly sent all three tumbling down stairs  coalhole answered a spectral voice from the gloom above  good gracious he must have poked up the cover climbed into the street stole the candy and sneaked in at the shedwindow while we were looking for it  cats got it did nt they jeered the voice in a tone that made polly sit down and laugh till she could nt laugh any longer  just give maud a bit she s so disappointed fan and i are sick of it and so will you be if you eat it all called polly when she got her breath  go to bed maudie and look under your pillow when you get there was the oracular reply that came down to them as toms door closed after a jubilant solo on the tin pan  the girls went to bed tired out and maud slumbered placidly hugging the sticky bundle found where molasses candy is not often discovered polly was very tired and soon fell asleep but fanny who slept with her lay awake longer than usual thinking about her troubles for her head ached and the dissatisfaction that follows anger would not let her rest with the tranquillity that made the rosy face in the little round nightcap such a pleasant sight to see as it lay beside her the gas was turned down but fanny saw a figure in a gray wrapper creep by her door and presently return pausing to look in who is it she cried so loud that polly woke  only me dear answered grandmas mild voice poor tom has got a dreadful toothache and i came down to find some creosote for him he told me not to tell you but i cant find the bottle and dont want to disturb mamma  it s in my closet old tom will pay for his trick this time said fanny in a satisfied tone  i thought he d get enough of our candy laughed polly and then they fell asleep leaving tom to the delights of toothache and the tender mercies of kind old grandma     chapter iii pollys troubles   polly soon found that she was in a new world a world where the manners and customs were so different from the simple ways at home that she felt like a stranger in a strange land and often wished that she had not come in the first place she had nothing to do but lounge and gossip read novels parade the streets and dress and before a week was gone she was as heartily sick of all this as a healthy person would be who attempted to live on confectionery fanny liked it because she was used to it and had never known anything better but polly had and often felt like a little woodbird shut up in a gilded cage nevertheless she was much impressed by the luxuries all about her enjoyed them wished she owned them and wondered why the shaws were not a happier family she was not wise enough to know where the trouble lay she did not attempt to say which of the two lives was the right one she only knew which she liked best and supposed it was merely another of her oldfashioned ways  fannys friends did not interest her much she was rather afraid of them they seemed so much older and wiser than herself even those younger in years they talked about things of which she knew nothing and when fanny tried to explain she did nt find them interesting indeed some of them rather shocked and puzzled her so the girls let her alone being civil when they met but evidently feeling that she was too odd to belong to their set then she turned to maud for companionship for her own little sister was excellent company and polly loved her dearly but miss maud was much absorbed in her own affairs for she belonged to a set also and these mites of five and six had their musicals their parties receptions and promenades as well as their elders and the chief idea of their little lives seemed to be to ape the fashionable follies they should have been too innocent to understand maud had her tiny cardcase and paid calls like mamma and fan her box of dainty gloves her jeweldrawer her crimpingpins as fine and fanciful a wardrobe as a paris doll and a french maid to dress her polly could nt get on with her at first for maud did nt seem like a child and often corrected polly in her conversation and manners though little mademoiselles own were anything but perfect now and then when maud felt poorly or had a fwactious turn for she had nerves as well as mamma she would go to polly to be amoosed for her gentle ways and kind forbearance soothed the little fine lady better than anything else polly enjoyed these times and told stories played games or went out walking just as maud liked slowly and surely winning the childs heart and relieving the whole house of the young tyrant who ruled it  tom soon got over staring at polly and at first did not take much notice of her for in his opinion girls did nt amount to much anyway and considering the style of girl he knew most about polly quite agreed with him he occasionally refreshed himself by teasing her to see how she d stand it and caused polly much anguish of spirit for she never knew where he would take her next he bounced out at her from behind doors booed at her in dark entries clutched her feet as she went up stairs startled her by shrill whistles right in her ear or sudden tweaks of the hair as he passed her in the street and as sure as there was company to dinner he fixed his round eyes on her and never took them off till she was reduced to a piteous state of confusion and distress she used to beg him not to plague her but he said he did it for her good she was too shy and needed toughening like the other girls in vain she protested that she did nt want to be like the other girls in that respect he only laughed in her face stuck his red hair straight up all over his head and glared at her till she fled in dismay  yet polly rather liked tom for she soon saw that he was neglected hustled out of the way and left to get on pretty much by himself she often wondered why his mother did nt pet him as she did the girls why his father ordered him about as if he was a born rebel and took so little interest in his only son fanny considered him a bear and was ashamed of him but never tried to polish him up a bit and maud and he lived together like a cat and dog who did not belong to a happy family grandma was the only one who stood by poor old tom and polly more than once discovered him doing something kind for madam and seeming very much ashamed when it was found out he was nt respectful at all he called her the old lady and told her he would nt be fussed over but when anything was the matter he always went to the old lady and was very grateful for the fussing polly liked him for this and often wanted to speak of it but she had a feeling that it would nt do for in praising their affection she was reproaching others with neglect so she held her tongue and thought about it all the more grandma was rather neglected too and perhaps that is the reason why tom and she were such good friends she was even more oldfashioned than polly but people did nt seem to mind it so much in her as her day was supposed to be over and nothing was expected of her but to keep out of everybodys way and to be handsomely dressed when she appeared before people grandma led a quiet solitary life in her own rooms full of old furniture pictures books and relics of a past for which no one cared but herself her son went up every evening for a little call was very kind to her and saw that she wanted nothing money could buy but he was a busy man so intent on getting rich that he had no time to enjoy what he already possessed madam never complained interfered or suggested but there was a sad sort of quietude about her a wistful look in her faded eyes as if she wanted something which money could not buy and when children were near she hovered about them evidently longing to cuddle and caress them as only grandmothers can polly felt this and as she missed the homepetting gladly showed that she liked to see the quiet old face brighten as she entered the solitary room where few children came except the phantoms of little sons and daughters who to the motherly heart that loved them never faded or grew up polly wished the children would be kinder to grandma but it was not for her to tell them so although it troubled her a good deal and she could only try to make up for it by being as dutiful and affectionate as if their grandma was her own  another thing that disturbed polly was the want of exercise to dress up and parade certain streets for an hour every day to stand talking in doorways or drive out in a fine carriage was not the sort of exercise she liked and fan would take no other indeed she was so shocked when polly one day proposed a run down the mall that her friend never dared suggest such a thing again at home polly ran and rode coasted and skated jumped rope and raked hay worked in her garden and rowed her boat so no wonder she longed for something more lively than a daily promenade with a flock of giddy girls who tilted along in highheeled boots and costumes which made polly ashamed to be seen with some of them so she used to slip out alone sometimes when fanny was absorbed in novels company or millinery and get fine brisk walks round the park on the unfashionable side where the babies took their airings or she went inside to watch the boys coasting and to wish she could coast too as she did at home she never went far and always came back rosy and gay  one afternoon just before dinner she felt so tired of doing nothing that she slipped out for a run it had been a dull day but the sun was visible now setting brightly below the clouds it was cold but still and polly trotted down the smooth snowcovered mall humming to herself and trying not to feel homesick the coasters were at it with all their might and she watched them till her longing to join the fun grew irresistible on the hill some little girls were playing with their sleds real little girls in warm hoods and coats rubber boots and mittens and polly felt drawn toward them in spite of her fear of fan  i want to go down but i dars nt it s so steep said one of these common children as maud called them  if you ll lend me your sled and sit in my lap i ll take you down all nice answered polly in a confidential tone  the little girls took a look at her seemed satisfied and accepted her offer polly looked carefully round to see that no fashionable eye beheld the awful deed and finding all safe settled her freight and spun away down hill feeling all over the delightsome excitement of swift motion which makes coasting such a favorite pastime with the more sensible portion of the childworld one after another she took the little girls down the hill and dragged them up again while they regarded her in the light of a graycoated angel descended for their express benefit polly was just finishing off with one delicious go all by herself when she heard a familiar whistle behind her and before she could get off up came tom looking as much astonished as if he had found her mounted on an elephant  hullo polly what ll fan say to you was his polished salutation  dont know and dont care coasting is no harm i like it and i m going to do it now i ve got a chance so clear the lulla and away went independent polly with her hair blowing in the wind and an expression of genuine enjoyment which a very red nose did nt damage in the least  good for you polly and casting himself upon his sled with the most reckless disregard for his ribs off whizzed tom after her and came alongside just as she reined up general grant on the broad path below oh wont you get it when we go home cried the young gentleman even before he changed his graceful attitude  i shant if you dont go and tell but of course you will added polly sitting still while an anxious expression began to steal over her happy face  i just wont then returned tom with the natural perversity of his tribe  if they ask me i shall tell of course if they dont ask i think there s no harm in keeping still i should nt have done it if i had nt known my mother was willing but i dont wish to trouble your mother by telling of it do you think it was very dreadful of me asked polly looking at him  i think it was downright jolly and i wont tell if you dont want me to now come up and have another said tom heartily  just one more the little girls want to go this is their sled  let em take it it is nt good for much and you come on mine mazeppas a stunner you see if he is nt  so polly tucked herself up in front tom hung on behind in some mysterious manner and mazeppa proved that he fully merited his masters sincere if inelegant praise they got on capitally now for tom was in his proper sphere and showed his best side being civil and gay in the bluff boyfashion that was natural to him while polly forgot to be shy and liked this sort of toughening much better than the other they laughed and talked and kept taking just one more till the sunshine was all gone and the clocks struck dinnertime  we shall be late let s run said polly as they came into the path after the last coast  you just sit still and i ll get you home in a jiffy and before she could unpack herself tom trotted off with her at a fine pace  here s a pair of cheeks i wish you d get a color like this fanny said mr shaw as polly came into the diningroom after smoothing her hair  your nose is as red as that cranberry sauce answered fan coming out of the big chair where she had been curled up for an hour or two deep in lady audleys secret  so it is said polly shutting one eye to look at the offending feature never mind i ve had a good time anyway she added giving a little prance in her chair  i dont see much fun in these cold runs you are so fond of taking said fanny with a yawn and a shiver  perhaps you would if you tried it and polly laughed as she glanced at tom  did you go alone dear asked grandma patting the rosy cheek beside her  yes m but i met tom and we came home together pollys eyes twinkled when she said that and tom choked in his soup  thomas leave the table commanded mr shaw as his incorrigible son gurgled and gasped behind his napkin  please dont send him away sir i made him laugh said polly penitently  whats the joke asked fanny waking up at last  i should nt think you d make him laugh when he s always making you cwy observed maud who had just come in  what have you been doing now sir demanded mr shaw as tom emerged red and solemn from his brief obscurity  nothing but coast he said gruffly for papa was always lecturing him and letting the girls do just as they liked  so s polly i saw her me and blanche were coming home just now and we saw her and tom widing down the hill on his sled and then he dwagged her ever so far cried maud with her mouth full  you did nt and fanny dropped her fork with a scandalized face  yes i did and liked it ever so much answered polly looking anxious but resolute  did any one see you cried fanny  only some little girls and tom  it was horridly improper and tom ought to have told you so if you did nt know any better i should be mortified to death if any of my friends saw you added fan much disturbed  now dont you scold it s no harm and polly shall coast if she wants to may nt she grandma cried tom gallantly coming to the rescue and securing a powerful ally  my mother lets me and if i dont go among the boys i cant see what harm there is in it said polly before madam could speak  people do many things in the country that are not proper here began mrs shaw in her reproving tone  let the child do it if she likes and take maud with her i should be glad to have one hearty girl in my house interrupted mr shaw and that was the end of it  thank you sir said polly gratefully and nodded at tom who telegraphed back all right and fell upon his dinner with the appetite of a young wolf  oh you slyboots you re getting up a flirtation with tom are you whispered fanny to her friend as if much amused  what and polly looked so surprised and indignant that fanny was ashamed of herself and changed the subject by telling her mother she needed some new gloves  polly was very quiet after that and the minute dinner was over she left the room to go and have a quiet think about the whole matter before she got halfway up stairs she saw tom coming after and immediately sat down to guard her feet he laughed and said as he perched himself on the post of the banisters i wont grab you honor bright i just wanted to say if you ll come out tomorrow some time we ll have a good coast  no said polly i cant come  why not are you mad i did nt tell and tom looked amazed at the change which had come over her  no you kept your word and stood by me like a good boy i m not mad either but i dont mean to coast any more your mother dont like it  that is nt the reason i know you nodded to me after she d freed her mind and you meant to go then come now what is it  i shant tell you but i m not going was pollys determined answer  well i did think you had more sense than most girls but you have nt and i would nt give a sixpence for you  that s polite said polly getting ruffled  well i hate cowards  i aint a coward  yes you are you re afraid of what folks will say aint you now  polly knew she was and held her peace though she longed to speak but how could she  ah i knew you d back out and tom walked away with an air of scorn that cut polly to the heart  it s too bad just as he was growing kind to me and i was going to have a good time it s all spoilt by fans nonsense mrs shaw dont like it nor grandma either i dare say there ll be a fuss if i go and fan will plague me so i ll give it up and let tom think i m afraid oh dear i never did see such ridiculous people  polly shut her door hard and felt ready to cry with vexation that her pleasure should be spoilt by such a silly idea for of all the silly freaks of this fast age that of little people playing at love is about the silliest polly had been taught that it was a very serious and sacred thing and according to her notions it was far more improper to flirt with one boy than to coast with a dozen she had been much amazed only the day before to hear maud say to her mother mamma must i have a beau the girls all do and say i ought to have fweddy lovell but i dont like him as well as hawry fiske  oh yes i d have a little sweetheart dear it s so cunning answered mrs shaw and maud announced soon after that she was engaged to fweddy cause hawry slapped her when she proposed the match  polly laughed with the rest at the time but when she thought of it afterward and wondered what her own mother would have said if little kitty had put such a question she did nt find it cunning or funny but ridiculous and unnatural she felt so now about herself and when her first petulance was over resolved to give up coasting and everything else rather than have any nonsense with tom who thanks to his neglected education was as ignorant as herself of the charms of this new amusement for schoolchildren so polly tried to console herself by jumping rope in the backyard and playing tag with maud in the dryingroom where she likewise gave lessons in nasgimnics as maud called it which did that little person good fanny came up sometimes to teach them a new dancing step and more than once was betrayed into a game of romps for which she was none the worse but tom turned a cold shoulder to polly and made it evident by his cavalier manner that he really did nt think her worth a sixpence  another thing that troubled polly was her clothes for though no one said anything she knew they were very plain and now and then she wished that her blue and mouse colored merinos were rather more trimmed her sashes had bigger bows and her little ruffles more lace on them she sighed for a locket and for the first time in her life thought seriously of turning up her pretty curls and putting on a wad she kept these discontents to herself however after she had written to ask her mother if she might have her best dress altered like fannys and received this reply no dear the dress is proper and becoming as it is and the old fashion of simplicity the best for all of us i dont want my polly to be loved for her clothes but for herself so wear the plain frocks mother took such pleasure in making for you and let the panniers go the least of us have some influence in this big world and perhaps my little girl can do some good by showing others that a contented heart and a happy face are better ornaments than any paris can give her you want a locket deary so i send one that my mother gave me years ago you will find fathers face on one side mine on the other and when things trouble you just look at your talisman and i think the sunshine will come back again  of course it did for the best of all magic was shut up in the quaint little case that polly wore inside her frock and kissed so tenderly each night and morning the thought that insignificant as she was she yet might do some good made her very careful of her acts and words and so anxious to keep head contented and face happy that she forgot her clothes and made others do the same she did not know it but that good old fashion of simplicity made the plain gowns pretty and the grace of unconsciousness beautified their little wearer with the charm that makes girlhood sweetest to those who truly love and reverence it one temptation polly had already yielded to before the letter came and repented heartily of afterward  polly i wish you d let me call you marie said fanny one day as they were shopping together  you may call me mary if you like but i wont have any ie put on to my name i m polly at home and i m fond of being called so but marie is frenchified and silly  i spell my own name with an ie and so do all the girls  and what a jumble of netties nellies hatties and sallies there is how pollie would look spelt so  well never mind that was nt what i began to say there s one thing you must have and that is bronze boots said fan impressively  why must i when i ve got enough without  because it s the fashion to have them and you cant be finished off properly without i m going to get a pair and so must you  dont they cost a great deal  eight or nine dollars i believe i have mine charged but it dont matter if you have nt got the money i can lend you some  i ve got ten dollars to do what i like with but it s meant to get some presents for the children and polly took out her purse in an undecided way  you can make presents easy enough grandma knows all sorts of nice contrivances they ll do just as well and then you can get your boots  well i ll look at them said polly following fanny into the store feeling rather rich and important to be shopping in this elegant manner  are nt they lovely your foot is perfectly divine in that boot polly get them for my party you ll dance like a fairy whispered fan  polly surveyed the dainty shining boot with the scalloped top the jaunty heel and the delicate toe thought her foot did look very well in it and after a little pause said she would have them it was all very delightful till she got home and was alone then on looking into her purse she saw one dollar and the list of things she meant to get for mother and the children how mean the dollar looked all alone and how long the list grew when there was nothing to buy the articles  i cant make skates for ned nor a desk for will and those are what they have set their hearts upon fathers book and mothers collar are impossible now and i m a selfish thing to go and spend all my money for myself how could i do it and polly eyed the new boots reproachfully as they stood in the first position as if ready for the party they are lovely but i dont believe they will feel good for i shall be thinking about my lost presents all the time sighed polly pushing the enticing boots out of sight i ll go and ask grandma what i can do for if i ve got to make something for every one i must begin right away or i shant get done and off she bustled glad to forget her remorse in hard work  grandma proved equal to the emergency and planned something for every one supplying materials taste and skill in the most delightful manner polly felt much comforted but while she began to knit a pretty pair of white bedsocks to be tied with rosecolored ribbons for her mother she thought some very sober thoughts upon the subject of temptation and if any one had asked her just then what made her sigh as if something lay heavy on her conscience she would have answered bronze boots     chapter iv little things   it s so wainy i cant go out and evwybody is so cwoss they wont play with me said maud when polly found her fretting on the stairs and paused to ask the cause of her wails  i ll play with you only dont scream and wake your mother what shall we play  i dont know i m tired of evwything cause my toys are all bwoken and my dolls are all sick but clawa moaned maud giving a jerk to the paris doll which she held upside down by one leg in the most unmaternal manner  i m going to dress a dolly for my little sister would nt you like to see me do it asked polly persuasively hoping to beguile the cross child and finish her own work at the same time  no i should nt cause she ll look nicer than my clawa her clothes wont come off and tom spoilt em playing ball with her in the yard  would nt you like to rip these clothes off and have me show you how to make some new ones so you can dress and undress clara as much as you like  yes i love to cut and mauds face brightened for destructiveness is one of the earliest traits of childhood and ripping was mauds delight  establishing themselves in the deserted diningroom the children fell to work and when fanny discovered them maud was laughing with all her heart at poor clara who denuded of her finery was cutting up all sorts of capers in the hands of her merry little mistress  i should think you d be ashamed to play with dolls polly i have nt touched one this ever so long said fanny looking down with a superior air  i aint ashamed for it keeps maud happy and will please my sister kitty and i think sewing is better than prinking or reading silly novels so now and polly stitched away with a resolute air for she and fanny had had a little tiff because polly would nt let her friend do up her hair like other folks and bore her ears  dont be cross dear but come and do something nice it s so dull today said fanny anxious to be friends again for it was doubly dull without polly  cant i m busy  you always are busy i never saw such a girl what in the world do you find to do all the time asked fanny watching with interest the set of the little red merino frock polly was putting on to her doll  lots of things but i like to be lazy sometimes as much as you do just lie on the sofa and read fairy stories or think about nothing would you have a whitemuslin apron or a black silk added polly surveying her work with satisfaction  muslin with pockets and tiny blue bows i ll show you how and forgetting her hate and contempt for dolls down sat fanny soon getting as much absorbed as either of the others  the dull day brightened wonderfully after that and the time flew pleasantly as tongues and needles went together grandma peeped in and smiled at the busy group saying sew away my dears dollies are safe companions and needlework an accomplishment that s sadly neglected nowadays small stitches maud neat buttonholes fan cut carefully polly and dont waste your cloth take pains and the best needlewoman shall have a pretty bit of white satin for a dolls bonnet  fanny exerted herself and won the prize for polly helped maud and neglected her own work but she did nt care much for mr shaw said looking at the three bright faces at the teatable i guess polly has been making sunshine for you today no indeed sir i have nt done anything only dress mauds doll  and polly did nt think she had done much but it was one of the little things which are always waiting to be done in this world of ours where rainy days come so often where spirits get out of tune and duty wont go hand in hand with pleasure little things of this sort are especially good work for little people a kind little thought an unselfish little act a cheery little word are so sweet and comfortable that no one can fail to feel their beauty and love the giver no matter how small they are mothers do a deal of this sort of thing unseen unthanked but felt and remembered long afterward and never lost for this is the simple magic that binds hearts together and keeps home happy polly had learned this secret  she loved to do the little things that others did not see or were too busy to stop for and while doing them without a thought of thanks she made sunshine for herself as well as others there was so much love in her own home that she quickly felt the want of it in fannys and puzzled herself to find out why these people were not kind and patient to one another she did not try to settle the question but did her best to love and serve and bear with each and the good will the gentle heart the helpful ways and simple manners of our polly made her dear to every one for these virtues even in a little child are lovely and attractive  mr shaw was very kind to her for he liked her modest respectful manners and polly was so grateful for his many favors that she soon forgot her fear and showed her affection in all sorts of confiding little ways which pleased him extremely she used to walk across the park with him when he went to his office in the morning talking busily all the way and saying goodby with a nod and a smile when they parted at the great gate at first mr shaw did not care much about it but soon he missed her if she did not come and found that something fresh and pleasant seemed to brighten all his day if a small graycoated figure with an intelligent face a merry voice and a little hand slipped confidingly into his went with him through the wintry park coming home late he liked to see a curly brown head watching at the window to find his slippers ready his paper in its place and a pair of willing feet eager to wait upon him i wish my fanny was more like her he often said to himself as he watched the girls while they thought him deep in politics or the state of the money market poor mr shaw had been so busy getting rich that he had not found time to teach his children to love him he was more at leisure now and as his boy and girls grew up he missed something polly was unconsciously showing him what it was and making childlove so sweet that he felt he could not do without it any more yet did nt quite know how to win the confidence of the children who had always found him busy indifferent and absentminded  as the girls were going to bed one night polly kissed grandma as usual and fanny laughed at her saying what a baby you are we are too old for such things now  i dont think people ever are too old to kiss their fathers and mothers was the quick answer  right my little polly and mr shaw stretched out his hand to her with such a kindly look that fanny stared surprised and then said shyly i thought you did nt care about it father i do my dear and mr shaw put out the other hand to fanny who gave him a daughterly kiss quite forgetting everything but the tender feeling that sprung up in her heart at the renewal of the childish custom which we never need outgrow  mrs shaw was a nervous fussy invalid who wanted something every five minutes so polly found plenty of small things to do for her and did them so cheerfully that the poor lady loved to have the quiet helpful child near to wait upon her read to her run errands or hand the seven different shawls which were continually being put on or off  grandma too was glad to find willing hands and feet to serve her and polly passed many happy hours in the quaint rooms learning all sorts of pretty arts and listening to pleasant chat never dreaming how much sunshine she brought to the solitary old lady  tom was pollys rock ahead for a long time because he was always breaking out in a new place and one never knew where to find him he tormented yet amused her was kind one day and a bear the next at times she fancied he was never going to be bad again and the next thing she knew he was deep in mischief and hooted at the idea of repentance and reformation polly gave him up as a hard case but was so in the habit of helping any one who seemed in trouble that she was good to him simply because she could nt help it  what s the matter is your lesson too hard for you she asked one evening as a groan made her look across the table to where tom sat scowling over a pile of dilapidated books with his hands in his hair as if his head was in danger of flying asunder with the tremendous effort he was making  hard guess it is what in thunder do i care about the old carthaginians regulus was nt bad but i m sick of him and tom dealt harknesss latin reader a thump which expressed his feelings better than words  i like latin and used to get on well when i studied it with jimmy perhaps i can help you a little bit said polly as tom wiped his hot face and refreshed himself with a peanut  you pooh girls latin dont amount to much anyway was the grateful reply  but polly was used to him now and nothing daunted took a look at the grimy page in the middle of which tom had stuck she read it so well that the young gentleman stopped munching to regard her with respectful astonishment and when she stopped he said suspiciously you are a sly one polly to study up so you can show off before me but it wont do maam turn over a dozen pages and try again  polly obeyed and did even better than before saying as she looked up with a laugh i ve been through the whole book so you wont catch me that way tom  i say how came you to know such a lot asked tom much impressed  i studied with jimmy and kept up with him for father let us be together in all our lessons it was so nice and we learned so fast  tell me about jimmy he s your brother is nt he  yes but he s dead you know i ll tell about him some other time you ought to study now and perhaps i can help you said polly with a little quiver of the lips  should nt wonder if you could and tom spread the book between them with a grave and businesslike air for he felt that polly had got the better of him and it behooved him to do his best for the honor of his sex he went at the lesson with a will and soon floundered out of his difficulties for polly gave him a lift here and there and they went on swimmingly till they came to some rules to be learned polly had forgotten them so they both committed them to memory tom with hands in his pockets rocked to and fro muttering rapidly while polly twisted the little curl on her forehead and stared at the wall gabbling with all her might  done cried tom presently  done echoed polly and then they heard each other recite till both were perfect that s pretty good fun said tom joyfully tossing poor harkness away and feeling that the pleasant excitement of companionship could lend a charm even to latin grammar  now maam we ll take a turn at algibbera i like that as much as i hate latin  polly accepted the invitation and soon owned that tom could beat her here this fact restored his equanimity but he did nt crow over her far from it for he helped her with a paternal patience that made her eyes twinkle with suppressed fun as he soberly explained and illustrated unconsciously imitating dominie deane till polly found it difficult to keep from laughing in his face  you may have another go at it any time you like generously remarked tom as he shied the algebra after the latin reader  i ll come every evening then i d like to for i have nt studied a bit since i came you shall try and make me like algebra and i ll try and make you like latin will you  oh i d like it well enough if there was any one explain it to me old deane puts us through doublequick and dont give a fellow time to ask questions when we read  ask your father he knows  dont believe he does should nt dare to bother him if he did  why not  he d pull my ears and call me a stupid or tell me not to worry him  i dont think he would he s very kind to me and i ask lots of questions  he likes you better than he does me  now tom it s wrong of you to say so of course he loves you ever so much more than he does me cried polly reprovingly  why dont he show it then muttered tom with a halfwistful halfdefiant glance toward the library door which stood ajar  you act so how can he asked polly after a pause in which she put toms question to herself and could find no better reply than the one she gave him  why dont he give me my velocipede he said if i did well at school for a month i should have it and i ve been pegging away like fury for most six weeks and he dont do a thing about it the girls get their duds because they tease i wont do that anyway but you dont catch me studying myself to death and no pay for it  it is too bad but you ought to do it because it s right and never mind being paid began polly trying to be moral but secretly sympathizing heartily with poor tom  dont you preach polly if the governor took any notice of me and cared how i got on i would nt mind the presents so much but he dont care a hang and never even asked if i did well last declamation day when i d gone and learned the battle of lake regillus because he said he liked it  oh tom did you say that it s splendid jim and i used to say horatius together and it was such fun do speak your piece to me i do so like macaulays lays  it s dreadful long began tom but his face brightened for pollys interest soothed his injured feelings and he was glad to prove his elocutionary powers he began without much spirit but soon the martial ring of the lines fired him and before he knew it he was on his legs thundering away in grand style while polly listened with kindling face and absorbed attention tom did declaim well for he quite forgot himself and delivered the stirring ballad with an energy that made polly flush and tingle with admiration and delight and quite electrified a second listener who had heard all that went on and watched the little scene from behind his newspaper  as tom paused breathless and polly clapped her hands enthusiastically the sound was loudly echoed from behind him both whirled round and there was mr shaw standing in the doorway applauding with all his might  tom looked much abashed and said not a word polly ran to mr shaw and danced before him saying eagerly was nt it splendid did nt he do well may nt he have his velocipede now  capital tom you ll be an orator yet learn another piece like that and i ll come and hear you speak it are you ready for your velocipede hey  polly was right and tom owned that the governor was kind did like him and had nt entirely forgotten his promise the boy turned red with pleasure and picked at the buttons on his jacket while listening to this unexpected praise but when he spoke he looked straight up in his fathers face while his own shone with pleasure as he answered in one breath thankee sir i ll do it sir guess i am sir  very good then look out for your new horse tomorrow sir and mr shaw stroked the fuzzy red head with a kind hand feeling a fatherly pleasure in the conviction that there was something in his boy after all  tom got his velocipede next day named it black auster in memory of the horse in the battle of lake regillus and came to grief as soon as he began to ride his new steed  come out and see me go it whispered tom to polly after three days practice in the street for he had already learned to ride in the rink  polly and maud willingly went and watched his struggles with deep interest till he got an upset which nearly put an end to his velocipeding forever  hi there austers coming shouted tom as came rattling down the long steep street outside the park  they stepped aside and he whizzed by arms and legs going like mad with the general appearance of a runaway engine it would have been a triumphant descent if a big dog had not bounced suddenly through one of the openings and sent the whole concern helterskelter into the gutter polly laughed as she ran to view the ruin for tom lay flat on his back with the velocipede atop him while the big dog barked wildly and his master scolded him for his awkwardness but when she saw toms face polly was frightened for the color had all gone out of it his eyes looked strange and dizzy and drops of blood began to trickle from a great cut on his forehead the man saw it too and had him up in a minute but he could nt stand and stared about him in a dazed sort of way as he sat on the curbstone while polly held her handkerchief to his forehead and pathetically begged to know if he was killed  dont scare mother i m all right got upset did nt i he asked presently eyeing the prostrate velocipede with more anxiety about its damages than his own  i knew you d hurt yourself with that horrid thing just let it be and come home for your head bleeds dreadfully and everybody is looking at us whispered polly trying to tie the little handkerchief over the ugly cut  come on then jove how queer my head feels give us a boost please stop howling maud and come home you bring the machine and i ll pay you pat as he spoke tom slowly picked himself and steadying himself by pollys shoulder issued commands and the procession fell into line first the big dog barking at intervals then the goodnatured irishman trundling that divil of a whirligig as he disrespectfully called the idolized velocipede then the wounded hero supported by the helpful polly and maud brought up the rear in tears bearing toms cap  unfortunately mrs shaw was out driving with grandma and fanny was making calls so that there was no one but polly to stand by tom for the parlormaid turned faint at the sight of blood and the chambermaid lost her wits in the flurry it was a bad cut and must be sewed up at once the doctor said as soon as he came somebody must hold his head he added as he threaded his queer little needle  i ll keep still but if anybody must hold me let polly you aint afraid are you asked tom with imploring look for he did nt like the idea of being sewed a bit  polly was just going to shrink away saying oh i cant when she remembered that tom once called her a coward here was a chance to prove that she was nt besides poor tom had no one else to help him so she came up to the sofa where he lay and nodded reassuringly as she put a soft little hand on either side of the damaged head  you are a trump polly whispered tom then he set his teeth clenched his hands lay quite still and bore it like a man it was all over in a minute or two and when he had had a glass of wine and was nicely settled on his bed he felt pretty comfortable in spite of the pain in his head and being ordered to keep quiet he said thank you ever so much polly and watched her with a grateful face as she crept away  he had to keep the house for a week and laid about looking very interesting with a great black patch on his forehead every one petted him for the doctor said that if the blow had been an inch nearer the temple it would have been fatal and the thought of losing him so suddenly made bluff old tom very precious all at once his father asked him how he was a dozen times a day his mother talked continually of that dear boys narrow escape and grandma cockered him up with every delicacy she could invent and the girls waited on him like devoted slaves this new treatment had an excellent effect for when neglected tom got over his first amazement at this change of base he blossomed out delightfully as sick people do sometimes and surprised his family by being unexpectedly patient grateful and amiable nobody ever knew how much good it did him for boys seldom have confidences of this sort except with their mothers and mrs shaw had never found the key to her sons heart but a little seed was sowed then that took root and though it grew very slowly it came to something in the end perhaps polly helped it a little evening was his hardest time for want of exercise made him as restless and nervous as it was possible for a hearty lad to be on such a short notice  he could nt sleep so the girls amused him fanny played and read aloud polly sung and told stories and did the latter so well that it got to be a regular thing for her to begin as soon as twilight came and tom was settled in his favorite place on grandmas sofa  fire away polly said the young sultan one evening as his little scheherazade sat down in her low chair after stirring up the fire till the room was bright and cosy  i dont feel like stories tonight tom i ve told all i know and cant make up any more answered polly leaning her head on her hand with a sorrowful look that tom had never seen before he watched her a minute and then asked curiously what were you thinking about just now when you sat staring at the fire and getting soberer and soberer every minute  i was thinking about jimmy  would you mind telling about him you know you said you would some time but dont if you d rather not said tom lowering his rough voice respectfully  i like to talk about him but there is nt much to tell began polly grateful for his interest sitting here with you reminded me of the way i used to sit with him when he was sick we used to have such happy times and it s so pleasant to think about them now  he was awfully good was nt he  no he was nt but he tried to be and mother says that is half the battle we used to get tired of trying but we kept making resolutions and working hard to keep em i dont think i got on much but jimmy did and every one loved him  did nt you ever squabble as we do  yes indeed sometimes but we could nt stay mad and always made it up again as soon as we could jimmy used to come round first and say all serene polly so kind and jolly that i could nt help laughing and being friends right away  did he not know a lot  yes i think he did for he liked to study and wanted to get on so he could help father people used to call him a fine boy and i felt so proud to hear it but they did nt know half how wise he was because he did nt show off a bit i suppose sisters always are grand of their brothers but i dont believe many girls had as much right to be as i had  most girls dont care two pins about their brothers so that shows you dont know much about it  well they ought to if they dont and they would if the boys were as kind to them as jimmy was to me  why what did he do  loved me dearly and was nt ashamed to show it cried polly with a sob in her voice that made her answer very eloquent  what made him die polly asked tom soberly after little pause  he got hurt coasting last winter but he never told which boy did it and he only lived a week i helped take care of him and he was so patient i used to wonder at him for he was in dreadful pain all time he gave me his books and his dog and his speckled hens and his big knife and said goodby polly and kissed me the last thing and then o jimmy jimmy if he only could come back  poor pollys eyes had been getting fuller and fuller lips trembling more and more as she went on when she came to that goodby she could nt get any further but covered up her face and cried as her heart would break tom was full of sympathy but did nt know how to show it so he sat shaking up the camphor bottle and trying to think of something proper and comfortable to say when fanny came to the rescue and cuddled polly in her arms with soothing little pats and whispers and kisses till the tears stopped and polly said she did nt mean to and would nt any more i ve been thinking about my dear boy all the evening for tom reminds me of him she added with a sigh  me how can i when i aint a bit like him cried tom amazed  but you are in some ways  wish i was but i cant be for he was good you know  so are you when you choose has nt he been good and patient and dont we all like to pet him when he s clever fan said polly whose heart was still aching for her brother and ready for his sake to find virtues even in tormenting tom  yes i dont know the boy lately but he ll be as bad as ever when he s well returned fanny who had nt much faith in sickbed repentances  much you know about it growled tom lying down again for he had sat bolt upright when polly made the astounding declaration that he was like the wellbeloved jimmy that simple little history had made a deep impression on tom and the tearful ending touched the tender spot that most boys hide so carefully it is very pleasant to be loved and admired very sweet to think we shall be missed and mourned when we die and tom was seized with a sudden desire to imitate this boy who had nt done anything wonderful yet was so dear to his sister that she cried for him a whole year after he was dead so studious and clever the people called him a fine fellow and so anxious to be good that he kept on trying till he was better even than polly whom tom privately considered a model of virtue as girls go  i just wish i had a sister like you he broke out all of a sudden  and i just wish i had a brother like jim cried fanny for she felt the reproach in toms words and knew she deserved it  i should nt think you d envy anybody for you ve got one another said polly with such a wistful look that it suddenly set tom and fanny to wondering why they did nt have better times together and enjoy themselves as polly and jim did  fan dont care for anybody but herself said tom  tom is such a bear retorted fanny  i would nt say such things for if anything should happen to either of you the other one would feel so sorry every cross word i ever said to jimmy comes back now and makes me wish i had nt  two great tears rolled down pollys cheeks and were quietly wiped away but i think they watered that sweet sentiment called fraternal love which till now had been neglected in the hearts of this brother and sister they did nt say anything then or make any plans or confess any faults but when they parted for the night fanny gave the wounded head a gentle pat tom never would have forgiven her if she had kissed him and said in a whisper i hope you ll have a good sleep tommy dear  and tom nodded back at her with a hearty same to you fan  that was all but it meant a good deal for the voices were kind and the eyes met full of that affection which makes words of little consequence polly saw it and though she did nt know that she had made the sunshine it shone back upon her so pleasantly that she fell happily asleep though her jimmy was nt there to say goodnight     chapter v scrapes   after being unusually good children are apt to turn short round and refresh themselves by acting like sancho for a week after toms mishap the young folks were quite angelic so much so that grandma said she was afraid something was going to happen to them the dear old lady need nt have felt anxious for such excessive virtue does nt last long enough to lead to translation except with little prigs in the goody storybooks and no sooner was tom on his legs again when the whole party went astray and much tribulation was the consequence  it all began with pollys stupidity as fan said afterward just as polly ran down to meet mr shaw one evening and was helping him off with his coat the bell rang and a fine bouquet of hothouse flowers was left in pollys hands for she never could learn city ways and opened the door herself  hey whats this my little polly is beginning early after all said mr shaw laughing as he watched the girls face dimple and flush as she smelt the lovely nosegay and glanced at a note half hidden in the heliotrope  now if polly had nt been stupid as fan said she would have had her wits about her and let it pass but you see polly was an honest little soul and it never occurred to her that there was any need of concealment so she answered in her straightforward way oh they aint for me sir they are for fan from mr frank i guess she ll be so pleased  that puppy sends her things of this sort does he and mr shaw looked far from pleased as he pulled out the note and coolly opened it  polly had her doubts about fans approval of that sort of thing but dared not say a word and stood thinking how she used to show her father the funny valentines the boys sent her and how they laughed over them together but mr shaw did not laugh when he had read the sentimental verses accompanying the bouquet and his face quite scared polly as he asked angrily how long has this nonsense been going on  indeed sir i dont know fan does nt mean any harm i wish i had nt said anything stammered polly remembering the promise given to fanny the day of the concert she had forgotten all about it and had become accustomed to see the big boys as she called mr frank and his friends with the girls on all occasions now it suddenly occurred to her that mr shaw did nt like such amusements and had forbidden fan to indulge in them oh dear how mad she will be well i cant help it girls should nt have secrets from their fathers then there would nt be any fuss thought polly as she watched mr shaw twist up the pink note and poke it back among the flowers which he took from her saying shortly send fanny to me in the library  now you ve done it you stupid thing cried fanny both angry and dismayed when polly delivered the message  why what else could i do asked polly much disturbed  let him think the bouquet was for you then thered have been no trouble  but that would have been doing a lie which is most as bad as telling one  dont be a goose you ve got me into a scrape and you ought to help me out  i will if i can but i wont tell lies for anybody cried polly getting excited  nobody wants you to just hold your tongue and let me manage  then i d better not go down began polly when a stern voice from below called like bluebeard are you coming down  yes sir answered a meek voice and fanny clutched polly whispering you must come i m frightened out of my wits when he speaks like that stand by me polly there s a dear  i will whispered sister ann and down they went with fluttering hearts  mr shaw stood on the rug looking rather grim the bouquet lay on the table and beside it a note directed to frank moore esq in a very decided hand with a fiercelooking flourish after the esq pointing to this impressive epistle mr shaw said knitting his black eyebrows as he looked at fanny i m going to put a stop to this nonsense at once and if i see any more of it i ll send you to school in a canadian convent  this awful threat quite took pollys breath away but fanny had heard it before and having a temper of her own said pertly i m sure i have nt done anything so very dreadful i cant help it if the boys send me philopena presents as they do to the other girls  there was nothing about philopenas in the note but that s not the question i forbid you to have anything to do with this moore he s not a boy but a fast fellow and i wont have him about you knew this and yet disobeyed me  i hardly ever see him began fanny  is that true asked mr shaw turning suddenly to polly  oh please sir dont ask me i promised i would nt that is fanny will tell you cried polly quite red with distress at the predicament she was in  no matter about your promise tell me all you know of this absurd affair it will do fanny more good than harm and mr shaw sat down looking more amiable for pollys dismay touched him  may i she whispered to fanny  i dont care answered fan looking both angry and ashamed as she stood sullenly tying knots in her handkerchief  so polly told with much reluctance and much questioning all she knew of the walks the lunches the meetings and the notes it was nt much and evidently less serious than mr shaw expected for as he listened his eyebrows smoothed themselves out and more than once his lips twitched as if he wanted to laugh for after all it was rather comical to see how the young people aped their elders playing the newfashioned game quite unconscious of its real beauty power and sacredness  oh please sir dont blame fan much for she truly is nt half as silly as trix and the other girls she would nt go sleighriding though mr frank teased and she wanted to ever so much she s sorry i know and wont forget what you say any more if you ll forgive her this once cried polly very earnestly when the foolish little story was told  i dont see how i can help it when you plead so well for her come here fan and mind this one thing drop all this nonsense and attend to your books or off you go and canada is no joke in winter time let me tell you  as he spoke mr shaw stroked his sulky daughters cheek hoping to see some sign of regret but fanny felt injured and would nt show that she was sorry so she only said pettishly i suppose i can have my flowers now the fuss is over  they are going straight back where they came from with a line from me which will keep that puppy from ever sending you any more ringing the bell mr shaw despatched the unfortunate posy and then turned to polly saying kindly but gravely set this silly child of mine a good example and do your best for her wont you  me what can i do sir asked polly looking ready but quite ignorant how to begin  make her as like yourself as possible my dear nothing would please me better now go and let us hear no more of this folly  they went without a word and mr shaw heard no more of the affair but poor polly did for fan scolded her till polly thought seriously of packing up and going home next day i really have nt the heart to relate the dreadful lectures she got the snubs she suffered or the cold shoulders turned upon her for several days after this pollys heart was full but she told no one and bore her trouble silently feeling her friends ingratitude and injustice deeply  tom found out what the matter was and sided with polly which proceeding led to scrape number two  where s fan asked the young gentleman strolling into his sisters room where polly lay on the sofa trying to forget her troubles in an interesting book  down stairs seeing company  why did nt you go too  i dont like trix and i dont know her fine new york friends  dont want to neither why dont you say  not polite  who cares i say polly come and have some fun  i d rather read  that is nt polite  polly laughed and turned a page tom whistled a minute then sighed deeply and put his hand to his forehead which the black plaster still adorned  does your head ache asked polly  awfully  better lie down then  cant i m fidgety and want to be amoosed as pug says  just wait till i finish my chapter and then i ll come said pitiful polly  all right returned the perjured boy who had discovered that a broken head was sometimes more useful than a whole one and exulting in his base stratagem he roved about the room till fans bureau arrested him it was covered with all sorts of finery for she had dressed in a hurry and left everything topsyturvy a wellconducted boy would have let things alone or a moral brother would have put things to rights being neither tom rummaged to his hearts content till fans drawers looked as if some one had been making hay in them he tried the effect of earrings ribbons and collars wound up the watch though it was nt time burnt his inquisitive nose with smellingsalts deluged his grimy handkerchief with fans best cologne anointed his curly crop with her hairoil powdered his face with her violetpowder and finished off by pinning on a bunch of false ringlets which fanny tried to keep a profound secret the ravages committed by this bad boy are beyond the power of language to describe as he revelled in the interesting drawers boxes and cases which held his sisters treasures  when the curls had been put on with much pricking of fingers and a blue ribbon added la fan he surveyed himself with satisfaction and considered the effect so fine that he was inspired to try a still greater metamorphosis the dress fan had taken off lay on a chair and into it got tom chuckling with suppressed laughter for polly was absorbed and the bedcurtains hid his iniquity fans best velvet jacket and hat ermine muff and a sofapillow for pannier finished off the costume and tripping along with elbows out tom appeared before the amazed polly just as the chapter ended she enjoyed the joke so heartily that tom forgot consequences and proposed going down into the parlor to surprise the girls  goodness no fanny never would forgive us if you showed her curls and things to those people there are gentlemen among them and it would nt be proper said polly alarmed at the idea  all the more fun fan has nt treated you well and it will serve her right if you introduce me as your dear friend miss shaw come on it will be a jolly lark  i would nt for the world it would be so mean take em off tom and i ll play anything else you like  i aint going to dress up for nothing i look so lovely someone must admire me take me down polly and see if they dont call me a sweet creature  tom looked so unutterably ridiculous as he tossed his curls and pranced that polly went off into another gale of merriment but even while she laughed she resolved not to let him mortify his sister  now then get out of the way if you wont come i m going down said tom  no you re not  how will you help it miss prim  so and polly locked the door put the key in her pocket and nodded at him defiantly  tom was a pepperpot as to temper and anything like opposition always had a bad effect forgetting his costume he strode up to polly saying with a threatening wag of the head none of that i wont stand it  promise not to plague fan and i ll let you out  wont promise anything give me that key or i ll make you  now tom dont be savage i only want to keep you out of a scrape for fan will be raging if you go take off her things and i ll give up  tom vouchsafed no reply but marched to the other door which was fast as polly knew looked out of the threestory window and finding no escape possible came back with a wrathful face will you give me that key  no i wont said polly valiantly  i m stronger than you are so you d better hand over  i know you are but it s cowardly for a great boy like you to rob a girl  i dont want to hurt you but by george i wont stand this  tom paused as polly spoke evidently ashamed of himself but his temper was up and he would nt give in if polly had cried a little just here he would have yielded unfortunately she giggled for toms fierce attitude was such a funny contrast to his dress that she could nt help it that settled the matter no girl that ever lived should giggle at him much less lock him up like a small child without a word he made a grab at pollys arm for the hand holding the key was still in her pocket with her other hand she clutched her frock and for a minute held on stoutly but toms strong fingers were irresistible rip went the pocket out came the hand and with a cry of pain from polly the key fell on the floor  it s your own fault if you re hurt i did nt mean to muttered tom as he hastily departed leaving polly to groan over her sprained wrist he went down but not into the parlor for somehow the joke seemed to have lost its relish so he made the girls in the kitchen laugh and then crept up the back way hoping to make it all right with polly but she had gone to grandmas room for though the old lady was out it seemed a refuge he had just time to get things in order when fanny came up crosser than ever for trix had been telling her of all sorts of fun in which she might have had a share if polly had held her tongue  where is she asked fan wishing to vent her vexation on her friend  moping in her room i suppose replied tom who was discovered reading studiously  now while this had been happening maud had been getting into hot water also for when her maid left her to see a friend below miss maud paraded into pollys room and solaced herself with mischief in an evil hour polly had let her play boat in her big trunk which stood empty since then polly had stored some of her most private treasures in the upper tray so that she might feel sure they were safe from all eyes she had forgotten to lock the trunk and when maud raised the lid to begin her voyage several objects of interest met her eyes she was deep in her researches when fan came in and looked over her shoulder feeling too cross with polly to chide maud  as polly had no money for presents she had exerted her ingenuity to devise all sorts of gifts hoping by quantity to atone for any shortcomings in quality some of her attempts were successful others were failures but she kept them all fine or funny knowing the children at home would enjoy anything new some of mauds castoff toys had been neatly mended for kitty some of fans old ribbons and laces were converted into dolls finery and toms little figures whittled out of wood in idle minutes were laid away to show will what could be done with a knife  what rubbish said fanny  queer girl is nt she added tom who had followed to see what was going on  dont you laugh at pollys things she makes nicer dolls than you fan and she can wite and dwar ever so much better than tom cried maud how do you know i never saw her draw said tom  here s a book with lots of pictures in it i cant wead the witing but the pictures are so funny  eager to display her friends accomplishments maud pulled out a fat little book marked pollys journal and spread it in her lap  only the pictures no harm in taking a look at em said tom  just one peep answered fanny and the next minute both were laughing at a droll sketch of tom in the gutter with the big dog howling over him and the velocipede running away very rough and faulty but so funny that it was evident pollys sense of humor was strong a few pages farther back came fanny and mr frank caricatured then grandma carefully done tom reciting his battlepiece mr shaw and polly in the park maud being borne away by katy and all the schoolgirls turned into ridicule with an unsparing hand  sly little puss to make fun of us behind our backs said fan rather nettled by pollys quiet retaliation for many slights from herself and friends  she does draw well said tom looking critically at the sketch of a boy with a pleasant face round whom polly had drawn rays like the sun and under which was written my dear jimmy  you would nt admire her if you knew what she wrote here about you said fanny whose eyes had strayed to the written page opposite and lingered there long enough to read something that excited her curiosity  what is it asked tom forgetting his honorable resolves for a minute  she says i try to like tom and when he is pleasant we do very well but he dont stay so long he gets cross and rough and disrespectful to his father and mother and plagues us girls and is so horrid i almost hate him it s very wrong but i cant help it how do you like that asked fanny  go ahead and see how she comes down on you maam retorted tom who had read on a bit  does she and fanny continued rapidly as for fan i dont think we can be friends any more for she told her father a lie and wont forgive me for not doing so too i used to think her a very fine girl but i dont now if she would be as she was when i first knew her i should love her just the same but she is nt kind to me and though she is always talking about politeness i dont think it is polite to treat company as she does me she thinks i am odd and countrified and i dare say i am but i should nt laugh at a girls clothes because she was poor or keep her out of the way because she did nt do just as other girls do here i see her make fun of me and i cant feel as i did and i d go home only it would seem ungrateful to mr shaw and grandma and i do love them dearly  i say fan you ve got it now shut the book and come away cried tom enjoying this broadside immensely but feeling guilty as well he might  just one bit more whispered fanny turning on a page or two and stopping at a leaf that was blurred here and there as if tears had dropped on it  sunday morning early nobody is up to spoil my quiet time and i must write my journal for i ve been so bad lately i could nt bear to do it i m glad my visit is most done for things worry me here and there is nt any one to help me get right when i get wrong i used to envy fanny but i dont now for her father and mother dont take care of her as mine do of me she is afraid of her father and makes her mother do as she likes i m glad i came though for i see money dont give people everything but i d like a little all the same for it is so comfortable to buy nice things i read over my journal just now and i m afraid it s not a good one for i have said all sorts of things about the people here and it is nt kind i should tear it out only i promised to keep my diary and i want to talk over things that puzzle me with mother i see now that it is my fault a good deal for i have nt been half as patient and pleasant as i ought to be i will truly try for the rest of the time and be as good and grateful as i can for i want them to like me though i m only an oldfashioned country girl  that last sentence made fanny shut the book with a face full of selfreproach for she had said those words herself in a fit of petulance and polly had made no answer though her eyes filled and her cheeks burned fan opened her lips to say something but not a sound followed for there stood polly looking at them with an expression they had never seen before  what are you doing with my things she demanded in a low tone while her eyes kindled and her color changed  maud showed us a book she found and we were just looking at the pictures began fanny dropping it as if it burnt her fingers  and reading my journal and laughing at my presents and then putting the blame on maud it s the meanest thing i ever saw and i ll never forgive you as long as i live  polly said this all in one indignant breath and then as if afraid of saying too much ran out of the room with such a look of mingled contempt grief and anger that the three culprits stood dumb with shame tom had nt even a whistle at his command maud was so scared at gentle pollys outbreak that she sat as still as a mouse while fanny conscience stricken laid back the poor little presents with a respectful hand for somehow the thought of pollys poverty came over her as it never had done before and these odds and ends so carefully treasured up for those at home touched fanny and grew beautiful in her eyes as she laid by the little book the confessions in it reproached her more sharply that any words polly could have spoken for she had laughed at her friend had slighted her sometimes and been unforgiving for an innocent offence that last page where polly took the blame on herself and promised to truly try to be more kind and patient went to fannys heart melting all the coldness away and she could only lay her head on the trunk sobbing it was nt pollys fault it was all mine  tom still red with shame at being caught in such a scrape left fanny to her tears and went manfully away to find the injured polly and confess his manifold transgressions but polly could nt be found he searched high and low in every room yet no sign of the girt appeared and tom began to get anxious she cant have run away home can she he said to himself as he paused before the hattree there was the little round hat and tom gave it a remorseful smooth remembering how many times he had tweaked it half off or poked it over poor pollys eyes maybe she s gone down to the office to tell pa t is nt a bit like her though anyway i ll take a look round the corner  eager to get his boots tom pulled open the door of a dark closet under the stairs and nearly tumbled over backward with surprise for there on the floor with her head pillowed on a pair of rubbers lay polly in an attitude of despair this mournful spectacle sent toms penitent speech straight out of his head and with an astonished hullo he stood and stared in impressive silence polly was nt crying and lay so still that tom began to think she might be in a fit or a faint and bent anxiously down to inspect the pathetic bunch a glimpse of wet eyelashes a round cheek redder than usual and lips parted by quick breathing relieved his mind upon that point so taking courage he sat down on the bootjack and begged pardon like a man  now polly was very angry and i think she had a right to be but she was not resentful and after the first flash was over she soon began to feel better about it it was nt easy to forgive but as she listened to toms honest voice getting gruff with remorse now and then she could nt harden her heart against him or refuse to make up when he so frankly owned that it was confounded mean to read her book that way she liked his coming and begging pardon at once it was a handsome thing to do she appreciated it and forgave him in her heart some time before she did with her lips for to tell the truth polly had a spice of girlish malice and rather liked to see domineering tom eat humblepie just enough to do him good you know she felt that atonement was proper and considered it no more than just that fan should drench a handkerchief or two with repentant tears and that tom should sit on a very uncomfortable seat and call himself hard names for five or ten minutes before she relented  come now do say a word to a fellow i m getting the worst of it anyway for there s fan crying her eyes out upstairs and here are you stowed away in a dark closet as dumb as a fish and nobody but me to bring you both round i d have cut over to the smythes and got ma home to fix things only it looked like backing out of the scrape so i did nt said tom as a last appeal  polly was glad to hear that fan was crying it would do her good but she could nt help softening to tom who did seem in a predicament between two weeping damsels a little smile began to dimple the cheek that was nt hidden and then a hand came slowly out from under the curly head and was stretched toward him silently tom was just going to give it a hearty shake when he saw a red mark on the wrist and knew what made it his face changed and he took the chubby hand so gently that polly peeped to see what it meant  will you forgive that too he asked in a whisper stroking the red wrist  yes it dont hurt much now and polly drew her hand away sorry he had seen it  i was a beast that s what i was said tom in a tone of great disgust and just at that awkward minute down tumbled his fathers old beaver over his head and face putting a comical quencher on his selfreproaches of course neither could help laughing at that and when he emerged polly was sitting up looking as much better for her shower as he did for his momentary eclipse  fan feels dreadfully will you kiss and be friends if i trot her down asked tom remembering his fellowsinner  i ll go to her and polly whisked out of the closet as suddenly as she had whisked in leaving tom sitting on the bootjack with a radiant countenance  how the girls made it up no one ever knew but after much talking and crying kissing and laughing the breach was healed and peace declared a slight haze still lingered in the air after the storm for fanny was very humble and tender that evening tom a trifle pensive but distressingly polite and polly magnanimously friendly to every one for generous natures like to forgive and polly enjoyed the petting after the insult like a very human girl  as she was brushing her hair at bedtime there came a tap on her door and opening it she beheld nothing but a tall black bottle with a strip of red flannel tied round it like a cravat and a cockedhat note on the cork inside were these lines written in a sprawling hand with very black ink  dear polly opydilldock is firstrate for sprains you put a lot on the flannel and do up your wrist and i guess it will be all right in the morning will you come a sleighride tomorrow i m awful sorry i hurt you  tom     chapter vi grandma   where s polly asked fan one snowy afternoon as she came into the diningroom where tom was reposing on the sofa with his boots in the air absorbed in one of those delightful books in which boys are cast away on desert islands where every known fruit vegetable and flower is in its prime all the year round or lost in boundless forests where the young heroes have thrilling adventures kill impossible beasts and when the authors invention gives out suddenly find their way home laden with tiger skins tame buffaloes and other pleasing trophies of their prowess  dun no was toms brief reply for he was just escaping from an alligator of the largest size  do put down that stupid book and let s do something said fanny after a listless stroll round the room  hi they ve got him was the only answer vouchsafed by the absorbed reader  where s polly asked maud joining the party with her hands full of paper dolls all suffering for balldresses  do get along and dont bother me cried tom exasperated at the interruption  then tell us where she is i m sure you know for she was down here a little while ago said fanny  up in grandmas room maybe  provoking thing you knew it all the time and did nt tell just to plague us scolded maud  but tom was now under water stabbing his alligator and took no notice of the indignant departure of the young ladies  polly s always poking up in grandmas room i dont see what fun there is in it said fanny as they went up stairs  polly s a verwy queer girl and gwandma pets her a gweat deal more than she does me observed maud with an injured air  let s peek and see what they are doing whispered fan pausing at the halfopen door  grandma was sitting before a quaint old cabinet the doors of which stood wide open showing glimpses of the faded relics treasured there on a stool at the old ladys feet sat polly looking up with intent face and eager eyes quite absorbed in the history of a highheeled brocade shoe which lay in her lap  well my dear grandma was saying she had it on the very day that uncle joe came in as she sat at work and said dolly we must be married at once very well joe says aunt dolly and down she went to the parlor where the minister was waiting never stopping to change the dimity dress she wore and was actually married with her scissors and pinball at her side and her thimble on that was in war times 1812 my dear and uncle joe was in the army so he had to go and he took that very little pinball with him here it is with the mark of a bullet through it for he always said his dollys cushion saved his life  how interesting that is cried polly as she examined the faded cushion with the hole in it  why grandma you never told me that story said fanny hurrying in finding the prospect was a pleasant one for a stormy afternoon  you never asked me to tell you anything my dear so i kept my old stories to myself answered grandma quietly  tell some now please may we stay and see the funny things said fan and maud eyeing the open cabinet with interest  if polly likes she is my company and i am trying to entertain her for i love to have her come said grandma with her oldtime politeness  oh yes do let them stay and hear the stories i ve often told them what good times we have up here and teased them to come but they think it s too quiet now sit down girls and let grandma go on you see i pick out something in the cabinet that looks interesting and then she tells me about it said polly eager to include the girls in her pleasures and glad to get them interested in grandmas reminiscences for polly knew how happy it made the lonely old lady to live over her past and to have the children round her  here are three drawers that have not been opened yet each take one and choose something from it for me to tell about said madam quite excited at the unusual interest in her treasures  so the girls each opened a drawer and turned over the contents till they found something they wanted to know about maud was ready first and holding up an oddly shaped linen bag with a big blue f embroidered on it demanded her story grandma smiled as she smoothed the old thing tenderly and began her story with evident pleasure  my sister nelly and i went to visit an aunt of ours when we were little girls but we did nt have a very good time for she was extremely strict one afternoon when she had gone out to tea and old debby the maid was asleep in her room we sat on the doorstep feeling homesick and ready for any thing to amuse us  what shall we do said nelly  just as she spoke a ripe plum dropped bounce on the grass before us as if answering her question it was all the plums fault for if it had nt fallen at that minute i never should have had the thought which popped into my mischievous mind  let s have as many as we want and plague aunt betsey to pay her for being so cross i said giving nelly half the great purple plum  it would be dreadful naughty began nelly but i guess we will she added as the sweet mouthful slipped down her throat  debby s asleep come on then and help me shake i said getting up eager for the fun  we shook and shook till we got red in the face but not one dropped for the tree was large and our little arms were not strong enough to stir the boughs then we threw stones but only one green and one halfripe one came down and my last stone broke the shed window so there was an end of that  it s as provoking as aunt betsey herself said nelly as we sat down out of breath  i wish the wind would come and blow em down for us panted i staring up at the plums with longing eyes  if wishing would do any good i should wish em in my lap at once added nelly  you might as well wish em in your mouth and done with it if you are too lazy to pick em up if the ladder was nt too heavy we could try that said i determined to have them  you know we cant stir it so what is the use of talking about it you proposed getting the plums now let s see you do it answered nelly rather crossly for she had bitten the green plum and it puckered her mouth  wait a minute and you will see me do it cried i as a new thought came into my naughty head  what are you taking your shoes and socks off for you cant climb the tree fan dont ask questions but be ready to pick em up when they fall miss lazybones with this mysterious speech i pattered into the house barefooted and full of my plan up stairs i went to a window opening on the shed roof out i got and creeping carefully along till i came near the tree i stood up and suddenly crowed like the little rooster nelly looked up and stared and laughed and clapped her hands when she saw what i was going to do  i m afraid you ll slip and get hurt dont care if i do i ll have those plums if i break my neck doing it and half sliding half walking i went down the sloping roof till the boughs of the tree were within my reach  hurrah cried nelly dancing down below as my first shake sent a dozen plums rattling round her  hurrah cried i letting go one branch and trying to reach another but as i did so my foot slipped i tried to catch something to hold by but found nothing and with a cry down i fell like a very big plum on the grass below  fortunately the shed was low the grass was thick and the tree broke my fall but i got a bad bump and a terrible shaking nelly thought i was killed and began to cry with her mouth full but i picked myself up in a minute for i was used to such tumbles and did nt mind the pain half as much as the loss of the plums  hush debby will hear and spoil all the fun i said i d get em and i have see what lots have come down with me so there had for my fall shook the tree almost as much as it did me and the green and purple fruit lay all about us  by the time the bump on my forehead had swelled as big as a nut our aprons were half full and we sat down to enjoy ourselves but we did nt o dear no for many of the plums were not ripe some were hurt by the birds some crushed in falling and many as hard as stones nelly got stung by a wasp my head began to ache and we sat looking at one another rather dismally when nelly had a bright idea  let s cook em then they ll be good and we can put some away in our little pails for tomorrow that will be splendid there s a fire in the kitchen debby always leaves the kettle on and we can use her saucepan and i know where the sugar is and we ll have a grand time in we went and fell to work very quietly it was a large open fireplace with the coals nicely covered up and the big kettle simmering on the hook we raked open the fire put on the saucepan and in it the best of our plums with water enough to spoil them but we did nt know that and felt very important as we sat waiting for it to boil each armed with a big spoon while the sugar box stood between us ready to be used  how slow they were to be sure i never knew such obstinate things for they would nt soften though they danced about in the boiling water and bobbed against the cover as if they were doing their best  the sun began to get low we were afraid debby would come down and still those dreadful plums would nt look like sauce at last they began to burst the water got a lovely purple we put lots of sugar in and kept tasting till our aprons and faces were red and our lips burnt with the hot spoons  there s too much juice said nelly shaking her head wisely it ought to be thick and nice like mammas i ll pour off some of the juice and we can drink it said i feeling that i d made a mistake in my cooking  so nelly got a bowl and i got a towel and lifted the big saucepan carefully off it was heavy and hot and i was a little afraid of it but did nt like to say so just as i began to pour debby suddenly called from the top of the stairs children what under the sun are you doing it startled us both nelly dropped the bowl and ran i dropped the saucepan and did nt run for a part of the hot juice splashed upon my bare feet and ankles and made me scream with dreadful pain  down rushed debby to find me dancing about the kitchen with a great bump on my forehead a big spoon in my hand and a pair of bright purple feet the plums were lying all over the hearth the saucepan in the middle of the room the basin was broken and the sugar swimming about as if the bowl had turned itself over trying to sweeten our mess for us  debby was very good to me for she never stopped to scold but laid me down on the old sofa and bound up my poor little feet with oil and cotton wool nelly seeing me lie white and weak thought i was dying and went over to the neighbors for aunt betsey and burst in upon the old ladies sitting primly at their tea crying distractedly oh aunt betsey come quick for the saucepan fell off the shed and fans feet are all boiled purple nobody laughed at this funny message and aunt betsey ran all the way home with a muffin in her hand and her ball in her pocket though the knitting was left behind  i suffered a great deal but i was nt sorry afterward for i learned to love aunt betsey who nursed me tenderly and seemed to forget her strict ways in her anxiety for me  this bag was made for my special comfort and hung on the sofa where i lay all those weary days aunt kept it full of pretty patchwork or what i liked better gingernuts and peppermint drops to amuse me though she did nt approve of cosseting children up any more than i do now  i like that vewy well and i wish i could have been there was mauds condescending remark as she put back the little bag after a careful peep inside as if she hoped to find an ancient gingernut or a wellpreserved peppermint drop still lingering in some corner  we had plums enough that autumn but did nt seem to care much about them after all for our prank became a household joke and for years we never saw the fruit but nelly would look at me with a funny face and whisper purple stockings fan  thank you maam said polly now fan your turn next  well i ve a bundle of old letters and i d like to know if there is any story about them answered fanny hoping some romance might be forthcoming  grandma turned over the little packet tied up with a faded pink ribbon a dozen yellow notes written on rough thick paper with red wafers still adhering to the folds showing plainly that they were written before the day of initial notepaper and selfsealing envelopes  they are not loveletters deary but notes from my mates after i left miss cottons boardingschool i dont think there is any story about them and grandma turned them over with spectacles before the dim eyes so young and bright when they first read the very same notes  fanny was about to say i ll choose again when grandma began to laugh so heartily that the girls felt sure she had caught some merry old memory which would amuse them  bless my heart i have nt thought of that frolic this forty years poor dear giddy sally pomroy and she s a greatgrandmother now cried the old lady after reading one of the notes and clearing the mist off her glasses  now please tell about her i know it s something funny to make you laugh so said polly and fan together  well it was droll and i m glad i remembered it for it s just the story to tell you young things  it was years ago began grandma briskly and teachers were very much stricter than they are now the girls at miss cottons were not allowed lights in their rooms after nine oclock never went out alone and were expected to behave like models of propriety from morning till night  as you may imagine ten young girls full of spirits and fun found these rules hard to keep and made up for good behavior in public by all sorts of frolics in private  miss cotton and her brother sat in the back parlor after school was over and the young ladies were sent to bed mr john was very deaf and miss priscilla very nearsighted two convenient afflictions for the girls on some occasions but once they proved quite the reverse as you shall hear  we had been very prim for a week and our bottled up spirits could no longer be contained so we planed a revel after our own hearts and set our wits to work to execute it  the first obstacle was surmounted in this way as none of us could get out alone we resolved to lower sally from the window for she was light and small and very smart  with our combined pocketmoney she was to buy nuts and candy cake and fruit pie and a candle so that we might have a light after betsey took ours away as usual we were to darken the window of the inner chamber set a watch in the little entry light up and then for a good time  at eight oclock on the appointed evening several of us professed great weariness and went to our room leaving the rest sewing virtuously with miss cotton who read hannah mores sacred dramas aloud in a way that fitted the listeners for bed as well as a dose of opium would have done  i am sorry to say i was one of the ringleaders and as soon as we got up stairs produced the rope provided for the purpose and invited sally to be lowered it was an oldfashioned house sloping down behind and the closet window chosen by us was not many feet from the ground  it was a summer evening so that at eight oclock it was still light but we were not afraid of being seen for the street was a lonely one and our only neighbors two old ladies who put down their curtains at sunset and never looked out till morning  sally had been bribed by promises of as many goodies as she could eat and being a regular madcap she was ready for anything  tying the rope round her waist she crept out and we let her safely down sent a big basket after her and saw her slip round the corner in my big sun bonnet and another girls shawl so that she should not be recognized  then we put our nightgowns over our dresses and were laid peacefully in bed when betsey came up earlier than usual for it was evident that miss cotton felt a little suspicious at our sudden weariness  for half an hour we lay laughing and whispering as we waited for the signal from sally at last we heard a cricket chirp shrilly under the window and flying up saw a little figure below in the twilight  o quick quick cried sally panting with haste draw up the basket and then get me in for i saw mr cotton in the market and ran all the way home so that i might get in before he came up came the heavy basket bumping and scraping on the way and smelling o so nice down went the rope and with a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together we hoisted poor sally halfway up to the window when sad to tell the rope slipped and down she fell only being saved from broken bones by the haycock under the window  he s coming he s coming o pull me up for mercy sake cried sally scrambling to her feet unhurt but a good deal shaken  we saw a dark figure approaching and dragged her in with more bumping and scraping and embraced her with rapture for we had just escaped being detected by mr john whose eyes were as sharp as his ears were dull  we heard the frontdoor shut then a murmur of voices and then betseys heavy step coming up stairs  under the bed went the basket and into the beds went the conspirators and nothing could have been more decorous than the appearance of the room when betsey popped her head in  masters an old fidget to send me travelling up again just because he fancied he saw something amiss at the window nothing but a curtain flapping or a shadder for the poor dears is sleeping like lambs we heard her say this to herself and a general titter agitated the white coverlets as she departed  sally was in high feather at the success of her exploit and danced about like an elf as she put her nightgown on over her frock braided her hair in funny little tails all over her head and fastened the great red pincushion on her bosom for a breastpin in honor of the feast  the other girls went to their rooms as agreed upon and all was soon dark and still up stairs while miss cotton began to enjoy herself below as she always did when her young charges were safely disposed of  then ghosts began to walk and the mice scuttled back to their holes in alarm for white figures glided from room to room till all were assembled in the little chamber  the watch was set at the entry door the signal agreed upon the candle lighted and the feast spread forth upon a newspaper on the bed with the coverlet arranged so that it could be whisked over the refreshments at a moments notice  how good everything was to be sure i dont think i ve eaten any pies since that had such a delicious flavor as those broken ones eaten hastily in that little oven of a room with sally making jokes and the others enjoying stolen sweets with true girlish relish of course it was very wicked but i must tell the truth  we were just beginning on the cake when the loud scratching of a rat disturbed us  the signal fly run hide hush dont laugh cried several voices and we scuttled into bed as rapidly and noiselessly as possible with our mouths and hands full  a long pause broken by more scratching but as no one came we decided on sending to inquire what it meant i went and found mary the picket guard half asleep and longing for her share of the feast  it was a real rat i ve not made a sound do go and finish i m tired of this said mary slapping away at the mosquitoes  back i hurried with the good news every one flew up briskly we lighted the candle again and returned to our revel the refreshments were somewhat injured by sallys bouncing in among them bit we did nt care and soon finished the cake  now let s have the nuts i said groping for the paper bag  they are almonds and peanuts so we can crack them with our teeth be sure you get the bag by the right end said sally  i know what i m about and to show her that it was all right i gave the bag a little shake when out flew the nuts rattling like a hailstorm all over the uncarpeted floor  now you ve done it cried sally as mary scratched like a mad rat and a door creaked below for miss cotton was not deaf  such a flurry as we were in out went the candle and each one rushed away with as much of the feast as she could seize in her haste sally dived into her bed recklessly demolishing the last pie and scattering the candy far and wide  poor mary was nearly caught for miss cotton was quicker than betsey and our guard had to run for her life  our room was the first and was in good order though the two flushed faces on the pillows were rather suspicious miss cotton stood staring about her looking so funny without her cap that my bedfellow would have gone off in a fit of laughter if i had not pinched her warningly  young ladies what is this unseemly noise no answer from us but a faint snore miss cotton marched into the next room put the same question and received the same reply  in the third chamber lay sally and we trembled as the old lady went in sitting up we peeped and listened breathlessly  sarah i command you to tell me what this all means but sally only sighed in her sleep and muttered wickedly ma take me home i m starved at cottons mercy on me is the child going to have a fever cried the old lady who did not observe the tell tale nuts at her feet  so dull so strict o take me home moaned sally tossing her arms and gurgling like a naughty little gypsy  that last bit of acting upset the whole concern for as she tossed her arms she showed the big red cushion on her breast nearsighted as she was that ridiculous object could not escape miss cotton neither did the orange that rolled out from the pillow nor the boots appearing at the foot of the bed  with sudden energy the old lady plucked off the cover and there lay sally with her hair dressed la topsy her absurd breastpin and her dusty boots among papers of candy bits of pie and cake oranges and apples and a candle upside down burning a hole in the sheet  at the sound of miss cottons horrified exclamation sally woke up and began laughing so merrily that none of us could resist following her example and the rooms rang with merriment far many minutes i really dont know when we should have stopped if sally had not got choked with the nut she had in her mouth and so frightened us nearly out of our wits  what became of the things and how were you punished asked fan in the middle of her laughter  the remains of the feast went to the pig and we were kept on bread and water for three days  did that cure you  oh dear no we had half a dozen other frolics that very summer and although i cannot help laughing at the remembrance of this you must not think child that i approve of such conduct or excuse it no no my dear far from it  i call that a tiptop story drive on grandma and tell one about boys broke in a new voice and there was tom astride of a chair listening and laughing with all his might for his book had come to an end and he had joined the party unobserved  wait for your turn tommy now polly dear what will you have said grandma looking so lively and happy that it was very evident reminiscing did her good  let mine come last and tell one for tom next said polly looking round and beckoning him nearer  he came and sat himself crosslegged on the floor before the lower drawer of the cabinet which grandma opened for him saying with a benign stroke of the curly head there dear that s where i keep the little memorials of my brother jack poor lad he was lost at sea you know well choose anything you like and i ll try to remember a story about it  tom made a rapid rummage and fished up a little broken pistol  there that s the chap for me wish it was nt spoilt then we d have fun popping away at the cats in the yard now then grandma  i remember one of jacks pranks when that was used with great effect said grandma after a thoughtful pause during which tom teased the girls by snapping the lock of the pistol in their faces  once upon a time continued madam much flattered by the row of interested faces before her my father went away on business leaving mother aunt and us girls to jacks care very proud he was to be sure of the responsibility and the first thing he did was to load that pistol and keep it by his bed in our great worriment for we feared he d kill himself with it for a week all went well then we were startled by the news that robbers were about all sorts of stories flew through the town we were living in the country then some said that certain houses were marked with a black cross and those were always robbed others that there was a boy in the gang for windows so small that they were considered safe were entered by some little rogue at one place the thieves had a supper and left ham and cake in the front yard mrs jones found mrs smiths shawl in her orchard with a hammer and an unknown teapot near it one man reported that some one tapped at his window in the night saying softly is anyone here and when he looked out two men were seen to run down the road  we lived just out of town in a lonely place the house was old with convenient little back windows and five outside doors jack was the only man about the place and he was barely thirteen mother and aunt were very timid and the children werent old enough to be of any use so jack and i were the homeguard and vowed to defend the family manfully  good for you hope the fellows came cried tom charmed with this opening  one day an illlooking man came in and asked for food continued grandma with a mysterious nod and while he ate i saw him glance sharply about from the wooden buttons on the backdoors to the silver urn and tankards on the diningroom sideboard a strong suspicion took possession of me and i watched him as a cat does a mouse  he came to examine the premises i m sure of it but we will be ready for him i said fiercely as i told the family about him  this fancy haunted us all and our preparations were very funny mother borrowed a rattle and kept it under her pillow aunt took a big bell to bed with her the children had little tip the terrier to sleep in their room while jack and i mounted guard he with the pistol and i with a hatchet for i did nt like firearms biddy who slept in the attic practised getting out on the shed roof so that she might run away at the first alarm every night we arranged pitfalls for the robbers and all filed up to bed bearing plate money weapons and things to barricade with as if we lived in war times  we waited a week and no one came so we began to feel rather slighted for other people got a scare as tom says and after all our preparations we really felt a trifle disappointed that we had had no chance to show our courage at last a black mark was found upon our door and a great panic ensued for we felt that now our time had come  that night we put a tub of water at the bottom of the backstairs and a pile of tin pans at the top of the front stairs so that any attempt to come up would produce a splash or a rattle bells were hung on door handles sticks of wood piled up in dark corners for robbers to fall over and the family retired all armed and all provided with lamps and matches  jack and i left our doors open and kept asking one another if we did nt hear something till he fell asleep i was wakeful and lay listening to the crickets till the clock struck twelve then i got drowsy and was just dropping off when the sound of steps outside woke me up staring wide awake creeping to the window i was in time to see by the dim moonlight a shadow glide round the corner and disappear a queer little thrill went over me but i resolved to keep quiet till i was sure something was wrong for i had given so many false alarms i did nt want jack to laugh at me again popping my head out of the door i listened and presently heard a scraping sound near the shed  there they are but i wont rouse the house till the bell rings or the pans fall the rogues cant go far without a clatter of some sort and if we could only catch one of them we should get the reward and a deal of glory i said to myself grasping my hatchet firmly  a door closed softly below and a step came creeping towards the backstairs sure now of my prey i was just about to scream jack when something went splash into the tub at the foot of the backstairs  in a minute every one was awake and up for jack fired his pistol before he was half out of bed and roared fire so loud it roused the house mother sprung her rattle aunt rang her bell jip barked like mad and we all screamed while from below came up a regular irish howl  some one brought a lamp and we peeped anxiously down to see our own stupid biddy sitting in the tub wringing her hands and wailing dismally  och murther and it s kilt i am the saints be about us how iver did i come forninst this say iv wather just crapin in quiet afther a bit iv sthroll wid mike mahoney me own by that s to marry me intirely come saint patricks day nixt we laughed so we could hardly fish the poor thing up or listen while she explained that she had slipped out of her window for a word with mike and found it fastened when she wanted to come back so she had sat on the roof trying to discover the cause of this mysterious barring out till she was tired when she prowled round the house till she found a cellar window unfastened after all our care and got in quite cleverly she thought but the tub was a new arrangement which she knew nothing about and when she fell into the say she was bewildered and could only howl  this was not all the damage either for aunt fainted with the fright mother cut her hand with a broken lamp the children took cold hopping about on the wet stairs jip barked himself sick i sprained my ankle and jack not only smashed a lookingglass with his bullets but spoilt his pistol by the heavy charge put in it after the damages were repaired and the flurry was well over jack confessed that he had marked the door for fun and shut biddy out as a punishment for gallivanting of which he did nt approve such a rogue as that boy was  but did nt the robbers ever come cried tom enjoying the joke but feeling defrauded of the fight  never my dear but we had our scare and tested our courage and that was a great satisfaction of course answered grandma placidly  well i think you were the bravest of the lot i d like to have seen you flourishing round there with your hatchet added tom admiringly and the old lady looked as much pleased with the compliment as if she had been a girl  i choose this said polly holding up a long white kid glove shrunken and yellow with time but looking as if it had a history  ah that now has a story worth telling cried grandma adding proudly treat that old glove respectfully my children for lafayettes honored hand has touched it  oh grandma did you wear it did you see him do tell us all about it and that will be the best of the whole cried polly who loved history and knew a good deal about the gallant frenchman and his brave life  grandma loved to tell this story and always assumed her most imposing air to do honor to her theme drawing herself up therefore she folded her hands and after two or three little hems began with an absent look as if her eyes beheld a faraway time which brightened as she gazed  the first visit of lafayette was before my time of course but i heard so much about it from my grandfather that i really felt as if i d seen it all our aunt hancock lived in the governors house on beacon hill at that time here the old lady bridled up still more for she was very proud of our aunt ah my dears those were the good old times she continued with a sigh such dinners and tea parties such damask table cloths and fine plate such solid handsome furniture and elegant carriages aunts was lined with red silk velvet and when the coach was taken away from her at the governors death she just ripped out the lining and we girls had spencers made of it dear heart how well i remember playing in aunts great garden and chasing jack up and down those winding stairs and my blessed father in his plumcolored coat and knee buckles and the queue i used to tie up for him every day handing aunt in to dinner looking so dignified and splendid  grandma seemed to forget her story for a minute and become a little girl again among the playmates dead and gone so many years polly motioned the others to be quiet and no one spoke till the old lady with a long sigh came back to the present and went on  well as i was saying the governor wanted to give a breakfast to the french officers and madam who was a hospitable soul got up a splendid one for them but by some mistake or accident it was discovered at the last minute that there was no milk  a great deal was needed and very little could be bought or borrowed so despair fell upon the cooks and maids and the great breakfast would have been a failure if madam with the presence of mind of her sex had not suddenly bethought herself of the cows feeding on the common  to be sure they belonged to her neighbors and there was no time to ask leave but it was a national affair our allies must be fed and feeling sure that her patriotic friends would gladly lay their cows on the altar of their country madam hancock covered herself with glory by calmly issuing the command milk em it was done to the great astonishment of the cows and the entire satisfaction of the guests among whom was lafayette  this milking feat was such a good joke that no one seems to have remembered much about the great man though one of his officers a count signalized himself by getting very tipsy and going to bed with his boots and spurs on which caused the destruction of aunts best yellow damask coverlet for the restless sleeper kicked it into rags by morning  aunt valued it very much even in its tattered condition and kept it a long while as a memorial of her distinguished guests  the time when i saw lafayette was in 1825 and there were no tipsy counts then uncle hancock a sweet man my dears though some call him mean nowadays was dead and aunt had married captain scott  it was not at all the thing for her to do however that s neither here nor there she was living in federal street at the time a most aristocratic street then children and we lived close by  old josiah quincy was mayor of the city and he sent aunt word that the marquis lafayette wished to pay his respects to her  of course she was delighted and we all flew about to make ready for him aunt was an old lady but she made a grand toilet and was as anxious to look well as any girl  what did she wear asked fan with interest  she wore a steelcolored satin trimmed with black lace and on her cap was pinned a lafayette badge of white satin  i never shall forget how beautifully she looked as she sat in state on the front parlor sophy right under a great portrait of her first husband and on either side of her sat madam storer and madam williams elegant to behold in their stiff silks rich lace and stately turbans we dont see such splendid old ladies nowadays  i think we do sometimes said polly slyly  grandma shook her head but it pleased her very much to be admired for she had been a beauty in her day  we girls had dressed the house with flowers old mr coolidge sent in a clothesbasket full joe joy provided the badges and aunt got out some of the revolutionary wine from the old beacon street cellar  i wore my green and white palmyrine my hair bowed high the beautiful legomutton sleeves that were so becoming and these very gloves  well byandby the general escorted by the mayor drove up dear me i see him now a little old man in nankeen trousers and vest a long blue coat and ruffled shirt leaning on his cane for he was lame and smiling and bowing like a true frenchman  as he approached the three old ladies rose and courtesied with the utmost dignity lafayette bowed first to the governors picture then to the governors widow and kissed her hand  that was droll for on the back of her glove was stamped lafayettes likeness and the gallant old gentleman kissed his own face  then some of the young ladies were presented and as if to escape any further selfsalutations the marquis kissed the pretty girls on the cheek  yes my dears here is just the spot where the dear old man saluted me i m quite as proud of it now as i was then for he was a brave good man and helped us in our trouble  he did not stay long but we were very merry drinking his health receiving his compliments and enjoying the honor he did us  down in the street there was a crowd of course and when he left they wanted to take out the horses and drag him home in triumph but he did nt wish it and while that affair was being arranged we girls had been pelting him with the flowers which we tore from the vases the walls and our own topknots to scatter over him  he liked that and laughed and waved his hand to us while we ran and pelted and begged him to come again  we young folks quite lost our heads that night and i have nt a very clear idea of how i got home the last thing i remember was hanging out of the window with a flock of girls watching the carriage roll away while the crowd cheered as if they were mad  bless my heart it seems as if i heard em now hurrah for lafayette and mayor quincy hurrah for madam hancock and the pretty girls hurrah for col may three cheers for boston now then hurrah hurrah hurrah  and here the old lady stopped out of breath with her cap askew her spectacles on the end of her nose and her knitting much the worse for being waved enthusiastically in the air while she hung over the arm of her chair shrilly cheering an imaginary lafayette the girls clapped their hands and tom hurrahed with all his might saying when he got his breath lafayette was a regular old trump i always liked him  my dear what a disrespectful way to speak of that great man said grandma shocked at young americas irreverence  well he was a trump anyway so why not call him one asked tom feeling that the objectionable word was all that could be desired  what queer gloves you wore then interrupted fanny who had been trying on the muchhonored glove and finding it a tight fit  much better and cheaper than we have now returned grandma ready to defend the good old times against every insinuation you are an extravagant set nowadays and i really dont know what you are coming to by the way i ve got somewhere two letters written by two young ladies one in 1517 and the other in 1868 the contrast between the two will amuse you i think  after a little search grandma produced an old portfolio and selecting the papers read the following letter written by anne boleyn before her marriage to henry viii and now in the possession of a celebrated antiquarian  dear mary i have been in town almost a month yet i cannot say i have found anything in london extremely agreeable we rise so late in the morning seldom before six oclock and sit up so late at night being scarcely in bed before ten that i am quite sick of it and was it not for the abundance of fine things i am every day getting i should be impatient of returning into the country  my indulgent mother bought me yesterday at a merchants in cheapside three new shifts that cost fourteen pence an ell and i am to have a pair of new stuff shoes for my lord of norfolks ball which will be three shillings  the irregular life i have led since my coming to this place has quite destroyed my appetite you know i could manage a pound of bacon and a tankard of good ale for my breakfast in the country but in london i find it difficult to get through half the quantity though i must own i am generally eager enough for the dinner hour which is here delayed till twelve in your polite society  i played at hot cockles last night at my lord of leicesters the lord of surrey was there a very elegant young man who sung a song of his own composition on the lord of kildares daughter it was much approved and my brother whispered me that the fair geraldine for so my lord of surrey calls his sweetheart is the finest woman of the age i should be glad to see her for i hear she is good as she is beautiful  pray take care of the poultry during my absence poor things i always fed them myself and if margery has knitted me the crimson worsted mittens i should be glad if they were sent up the first opportunity  adieu dear mary i am just going to mass and you shall speedily have the prayers as you have now the kindest love of your own anne boleyn  up before six and think it late to go to bed at ten what a countrified thing anne must have been bacon and ale for breakfast and dinner at twelve how very queer to live so cried fanny lord surrey and lord leicester sound fine but hot cockles and red mittens and shoes for three shillings are horrid  i like it said polly thoughtfully and i m glad poor anne had a little fun before her troubles began may i copy that letter some time grandma  yes dear and welcome now here s the other by a modern girl on her first visit to london this will suit you better fan and grandma read what a friend had sent her as a pendant to annes little picture of london life long ago  my dearest constance after three months of intense excitement i snatch a leisure moment to tell you how much i enjoy my first visit to london having been educated abroad it really seems like coming to a strange city at first the smoke dirt and noise were very disagreeable but i soon got used to these things and now find all i see perfectly charming  we plunged at once into a whirl of gayety and i have had no time to think of anything but pleasure it is the height of the season and every hour is engaged either in going to balls concerts theatres fetes and church or in preparing for them we often go to two or three parties in an evening and seldom get home till morning so of course we dont rise till noon next day this leaves very little time for our drives shopping and calls before dinner at eight and then the evening gayeties begin again  at a ball at lady russells last night i saw the prince of wales and danced in the set with him he is growing stout and looks dissipated i was disappointed in him for neither in appearance nor conversation was he at all princely i was introduced to a very brilliant and delightful young gentleman from america i was charmed with him and rather surprised to learn that he wrote the poems which were so much admired last season also that he is the son of a rich tailor how odd these americans are with their money and talent and independence  o my dear i must not forget to tell you the great event of my first season i am to be presented at the next drawing room think how absorbed i must be in preparation for this grand affair mamma is resolved that i shall do her credit and we have spent the last two weeks driving about from milliners to mantuamakers from merchants to jewellers i am to wear white satin and plumes pearls and roses my dress will cost a hundred pounds or more and is very elegant  my cousins and friends lavish lovely things upon me and you will open your unsophisticated eyes when i display my silks and laces trinkets and french hats not to mention billet deux photographs and other relics of a young belles first season  you ask if i ever think of home i really have nt time but i do sometimes long a little for the quiet the pure air and the girlish amusements i used to enjoy so much one gets pale and old and sadly fagged out with all this dissipation pleasant as it is i feel quite blasé already  if you could send me the rosy cheeks bright eyes and gay spirits i always had at home i d thank you as you cannot do that please send me a bottle of june rain water for my maid tells me it is better than any cosmetic for the complexion and mine is getting ruined by late hours  i fancy some fruit off our own trees would suit me for i have no appetite and mamma is quite desolate about me one cannot live on french cookery without dyspepsia and one can get nothing simple here for food like everything else is regulated by the fashion  adieu ma chere i must dress for church i only wish you could see my new hat and go with me for lord rockingham promised to be there  adieu yours eternally florence  yes i do like that better and i wish i had been in this girls place dont you polly said fan as grandma took off her glasses  i should love to go to london and have a good time but i dont think i should care about spending ever so much money or going to court maybe i might when i got there for i do like fun and splendor added honest polly feeling that pleasure was a very tempting thing  grandma looks tired let s go and play in the dwyingwoom said maud who found the conversation getting beyond her depth  let us all kiss and thank grandma for amusing us so nicely before we go whispered polly maud and fanny agreed and grandma looked so gratified by their thanks that tom followed suit merely waiting till those girls were out of sight to give the old lady a hearty hug and a kiss on the very cheek lafayette had saluted  when he reached the playroom polly was sitting in the swing saying very earnestly i always told you it was nice up in grandmas room and now you see it is i wish you d go oftener she admires to have you and likes to tell stories and do pleasant things only she thinks you dont care for her quiet sort of fun i do anyway and i think she s the kindest best old lady that ever lived and i love her dearly  i did nt say she was nt only old people are sort of tedious and fussy so i keep out of their way said fanny  well you ought not to and you miss lots of pleasant times my mother says we ought to be kind and patient and respectful to all old folks just because they are old and i always mean to be  your mother s everlastingly preaching muttered fan nettled by the consciousness of her own shortcomings with regard to grandma  she dont preach cried polly firing up like a flash she only explains things to us and helps us be good and never scolds and i d rather have her than any other mother in the world though she dont wear velvet cloaks and splendid bonnets so now  go it polly called tom who was gracefully hanging head downward from the bar put up for his special benefit  polly s mad polly s mad sung maud skipping rope round the room  if mr sydney could see you now he would nt think you such an angel any more added fanny tossing a beanbag and her head at the same time  polly was mad her face was very red her eyes very bright and her lips twitched but she held her tongue and began to swing as hard as she could fearing to say something she would be sorry for afterward for a few minutes no one spoke tom whistled and maud hummed but fan and polly were each soberly thinking of something for they had reached an age when children girls especially begin to observe contrast and speculate upon the words acts manners and looks of those about them a good deal of thinking goes on in the heads of these shrewd little folks and the elders should mind their ways for they get criticised pretty sharply and imitated very closely  two little things had happened that day and the influence of a few words a careless action was still working in the active minds of the girls  mr sydney had called and while fanny was talking with him she saw his eye rest on polly who sat apart watching the faces round her with the modest intelligent look which many found so attractive at that minute madam shaw came in and stopped to speak to the little girl polly rose at once and remained standing till the old lady passed on  are you laughing at pollys prim ways fanny had asked as she saw mr sydney smile  no i am admiring miss pollys fine manners he answered in a grave respectful tone which had impressed fanny very much for mr sydney was considered by all the girls as a model of good breeding and that indescribable something which they called elegance  fanny wished she had done that little thing and won that approving look for she valued the young mans good opinion because it was so hard to win by her set at least so when polly talked about old people it recalled this scene and made fan cross  polly was remembering how when mrs shaw came home that day in her fine visiting costume and maud ran to welcome her with unusual affection she gathered up her lustrous silk and pushed the little girl away saying impatiently dont touch me child your hands are dirty then the thought had come to polly that the velvet cloak did nt cover a right motherly heart that the fretful face under the nodding purple plumes was not a tender motherly face and that the hands in the delicate primrose gloves had put away something very sweet and precious she thought of another woman whose dress never was too fine for little wet cheeks to lie against or loving little arms to press whose face in spite of many lines and the gray hairs above it was never sour or unsympathetic when childrens eyes turned towards it and whose hands never were too busy too full or too nice to welcome and serve the little sons and daughters who freely brought their small hopes and fears sins and sorrows to her who dealt out justice and mercy with such wise love ah that s a mother thought polly as the memory came warm into her heart making her feel very rich and pity maud for being so poor  this it was that caused such sudden indignation at fannys dreadful speech and this it was that made quicktempered polly try to calm her wrath before she used toward fannys mother the disrespectful tone she so resented toward her own as the swing came down after some dozen quick journeys to and fro polly seemed to have found a smile somewhere up aloft for she looked toward fan saying pleasantly as she paused a little in her airy exercise i m not mad now shall i come and toss with you  no i ll come and swing with you answered fanny quick to feel the generous spirit of her friend  you are an angel and i ll never be so rude again she added as pollys arm came round her and half the seat was gladly offered  no i aint but if i ever get at all like one it will be mothers preaching that did it said polly with a happy laugh  good for you polly peacemaker cried tom quoting his father and giving them a grand push as the most appropriate way of expressing his approbation of the sentiment  nothing more was said but from that day there slowly crept into the family more respect for grandma more forbearance with her infirmities more interest in her little stories and many a pleasant gossip did the dear old lady enjoy with the children as they gathered round her fire solitary so long     chapter vii goodby   oh dear must you really go home saturday said fan some days after what tom called the grand scrimmage  i really must for i only came to stay a month and here i ve been nearly six weeks answered polly feeling as if she had been absent a year  make it two months and stay over christmas come do now urged tom heartily  you are very kind but i would nt miss christmas at home for anything besides mother says they cant possibly do without me  neither can we cant you tease your mother and make up your mind to stay began fan  polly never teases she says it s selfish and i dont do it now much put in maud with a virtuous air  dont you bother polly she d rather go and i dont wonder let s be just as jolly as we can while she stays and finish up with your party fan said tom in a tone that settled the matter  polly had expected to be very happy in getting ready for the party but when the time came she was disappointed for somehow that naughty thing called envy took possession of her and spoiled her pleasure before she left home she thought her new white muslin dress with its fresh blue ribbons the most elegant and proper costume she could have but now when she saw fannys pink silk with a white tarlatan tunic and innumerable puffings bows and streamers her own simple little toilet lost all its charms in her eyes and looked very babyish and oldfashioned  even maud was much better dressed than herself and looked very splendid in her cherrycolored and white suit with a sash so big she could hardly carry it and little white boots with red buttons they both had necklaces and bracelets earrings and brooches but polly had no ornament except the plain locket on a bit of blue velvet her sash was only a wide ribbon tied in a simple bow and nothing but a blue snood in the pretty curls her only comfort was the knowledge that the modest tucker drawn up round the plump shoulders was real lace and that her bronze boots cost nine dollars  poor polly with all her efforts to be contented and not to mind looking unlike other people found it hard work to keep her face bright and her voice happy that night no one dreamed what was going an under the muslin frock till grandmas wise old eyes spied out the little shadow on pollys spirits and guessed the cause of it when dressed the three girls went up to show themselves to the elders who were in grandmas room where tom was being helped into an agonizingly stiff collar  maud pranced like a small peacock and fan made a splendid courtesy as every one turned to survey them but polly stood still and her eyes went from face to face with an anxious wistful air which seemed to say i know i m not right but i hope i dont look very bad  grandma read the look in a minute and when fanny said with a satisfied smile how do we look she answered drawing polly toward her so kindly  very like the fashionplates you got the patterns of your dresses from but this little costume suits me best  do you really think i look nice and pollys face brightened for she valued the old ladys opinion very much  yes my dear you look just as i like to see a child of your age look what particularly pleases me is that you have kept your promise to your mother and have nt let anyone persuade you to wear borrowed finery young things like you dont need any ornaments but those you wear tonight youth health intelligence and modesty  as she spoke grandma gave a tender kiss that made polly glow like a rose and for a minute she forgot that there were such things as pink silk and coral earrings in the world she only said thank you maam and heartily returned the kiss but the words did her good and her plain dress looked charming all of a sudden  polly s so pretty it dont matter what she wears observed tom surveying her over his collar with an air of calm approval  she has nt got any bwetelles to her dwess and i have said maud settling her ruffled bands over her shoulders which looked like cherrycolored wings on a stout little cherub  i did wish she d just wear my blue set ribbon is so very plain but as tom says it dont much matter and fanny gave an effective touch to the blue bow above pollys left temple  she might wear flowers they always suit young girls said mrs shaw privately thinking that her own daughters looked much the best yet conscious that blooming polly had the most attractive face bless me i forgot my posies in admiring the belles hand them out tom and mr shaw nodded toward an interesting looking box that stood on the table  seizing them wrong sideup tom produced three little bouquets all different in color size and construction  why papa how very kind of you cried fanny who had not dared to receive even a geranium leaf since the late scrape  your father used to be a very gallant young gentleman once upon a time said mrs shaw with a simper  ah tom it s a good sign when you find time to think of giving pleasure to your little girls and grandma patted her sons bald head as if he was nt more than eighteen  thomas jr had given a somewhat scornful sniff at first but when grandma praised his father the young man thought better of the matter and regarded the flowers with more respect as he asked which is for which  guess said mr shaw pleased that his unusual demonstration had produced such an effect  the largest was a regular hothouse bouquet of tearosebuds scentless heath and smilax the second was just a handful of sweetpeas and mignonette with a few cheerful pansies and one fragrant little rose in the middle the third a small posy of scarlet verbenas white feverfew and green leaves  not hard to guess the smart one for fan the sweet one for polly and the gay one for pug now then catch hold girls and tom proceeded to deliver the nosegays with as much grace as could be expected from a youth in a new suit of clothes and very tight boots  that finishes you off just right and is a very pretty attention of papas now run down for the bell has rung and remember not to dance too often fan be as quiet as you can tom and maud dont eat too much supper grandma will attend to things for my poor nerves wont allow me to come down  with that mrs shaw dismissed them and the four descended to receive the first batch of visitors several little girls who had been asked for the express purpose of keeping maud out of her sisters way tom had likewise been propitiated by being allowed to bring his three bosom friends who went by the schoolboy names of rumple sherry and spider  they will do to make up sets as gentlemen are scarce and the party is for polly so i must have some young folks on her account said fanny when sending out her invitations  of course the boys came early and stood about in corners looking as if they had more arms and legs than they knew what to do with tom did his best to be a good host but ceremony oppressed his spirits and he was forced to struggle manfully with the wild desire to propose a game of leapfrog for the long drawingrooms cleared for dancing tempted him sorely  polly sat where she was told and suffered bashful agonies as fan introduced very fine young ladies and very stiff young gentlemen who all said about the same civil things and then appeared to forget all about her when the first dance was called fanny cornered tom who had been dodging her for he knew what she wanted and said in an earnest whisper now tom you must dance this with polly you are the young gentleman of the house and it s only proper that you should ask your company first  polly dont care for manners i hate dancing dont know how let go my jacket and dont bother or i ll cut away altogether growled tom daunted by the awful prospect of opening the ball with polly  i ll never forgive you if you do come be clever and help me there s a dear you know we both were dreadfully rude to polly and agreed that we d be as kind and civil to her as ever we could i shall keep my word and see that she is nt slighted at my party for i want her to love me and go home feeling all right  this artful speech made an impression on the rebellious thomas who glanced at pollys happy face remembered his promise and with a groan resolved to do his duty  well i ll take her but i shall come to grief for i dont know anything about your old dances  yes you do i ve taught you the steps a dozen times i m going to begin with a redowa because the girls like it and it s better fun than square dances now put on your gloves and go and ask polly like a gentleman  oh thunder muttered tom and having split the detested gloves in dragging them on he nerved himself for the effort walked up to polly made a stiff bow stuck out his elbow and said solemnly may i have the pleasure miss milton  he did it as much like the big fellows as he could and expected that polly would be impressed but she was nt a bit for after a surprised look she laughed in his face and took him by the hand saying heartily of course you may but dont be a goose tommy  well fan told me to be elegant so i tried to whispered tom adding as he clutched his partner with a somewhat desperate air hold on tight and we ll get through somehow  the music struck up and away they went tom hopping one way and polly the other in a most ungraceful manner  keep time to the music gasped polly  cant never could returned tom  keep step with me then and dont tread on my toes pleaded polly  never mind keep bobbing and we ll come right by and by muttered tom giving his unfortunate partner a sudden whisk which nearly landed both on the floor  but they did not get right by and by for tom in his frantic efforts to do his duty nearly annihilated poor polly he tramped he bobbed he skated he twirled her to the right dragged her to the left backed her up against people and furniture trod on her feet rumpled her dress and made a spectacle of himself generally polly was much disturbed but as everyone else was flying about also she bore it as long as she could knowing that tom had made a martyr of himself and feeling grateful to him for the sacrifice  oh do stop now this is dreadful cried polly breathlessly after a few wild turns  is nt it said tom wiping his red face with such an air of intense relief that polly had not the heart to scold him but said thank you and dropped into a chair exhausted  i know i ve made a guy of myself but fan insisted on it for fear you d be offended if i did nt go the first dance with you said tom remorsefully watching polly as she settled the bow of her crushed sash which tom had used as a sort of handle by which to turn and twist her i can do the lancers tiptop but you wont ever want to dance with me any more he added as he began to fan her so violently that her hair flew about as if in a gale of wind  yes i will i d like to and you shall put your name down here on the sticks of my fan that s the way trix says when you dont have a ballbook  looking much gratified tom produced the stump of a leadpencil and wrote his name with a flourish saying as he gave it back now i m going to get sherry or some of the fellows that do the redowa well so you can have a real good go before the music stops  off went tom but before he could catch any eligible partner polly was provided with the best dancer in the room mr sydney had seen and heard the whole thing and though he had laughed quietly he liked honest tom and goodnatured polly all the better for their simplicity pollys foot was keeping time to the lively music and her eyes were fixed wistfully on the smoothlygliding couples before her when mr sydney came to her saying in the pleasant yet respectful way she liked so much miss polly can you give me a turn  oh yes i m dying for another and polly jumped up with both hands out and such a grateful face that mr sydney resolved she should have as many turns as she liked  this time all went well and tom returning from an unsuccessful search was amazed to behold polly circling gracefully about the room guided by a most accomplished partner  ah that s something like he thought as he watched the bronze boots retreating and advancing in perfect time to the music dont see how sydney does the steering so well but it must be fun and by jupiter i ll learn it added shaw jr with an emphatic gesture which burst the last button off his gloves  polly enjoyed herself till the music stopped and before she had time to thank mr sydney as warmly as she wished tom came up to say with his most lordly air you dance splendidly polly now you just show me any one you like the looks of and i ll get him for you no matter who he is  i dont want any of the gentlemen they are so stiff and dont care to dance with me but i like those boys over there and i ll dance with any of them if they are willing said polly after a survey  i ll trot out the whole lot and tom gladly brought up his friends who all admired polly immensely and were proud to be chosen instead of the big fellows  there was no sitting still for polly after that for the lads kept her going at a great pace and she was so happy she never saw or suspected how many little manoeuvres heartburnings displays of vanity affectation and nonsense were going on all round her she loved dancing and entered into the gayety of the scene with a heartiness that was pleasant to see her eyes shone her face glowed her lips smiled and the brown curls waved in the air as she danced with a heart as light as her feet  are you enjoying yourself polly asked mr shaw who looked in now and then to report to grandma that all was going well  oh such a splendid time cried polly with an enthusiastic little gesture as she chassed into the corner where he stood  she is a regular belle among the boys said fanny as she promenaded by  they are so kind in asking me and i m not afraid of them explained polly prancing simply because she could nt keep still  so you are afraid of the young gentlemen hey and mr shaw held her by one curl  all but mr sydney he dont put on airs and talk nonsense and oh he does dance like an angel as trix says  papa i wish you d come and waltz with me fan told me not to go near her cause my wed dwess makes her pink one look ugly and tom wont and i want to dwedfully  i ve forgotten how maudie ask polly she ll spin you round like a teetotum mr sydneys name is down for that answered polly looking at her fan with a pretty little air of importance but i guess he would nt mind my taking poor maud instead she has nt danced hardly any and i ve had more than my share would it be very improper to change my mind and polly looked up at her tall partner with eye which plainly showed that the change was a sacrifice  not a bit give the little dear a good waltz and we will look on answered mr sydney with a nod and smile  that is a refreshing little piece of nature said mr shaw as polly and maud whirled away  she will make a charming little woman if she is nt spoilt  no danger of that she has got a sensible mother  i thought so and sydney sighed for he had lately lost his own good mother  when supper was announced polly happened to be talking or trying to talk to one of the poky gentlemen whom fan had introduced he took miss milton down of course put her in a corner and having served her to a dab of ice and one macaroon he devoted himself to his own supper with such interest that polly would have fared badly if tom had not come and rescued her  i ve been looking everywhere for you come with me and dont sit starving here said tom with a scornful look from her empty plate to that of her recreant escort which was piled with good things  following her guide polly was taken to the big china closet opening from the diningroom to the kitchen and here she found a jovial little party feasting at ease maud and her bosom friend gwace were seated on tin cakeboxes sherry and spider adorned the refrigerator while tom and rumple foraged for the party  here s fun said polly as she was received with a clash of spoons and a waving of napkins  you just perch on that crackerkeg and i ll see that you get enough said tom putting a dumbwaiter before her and issuing his orders with a fine air of authority  we are a band of robbers in our cave and i m the captain and we pitch into the folks passing by and go out and bring home plunder now rumple you go and carry off a basket of cake and i ll watch here till katy comes by with a fresh lot of oysters polly must have some sherry cut into the kitchen and bring a cup of coffee spider scrape up the salad and poke the dish through the slide for more eat away polly and my men will be back with supplies in a jiffy  such fun as they had in that closet such daring robberies of jellypots and cakeboxes such successful raids into the diningroom and kitchen such base assaults upon poor katy and the colored waiter who did his best but was helpless in the hands of the robber horde a very harmless little revel for no wine was allowed and the gallant band were so busy skirmishing to supply the ladies that they had not time to eat too much no one missed them and when they emerged the feast was over except for a few voracious young gentlemen who still lingered among the ruins  that s the way they always do poke the girls in corners give em just one taste of something and then go and stuff like pigs whispered tom with a superior air forgetting certain private banquets of his own after company had departed  the rest of the evening was to be devoted to the german and as polly knew nothing about it she established herself in a window recess to watch the mysteries for a time she enjoyed it for it was all new to her and the various pretty devices were very charming but by and by that bitter weed envy cropped up again and she could not feel happy to be left out in the cold while the other girls were getting gay tissuepaper suits droll bonbons flowers ribbons and all manner of tasteful trifles in which girlish souls delight everyone was absorbed mr sydney was dancing tom and his friends were discussing baseball on the stairs and mauds set had returned to the library to play  polly tried to conquer the bad feeling but it worried her till she remembered something her mother once said to her when you feel out of sorts try to make some one else happy and you will soon be so yourself  i will try it thought polly and looked round to see what she could do sounds of strife in the library led her to enter maud and the young ladies were sitting on the sofa talking about each others clothes as they had seen their mammas do  was your dress imported asked grace  no was yours returned blanche  yes and it cost oh ever so much  i dont think it is as pretty as mauds  mine was made in new york said miss shaw smoothing her skirts complacently  i cant dress much now you know cause mammas in black for somebody observed miss alice lovett feeling the importance which affliction conferred upon her when it took the form of a jet necklace  well i dont care if my dress is nt imported my cousin had three kinds of wine at her party so now said blanche  did she and all the little girls looked deeply impressed till maud observed with a funny imitation of her fathers manner my papa said it was scandillus for some of the little boys got tipsy and had to be tooked home he would nt let us have any wine and gwandma said it was vewy impwoper for childwen to do so  my mother says your mothers coup is nt half so stylish as ours put in alice  yes it is too it s all lined with gween silk and that s nicer than old wed cloth cried maud ruffling up like an insulted chicken  well my brother dont wear a horrid old cap and he s got nice hair i would nt have a brother like tom he s horrid rude my sister says retorted alice  he is nt your brother is a pig  you re a fib  so are you  here i regret to say miss shaw slapped miss lovett who promptly returned the compliment and both began to cry  polly who had paused to listen to the edifying chat parted the belligerents and finding the poor things tired cross and sleepy yet unable to go home till sent for proposed to play games the young ladies consented and puss in the corner proved a peacemaker presently in came the boys and being exiles from the german gladly joined in the games which soon were lively enough to wake the sleepiest blindmansbuff was in full swing when mr shaw peeped in and seeing polly flying about with bandaged eyes joined in the fun to puzzle her he got caught directly and great merriment was caused by pollys bewilderment for she could nt guess who he was till she felt the bald spot on his head  this frolic put every one in such spirits that polly forgot her trouble and the little girls kissed each other goodnight as affectionately as if such things as imported frocks coups and rival brothers did nt exist well polly do you like parties asked fan when the last guest was gone  very much but i dont think it would be good for me to go to many answered polly slowly  why not  i should nt enjoy them if i did nt have a fine dress and dance all the time and be admired and all the rest of it  i did nt know you cared for such things cried fanny surprised  neither did i till tonight but i do and as i cant have em it s lucky i m going home tomorrow  oh dear so you are what shall i do without my sweet p as sydney calls you sighed fanny bearing polly away to be cuddled  every one echoed the exclamation next day and many loving eyes followed the little figure in the drab frock as it went quietly about doing for the last time the small services which would help to make its absence keenly felt polly was to go directly after an early dinner and having packed her trunk all but one tray she was told to go and take a run while grandma finished polly suspected that some pleasant surprise was going to be put in for fan did nt offer to go with her maud kept dodging about with something under her apron and tom had just whisked into his mothers room in a mysterious manner so polly took the hint and went away rejoicing in the thought of the unknown treasures she was to carry home  mr shaw had not said he should come home so early but polly thought he might and went to meet him mr shaw did nt expect to see polly for he had left her very busy and now a light snow was falling but as he turned into the mall there was the round hat and under it the bright face looking all the rosier for being powdered with snowflakes as polly came running to meet him  there wont be any one to help the old gentleman safely home tomorrow he said as polly took his hand in both hers with an affectionate squeeze  yes there will see if there is nt cried polly nodding and smiling for fan had confided to her that she meant to try it after her friend had gone  i m glad of it but my dear i want you to promise that you will come and make us a visit every winter a good long one said mr shaw patting the blue mittens folded round his hand  if they can spare me from home i d love to come dearly  they must lend you for a little while because you do us all good and we need you  do i i dont see how but i m glad to hear you say so cried polly much touched  i cant tell you how exactly but you brought something into my house that makes it warmer and pleasanter and wont quite vanish i hope when you go away my child  polly had never heard mr shaw speak like that before and did nt know what to say she felt so proud and happy at this proof of the truth of her mothers words when she said that even a little girl could exert an influence and do some good in this big busy world she only gave her friend a grateful look sweeter than any words and they went on together hand in hand through the softfalling snow  if polly could have seen what went into that top tray she would have been entirely overcome for fanny had told grandma about the poor little presents she had once laughed at and they had all laid their heads together to provide something really fine and appropriate for every member of the milton family such a mine of riches and so much goodwill affection and kindly forethought was packed away in the tempting bundles that no one could feel offended but would find an unusual charm about the pretty gifts that made them doubly welcome i only know that if polly had suspected that a little watch was ticking away in a little case with her name on it inside that trunk she never could have left it locked as grandma advised or have eaten her dinner so quietly as it was her heart was very full and the tears rose to her eyes more than once everyone was so kind and so sorry to have her go  tom did nt need any urging to play escort now and both fan and maud insisted on going too mrs shaw forgot her nerves and put up some gingerbread with her own hands mr shaw kissed polly as if she had been his dearest daughter and grandma held her close whispering in a tremulous tone my little comfort come again soon while katy waved her apron from the nursery window crying as they drove away the saints bless ye miss polly dear and sind ye the best of lucks  but the crowning joke of all was toms goodby for when polly was fairly settled in the car the last all aboard uttered and the train in motion tom suddenly produced a knobby little bundle and thrusting it in at the window while he hung on in some breakneck fashion said with a droll mixture of fun and feeling in his face it s horrid but you wanted it so i put it in to make you laugh goodby polly goodby goodby  the last adieu was a trifle husky and tom vanished as it was uttered leaving polly to laugh over his parting souvenir till the tears ran down her cheeks it was a paper bag of peanuts and poked down at the very bottom a photograph of tom it was horrid for he looked as if taken by a flash of lightning so black wild and staring was it but polly liked it and whenever she felt a little pensive at parting with her friends she took a peanut or a peep at toms funny picture which made her merry again  so the short journey came blithely to an end and in the twilight she saw a group of loving faces at the door of a humble little house which was more beautiful than any palace in her eyes for it was home     chapter viii six years afterward   what do you think polly is going to do this winter exclaimed fanny looking up from the letter she had been eagerly reading  going to deliver lectures on womans rights said the young gentleman who was carefully examining his luxuriant crop of decidedly auburn hair as he lounged with both elbows on the chimneypiece  going to set her cap for some young minister and marry him in the spring added mrs shaw whose mind ran a good deal upon matchmaking just now  i think she is going to stay at home and do all the work cause servants cost so much it would be just like her observed maud who could pronounce the letter r now  it s my opinion she is going to open a school or something of that sort to help those brothers of hers along said mr shaw who had put down his paper at the sound of pollys name  every one of you wrong though papa comes nearest the truth cried fanny she is going to give music lessons and support herself so that will may go to college he is the studious one and polly is very proud of him ned the other brother has a business talent and dont care for books so he has gone out west and will make his own way anywhere polly says she is nt needed at home now the family is so small and kitty can take her place nicely so she is actually going to earn her own living and hand over her share of the family income to will what a martyr that girl does make of herself and fanny looked as solemn as if polly had proposed some awful selfsacrifice  she is a sensible bravehearted girl and i respect her for doing it said mr shaw emphatically one never knows what may happen and it does no harm for young people to learn to be independent  if she is as pretty as she was last time i saw her she ll get pupils fast enough i would nt mind taking lessons myself was the gracious observation of shaw jr as he turned from the mirror with the soothing certainty that his objectionable hair actually was growing darker  she would nt take you at any price said fanny remembering pollys look of disappointment and disapproval when she came on her last visit and found him an unmistakable dandy  you just wait and see was the placid reply  if polly does carry out her plan i wish maud to take lessons of her fanny can do as she likes but it would please me very much to have one of my girls sing as polly sings it suits old people better than your opera things and mother used to enjoy it so much  as he spoke mr shaws eye turned toward the corner of the fire where grandma used to sit the easychair was empty now the kind old face was gone and nothing but a very tender memory remained  i d like to learn papa and polly is a splendid teacher i know she s always so patient and makes everything so pleasant i do hope she will get scholars enough to begin right away said maud  when is she coming asked mrs shaw quite willing to help polly but privately resolving that maud should be finished off by the most fashionable master in the city  she does nt say she thanks me for asking her here as usual but says she shall go right to work and had better begin with her own little room at once wont it seem strange to have polly in town and yet not with us  we ll get her somehow the little room will cost something and she can stay with us just as well as not even if she does teach tell her i say so said mr shaw  she wont come i know for if she undertakes to be independent she ll do it in the most thorough manner answered fanny and mrs shaw sincerely hoped she would it was all very well to patronize the little musicteacher but it was not so pleasant to have her settled in the family  i shall do what i can for her among my friends and i dare say she will get on very well with young pupils to begin with if she starts right puts her terms high enough and gets a few good names to give her the entre into our first families i dont doubt she will do nicely for i must say polly has the manners of a lady observed mrs shaw  she s a mighty taking little body and i m glad she s to be in town though i d like it better if she did nt bother about teaching but just stayed here and enjoyed herself said tom lazily  i ve no doubt she would feel highly honored to be allowed to devote her time to your amusement but she cant afford expensive luxuries and she dont approve of flirting so you will have to let her go her own way and refresh herself with such glimpses of you as her engagements permit answered fanny in the sarcastic tone which was becoming habitual to her  you are getting to be a regular old maid fan as sharp as a lemon and twice as sour returned tom looking down at her with an air of calm superiority  do be quiet children you know i cant bear anything like contention maud give me my shetland shawl and put a cushion at my back  as maud obeyed her mother with a reproving look at her erring brother and sister a pause followed for which every one seemed grateful they were sitting about the fire after dinner and all looked as if a little sunshine would do them good it had been a dull november day but all of a sudden the clouds lifted and a bright ray shot into the room every one turned involuntarily to welcome it and every one cried out why polly for there on the threshold stood a brightfaced girl smiling as if there was no such thing as november weather in the world  you dear thing when did you come cried fanny kissing both the blooming checks with real affection while the rest hovered near waiting for a chance  i came yesterday and have been getting my nest in order but i could nt keep away any longer so i ran up to say how do you do answered polly in the cheery voice that did ones heart good to hear  my polly always brings the sunshine with her and mr shaw held out his hands to his little friend for she was his favorite still  it was good to see her put both arms about his neck and give him a tender kiss that said a great deal for grandma had died since polly met him last and she longed to comfort him seeing how gray and old he had grown  if tom had had any thoughts of following his fathers example something in pollys manner made him change his mind and shake hands with a hearty i m very glad to see you polly adding to himself as he looked at the face in the modest little bonnet prettier than ever by jove  there was something more than mere prettiness in pollys face though tom had not learned to see it yet the blue eyes were clear and steady the fresh mouth frank and sweet the white chin was a very firm one in spite of the dimple and the smooth forehead under the little curls had a broad benevolent arch while all about the face were those unmistakable lines and curves which can make even a plain countenance comely by breathing into it the beauty of a lovely character polly had grown up but she had no more style now than in the days of the round hat and rough coat for she was all in gray like a young quakeress with no ornament but a blue bow at the throat and another in the hair yet the plain suit became her excellently and one never thought of the dress looking at the active figure that wore it for the freedom of her childhood gave to polly that good gift health and every movement was full of the vigor grace and ease which nothing else can so surely bestow a happy soul in a healthy body is a rare sight in these days when doctors flourish and every one is ill and this pleasant union was the charm which polly possessed without knowing it  it does seem so good to have you here again said maud cuddling pollys cold hand as she sat at her feet when she was fairly established between fanny and mr shaw while tom leaned on the back of his mothers chair and enjoyed the prospect  how do you get on when do you begin where is your nest now tell all about it began fanny who was full of curiosity about the new plan  i shall get on very well i think for i ve got twelve scholars to begin with all able to pay a good price and i shall give my first lesson on monday  dont you dread it asked fanny  not much why should i answered polly stoutly  well i dont know it s a new thing and must be a little bit hard at first stammered fanny not liking to say that working for ones living seemed a dreadful hardship to her  it will be tiresome of course but i shall get used to it i shall like the exercise and the new people and places i must see will amuse me then the independence will be delightful and if i can save a little to help kitty along with that will be best of all  pollys face shone as if the prospect was full of pleasure instead of work and the hearty good will with which she undertook the new task seemed to dignify her humble hopes and plans and make them interesting in the sight of others  who have you got for pupils asked mrs shaw forgetting her nerves for a minute  polly named her list and took a secret satisfaction in seeing the impression which certain names made upon her hearers  how in the world did you get the davenports and the greys my dear said mrs shaw sitting erect in her surprise  mrs davenport and mother are relations you know  you never told us that before the davenports have been away some years and i forgot all about them but when i was making my plan i knew i must have a good name or two to set me going so i just wrote and asked mrs d if she would help me she came and saw us and was very kind and has got these pupils for me like a dear good woman as she is  where did you learn so much worldly wisdom polly asked mr shaw as his wife fell back in her chair and took out her salts as if this discovery had been too much for her  i learnt it here sir answered polly laughing i used to think patronage and things of that sort very disagreeable and not worth having but i ve got wiser and to a certain extent i m glad to use whatever advantages i have in my power if they can be honestly got  why did nt you let us help you in the beginning we should have been very glad to i m sure put in mrs shaw who quite burned to be known as a joint patroness with mrs davenport  i know you would but you have all been so kind to me i did nt want to trouble you with my little plans till the first steps were taken besides i did nt know as you would like to recommend me as a teacher though you like me well enough as plain polly  my dear of course i would and we want you to take maud at once and teach her your sweet songs she has a fine voice and is really suffering for a teacher  a slight smile passed over pollys face as she returned her thanks for the new pupil for she remembered a time when mrs shaw considered her sweet songs quite unfit for a fashionable young ladys repertoire where is your room asked maud  my old friend miss mills has taken me in and i am nicely settled mother did nt like the idea of my going to a strange boardinghouse so miss mills kindly made a place for me you know she lets her rooms without board but she is going to give me my dinners and i m to get my own breakfast and tea quite independently i like that way and it s very little trouble my habits are so simple a bowl of bread and milk night and morning with baked apples or something of that sort is all i want and i can have it when i like  is your room comfortably furnished cant we lend you anything my dear an easychair now or a little couch so necessary when one comes in tired said mrs shaw taking unusual interest in the affair  thank you but i dont need anything for i brought all sorts of home comforts with me oh fan you ought to have seen my triumphal entry into the city sitting among my goods and chattels in a farmers cart pollys laugh was so infectious that every one smiled and forgot to be shocked at her performance yes she added i kept wishing i could meet you just to see your horrified face when you saw me sitting on my little sofa with boxes and bundles all round me a birdcage on one side a fishing basket with a kittens head popping in and out of the hole on the other side and jolly old mr brown in his blue frock perched on a keg of apples in front it was a lovely bright day and i enjoyed the ride immensely for we had all sorts of adventures  oh tell about it begged maud when the general laugh at pollys picture had subsided  well in the first place we forgot my ivy and kitty came running after me with it then we started again but were soon stopped by a great shouting and there was will racing down the hill waving a pillow in one hand and a squash pie in the other how we did laugh when he came up and explained that our neighbor old mrs dodd had sent in a hoppillow for me in case of headache and a pie to begin housekeeping with she seemed so disappointed at being too late that will promised to get them to me if he ran all the way to town the pillow was easily disposed of but that pie i do believe it was stowed in every part of the wagon and never staid anywhere i found it in my lap then on the floor next upside down among the books then just on the point of coasting off a trunk into the road and at last it landed in my rockingchair such a remarkable pie as it was too for in spite of all its wanderings it never got spilt or broken and we finally ate it for lunch in order to be left in peace next my kitty got away and i had a chase over walls and brooks before i got her while mr brown sat shaking with fun to see me run we finished off by having the bookshelves tumble on our heads as we went down a hill and losing my chair off behind as we went up a hill a shout made us pause and looking back there was the poor little chair rocking all by itself in the middle of the road while a small boy sat on the fence and whooped it was great fun i do assure you  polly had run on in her lively way not because she thought her adventures amounted to much but from a wish to cheer up her friends who had struck her as looking rather dull and out of sorts especially mr shaw and when she saw him lean back in his chair with the old hearty laugh she was satisfied and blessed the unlucky pie for amusing him  oh polly you do tell such interesting things sighed maud wiping her eyes  i wish i d met you i d have given you three cheers and a tiger for it must have been an imposing spectacle said tom  no you would nt you d have whisked round the corner when you saw me coming or have stared straight before you utterly unconscious of the young woman in the baggage wagon  polly laughed in his face just as she used to do when she said that and in spite of the doubt cast upon his courtesy tom rather liked it though he had nothing to say for himself but a reproachful now polly that s too bad  true nevertheless you must come and see my pets maud for my cat and bird live together as happily as brother and sister said polly turning to maud who devoured every word she said  that s not saying much for them muttered tom feeling that polly ought to address more of her conversation to him  polly knows what she s talking about her brothers appreciate their sisters observed fanny in her sharp tone  and polly appreciates her brothers dont forget to add that maam answered tom  did i tell you that will was going to college broke in polly to avert the rising storm  hope he ll enjoy himself observed tom with the air of a man who had passed through all the mysteries and reached that state of sublime indifference which juniors seem to pride themselves upon  i think he will he is so fond of study and is so anxious to improve every opportunity i only hope he wont overwork and get sick as so many boys do said simple polly with such a respectful belief in the eager thirst for knowledge of collegians as a class that tom regarded the deluded girl with a smile of lofty pity from the heights of his vast and varied experience  guess he wont hurt himself i ll see that he dont study too hard and toms eyes twinkled as they used to do when he planned his boyish pranks  i m afraid you cant be trusted as a guide if various rumors i ve heard are true said polly looking up at him with a wistful expression that caused his face to assume the sobriety of an owls  base slanders i m as steady as a clock an ornament to my class and a model young man aint i mother and tom patted her thin cheek with a caressing hand sure of one firm friend in her for when he ceased to be a harumscarum boy mrs shaw began to take great pride in her son and he missing grandma tried to fill her place with his feeble mother  yes dear you are all i could ask and mrs shaw looked up at him with such affection and confidence in her eyes that polly gave tom the first approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came  why tom should look troubled and turn grave all at once she could nt understand but she liked to see him stroke his mothers cheek so softly as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair for polly fancied that he felt a mans pity for her weakness and was learning a sons patient love for a mother who had had much to bear with him  i m so glad you are going to be here all winter for we are to be very gay and i shall enjoy taking you round with me began fanny forgetting pollys plan for a moment  polly shook her head decidedly it sounds very nice but it cant be done fan for i ve come to work not play to save not spend and parties will be quite out of the question for me  you dont intend to work all the time without a bit of fun i hope cried fanny dismayed at the idea  i mean to do what i ve undertaken and not to be tempted away from my purpose by anything i should nt be fit to give lessons if i was up late should i and how far would my earnings go towards dress carriages and all the little expenses which would come if i set up for a young lady in society i cant do both and i m not going to try but i can pick up bits of fun as i go along and be contented with free concerts and lectures seeing you pretty often and every sunday will is to spend with me so i shall have quite as much dissipation as is good for me  if you dont come to my parties i ll never forgive you said fanny as polly paused while tom chuckled inwardly at the idea of calling visits from a brother dissipation  any small party where it will do to wear a plain black silk i can come to but the big ones must nt be thought of thank you  it was charming to see the resolution of pollys face when she said that for she knew her weakness and beyond that black silk she had determined not to go fanny said no more for she felt quite sure that polly would relent when the time came and she planned to give her a pretty dress for a christmas present so that one excuse should be removed  i say polly wont you give some of us fellows music lessons somebody wants me to play and i d rather learn of you than any senor twankydillo said tom who did nt find the conversation interesting  oh yes if any of you boys honestly want to learn and will behave yourselves i ll take you but i shall charge extra answered polly with a wicked sparkle of the eye though her face was quite sober and her tone delightfully businesslike  why polly tom is nt a boy he s twenty and he says i must treat him with respect besides he s engaged and does put on such airs broke in maud who regarded her brother as a venerable being  who is the little girl asked polly taking the news as a joke  trix why did nt you know it answered maud as if it had been an event of national importance  no is it true fan and polly turned to her friend with a face full of surprise while tom struck an imposing attitude and affected absence of mind  i forgot to tell you in my last letter it s just out and we dont like it very well observed fanny who would have preferred to be engaged first herself  it s a very nice thing and i am perfectly satisfied announced mrs shaw rousing from a slight doze  polly looks as if she did nt believe it have nt i the appearance of the happiest man alive asked tom wondering if it could be pity which he saw in the steady eyes fixed on him  no i dont think you have she said slowly  how the deuce should a man look then cried tom rather nettled at her sober reception of the grand news  as if he had learned to care for some one a great deal more than for himself answered polly with sudden color in her cheeks and a sudden softening of the voice as her eyes turned away from tom who was the picture of a complacent dandy from the topmost curl of his auburn head to the tips of his aristocratic boots  tommy s quenched i agree with you polly i never liked trix and i hope it s only a boyandgirl fancy that will soon die a natural death said mr shaw who seemed to find it difficult to help falling into a brown study in spite of the lively chatter going on about him  shaw jr being highly incensed at the disrespectful manner in which his engagement was treated tried to assume a superb air of indifference and finding that a decided failure was about to stroll out of the room with a comprehensive nod when his mother called after him where are you going dear  to see trix of course goodby polly and mr thomas departed hoping that by the skillful change of tone from ardent impatience to condescending coolness he had impressed one hearer at least with the fact that he regarded trix as the star of his existence and polly as a presuming little chit  if he could have heard her laugh and fannys remarks his wrath would have boiled over fortunately he was spared the trial and went away hoping that the coquetries of his trix would make him forget pollys look when she answered his question  my dear that boy is the most deluded creature you ever saw began fanny as soon as the front door banged belle and trix both tried to catch him and the slyest got him for in spite of his airs he is as softhearted as a baby you see trix has broken off two engagements already and the third time she got jilted herself such a fuss as she made i declare it really was absurd but i do think she felt it very much for she would nt go out at all and got thin and pale and blue and was really quite touching i pitied her and had her here a good deal and tom took her part he always does stand up for the crushed ones and that s good of him i allow well she did the forsaken very prettily let tom amuse her and led him on till the poor fellow lost his wits and finding her crying one day about her hat which was nt becoming he thought she was mourning for mr banks and so to comfort her the goose proposed that was all she wanted she snapped him up at once and there he is in a nice scrape for since her engagement she is as gay as ever flirts awfully with any one who comes along and keeps tom in a fume all the time i really dont think he cares for her half as much as he makes believe but he ll stand by her through thick and thin rather than do as banks did  poor tom was all polly said when fan had poured the story into her ear as they sat whispering in the sofa corner  my only consolation is that trix will break off the affair before spring she always does so that she may be free for the summer campaign it wont hurt tom but i hate to have him make a fool of himself out of pity for he is more of a man than he seems and i dont want any one to plague him  no one but yourself said polly smiling  well that s all fair he is a torment sometimes but i m rather fond of him in spite of it i get so tired of the other fellows they are such absurd things and when tom is in his good mood he is very nice and quite refreshing  i m glad to hear it said polly making a mental note of the fact  yes and when grandma was ill he was perfectly devoted i did nt know the boy had so much gentleness in him he took her death sadly to heart for though he did nt say much he was very grave and steady for a long time i tried to comfort him and we had two or three real sweet little talks together and seemed to get acquainted for the first time it was very nice but it did nt last good times never do with us we soon got back into the old way and now we hector one another just as before  fanny sighed then yawned and fell into her usual listless attitude as if the brief excitement of pollys coming had begun to subside  walk home with me and see my funny little room it s bright now and the air will do you good come both of you and have a frolic as we used to said polly for the red sunset now burning in the west seemed to invite them out  they agreed and soon the three were walking briskly away to pollys new home in a quiet street where a few old trees rustled in the summer and the morning sun shone pleasantly in winter time       the way into my parlor      is up a winding stair  sang polly running up two flights of broad oldfashioned steps and opening the door of a back room out of which streamed the welcome glow of firelight  these are my pets maud she added pausing on the threshold and beckoning the girls to look in quietly  on the rug luxuriously basking in the warmth lay a gray kitten and close by meditatively roosting on one leg stood a plump canary who cocked his bright eye at the newcomers gave a loud chirp as if to wake his comrade and then flew straight to pollys shoulder where he broke into a joyful song to welcome his mistress home  allow me to introduce my family said polly this noisy little chap the boys named nicodemus and this dozy cat is called ashputtel because the joy of her life is to get among the cinders now take off your things and let me do the honors for you are to stop to tea and the carriage is to come for you at eight i arranged it with your mother while you were upstairs  i want to see everything said maud when the hats were off and the hands warmed  so you shall for i think my housekeeping arrangements will amuse you  then polly showed her kingdom and the three had a merry time over it the big piano took up so much room there was no place for a bed but polly proudly displayed the resources of her chintzcovered couch for the back let down the seat lifted up and inside were all the pillows and blankets so convenient you see and yet out of the way in the daytime for two or three of my pupils come to me explained polly  then there was a bright drugget over the faded carpet the little rockingchair and sewingtable stood at one window the ivy ran all over the other and hid the banqueting performances which went on in that corner bookshelves hung over the sofa a picture or two on the walls and a great vase of autumn leaves and grasses beautified the low chimneypiece it was a very humble little room but polly had done her best to make it pleasant and it already had a homelike look with the cheery fire and the household pets chirping and purring confidingly on the rug  how nice it is exclaimed maud as she emerged from the big closet where polly kept her stores such a cunning teakettle and saucepan and a teteatete set and lots of good things to eat do have toast for tea polly and let me make it with the new toasting fork it s such fun to play cook  fanny was not so enthusiastic as her sister for her eyes saw many traces of what seemed like poverty to her but polly was so gay so satisfied with her small establishment so full of happy hopes and plans that her friend had not the heart to find a fault or suggest an improvement and sat where she was told laughing and talking while the others got tea  this will be a country supper girls said polly bustling about here is real cream brown bread homemade cake and honey from my own beehives mother fitted me out with such a supply i m glad to have a party for i cant eat it all quick enough butter the toast maudie and put that little cover over it tell me when the kettle boils and dont step on nicodemus whatever you do  what a capital housekeeper you will make some day said fanny as she watched polly spread her table with a neatness and despatch which was pleasant to behold  yes it s good practice laughed polly filling her tiny teapot and taking her place behind the tray with a matronly air which was the best joke of the whole  this is the most delicious party i ever went to observed maud with her mouth full of honey when the feast was well under way i do wish i could have a nice room like this and a cat and a bird that would nt eat each other up and a dear little teakettle and make just as much toast as i like  such a peal of laughter greeted mauds pensive aspiration that miss mills smiled over her solitary cup of tea and little nick burst into a perfect ecstasy of song as he sat on the sugarbowl helping himself  i dont care for the toast and the kettle but i do envy you your good spirits polly said fanny as the merriment subsided i m so tired of everybody and everything it seems sometimes as if i should die of ennui dont you ever feel so  things worry me sometimes but i just catch up a broom and sweep or wash hard or walk or go at something with all my might and i usually find that by the time i get through the worry is gone or i ve got courage enough to bear it without grumbling answered polly cutting the brown loaf energetically  i cant do those things you know there s no need of it and i dont think they d cure my worrying said fanny languidly feeding ashputtel who sat decorously beside her at the table winking at the cream pot  a little poverty would do you good fan just enough necessity to keep you busy till you find how good work is and when you once learn that you wont complain of ennui any more returned polly who had taken kindly the hard lesson which twenty years of cheerful poverty had taught her  mercy no i should hate that but i wish some one would invent a new amusement for rich people i m dead sick of parties and flirtations trying to outdress my neighbors and going the same round year after year like a squirrel in a cage  fannys tone was bitter as well as discontented her face sad as well as listless and polly had an instinctive feeling that some trouble more real than any she had ever known before was lying heavy at her friends heart that was not the time to speak of it but polly resolved to stand ready to offer sympathy if nothing more whenever the confidential minute came and her manner was so kind so comfortable that fanny felt its silent magic grew more cheerful in the quiet atmosphere of that little room and when they said goodnight after an oldtime gossip by the fire she kissed her hostess warmly saying with a grateful look polly dear i shall come often you do me so much good     chapter ix lessons   the first few weeks were hard ones for polly had not yet outgrown her natural shyness and going among so many strangers caused her frequent panics but her purpose gave her courage and when the ice was once broken her little pupils quickly learned to love her the novelty soon wore off and though she thought she was prepared for drudgery she found it very tedious to go on doing the same thing day after day then she was lonely for will could only come once a week her leisure hours were fannys busiest and the bits of pleasure were so few and far between that they only tantalized her even her small housekeeping lost its charms for polly was a social creature and the solitary meals were often sad ones ashputtel and nick did their best to cheer her but they too seemed to pine for country freedom and home atmosphere poor puttel after gazing wistfully out of the window at the gaunt city cats skulking about the yard would retire to the rug and curl herself up as if all hope of finding congenial society had failed while little nick would sing till he vibrated on his perch without receiving any response except an inquisitive chirp from the pert sparrows who seemed to twit him with his captivity yes by the time the little teakettle had lost its brightness polly had decided that getting ones living was no joke and many of her brilliant hopes had shared the fate of the little kettle  if one could only make the sacrifice all at once and done with it then it would seem easier but to keep up a daily sacrifice of ones wishes tastes and pleasures is rather a hard task especially when one is pretty young and gay lessons all day a highly instructive lecture books over a solitary fire or music with no audience but a sleepy cat and a bird with his head tucked under his wing for evening entertainment was not exactly what might be called festive so in spite of her brave resolutions polly did long for a little fun sometimes and after saying virtuously to herself at nine yes it is much wiser and better for me to go to bed early and be ready for work tomorrow she would lie awake hearing the carriages roll to and fro and imagining the gay girls inside going to party opera or play till mrs dodds hop pillow might as well have been stuffed with nettles for any sleep it brought or any use it was except to catch and hide the tears that dropped on it when pollys heart was very full  another thorn that wounded our polly in her first attempt to make her way through the thicket that always bars a womans progress was the discovery that working for a living shuts a good many doors in ones face even in democratic america as fannys guest she had been in spite of poverty kindly received wherever her friend took her both as child and woman now things were changed the kindly people patronized the careless forgot all about her and even fanny with all her affection felt that polly the music teacher would not be welcome in many places where polly the young lady had been accepted as miss shaws friend  some of the girls still nodded amiably but never invited her to visit them others merely dropped their eyelids and went by without speaking while a good many ignored her as entirely as if she had been invisible these things hurt polly more than she would confess for at home every one worked and every one was respected for it she tried not to care but girls feel little slights keenly and more than once polly was severely tempted to give up her plan and run away to the safe shelter at home  fanny never failed to ask her to every sort of festivity in the shaw mansion but after a few trials polly firmly declined everything but informal visits when the family were alone she soon found that even the new black silk was nt fine enough for fannys smallest party and after receiving a few of the expressive glances by which women convey their opinion of their neighbors toilet and overhearing a joke or two about that inevitable dress and the little blackbird polly folded away the once treasured frock saying with a choke in her voice i ll wear it for will he likes it and clothes cant change his love for me  i am afraid the wholesome sweetness of pollys nature was getting a little soured by these troubles but before lasting harm was done she received from an unexpected source some of the real help which teaches young people how to bear these small crosses by showing them the heavier ones they have escaped and by giving them an idea of the higher pleasures one may earn in the good oldfashioned ways that keep hearts sweet heads sane hands busy  everybody has their days of misfortune like little rosamond and polly was beginning to think she had more than her share one of these ended in a way which influenced her whole life and so we will record it it began early for the hardhearted little grate would nt behave itself till she had used up a ruinous quantity of kindlings then she scalded poor puttel by upsetting her coffeepot and instead of a leisurely cosy meal had to hurry away uncomfortably for everything went wrong even to the coming off of both bonnet strings in the last dreadful scramble being late she of course forgot her music and hurrying back for it fell into a puddle which capped the climax of her despair  such a trying morning as that was polly felt out of tune herself and all the pianos seemed to need a tuner as much as she did the pupils were unusually stupid and two of them announced that their mamma was going to take them to the south whither she was suddenly called this was a blow for they had just begun and polly had nt the face to send in a bill for a whole quarter though her plans and calculations were sadly disturbed by the failure of that sum  trudging home to dinner tired and disappointed poor polly received another blow which hurt her more than the loss of all her pupils as she went hurrying along with a big music book in one hand and a paper bag of rolls for tea in the other she saw tom and trix coming as she watched them while they slowly approached looking so gay and handsome and happy it seemed to polly as if all the sunshine and good walking was on their side of the street all the wintry wind and mud on hers longing to see a friendly face and receive a kind word she crossed over meaning to nod and smile at least trix saw her first and suddenly became absorbed in the distant horizon tom apparently did not see her for his eyes were fixed on a fine horse just prancing by polly thought that he had seen her and approached with a curious little flutter at her heart for if tom cut her she felt that her cup would be full  on they came trix intent on the view tom staring at the handsome horse and polly with red checks expectant eyes and the brown bundle in full sight one dreadful minute as they came parallel and no one spoke or bowed then it was all over and polly went on feeling as if some one had slapped her in the face she would nt have believed it of tom it was all the doings of that horrid trix well she would nt trouble him any more if he was such a snob as to be ashamed of her just because she carried bundles and worked for her bread she clutched the paper bag fiercely as she said this to herself then her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she added how could he do it before her too  now tom was quite guiltless of this offence and had always nodded to polly when they met but it so happened he had always been alone till now and that was why it cut so deeply especially as polly never had approved of trix before she could clear her eyes or steady her face a gentleman met her lifted his hat smiled and said pleasantly good morning miss polly i m glad to meet you then with a sudden change of voice and manner he added i beg pardon is anything the matter can i be of service  it was very awkward but it could nt be helped and all polly could do was to tell the truth and make the best of it  it s very silly but it hurts me to be cut by my old friends i shall get used to it presently i dare say  mr sydney glanced back recognized the couple behind them and turned round with a disgusted expression polly was fumbling for her handkerchief and without a word he took both book and bundle from her a little bit of kindness that meant a good deal just then polly felt it and it did her good hastily wiping the traitorous eyes she laughed and said cheerfully there i m all right again thank you dont trouble yourself with my parcels  no trouble i assure you and this book reminds me of what i was about to say have you an hour to spare for my little niece her mother wants her to begin and desired me to make the inquiry  did she really and polly looked up at him as if she suspected him of inventing the whole thing out of kindness  mr sydney smiled and taking a note from his pocket presented it saying with a reproachful look behold the proof of my truth and never doubt again  polly begged pardon read the note from the little girls mother which was to have been left at her room if she was absent and gave the bearer a very grateful look as she accepted this welcome addition to her pupils well pleased at the success of his mission sydney artfully led the conversation to music and for a time polly forgot her woes talking enthusiastically on her favorite theme as she reclaimed her book and bag at her own door she said in her honest way thank you very much for trying to make me forget my foolish little troubles  then let me say one thing more though appearances are against him i dont believe tom shaw saw you miss trix is equal to that sort of thing but it is nt like tom for with all his foppery he is a good fellow at heart  as mr sydney said this polly held out her hand with a hearty thank you for that the young man shook the little hand in the gray woollen glove gave her exactly the same bow which he did the honorable mrs davenport and went away leaving polly to walk up stairs and address puttel with the peculiar remark you are a true gentleman so kind to say that about tom i ll think it s so anyway and wont i teach minnie in my very best style  puttel purred nick chirped approvingly and polly ate her dinner with a better appetite than she had expected but at the bottom of her heart there was a sore spot still and the afternoon lessons dragged dismally it was dusk when she got home and as she sat in the firelight eating her bread and milk several tears bedewed the little rolls and even the home honey had a bitter taste  now this wont do she broke out all at once this is silly and wicked and cant be allowed i ll try the old plan and put myself right by doing some little kindness to somebody now what shall it be o i know fan is going to a party tonight i ll run up and help her dress she likes to have me and i enjoy seeing the pretty things yes and i ll take her two or three clusters of my daphne it s so sweet  up got polly and taking her little posy trotted away to the shaws determined to be happy and contented in spite of trix and hard work  she found fanny enduring torment under the hands of the hairdresser who was doing his best to spoil her hair and distort her head with a mass of curls braids frizzles and puffs for though i discreetly refrain from any particular description still judging from the present fashions i think one may venture to predict that six years hence they would be something frightful  how kind of you polly i was just wishing you were here to arrange my flowers these lovely daphnes will give odor to my camellias and you were a dear to bring them there s my dress how do you like it said fanny hardly daring to lift her eyes from under the yellow tower on her head  it s regularly splendid but how do you ever get into it answered polly surveying with girlish interest the cloud of pink and white lace that lay upon the bed  it s fearfully and wonderfully made but distractingly becoming as you shall see trix thinks i m going to wear blue so she has got a green one and told belle it would spoil the effect of mine as we are much together of course was nt that sweet of her belle came and told me in time and i just got pink so my amiable sister that is to be wont succeed in her pretty little plot  i guess she has been reading the life of josephine you know she made a pretty lady of whom she was jealous sit beside her on a green sofa which set off her own white dress and spoilt the blue one of her guest answered polly busy with the flowers  trix never reads anything you are the one to pick up clever little stories i ll remember and use this one am i done yes that is charming is nt it polly and fan rose to inspect the success of monsieurs long labor  you know i dont appreciate a stylish coiffure as i ought so i like your hair in the old way best but this is the thing i suppose and not a word must be said  of course it is why child i have frizzed and burnt my hair so that i look like an old maniac with it in its natural state and have to repair damages as well as i can now put the flowers just here and fanny laid a pink camellia in a nest of fuzz and stuck a spray of daphne straight up at the back of her head  o fan dont it looks horridly so cried polly longing to add a little beauty to her friends sallow face by a graceful adjustment of the flowers  cant help it that s the way and so it must be answered fan planting another sprig halfway up the tower  polly groaned and offered no more suggestions as the work went on but when fan was finished from top to toe she admired all she honestly could and tried to keep her thoughts to herself but her frank face betrayed her for fanny turned on her suddenly saying you may as well free your mind polly for i see by your eyes that something dont suit  i was only thinking of what grandma once said that modesty had gone out of fashion answered polly glancing at the waist of her friends dress which consisted of a belt a bit of lace and a pair of shoulder straps  fanny laughed goodnaturedly saying as she clasped her necklace if i had such shoulders as yours i should nt care what the fashion was now dont preach but put my cloak on nicely and come along for i m to meet tom and trix and promised to be there early  polly was to be left at home after depositing fan at belles  i feel as if i was going myself she said as they rolled along  i wish you were and you would be polly if you werent such a resolute thing i ve teased and begged and offered anything i have if you ll only break your absurd vow and come and enjoy yourself  thank you but i wont so dont trouble your kind heart about me i m all right said polly stoutly  but when they drew up before the lighted house and she found herself in the midst of the pleasant stir of festivity the coming and going of carriages the glimpses of bright colors forms and faces the bursts of music and a general atmosphere of gayety polly felt that she was nt all right and as she drove away for a dull evening in her lonely little room she just cried as heartily as any child denied a stick of candy  it s dreadful wicked of me but i cant help it she sobbed to herself in the corner of the carriage that music sets me all in a twitter and i should have looked nice in fans blue tarlatan and i know i could behave as well as any one and have lots of partners though i m not in that set oh just one good gallop with mr sydney or tom no tom would nt ask me there and i would nt accept if he did oh me oh me i wish i was as old and homely and good and happy as miss mills  so polly made her moan and by the time she got home was just in the mood to go to bed and cry herself to sleep as girls have a way of doing when their small affliction becomes unbearable  but polly did nt get a chance to be miserable very long for as she went up stairs feeling like the most injured girl in the world she caught a glimpse of miss mills sewing away with such a bright face that she could nt resist stopping for a word or two  sit down my dear i m glad to see you but excuse me if i go on with my work as i m in a driving hurry to get these things done tonight said the brisk little lady with a smile and a nod as she took a new needleful of thread and ran up a seam as if for a wager  let me help you then i m lazy and cross and it will do me good said polly sitting down with the resigned feeling well if i cant be happy i can be useful perhaps  thank you my dear yes you can just hem the skirt while i put in the sleeves and that will be a great lift  polly put on her thimble in silence but as miss mills spread the white flannel over her lap she exclaimed why it looks like a shroud is it one  no dear thank god it is nt but it might have been if we had nt saved the poor little soul cried miss mills with a sudden brightening of the face which made it beautiful in spite of the stiff gray curl that bobbed on each temple the want of teeth and a crooked nose  will you tell me about it i like to hear your adventures and good works so much said polly ready to be amused by anything that made her forget herself  ah my dear it s a very common story and that s the saddest part of it i ll tell you all about it for i think you may be able to help me last night i watched with poor mary floyd she s dying of consumption you know began miss mills as her nimble fingers flew and her kind old face beamed over the work as if she put a blessing in with every stitch mary was very low but about midnight fell asleep and i was trying to keep things quiet when mrs finn she s the woman of the house came and beckoned me out with a scared face little jane has killed herself and i dont know what to do she said leading me up to the attic  who was little jane broke in polly dropping her work  i only knew her as a pale shy young girl who went in and out and seldom spoke to any one mrs finn told me she was poor but a busy honest little thing who did nt mix with the other folks but lived and worked alone she has looked so downhearted and pale for a week that i thought she was sick and asked her about it said mrs finn but she thanked me in her bashful way and said she was pretty well so i let her alone but tonight as i went up late to bed i was kind of impressed to look in and see how the poor thing did for she had nt left her room all day i did look in and here s what i found as mrs finn ended she opened the door of the back attic and i saw about as sad a sight as these old eyes ever looked at  o what cried polly pale now with interest  a bare room cold as a barn and on the bed a little dead white face that almost broke my heart it was so thin so patient and so young on the table was a bottle half full of laudanum an old pocketbook and a letter read that my dear and dont think hard of little jane  polly took the bit of paper miss mills gave her and read these words  dear mrs finn please forgive me for the trouble i make you but i dont see any other way i cant get work that pays enough to keep me the dr says i cant be well unless i rest i hate to be a burden so i m going away not to trouble anybody anymore i ve sold my things to pay what i owe you please let me be as i am and dont let people come and look at me i hope it is nt very wicked but there dont seem any room for me in the world and i m not afraid to die now though i should be if i stayed and got bad because i had nt strength to keep right give my love to the baby and so goodby goodby  jane bryant  o miss mills how dreadful cried polly with her eyes so full she could hardly read the little letter  not so dreadful as it might have been but a bitter sad thing to see that child only seventeen lying there in her little clean old nightgown waiting for death to come and take her because there did nt seem to be any room for her in the world ah well we saved her for it was nt too late thank heaven and the first thing she said was oh why did you bring me back i ve been nursing her all day hearing her story and trying to show her that there is room and a welcome for her her mother died a year ago and since then she has been struggling along alone she is one of the timid innocent humble creatures who cant push their way and so get put aside and forgotten she has tried all sorts of poorly paid work could nt live on it decently got discouraged sick frightened and could see no refuge from the big bad world but to get out of it while she was nt afraid to die a very old story my dear new and dreadful as it seems to you and i think it wont do you any harm to see and help this little girl who has gone through dark places that you are never like to know  i will indeed i will do all i can where is she now asked polly touched to the heart by the story so simple yet so sad  there and miss mills pointed to the door of her own little bedroom she was well enough to be moved tonight so i brought her home and laid her safely in my bed poor little soul she looked about her for a minute then the lost look went away and she gave a great sigh and took my hand in both her thin bits of ones and said o maam i feel as if i d been born into a new world help me to begin again and i ll do better so i told her she was my child now and might rest here sure of a home as long as i had one  as miss mills spoke in her motherly tone and cast a proud and happy look toward the warm and quiet nest in which she had sheltered this friendless little sparrow feeling sure that god meant her to keep it from falling to the ground polly put both arms about her neck and kissed her withered cheek with as much loving reverence as if she had been a splendid saint for in the likeness of this plain old maid she saw the lovely charity that blesses and saves the world  how good you are dear miss mills tell me what to do let me help you i m ready for anything said polly very humbly for her own troubles looked so small and foolish beside the stern hardships which had nearly had so tragical an end that she felt heartily ashamed of herself and quite burned to atone for them  miss mills stopped to stroke the fresh cheek opposite to smile and say then polly i think i ll ask you to go in and say a friendly word to my little girl the sight of you will do her good and you have just the right way of comforting people without making a fuss  have i said polly looking much gratified by the words  yes dear you ve the gift of sympathy and the rare art of showing it without offending i would nt let many girls in to see my poor jenny because they d only flutter and worry her but you ll know what to do so go and take this wrapper with you it s done now thanks to your nimble fingers  polly threw the warm garment over her arm feeling a thrill of gratitude that it was to wrap a living girl in and not to hide away a young heart that had grown cold too soon pushing open the door she went quietly into the dimly lighted room and on the pillow saw a face that drew her to it with an irresistible power for it was touched by a solemn shadow that made its youth pathetic as she paused at the bedside thinking the girl asleep a pair of hollow dark eyes opened wide and looked up at her startled at first then softening with pleasure at sight of the bonny face before them and then a humble beseeching expression filled them as if asking pardon for the rash act nearly committed and pity for the hard fate that prompted it polly read the language of these eyes and answered their mute prayer with a simple eloquence that said more than any words for she just stooped down and kissed the poor child with her own eyes full and lips that trembled with the sympathy she could not tell jenny put both arms about her neck and began to shed the quiet tears that so refresh and comfort heavy hearts when a tender touch unseals the fountain where they lie  everybody is so kind she sobbed and i was so wicked i dont deserve it  oh yes you do dont think of that but rest and let us pet you the old life was too hard for such a little thing as you and we are going to try and make the new one ever so much easier and happier said polly forgetting everything except that this was a girl like herself who needed heartening up  do you live here asked jenny when her tears were wiped away still clinging to the newfound friend  yes miss mills lets me have a little room up stairs and there i have my cat and bird my piano and my posy pots and live like a queen you must come up and see me tomorrow if you are able i m often lonely for there are no young people in the house to play with me answered polly smiling hospitably  do you sew asked jenny  no i m a music teacher and trot round giving lessons all day  how beautiful it sounds and how happy you must be so strong and pretty and able to go round making music all the time sighed jenny looking with respectful admiration at the plump firm hand held in both her thin and feeble ones  it did sound pleasant even to pollys ears and she felt suddenly so rich and so contented that she seemed a different creature from the silly girl who cried because she could nt go to the party it passed through her mind like a flash the contrast between her life and that of the wan creature lying before her and she felt as if she could not give enough out of her abundance to this needy little sister who had nothing in the wide world but the life just saved to her that minute did more for polly than many sermons or the wisest books for it brought her face to face with bitter truths showed her the dark side of life and seemed to blow away her little vanities her frivolous desires like a wintry wind that left a wholesome atmosphere behind sitting on the bedside polly listened while jane told the story which was so new to her listener that every word sank deep into her heart and never was forgotten  now you must go to sleep dont cry nor think nor do anything but rest that will please miss mills best i ll leave the doors open and play you a lullaby that you cant resist good night dear and with another kiss polly went away to sit in the darkness of her own room playing her softest airs till the tired eyes below were shut and little jane seemed to float away on a sea of pleasant sounds into the happier life which had just dawned for her  polly had fully intended to be very miserable and cry herself to sleep but when she lay down at last her pillow seemed very soft her little room very lovely with the firelight flickering on all the homelike objects and her newblown roses breathing her a sweet goodnight she no longer felt an injured hardworking unhappy polly but as if quite burdened with blessings for which she was nt half grateful enough she had heard of poverty and suffering in the vague faroff way which is all that many girls safe in happy homes ever know of it but now she had seen it in a shape which she could feel and understand and life grew more earnest to her from that minute so much to do in the great busy world and she had done so little where should she begin then like an answer came little jennys words now taking a new significance to pollys mind to be strong and beautiful and go round making music all the time yes she could do that and with a very earnest prayer polly asked for the strength of an upright soul the beauty of a tender heart the power to make her life a sweet and stirring song helpful while it lasted remembered when it died  little janes last thought had been to wish with all her might that god would bless the dear kind girl up there and give her all she asked i think both prayers although too humble to be put in words went up together for in the fulness of time they were beautifully answered     chapter x brothers and sisters   pollys happiest day was sunday for will never failed to spend it with her instead of sleeping later than usual that morning she was always up bright and early flying round to get ready for her guest for will came to breakfast and they made a long day of it will considered his sister the best and prettiest girl going and polly knowing well that a time would come when he would find a better and a prettier was grateful for his good opinion and tried to deserve it so she made her room and herself as neat and inviting as possible and always ran to meet him with a bright face and a motherly greeting when he came tramping in ruddy brisk and beaming with the brown loaf and the little pot of beans from the bakehouse near by  they liked a good country breakfast and nothing gave polly more satisfaction than to see her big boy clear the dishes empty the little coffeepot and then sit and laugh at her across the ravaged table another pleasure was to let him help clear away as they used to do at home while the peals of laughter that always accompanied this performance did miss mills heart good to hear for the room was so small and will so big that he seemed to be everywhere at once and polly and puttel were continually dodging his long arms and legs then they used to inspect the flower pots pay nick a visit and have a little music as a good beginning for the day after which they went to church and dined with miss mills who considered will an excellent young man if the afternoon was fair they took a long walk together over the bridges into the country or about the city streets full of sabbath quietude most people meeting them would have seen only an awkward young man with a boys face atop of his tall body and a quietly dressed fresh faced little woman hanging on his arm but a few people with eyes to read romances and pleasant histories everywhere found something very attractive in this couple and smiled as they passed wondering if they were young lovers or country cousins looking round  if the day was stormy they stayed at home reading writing letters talking over their affairs and giving each other good advice for though will was nearly three years younger than polly he could nt for the life of him help assuming amusingly venerable airs when he became a freshman in the twilight he had a good lounge on the sofa and polly sung to him which arrangement he particularly enjoyed it was so cosy and homey at nine oclock polly packed his bag with clean clothes nicely mended such remnants of the festive tea as were transportable and kissed him goodnight with many injunctions to muffle up his throat going over the bridge and be sure that his feet were dry and warm when he went to bed all of which will laughed at accepted graciously and did nt obey but he liked it and trudged away for another weeks work rested cheered and strengthened by that quiet happy day with polly for he had been brought up to believe in home influences and this brother and sister loved one another dearly and were not ashamed to own it  one other person enjoyed the humble pleasures of these sundays quite as much as polly and will maud used to beg to come to tea and polly glad to do anything for those who had done a good deal for her made a point of calling for the little girl as they came home from their walk or sending will to escort her in the carriage which maud always managed to secure if bad weather threatened to quench her hopes tom and fanny laughed at her fancy but she did not tire of it for the child was lonely and found something in that little room which the great house could not give her  maud was twelve now a pale plain child with sharp intelligent eyes and a busy little mind that did a good deal more thinking than anybody imagined she was just at the unattractive fidgety age when no one knew what to do with her and so let her fumble her way up as she could finding pleasure in odd things and living much alone for she did not go to school because her shoulders were growing round and mrs shaw would not allow her figure to be spoiled that suited maud excellently and whenever her father spoke of sending her again or getting a governess she was seized with bad headaches a pain in her back or weakness of the eyes at which mr shaw laughed but let her holiday go on nobody seemed to care much for plain pugnosed little maudie her father was busy her mother nervous and sick fanny absorbed in her own affairs and tom regarded her as most young men do their younger sisters as a person born for his amusement and convenience nothing more maud admired tom with all her heart and made a little slave of herself to him feeling well repaid if he merely said thank you chicken or did nt pinch her nose or nip her ear as he had a way of doing just as if i was a doll or a dog and had nt got any feelings she sometimes said to fanny when some service or sacrifice had been accepted without gratitude or respect it never occurred to tom when maud sat watching him with her face full of wistfulness that she wanted to be petted as much as ever he did in his neglected boyhood or that when he called her pug before people her little feelings were as deeply wounded as his used to be when the boys called him carrots he was fond of her in his fashion but he did nt take the trouble to show it so maud worshipped him afar off afraid to betray the affection that no rebuff could kill or cool  one snowy sunday afternoon tom lay on the sofa in his favorite attitude reading pendennis for the fourth time and smoking like a chimney as he did so maud stood at the window watching the falling flakes with an anxious countenance and presently a great sigh broke from her  dont do that again chicken or you ll blow me away whats the matter asked tom throwing down his book with a yawn that threatened dislocation  i m afraid i cant go to pollys answered maud disconsolately  of course you cant it s snowing hard and father wont be home with the carriage till this evening what are you always cutting off to pollys for  i like it we have such nice times and will is there and we bake little johnnycakes in the baker before the fire and they sing and it is so pleasant  warbling johnnycakes must be interesting come and tell me all about it  no you ll only laugh at me  i give you my word i wont if i can help it but i really am dying of curiosity to know what you do down there you like to hear secrets so tell me yours and i ll be as dumb as an oyster  it is nt a secret and you would nt care for it do you want another pillow she added as tom gave his a thump  this will do but why you women always stick tassels and fringe all over a sofacushion to tease and tickle a fellow is what i dont understand  one thing that polly does sunday nights is to take wills head in her lap and smooth his forehead it rests him after studying so hard she says if you dont like the pillow i could do that for you cause you look as if you were more tired of studying than will said maud with some hesitation but an evident desire to be useful and agreeable  well i dont care if you do try it for i am confoundedly tired and tom laughed as he recalled the frolic he had been on the night before  maud established herself with great satisfaction and tom owned that a silk apron was nicer than a fuzzy cushion  do you like it she asked after a few strokes over the hot forehead which she thought was fevered by intense application to greek and latin  not bad play away was the gracious reply as tom shut his eyes and lay so still that maud was charmed at the success of her attempt presently she said softly tom are you asleep  just turning the corner  before you get quite round would you please tell me what a public admonition is  what do you want to know for demanded tom opening his eyes very wide  i heard will talking about publics and privates and i meant to ask him but i forgot  what did he say  i dont remember it was about somebody who cut prayers and got a private and had done all sorts of bad things and had one or two publics i did nt hear the name and did nt care i only wanted to know what the words meant  so will tells tales does he and toms forehead wrinkled with a frown  no he did nt polly knew about it and asked him  wills a dig growled tom shutting his eyes again as if nothing more could be said of the delinquent william  i dont care if he is i like him very much and so does polly  happy fresh said tom with a comical groan  you need nt sniff at him for he is nice and treats me with respect cried maud with an energy that made tom laugh in her face  he s good to polly always and puts on her cloak for her and says my dear and kisses her goodnight and dont think it s silly and i wish i had a brother just like him yes i do and maud showed signs of woe for her disappointment about going was very great  bless my boots whats the chicken ruffling up her little feathers and pecking at me for is that the way polly soothes the best of brothers said tom still laughing  oh i forgot there i wont cry but i do want to go and maud swallowed her tears and began to stroke again  now toms horse and sleigh were in the stable for he meant to drive out to college that evening but he did nt take mauds hint it was less trouble to lie still and say in a conciliatory tone tell me some more about this good boy it s very interesting  no i shant but i ll tell about puttels playing on the piano said maud anxious to efface the memory of her momentary weakness polly points to the right key with a little stick and puttel sits on the stool and pats each key as it s touched and it makes a tune it s so funny to see her and nick perches on the rack and sings as if he d kill himself  very thrilling said tom in a sleepy tone  maud felt that her conversation was not as interesting as she hoped and tried again  polly thinks you are handsomer than mr sydney  much obliged  i asked which she thought had the nicest face and she said yours was the handsomest and his the best  does he ever go there asked a sharp voice behind them and looking round maud saw fanny in the big chair cooking her feet over the register  i never saw him there he sent up some books one day and will teased her about it  what did she do demanded fanny oh she shook him  what a spectacle and tom looked as if he would have enjoyed seeing it but fannys face grew so forbidding that toms little dog who was approaching to welcome her put his tail between his legs and fled under the table  then there is nt any sparking sunday night sung tom who appeared to have waked up again  of course not polly is nt going to marry anybody she s going to keep house for will when he s a minister i heard her say so cried maud with importance  what a fate for pretty polly ejaculated tom  she likes it and i m sure i should think she would it s beautiful to hear em plan it all out  any more gossip to retail pug asked tom a minute after as maud seemed absorbed in visions of the future  he told a funny story about blowing up one of the professors you never told us so i suppose you did nt know it some bad fellow put a torpedo or some sort of powder thing under the chair and it went off in the midst of the lesson and the poor man flew up frightened most to pieces and the boys ran with pails of water to put the fire out but the thing that made will laugh most was that the very fellow who did it got his trousers burnt trying to put out the fire and he asked the is it faculty or president  either will do murmured tom who was shaking with suppressed laughter  well he asked em to give him some new ones and they did give him money enough for a nice pair but he got some cheap ones with horrid great stripes on em and always wore em to that particular class which was one too many for the fellows will said and with the rest of the money he had a punch party was nt it dreadful  awful and tom exploded into a great laugh that made fanny cover her ears and the little dog bark wildly  did you know that bad boy asked innocent maud  slightly gasped tom in whose wardrobe at college those identical trousers were hanging at that moment  dont make such a noise my head aches dreadfully said fanny fretfully  girls heads always do ache answered tom subsiding from a roar into a chuckle  what pleasure you boys can find in such ungentlemanly things i dont see said fanny who was evidently out of sorts  as much a mystery to you as it is to us how you girls can like to gabble and prink from one weeks end to the other retorted tom  there was a pause after this little passageatarms but fan wanted to be amused for time hung heavily on her hands so she asked in a more amiable tone how s trix  as sweet as ever answered tom gruffly  did she scold you as usual  she just did  what was the matter  well i ll leave it to you if this is nt unreasonable she wont dance with me herself yet dont like me to go it with anybody else i said i thought if a fellow took a girl to a party she ought to dance with him once at least especially if they were engaged she said that was the very reason why she should nt do it so at the last hop i let her alone and had a gay time with belle and today trix gave it to me hot and heavy coming home from church  if you go and engage yourself to a girl like that i dont know what you can expect did she wear her paris hat today added fan with sudden interest in her voice  she wore some sort of a blue thing with a confounded bird of paradise in it that kept whisking into my face every time she turned her head  men never know a pretty thing when they see it that hat is perfectly lovely  they know a lady when they see her and trix dont look like one i cant say where the trouble is but there s too much fuss and feathers for my taste you are twice as stylish yet you never look loud or fast  touched by this unusual compliment fanny drew her chair nearer as she replied with complacency yes i flatter myself i do know how to dress well trix never did she s fond of gay colors and generally looks like a walking rainbow  cant you give her a hint tell her not to wear blue gloves anyway she knows i hate em  i ve done my best for your sake tom but she is a perverse creature and dont mind a word i say even about things much more objectionable than blue gloves  maudie run and bring me my other cigar case it s lying round somewhere  maud went and as soon as the door was shut tom rose on his elbow saying in a cautiously lowered voice fan does trix paint  yes and draws too answered fanny with a sly laugh  come you know what i mean i ve a right to ask and you ought to tell said tom soberly for he was beginning to find that being engaged was not unmitigated bliss  what makes you think she does  well between ourselves said tom looking a little sheepish but anxious to set his mind at rest she never will let me kiss her on her cheek nothing but an unsatisfactory peck at her lips then the other day as i took a bit of heliotrope out of a vase to put in my buttonhole i whisked a drop of water into her face i was going to wipe it off but she pushed my hand away and ran to the glass where she carefully dabbed it dry and came back with one cheek redder than the other i did nt say anything but i had my suspicions come now does she  yes she does but dont say a word to her for she ll never forgive my telling if she knew it  i dont care for that i dont like it and i wont have it said tom decidedly  you cant help yourself half the girls do it either paint or powder darken their lashes with burnt hairpins or take cologne on lumps of sugar or belladonna to make their eyes bright clara tried arsenic for her complexion but her mother stopped it said fanny betraying the secrets of the prisonhouse in the basest manner  i knew you girls were a set of humbugs and very pretty ones too some of you but i cant say i like to see you painted up like a lot of actresses said tom with an air of disgust  i dont do anything of the sort or need it but trix does and having chosen her you must abide your choice for better or worse  it has nt come to that yet muttered tom as he lay down again with a rebellious air  mauds return put an end to these confidences though tom excited her curiosity by asking the mysterious question i say fan is polly up to that sort of thing  no she thinks it s awful when she gets pale and dragged out she will probably change her mind  i doubt it said tom  polly says it is nt proper to talk secrets before people who aint in em observed maud with dignity  do for mercy sake stop talking about polly i m sick to death of it cried fanny snappishly  hullo and tom sat up to take a survey i thought you were bosom friends and as spoony as ever  well i am fond of polly but i get tired of hearing maud sing her praises everlastingly now dont go and repeat that chatterbox  my goodness is nt she cross whispered maud to tom  as two sticks let her be there s the bell see who it is pug answered tom as a tingle broke the silence of the house  maud went to peep over the banisters and came flying back in a rapture  it s will come for me cant i go it dont snow hard and i ll bundle up and you can send for me when papa comes  i dont care what you do answered fan who was in a very bad temper  without waiting for any other permission maud rushed away to get ready will would nt come up he was so snowy and fanny was glad because with her he was bashful awkward and silent so tom went down and entertained him with mauds report they were very good friends but led entirely different lives will being a dig and tom a bird or in plain english one was a hard student and the other a jolly young gentleman tom had rather patronized will who did nt like it and showed that he did nt by refusing to borrow money of him or accept any of his invitations to join the clubs and societies to which tom belonged so shaw let milton alone and he got on very well in his own way doggedly sticking to his books and resisting all temptations but those of certain libraries athletic games and such inexpensive pleasures as were within his means for this benighted youth had not yet discovered that college nowadays is a place in which to skylark not to study  when maud came down and trotted contentedly away holding wills hand tom watched them out of sight and then strolled about the house whistling and thinking till he went to sleep in his fathers armchair for want of something better to do he awoke to the joys of a solitary tea for his mother never came down and fanny shut herself and her headache up in her own room  well this is cheerful he said as the clock struck eight and his fourth cigar came to an end trix is mad and fan in the dumps so i ll take myself off guess i ll go round to pollys and ask will to drive out with me and save him the walk poor chap might bring midget home it will please her and there s no knowing when the governor will be back  with these thoughts in his head tom leisurely got under way and left his horse at a neighboring stable for he meant to make a little call and see what it was maud enjoyed so much  polly is holding forth he said to himself as he went quietly up stairs and the steady murmur of a pleasant voice came down to him tom laughed at pollys earnest way of talking when she was interested in anything but he liked it because it was so different from the coquettish clatter of most of the girls with whom he talked young men often laugh at the sensible girls whom they secretly respect and affect to admire the silly ones whom they secretly despise because earnestness intelligence and womanly dignity are not the fashion  the door was ajar and pausing in the dark entry tom took a survey before he went in the prospect was not dazzling but homelike and pleasant the light of a bright fire filled the little room and down on a stool before it was maud tending puttel and watching with deep interest the roasting of an apple intended for her special benefit on the couch lounged will his thoughtful eyes fixed on polly who while she talked smoothed the broad forehead of her yellowhaired laddie in a way that tom thought an immense improvement on mauds performance they had evidently been building castles in the air for polly was saying in her most impressive manner well whatever you do will dont have a great costly church that takes so much money to build and support it that you have nothing to give away i like the plain oldfashioned churches built for use not show where people met for hearty praying and preaching and where everybody made their own music instead of listening to opera singers as we do now i dont care if the old churches were bare and cold and the seats hard there was real piety in them and the sincerity of it was felt in the lives of the people i dont want a religion that i put away with my sunday clothes and dont take out till the day comes round again i want something to see and feel and live by daybyday and i hope you ll be one of the true ministers who can teach by precept and example how to get and keep it  i hope i shall be polly but you know they say that in families if there is a boy who cant do anything else they make a minister of him i sometimes think i aint good for much and that seems to me the reason why i should nt even try to be a minister said will smiling yet looking as if with all his humility he did have faith in the aspirations that came to him in his best moments  some one said that very thing to father once and i remember he answered i am glad to give my best and brightest son to the service of god  did he say that and wills color rose for the big bookloving fellow was as sensitive as a girl to the praise of those dearest to him  yes said polly unconsciously giving the strongest stimulus to her brothers hope and courage yes and he added i shall let my boys follow the guide that is in them and only ask of them to use their gifts conscientiously and be honest useful men  so we will ned is doing well out west and i m hard at it here if father does his best to give us the chance we each want the least we can do is to work with a will  whatever you do you cant help working with a will cried tom who had been so interested that he forgot he was playing eavesdropper  polly flew up looking so pleased and surprised that tom reproached himself for not having called oftener  i ve come for maud he announced in a paternal tone which made that young lady open her eyes  i cant go till my apple is done besides it is nt nine yet and will is going to take me along when he goes i d rather have him  i m going to take you both in the cutter the storm is over but it is heavy walking so you ll drive out with me old man said tom with a nod at will  of course he will and thank you very much i ve been trying to keep him all night miss mills always manages to find a corner for stray people but he insists on going so as to get to work early tomorrow said polly delighted to see that tom was taking off his coat as if he meant to wait for mauds apple which polly blessed for being so slow to cook  putting her guest into the best chair polly sat down and beamed at him with such hospitable satisfaction that tom went up several pegs in his own estimation  you dont come very often so we are rather overpowered when you do honor us she said demurely  well you know we fellows are so busy we have nt much time to enjoy ourselves answered tom  ahem said will loudly  take a troche said tom  then they both burst out laughing and polly fully understanding the joke joined them saying here are some peanuts tom do enjoy yourself while you can  now i call that a delicate compliment and tom who had not lost his early relish for this sort of refreshment though he seldom indulged his passion nowadays because peanuts are considered vulgar fell to cracking and munching with great satisfaction  do you remember the first visit i made at your house how you gave me peanuts coming from the depot and frightened me out of my wits pretending the coachman was tipsy asked polly  of course i do and how we coasted one day answered tom laughing  yes and the velocipede you ve got the scar of that yet i see  i remember how you stood by me while it was sewed up that was very plucky polly  i was dreadfully afraid but i remember i wanted to seem very brave because you d called me a coward  did i ought to have been ashamed of myself i used to rough you shamefully polly and you were so goodnatured you let me do it  could nt help myself laughed polly i did use to think you were an awful boy but seems to me i rather liked it  she had so much of it at home she got used to it put in will pulling the little curl behind pollys ear  you boys never teased me as tom did that s the reason it amused me i suppose novelty hath charms you know  grandma used to lecture tom for plaguing you polly and he used to say he d be a tiptop boy but he was nt observed maud with a venerable air  dear old grandma she did her best but i m a bad lot said tom with a shake of the head and a sober face  it always seems as if she must be up in her rooms and i cant get used to finding them empty added polly softly  father would nt have anything moved and tom sits up there sometimes it makes him feel good he says said maud who had a talent for betraying trifles which people preferred should not be mentioned in public  you d better hurry up your apple for if it is nt done pretty soon you ll have to leave it pug said tom looking annoyed  how is fan asked polly with tact  well fan is rather under the weather says she s dyspeptic which means cross  she is cross but she s sick too for i found her crying one day and she said nobody cared about her and she might as well be dead added maud having turned her apple with tender care  we must try to cheer her up among us if i was nt so busy i d like to devote myself to her she has done so much for me said polly gratefully  i wish you could i cant understand her for she acts like a weathercock and i never know how i m going to find her i hate to have her mope so but upon my life i dont know what to do said tom but as he uttered the words something was suggested by the sight before him chairs were few and polly had taken half of wills when they drew round the fire now she was leaning against him in a cosy confiding way delightful to behold while wills strong arm went round her with a protecting air which said as plainly as any words that this big brother and small sister knew how to love and help one another it was a pleasant little picture all the pleasanter for its unconsciousness and tom found it both suggestive and agreeable  poor old fan she dont get much petting maybe that s what she wants i ll try it and see for she stands by me like a trump if she was a rosy cosy little woman like polly it would come easier though thought tom as he meditatively ate his last nut feeling that fraternal affection could not be very difficult of demonstration to brothers blessed with pretty goodtempered sisters  i told tom about the bad fellow who blew up the professor and he said he knew him slightly and i was so relieved because i had a kind of a feeling that it was tom himself you and will laughed so about it  maud had a queer way of going on with her own thoughts and suddenly coming out with whatever lay uppermost regardless of time place or company as this remark fell from her there was a general smile and polly said with mock solemnity it was a sad thing and i ve no doubt that misguided young man is very sorry for it now  he looked perfectly bowed down with remorse last time i saw him said will regarding tom with eyes full of fun for will was a boy as well as a bookworm and relished a joke as well as scatterbrained tom  he always is remorseful after a scrape i ve understood for he is nt a very bad fellow only his spirits are one too many for him and he is nt as fond of his book as another fellow i know  i m afraid he ll he expelled if he dont mind said polly warningly  should nt wonder if he was he s such an unlucky dog answered tom rather soberly  i hope he ll remember that his friends will be very much disappointed if he is he might make them so proud and happy that i guess he will for he is nt half as thoughtless as he makes himself out said polly looking across at tom with such friendly eyes that he was quite touched though of course he did nt show it  thank you polly he may pull through but i have my doubts now old man let us pud along it s getting late for the chicken he added relapsing into the graceful diction with which a classical education gifts its fortunate possessor  taking advantage of the moment while will was wrestling with his boots in the closet and maud was absorbed in packing her apple into a large basket polly said to tom in a low tone thank you very much for being so kind to will  bless your heart i have nt done anything he s such a proud fellow he wont let me answered tom  but you do in many little ways tonight for example do you think i dont know that the suit of clothes he s just got would have cost a good deal more if your tailor had nt made them he s only a boy and dont understand things yet but i know your way of helping proud people so that they dont find it out and i do thank you tom so much  oh come polly that wont do what do you know about tailors and college matters said tom looking as much confused as if she had found him out in something reprehensible  i dont know much and that s the reason why i m grateful for your kindness to will i dont care what stories they tell about you i m sure you wont lead him into trouble but keep him straight for my sake you know i ve lost one brother and will takes jimmys place to me now  the tears in pollys eyes as she said that made tom vow a tremendous vow within himself to stand by will through thick and thin and keep him straight for pollys sake feeling all the time how illfitted he was for such a task  i ll do my best he said heartily as he pressed the hand polly gave him with a look which assured her that he felt the appeal to his honor and that henceforth the country lad was safe from all the temptations tom could have offered him  there now i shall give that to mamma to take her pills in it s just what she likes and it pleases her to be thought of said maud surveying her gift with complacency as she put on her things  you re a good little soul to remember poor mum said tom with an approving nod  well she was so pleased with the grapes you brought her i thought i d try something and maybe she d say thank you darling to me too do you think she will whispered maud with the wistful look so often seen on her little plain face  see if she dont and to mauds great surprise tom did nt laugh at her project  good night dear take care of yourself and keep your muffler round your mouth going over the bridge or you ll be as hoarse as a crow tomorrow said polly as she kissed her brother who returned it without looking as if he thought it girls nonsense then the three piled into the sleigh and drove off leave polly nodding on the doorstep  maud found the drive altogether too short but was consoled by the promise of a longer one if the sleighing lasted till next saturday and when tom ran up to bid his mother goodby and give her a hint about mauds gift she stayed below to say at the last minute in unconscious imitation of polly  good night take care of yourself my dear  tom laughed and was about to pinch the much enduring little nose but as if the words reminded him of something he gave her a kiss instead a piece of forbearance which almost took mauds breath away with surprise and gratification  it was rather a silent drive for will obediently kept his muffler up and tom fell into a brown study  he was not much given to reflection but occasionally indulged when something gave him a turn in that direction and at such times he was as sober and sincere as could be desired any one might have lectured him for an hour without doing as much good as that little call and the chat that grew out of it for though nothing very wise or witty was said many things were suggested and every one knows that persuasive influences are better than any amount of moralizing neither polly nor will tried to do anything of the sort and that was the charm of it nobody likes to be talked to but nobody can resist the eloquence of unconscious preaching with all his thoughtlessness tom was quick to see and feel these things and was not spoilt enough yet to laugh at them the sight of will and pollys simple affection for one another reminded him of a neglected duty so pleasantly that he could not forget it talking of early days made him wish he could go back and start again doing better grandmas name recalled the tender memory that always did him good and the thought that polly trusted her dearest brother to his care stirred up a manful desire to deserve the confidence tortures would nt have drawn a word of all this from him but it had its effect for boys dont leave their hearts and consciences behind them when they enter college and little things of this sort do much to keep both from being damaged by the four years scrimmage which begins the battle of life for most of them     chapter xi needles and tongues   dear polly the sewing circle meets at our house this p m this is in your line so do come and help me through i shall depend on you  yours ever fan  bad news my dear asked miss mills who had just handed the note to polly as she came in one noon a few weeks after jennys arrival  polly told her what it was adding i suppose i ought to go and help fanny but i cant say i want to the girls talk about things i have nothing to do with and i dont find their gossip very amusing i m an outsider and they only accept me on fans account so i sit in a corner and sew while they chatter and laugh  would nt it be a good chance to say a word for jenny she wants work and these young ladies probably have quantities done somewhere jenny does fine work exquisitely and begins to feel anxious to be earning something i dont want her to feel dependent and unhappy and a little wellpaid sewing would be all she needs to do nicely i can get it for her by running round to my friends but i really have nt the time till i get the mullers off they are paupers here but out west they can take care of themselves so i ve begged the money to send them and as soon as i can get them some clothes off they go that s the way to help people help themselves and miss mills clashed her big scissors energetically as she cut out a little red flannel shirt  i know it is and i want to help but i dont know where to begin said polly feeling quite oppressed with the immensity of the work  we cant any of us do all we would like but we can do our best for every case that comes to us and that helps amazingly begin with jenny my dear tell those girls about her and if i m not much mistaken you will find them ready to help for half the time it is nt hardness of heart but ignorance or thoughtlessness on the part of the rich that makes them seem so careless of the poor  to tell the truth i m afraid of being laughed at if i try to talk seriously about such things to the girls said polly frankly  you believe that such things are true you are sincere in your wish to help better them and you respect those who work for that end  yes i do  then my dear cant you bear a little ridicule for the sake of a good cause you said yesterday that you were going to make it a principle of your life to help up your sex as far and as fast as you could it did my heart good to hear you say it for i was sure that in time you would keep your word but polly a principle that cant bear being laughed at frowned on and coldshouldered is nt worthy of the name  i want to be strongminded in the real sense of the word but i dont like to be called so by people who dont understand my meaning and i shall be if i try to make the girls think soberly about anything sensible or philanthropic they call me oldfashioned now and i d rather be thought that though it is nt pleasant than be set down as a rampant womans rights reformer said polly in whose memory many laughs and snubs and sarcasms still lingered forgiven but not forgotten  this love and thought and care for those weaker poorer or worse than ourselves which we call christian charity is a very old fashion my dear it began eighteen hundred years ago and only those who honestly follow the beautiful example set us then learn how to get genuine happiness out of life i m not a rampant womans rights reformer added miss mills with a smile at pollys sober face but i think that women can do a great deal for each other if they will only stop fearing what people will think and take a hearty interest in whatever is going to fit their sisters and themselves to deserve and enjoy the rights god gave them there are so many ways in which this can be done that i wonder they dont see and improve them i dont ask you to go and make speeches only a few have the gift for that but i do want every girl and woman to feel this duty and make any little sacrifice of time or feeling that may be asked of them because there is so much to do and no one can do it as well as ourselves if we only think so  i ll try said polly influenced more by her desire to keep miss mills good opinion than any love of selfsacrifice for her sex it was rather a hard thing to ask of a shy sensitive girl and the kind old lady knew it for in spite of the gray hair and withered face her heart was very young and her own girlish trials not forgotten but she knew also that polly had more influence over others than she herself suspected simply because of her candid upright nature and that while she tried to help others she was serving herself in a way that would improve heart and soul more than any mere social success she might gain by following the rules of fashionable life which drill the character out of girls till they are as much alike as pins in a paper and have about as much true sense and sentiment in their little heads there was good stuff in polly unspoiled as yet and miss mills was only acting out her principle of women helping each other the wise old lady saw that polly had reached that point where the girl suddenly blooms into a woman asking something more substantial than pleasure to satisfy the new aspirations that are born a time as precious and important to the afterlife as the hour when the apple blossoms fall and the young fruit waits for the elements to ripen or destroy the harvest  polly did not know this and was fortunate in possessing a friend who knew what influences would serve her best and who could give her what all women should desire to give each other the example of a sweet good life more eloquent and powerful than any words for this is a right no one can deny us  polly turned the matter over in her mind as she dressed while jenny played waiting maid little dreaming what this new friend was meaning to do for her if she dared  is it going to be a teaparty miss asked jenny as the black silk went rustling on to her great admiration for she considered polly a beauty  well no i think it will probably be a lecture answered polly laughing for jennys grateful service and affectionate eyes confirmed the purpose which miss mills little homily had suggested  as she entered the shaws parlor an hour or two later an appalling array of welldressed girls appeared each provided with a dainty reticule basket or bag and each tongue going a good deal faster than the needle while the white fingers stitched sleeves in upside down put flannel jackets together hind part before or gobbled buttonholes with the best intentions in life  you are a dear to come so early here s a nice place for you between belle and miss perkins and here s a sweet little dress to make unless you like something else better said fanny receiving her friend with warmth and placing her where she thought she would enjoy herself  thank you i ll take an unbleached cotton shirt if you have such a thing for it is likely to be needed before a cambric frock replied polly subsiding into her corner as quickly as possible for at least six eyeglasses were up and she did nt enjoy being stared at  miss perkins a grave coldlooking young lady with an aristocratic nose bowed politely and then went on with her work which displayed two diamond rings to great advantage belle being of the demonstrative sort smiled and nodded drew up her chair and began a whispered account of trixs last quarrel with tom polly listened with interest while she sewed diligently occasionally permitting her eyes to study the elegant intricacies of miss perkins dress for that young lady sat like a statue quirking her delicate fingers and accomplishing about two stitches a minute  in the midst of belles story a more exciting bit of gossip caught her ear and she plunged into the conversation going on across the table leaving polly free to listen and admire the wit wisdom and charitable spirit of the accomplished young ladies about her there was a perfect babel of tongues but out of the confusion polly gathered scraps of fashionable intelligence which somewhat lessened her respect for the dwellers in high places one fair creature asserted that joe somebody took so much champagne at the last german that he had to be got away and sent home with two servants another divulged the awful fact that carrie ps wedding presents were half of them hired for the occasion a third circulated a whisper to the effect that though mrs buckminster wore a thousanddollar cloak her boys were not allowed but one sheet to their beds and a fourth young gossip assured the company that a certain person never had offered himself to a certain other person though the report was industriously spread by interested parties this latter remark caused such a clamor that fanny called the meeting to order in a most unparliamentary fashion  girls girls you really must talk less and sew more or our society will be disgraced do you know our branch sent in less work than any of the others last month and mrs fitz george said she did nt see how fifteen young ladies could manage to do so little  we dont talk a bit more than the old ladies do i just wish you could have heard them go on last time the way they get so much done is they take work home and make their seamstresses do it and then they take credit for vast industry said belle who always spoke her mind with charming candor  that reminds me that mamma says they want as many things as we can make for it s a hard winter and the poor are suffering very much do any of you wish to take articles home to do at odd times said fan who was president of this energetic dorcas society  mercy no it takes all my leisure time to mend my gloves and refresh my dresses answered belle  i think if we meet once a week it is all that should be expected of us with our other engagements poor people always complain that the winter is a hard one and never are satisfied remarked miss perkins making her diamonds sparkle as she sewed buttons on the wrong side of a pink calico apron which would hardly survive one washing  nobody can ask me to do any more if they remember all i ve got to attend to before summer said trix with an important air i ve got three women hard at work and want another but everyone is so busy and ask such abominable prices that i m in despair and shall have to take hold myself i m afraid  there s a chance for jane thought polly but had nt courage to speak out loud in meeting just then and resolved to ask trix for work in private  prices are high but you forget how much more it costs to live now than it used to do mamma never allows us to beat down workwomen but wishes us to pay them well and economize in some other way if we must said emma davenport a quiet brighteyed girl who was called odd among the young ladies because she dressed simply when her father was a millionaire  just hear that girl talk about economy i beg your pardon she s some relation of yours i believe said belle in a low tone  very distant but i m proud of it for with her economy does nt mean scrimping in one place to make a show in another if every one would follow the davenports example workwomen would nt starve or servants be such a trouble emma is the plainest dressed girl in the room next to me yet any one can see she is a true gentlewoman said polly warmly  and you are another answered belle who had always loved polly in her scatterbrained way  hush trix has the floor  if they spent their wages properly i should nt mind so much but they think they must be as fine as anybody and dress so well that it is hard to tell mistress from maid why our cook got a bonnet just like mine the materials were cheaper but the effect was the same and had the impertinence to wear it before my face i forbid it and she left of course which made papa so cross he would nt give me the camels hair shawl he promised this year  it s perfectly shameful said miss perkins as trix paused out of breath servants ought to be made to dress like servants as they do abroad then we should have no more trouble observed miss perkins who had just made the grand tour and had brought home a french maid  perky dont practise as she preaches whispered belle to polly as miss p became absorbed in the chat of her other neighbors she pays her chamber girl with old finery and the other day when betsey was out parading in her mississ castoff purple plush suit mr curtis thought she was mademoiselle and bowed to her he is as blind as a bat but recognized the dress and pulled off his hat to it in the most elegant style perky adores him and was mad enough to beat betsey when she told the story and giggled over it betsey is quite as stylish and ever so much prettier than perky and she knows it which is an aggravation  polly could nt help laughing but grew sober a minute after as trix said pettishly well i m sick of hearing about beggars i believe half of them are humbugs and if we let them alone they d go to work and take care of themselves there s altogether too much fuss made about charity i do wish we could be left in peace  there cant be too much charity burst out polly forgetting her shyness all at once  oh indeed well i take the liberty to differ from you returned trix putting up her glass and bestowing upon polly her most toploftical stare as the girls called it  i regret to say that polly never could talk with or be near trix without feeling irritated and combative she tried to conquer this feeling but she could nt and when trix put on airs polly felt an intense desire to box her ears that eyeglass was her especial aversion for trix was no more nearsighted than herself but pretended to be because it was the fashion and at times used the innocent glass as a weapon with which to put down any one who presumed to set themselves up the supercilious glance which accompanied her ironically polite speech roused polly who answered with sudden color and the kindling of the eyes that always betrayed a perturbed spirit i dont think many of us would enjoy that selfish sort of peace while little children starve and girls no older than us kill themselves because their dreadful poverty leaves them no choice but sin or death  a sudden lull took place for though polly did not raise her voice it was full of indignant emotion and the most frivolous girl there felt a little thrill of sympathy for the most utterly fashionable life does not kill the heart out of women till years of selfish pleasure have passed over their heads trix was ashamed of herself but she felt the same antagonism toward polly that polly did toward her and being less generous took satisfaction in plaguing her polly did not know that the secret of this was the fact that tom often held her up as a model for his fiance to follow which caused that young lady to dislike her more than ever  half the awful stories in the papers are made up for a sensation and it s absurd to believe them unless one likes to be harrowed up i dont and as for peace i m not likely to get much while i have tom to look after said trix with an aggravating laugh  pollys needle snapped in two but she did not mind it as she said with a look that silenced even sharptongued trix i cant help believing what my own eyes and ears have seen and heard you lead such safe and happy lives you cant imagine the misery that is all round you but if you could get a glimpse of it it would make your hearts ache as it has mine  do you suffer from heartache some one hinted as much to me but you looked so well i could nt believe it  now that was cruel in trix more cruel than any one guessed but girls tongues can deal wounds as sharp and sudden as the slender stiletto spanish women wear in their hair and polly turned pale as those words stabbed her belle saw it and rushed to the rescue with more goodwill than wisdom  nobody ever accused you of having any heart to ache with polly and i are not old enough yet to get tough and cool and we are still silly enough to pity unhappy people tom shaw especially added belle under her breath  that was a twoedged thrust for trix was decidedly an old girl and tom was generally regarded as a hapless victim trix turned red but before she could load and fire again emma davenport who labored under the delusion that this sort of skirmishing was illnatured and therefore illbred spoke up in her pleasant way speaking of pitying the poor i always wonder why it is that we all like to read and cry over their troubles in books but when we have the real thing before us we think it is uninteresting and disagreeable  it s the genius that gets into the books which makes us like the poverty i fancy but i dont quite agree that the real thing is nt interesting i think it would be if we knew how to look at and feel it said polly very quietly as she pushed her chair out of the arctic circle of miss perkins into the temperate one of friendly emma  but how shall we learn that i dont see what we girls can do more than we do now we have nt much money for such things should nt know how to use it if we had and it is nt proper for us to go poking into dirty places to hunt up the needy going about doing good in pony phaetons as somebody says may succeed in england but it wont work here said fanny who had begun lately to think a good deal of some one beside herself and so found her interest in her fellowbeings increasing daily  we cant do much perhaps just yet but still there are things left undone that naturally fall to us i know a house said polly sewing busily as she talked where every servant who enters it becomes an object of interest to the mistress and her daughters these women are taught good habits books are put where they can get them sensible amusements are planned for them sometimes and they soon feel that they are not considered mere scrubs to do as much work as possible for as little money as possible but helpers in the family who are loved and respected in proportion to their faithfulness this lady feels her duty to them owns it and does it as conscientiously as she wants them to do theirs by her and that is the way it ought to be i think  as polly paused several keen eyes discovered that emmas cheeks were very red and saw a smile lurking in the corners of the mouth that tried to look demure which told them who polly meant  do the biddies all turn out saints in that well regulated family asked the irrepressible trix  no few of us do that even in the parlor but every one of the biddies is better for being there whether they are grateful or not i ought not to have mentioned this perhaps but i wanted to show you one thing that we girls can do we all complain about bad servants most as much as if we were housekeepers ourselves but it never occurs to us to try and mend the matter by getting up a better spirit between mistress and maid then there s another thing we can do added polly warming up most of us find money enough for our little vanities and pleasures but feel dreadfully poor when we come to pay for work sewing especially could nt we give up a few of the vanities and pay the seamstresses better  i declare i will cried belle whose conscience suddenly woke and smote her for beating down the woman who did her plain sewing in order that she might have an extra flounce on a new dress belle has got a virtuous fit pity it wont last a week said trix  wait and see retorted belle resolving that it should last just to disappoint that spiteful minx as she sweetly called her old schoolmate  now we shall behold belle galloping away at a great pace on her new hobby i should nt be surprised to hear of her preaching in the jail adopting a nice dirty little orphan or passing round tracts at a womans rights meeting said trix who never could forgive belle for having a lovely complexion and so much hair of her own that she never patronized either rats mice waterfalls switches or puffcombs  well i might do worse and i think of the two i d rather amuse myself so than as some young ladies do who get into the papers for their pranks returned belle with a moral air  suppose we have a little recess and rest while polly plays to us will you polly it will do us good they all want to hear you and begged i d ask  then i will with pleasure and polly went to the piano with such obliging readiness that several reproachful glances fell upon trix who did nt need her glass to see them  polly was never too sad perturbed or lazy to sing for it was almost as easy to her as breathing and seemed the most natural outlet for her emotions for a minute her hands wandered over the keys as if uncertain what to play then falling into a sad sweet strain she sang the bridge of sighs polly did nt know why she chose it but the instinct seemed to have been a true one for old as the song was it went straight to the hearts of the hearers and polly sung it better than she ever had before for now the memory of little jane lent it a tender pathos which no art could give it did them all good for music is a beautiful magician and few can resist its power the girls were touched by the appeal polly was lifted out of herself and when she turned round the softened look on all the faces told her that for the moment foolish differences and frivolous beliefs were forgotten in the one womanly sentiment of pity for the wrongs and woes of which the listeners happy lives were ignorant  that song always makes me cry and feel as if i had no right to be so comfortable said belle openly wiping her eyes on a crash towel  fortunately such cases are very rare said another young lady who seldom read the newspapers  i wish they were but i m afraid they are not for only three weeks ago i saw a girl younger than any of us and no worse who tried to destroy herself simply because she was so discouraged sick and poor said polly  do tell about her cried belle eagerly  feeling that the song had paved the way for the story and given her courage to tell it polly did tell it and must have done it well for the girls stopped work to listen and when she ended other eyes beside warmhearted belles were wet trix looked quite subdued miss perkins thawed to such a degree that something glittered on her hand as she bent over the pink pinafore again better and brighter than her biggest diamond emma got up and went to polly with a face full of affectionate respect while fanny moved by a sudden impulse caught up a costly sevres plate that stood on the etagere and laying a fivedollar bill in it passed it round quoting pollys words girls i know you ll like to help poor little jenny begin again and do better this time  it was good to see how quickly the pretty purses were out how generously each gave of its abundance and what hearty applause broke from the girls as belle laid down her gold thimble saying with an april face there take that i never have any money somehow it wont stay with me but i cant let the plate pass me this time  when fanny brought the contributions to polly she just gathered it up in her two hands with such a glad grateful face the girls wished they had had more to give  i cant thank you enough she said with an eloquent little choke in her voice this will help jenny very much but the way in which it was done will do her more good than double the money because it will prove to her that she is nt without friends and make her feel that there is a place in the world for her let her work for you in return for this she dont ask alms she only wants employment and a little kindness and the best charity we can bestow is to see that she has both  i ll give her as much sewing as she wants and she can stay at our house while she does it if she needs a home said trix in a spasm of benevolence  she does nt need a home thank you miss mills has given half of hers and considers jane her child answered polly with proud satisfaction in the fact  what an old dear cried belle  i want to know her may i whispered emma  oh yes i m glad to make her known to any one she is a quiet little old lady but she does one heaps of good and shows you how to be charitable in the wisest way  do tell us about it i m sure i want to do my duty but it s such a muddle i dont know how said belle  then quite naturally the conversation fell upon the great work that none should be too busy to think of and which few are too young or too poor to help on with their mite the faces grew more earnest the fingers flew faster as the quick young hearts and brains took in the new facts ideas and plans that grew out of the true stories the sensible hints the successful efforts which polly told them fresh from the lips of miss mills for of late polly had talked much with the good lady and learned quickly the lessons her unselfish life conveyed the girls found this more interesting than gossip partly owing to its novelty doubtless but the enthusiasm was sincere while it lasted and did them good many of them forgot all about it in a week but pollys effort was not lost for emma belle and fanny remained firm friends to jane so kindly helping her that the poor child felt as if she had indeed been born again into a new and happy world  not till long afterward did polly see how much good this little effort had done her for the first small sacrifice of this sort leads the way to others and a single hands turn given heartily to the worlds great work helps one amazingly with ones own small tasks polly found this out as her life slowly grew easier and brighter and the beautiful law of compensation gave her better purposes and pleasures than any she had lost the parents of some of her pupils were persons of real refinement and such are always quick to perceive the marks of culture in others no matter where they find them these attracted first by pollys cheerful face modest manners and faithful work soon found in her something more than a good teacher they found a real talent for music an eager desire for helpful opportunities and a heart grateful for the kindly sympathy that makes rough places smooth fortunately those who have the skill to detect these traits also possess the spirit to appreciate and often the power to serve and develop them in ways so delicate that the most sensitive pride could not resent the favor these true gentlefolk showed polly their respect and regard put many pleasures in her way and when they paid her for her work gave her also the hearty thanks that takes away all sense of degradation even from the humblest service for money so earned and paid sweetens the daily bread it buys and makes the mutual obligation a mutual benefit and pleasure  a few such patrons did much for polly and the music she gave them had an undertone of gratitude that left blithe echoes in those great houses which money could not buy  then as her butterfly acquaintances deserted her she found her way into a hive of friendly bees who welcomed her and showed her how to find the honey that keeps life sweet and wholesome through miss mills who was the counsellor and comforter of several polly came to know a little sisterhood of busy happy independent girls who each had a purpose to execute a talent to develop an ambition to achieve and brought to the work patience and perseverance hope and courage here polly found her place at once for in this little world love and liberty prevailed talent energy and character took the first rank money fashion and position were literally nowhere for here as in the big world outside genius seemed to blossom best when poverty was head gardener young teachers doing much work for little pay young artists trying to pencil paint or carve their way to rome young writers burning to distinguish themselves young singers dreaming of triumphs great as those of jenny lind and some who tried to conquer independence armed only with a needle like poor jane all these helped polly as unconsciously as she helped them for purpose and principle are the best teachers we can have and the want of them makes half the women of america what they are restless aimless frivolous and sick  to outsiders that was a very hardworking and uneventful winter to polly she thought so herself but as spring came on the seed of new virtues planted in the winter time and ripened by the sunshine of endeavor began to bud in pollys nature betraying their presence to others by the added strength and sweetness of her character long before she herself discovered these may flowers that had blossomed for her underneath the snow     chapter xii forbidden fruit   i m perfectly aching for some fun said polly to herself as she opened her window one morning and the sunshine and frosty air set her blood dancing and her eyes sparkling with youth health and overflowing spirits i really must break out somewhere and have a good time it s quite impossible to keep steady any longer now what will i do polly sprinkled crumbs to the doves who came daily to be fed and while she watched the gleaming necks and rosy feet she racked her brain to devise some unusually delightful way of enjoying herself for she really had bottled up her spirits so long they were in a state of uncontrollable effervescence  i ll go to the opera she suddenly announced to the doves it s expensive i know but it s remarkably good and music is such a treat to me yes i ll get two tickets as cheap as i can send a note to will poor lad he needs fun as much as i do and we ll go and have a nice time in some corner as charles lamb and his sister used to  with that polly slammed down the window to the dismay of her gentle little pensioners and began to fly about with great energy singing and talking to herself as if it was impossible to keep quiet she started early to her first lesson that she might have time to buy the tickets hoping as she put a fivedollar bill into her purse that they would nt be very high for she felt that she was not in a mood to resist temptation but she was spared any struggle for when she reached the place the ticket office was blocked up by eager purchasers and the disappointed faces that turned away told polly there was no hope for her  well i dont care i ll go somewhere for i will have my fun she said with great determination for disappointment only seemed to whet her appetite but the playbills showed her nothing inviting and she was forced to go away to her work with the money burning her pocket and all manner of wild schemes floating in her head at noon instead of going home to dinner she went and took an ice trying to feet very gay and festive all by herself it was rather a failure however and after a tour of the picture shops she went to give maud a lesson feeling that it was very hard to quench her longings and subside into a prim little music teacher  fortunately she did not have to do violence to her feelings very long for the first thing fanny said to her was can you go  where  did nt you get my note  i did nt go home to dinner  tom wants us to go to the opera tonight and fan got no further for polly uttered a cry of rapture and clasped her hands  go of course i will i ve been dying to go all day tried to get tickets this morning and could nt been fuming about it ever since and now oh how splendid and polly could not restrain an ecstatic skip for this burst of joy rather upset her  well you come to tea and we ll dress together and go all comfortable with tom who is in a heavenly frame of mind today  i must run home and get my things said polly resolving on the spot to buy the nicest pair of gloves the city afforded  you shall have my white cloak and any other little rigging you want tommy likes to have his ladies a credit to him you know said fanny departing to take a beauty sleep  polly instantly decided that she would nt borrow beckys best bonnet as she at first intended but get a new one for in her present excited state no extravagance seemed too prodigal in honor of this grand occasion i am afraid that mauds lesson was not as thorough as it should have been for pollys head was such a chaos of bonnets gloves operacloaks and fans that maud blundered through murdering time and tune at her own sweet will the instant it was over polly rushed away and bought not only the kids but a bonnet frame a bit of illusion and a pink crape rose which had tempted her for weeks in a certain shop window then home and to work with all the skill and speed of a distracted milliner  i m rushing madly into expense i m afraid but the fit is on me and i ll eat bread and water for a week to make up for it i must look nice for tom seldom takes me and ought to be gratified when he does i want to do like other girls just for once and enjoy myself without thinking about right and wrong now a bit of pink ribbon to tie it with and i shall be done in time to do up my best collar she said turning her boxes topsyturvy for the necessary ribbon in that delightful flurry which young ladies feel on such occasions  it is my private opinion that the little shifts and struggles we poor girls have to undergo beforehand give a peculiar relish to our fun when we get it this fact will account for the rapturous mood in which polly found herself when after making her bonnet washing and ironing her best set blacking her boots and mending her fan she at last like consuelo put on a little dress of black silk and with the smaller adornments pinned up in a paper started for the shaws finding it difficult to walk decorously when her heart was dancing in her bosom  maud happened to be playing a redowa up in the parlor and polly came prancing into the room so evidently spoiling for a dance that tom who was there found it impossible to resist catching her about the waist and putting her through the most intricate evolutions till mauds fingers gave out  that was splendid oh tom thank you so much for asking me tonight i feel just like having a regular good time cried polly when she stopped with her hat hanging round her neck and her hair looking as if she had been out in a high wind  glad of it i felt so myself and thought we d have a jolly little party all in the family said tom looking much gratified at her delight  is trix sick asked polly  gone to new york for a week  ah when the cats away the mice will play  exactly come and have another turn  before they could start however the awful spectacle of a little dog trotting out of the room with a paper parcel in his mouth made polly clasp her hands with the despairing cry my bonnet oh my bonnet  where what which and tom looked about him bewildered  snips got it save it save it  i will and tom gave chase with more vigor than discretion  snip evidently regarding it as a game got up for his special benefit enjoyed the race immensely and scampered all over the house shaking the precious parcel like a rat while his master ran and whistled commanded and coaxed in vain polly followed consumed with anxiety and maud laughed till mrs shaw sent down to know who was in hysterics a piteous yelp from the lower regions at last announced that the thief was captured and tom appeared bearing snip by the nape of the neck in one hand and pollys cherished bonnet in the other  the little scamp was just going to worry it when i grabbed him i m afraid he has eaten one of your gloves i cant find it and this one is pretty well chewed up said tom bereaving snip of the torn kid to which he still pertinaciously clung  serves me right said polly with a groan i d no business to get a new pair but i wanted to be extra gorgeous tonight and this is my punishment for such mad extravagance  was there anything else asked tom  only my best cuffs and collar you ll probably find them in the coalbin said polly with the calmness of despair  i saw some little white things on the diningroom floor as i raced through go get them maud and we ll repair damages said tom shutting the culprit into the boot closet where he placidly rolled himself up and went to sleep  they aint hurt a bit proclaimed maud restoring the lost treasures  neither is my bonnet for which i m deeply grateful said polly who had been examining it with a solicitude which made toms eyes twinkle  so am i for it strikes me that is an uncommonly nobby little affair he said approvingly tom had a weakness for pale pink roses and perhaps polly knew it  i m afraid it s too gay said polly with a dubious look  not a bit sort of bridal you know must be becoming put it on and let s see  i would nt for the world with my hair all tumbling down dont look at me till i m respectable and dont tell any one how i ve been acting i think i must be a little crazy tonight said polly gathering up her rescued finery and preparing to go and find fan  lunacy is mighty becoming polly try it again answered tom watching her as she went laughing away looking all the prettier for her dishevelment dress that girl up and she d be a raving tearing beauty added tom to maud in a lower tone as he look her into the parlor under his arm  polly heard it and instantly resolved to be as raving and as tearing as her means would allow just for one night she said as she peeped over the banisters glad to see that the dance and the race had taken the bandboxy air out of toms elegant array  i deeply regret being obliged to shock the eyes and ears of such of my readers as have a prejudice in favor of pure english by expressions like the above but having rashly undertaken to write a little story about young america for young america i feel bound to depict my honored patrons as faithfully as my limited powers permit otherwise i must expect the crushing criticism well i dare say it s all very prim and proper but it is nt a bit like us and never hope to arrive at the distinction of finding the covers of an oldfashioned girl the dirtiest in the library  the friends had a social cup o tea upstairs which polly considered the height of luxury and then each took a mirror and proceeded to prink to her hearts content the earnestness with which polly made her toilet that night was delightful to behold feeling in a daring mood she released her pretty hair from the braids in which she usually wore it and permitted the curls to display themselves in all their brown abundance especially several dangerous little ones about the temples and forehead the putting on of the rescued collar and cuffs was a task which absorbed her whole mind so was the settling of a minute bit of courtplaster just to the left of the dimple in her chin an unusual piece of coquetry in which polly would not have indulged if an almost invisible scratch had not given her an excuse for doing it the white downtrimmed cloak with certain imposing ornaments on the hood was assumed with becoming gravity and draped with much advancing and retreating before the glass as its wearer practised the true boston gait elbows back shoulders forward a bend and a slide occasionally varied by a slight skip but when that bonnet went on polly actually held her breath till it was safely landed and the pink rose bloomed above the smooth waves of hair with what fanny called a ravishing effect at this successful stage of affairs polly found it impossible to resist the loan of a pair of gold bands for the wrists and fannys white fan with the little mirror in the middle  i can put them in my pocket if i feel too much dressed said polly as she snapped on the bracelets but after a wave or two of the fan she felt that it would be impossible to take them off till the evening was over so enticing was their glitter  fanny also lent her a pair of threebutton gloves which completed her content and when tom greeted her with an approving here s a sight for gods and men why polly you re gorgeous she felt that her fun had decidedly begun  would nt polly make a lovely bride said maud who was revolving about the two girls trying to decide whether she would have a blue or a white cloak when she grew up and went to operas  faith and she would allow me to congratulate you mrs sydney added tom advancing with his weddingreception bow and a wicked look at fanny  go away how dare you cried polly growing much redder than her rose  if we are going to the opera tonight perhaps we d better start as the carriage has been waiting some time observed fan coolly and sailed out of the room in an unusually lofty manner  dont you like it polly whispered tom as they went down stairs together  very much  the deuce you do  i m so fond of music how can i help it  i m talking about syd  well i m not  you d better try for him  i ll think of it  oh polly polly what are you coming to  a tumble into the street apparently answered polly as she slipped a little on the step and tom stopped in the middle of his laugh to pilot her safely into the carriage where fanny was already seated  here s richness said polly to herself as she rolled away feeling as cinderella probably did when the pumpkincoach bore her to the first ball only polly had two princes to think about and poor cinderella on that occasion had not even one fanny did nt seem inclined to talk much and tom would go on in such a ridiculous manner that polly told him she would nt listen and began to hum bits of the opera but she heard every word nevertheless and resolved to pay him for his impertinence as soon as possible by showing him what he had lost  their seats were in the balcony and hardly were they settled when by one of those remarkable coincidences which are continually occurring in our youth mr sydney and fannys old friend frank moore took their places just behind them  oh you villain you did it on purpose whispered polly as she turned from greeting their neighbors and saw a droll look on toms face  i give you my word i did nt it s the law of attraction dont you see  if fan likes it i dont care  she looks resigned i think  she certainly did for she was talking and laughing in the gayest manner with frank while sydney was covertly surveying polly as if he did nt quite understand how the gray grub got so suddenly transformed into a white butterfly it is a wellknown fact that dress plays a very important part in the lives of most women and even the most sensible cannot help owning sometimes how much happiness they owe to a becoming gown gracefully arranged hair or a bonnet which brings out the best points in their faces and puts them in a good humor a great man was once heard to say that what first attracted him to his wellbeloved wife was seeing her in a white muslin dress with a blue shawl on the chair behind her the dress caught his eye and stopping to admire that the wearers intelligent conversation interested his mind and in time the womans sweetness won his heart it is not the finest dress which does the most execution i fancy but that which best interprets individual taste and character wise people understand this and everybody is more influenced by it than they know perhaps polly was not very wise but she felt that every one about her found something more attractive than usual in her and modestly attributed toms devotion sydneys interest and franks undisguised admiration to the new bonnet or more likely to that delightful combination of cashmere silk and swansdown which like charitys mantle seemed to cover a multitude of sins in other peoples eyes and exalt the little music teacher to the rank of a young lady  polly scoffed at this sort of thing sometimes but tonight she accepted it without a murmur rather enjoyed it in fact let her bracelets shine before the eyes of all men and felt that it was good to seem comely in their sight she forgot one thing however that her own happy spirits gave the crowning charm to a picture which every one liked to see a blithe young girl enjoying herself with all her heart the music and the light costume and company excited polly and made many things possible which at most times she would never have thought of saying or doing she did not mean to flirt but somehow it flirted itself and she could nt help it for once started it was hard to stop with tom goading her on and sydney looking at her with that new interest in his eyes pollys flirting was such a very mild imitation of the fashionable thing that trix  co would not have recognized it but it did very well for a beginner and polly understood that night wherein the fascination of it lay for she felt as if she had found a new gift all of a sudden and was learning how to use it knowing that it was dangerous yet finding its chief charm in that very fact  tom did nt know what to make of her at first though he thought the change uncommonly becoming and finally decided that polly had taken his advice and was setting her cap for syd as he gracefully expressed it sydney being a modest man thought nothing of the kind but simply fancied that little polly was growing up to be a very charming woman he had known her since her first visit and had always liked the child this winter he had been interested in the success of her plans and had done what he could to help them but he never thought of failing in love with polly till that night then he began to feel that he had not fully appreciated his young friend that she was such a bright and lovable girl it was a pity she should not always be gay and pretty and enjoy herself that she would make a capital wife for somebody and perhaps it was about time to think of settling as his sister often said these thoughts came and went as he watched the white figure in front felt the enchantment of the music and found everybody unusually blithe and beautiful he had heard the opera many times but it had never seemed so fine before perhaps because he had never happened to have had an ingenuous young face so near him in which the varying emotions born of the music and the romance it portrayed came and went so eloquently that it was impossible to help reading them polly did not know that this was why he leaned down so often to speak to her with an expression which she did not understand but liked very much nevertheless  dont shut your eyes polly they are so full of mischief tonight i like to see them said tom after idly wondering for a minute if she knew how long and curly her lashes were  i dont wish to look affected but the music tells the story so much better than the acting that i dont care to look on half the time answered polly hoping tom would nt see the tears she had so cleverly suppressed  now i like the acting best the music is all very fine i know but it does seem so absurd for people to go round telling tremendous secrets at the top of their voices i cant get used to it  that s because you ve more commonsense than romance i dont mind the absurdity and quite long to go and comfort that poor girl with the broken heart said polly with a sigh as the curtain fell on a most affecting tableau  whatshisname is a great jack not to see that she adores him in real life we fellows aint such bats as all that observed tom who had decided opinions on many subjects that he knew very little about and expressed them with great candor  a curious smile passed over pollys face and she put up her glass to hide her eyes as she said i think you are bats sometimes but women are taught to wear masks and that accounts for it i suppose  i dont agree there s precious little masking nowadays wish there was a little more sometimes added tom thinking of several blooming damsels whose beseeching eyes had begged him not to leave them to wither on the parent stem  i hope not but i guess there s a good deal more than any one would suspect  what can you know about broken hearts and blighted beings asked sydney smiling at the girls pensive tone  polly glanced up at him and her face dimpled and shone again as she answered laughing not much my time is to come  i cant imagine you walking about the world with your back hair down bewailing a hardhearted lover said tom  neither can i that would nt be my way  no miss polly would let concealment prey on her damask cheeks and still smile on in the novel fashion or turn sister of charity and nurse the heartless lover through smallpox or some other contagious disease and die seraphically leaving him to the agonies of remorse and tardy love  polly gave sydney an indignant look as he said that in a slow satirical way that nettled her very much for she hated to be thought sentimental  that s not my way either she said decidedly i d try to outlive it and if i could nt i d try to be the better for it disappointment need nt make a woman a fool  nor an old maid if she s pretty and good remember that and dont visit the sins of one blockhead on all the rest of mankind said tom laughing at her earnestness  i dont think there is the slightest possibility of miss pollys being either added sydney with a look which made it evident that concealment had not seriously damaged pollys damask cheek as yet  there s clara bird i have nt seen her but once since she was married how pretty she looks and polly retired behind the big glass again thinking the chat was becoming rather personal  now there s a girl who tried a different cure for unrequited affection from any you mention people say she was fond of belles brother he did nt reciprocate but went off to india to spoil his constitution so clara married a man twenty years older than she is and consoles herself by being the bestdressed woman in the city  that accounts for it said polly when toms long whisper ended  for what  the tired look in her eyes  i dont see it said tom after a survey through the glass  did nt expect you would  i see what you mean a good many women have it nowadays said sydney over pollys shoulder  whats she tired of the old gentleman asked tom  and herself added polly  you ve been reading french novels i know you have that s just the way the heroines go on cried tom  i have nt read one but it s evident you have young man and you d better stop  i dont care for em only do it to keep up my french but how came you to be so wise maam  observation sir i like to watch faces and i seldom see a grownup one that looks perfectly happy  true for you polly no more you do now i think of it i dont know but one that always looks so and there it is  where asked polly with interest  look straight before you and you ll see it  polly did look but all she saw was her own face in the little mirror of the fan which tom held up and peeped over with a laugh in his eyes  do i look happy i m glad of that and polly surveyed herself with care  both young men thought it was girlish vanity and smiled at its naive display but polly was looking for something deeper than beauty and was glad not to find it  rather a pleasant little prospect hey polly  my bonnet is straight and that s all i care about did you ever see a picture of beau brummel asked polly quickly  no  well there he is modernized and turning the fan she showed him himself  any more portraits in your gallery asked sydney as if he liked to share all the nonsense going  one more  what do you call it  the portrait of a gentleman and the little glass reflected a gratified face for the space of two seconds  thank you i m glad i dont disgrace my name said sydney looking down into the merry blue eyes that thanked him silently for many of the small kindnesses that women never can forget  very good polly you are getting on fast whispered tom patting his yellow kids approvingly  be quiet dear me how warm it is and polly gave him a frown that delighted his soul  come out and have an ice we shall have time  fan is so absorbed i could nt think of disturbing her said polly fancying that her friend was enjoying the evening as much as she was a great mistake by the way for fan was acting for effect and though she longed to turn and join them would nt do it unless a certain person showed signs of missing her he did nt and fanny chatted on raging inwardly over her disappointment and wondering how polly could be so gay and selfish  it was delicious to see the little airs polly put on for she felt as if she were somebody else and acting a part she leaned back as if quite oppressed by the heat permitted sydney to fan her and paid him for the service by giving him a flower from her bouquet proceedings which amused tom immensely even while it piqued him a little to be treated like an old friend who did nt count  go in and win polly i ll give you my blessing he whispered as the curtain rose again  it s only part of the fun so dont you laugh you disrespectful boy she whispered back in a tone never used toward sydney  tom did nt quite like the different way in which she treated them and the word boy disturbed his dignity for he was almost twentyone and polly ought to treat him with more respect sydney at the same moment was wishing he was in toms place young comely and such a familiar friend that polly would scold and lecture him in the delightful way she did tom while polly forgot them both when the music began and left them ample time to look at her and think about themselves  while they waited to get out when all was over polly heard fan whisper to tom what do you think trix will say to this  what do you mean  why the way you ve been going on tonight  dont know and dont care it s only polly  that s the very thing she cant bear p  well i can and i dont see why i should nt enjoy myself as well as trix  you ll get to enjoying yourself too much if you are nt careful polly s waked up  i m glad of it and so s syd  i only spoke for your good  dont trouble yourself about me i get lecturing enough in another quarter and cant stand any more come polly  she took the arm he offered her but her heart was sore and angry for that phrase it s only polly hurt her sadly as if i was nt anybody had nt any feelings and was only made to amuse or work for people fan and tom are both mistaken and i ll show them that polly is awake she thought indignantly why should nt i enjoy myself as well as the rest besides it s only tom she added with a bitter smile as she thought of trix  are you tired polly asked tom bending down to look into her face  yes of being nobody  ah but you aint nobody you re polly and you could nt better that if you tried ever so hard said tom warmly for he really was fond of polly and felt uncommonly so just then  i m glad you think so anyway it s so pleasant to be liked and she looked up with her face quite bright again  i always did like you dont you know ever since that first visit  but you teased me shamefully for all that  so i did but i dont now  polly did not answer and tom asked with more anxiety than the occasion required do i polly  not in the same way tom she answered in a tone that did nt sound quite natural  well i never will again  yes you will you cant help it and pollys eye glanced at sydney who was in front with fan  tom laughed and drew polly closer as the crowd pressed saying with mock tenderness did nt she like to be chaffed about her sweethearts well she shant be if i can help it poor dear did she get her little bonnet knocked into a cocked hat and her little temper riled at the same time  polly could nt help laughing and in spite of the crush enjoyed the slow journey from seat to carriage for tom took such excellent care of her she was rather sorry when it was over  they had a merry little supper after they got home and polly gave them a burlesque opera that convulsed her hearers for her spirits rose again and she was determined to get the last drop of fun before she went back to her humdrum life again  i ve had a regularly splendid time and thank you ever so much she said when the goodnights were being exchanged  so have i let s go and do it again tomorrow said tom holding the hand from which he had helped to pull a refractory glove  not for a long while please too much pleasure would soon spoil me answered polly shaking her head  i dont believe it goodnight sweet mistress milton as syd called you sleep like an angel and dont dream of i forgot no teasing allowed and tom took himself off with a theatrical farewell  now it s all over and done with thought polly as she fell asleep after a long vigil but it was not and pollys fun cost more than the price of gloves and bonnet for having nibbled at forbidden fruit she had to pay the penalty she only meant to have a good time and there was no harm in that but unfortunately she yielded to the various small temptations that beset pretty young girls and did more mischief to others than to herself fannys friendship grew cooler after that night tom kept wishing trix was half as satisfactory as polly and mr sydney began to build castles that had no foundation     chapter xiii the sunny side   i ve won the wager tom  did nt know there was one  dont you remember you said polly would be tired of her teaching and give it up in three months and i said she would nt  well is nt she  not a bit of it i thought she was at one time and expected every day to have her come in with a long face and say she could nt stand it but somehow lately she is always bright and happy seems to like her work and dont have the tired worried look she used to at first the three months are out so pay up tommy  all right what will you have  you may make it gloves i always need them and papa looks sober when i want money  there was a minutes pause as fan returned to her practising and tom relapsed into the reverie he was enjoying seated astride of a chair with his chin on his folded arms  seems to me polly dont come here as often as she used to he said presently  no she seems to be very busy got some new friends i believe old ladies sewinggirls and things of that sort i miss her but know she ll get tired of being goody and will come back to me before long  dont be too sure of that maam something in toms tone made fan turn round and ask what do you mean  well it strikes me that sydney is one of pollys new friends have nt you observed that she is uncommonly jolly and dont that sort of thing account for it  nonsense said fanny sharply  hope it is coolly returned tom  what put it into your head demanded fanny twirling round again so that her face was hidden  oh well i keep meeting syd and polly circulating in the same directions she looks as if she had found something uncommonly nice and he looks as if all creation was getting pollyfied pretty rapidly wonder you have nt observed it  i have  it was toms turn to look surprised now for fannys voice sounded strange to him he looked at her steadily for a minute but saw only a rosy ear and a bent head a cloud passed over his face and he leaned his chin on his arm again with a despondent whistle as he said to himself poor fan both of us in a scrape at once  dont you think it would be a good thing asked fanny after playing a bar or two very badly  yes for syd  not for polly why he s rich and clever and better than most of you goodfornothing fellows what can the girl expect  cant say but i dont fancy the match myself  dont be a dog in the manger tom bless your little heart i only take a brotherly sort of interest in polly she s a capital girl and she ought to marry a missionary or one of your reformer fellows and be a shining light of some sort i dont think setting up for a fine lady would suit her  i think it would and i hope she ll have the chance said fanny evidently making an effort to speak kindly  good for you fan and tom gave an emphatic nod as if her words meant more than she suspected mind you he added i dont know anything and only fancied there might be some little flirtation going on but i dare say it s nothing  time will show then fan began to sing and toms horse came so he departed with the very unusual demonstration of a gentle pat on the head as he said kindly that s right my dear keep jolly it was nt an elegant way of expressing sympathy but it was hearty and fan thanked him for it though she only said dont break your neck tommy  when he was gone fans song ended as suddenly as it began and she sat thinking with varying expressions of doubt and trouble passing rapidly across her face  well i cant do anything but wait she said at last slamming the musicbook together with a desperate look yes i can she added a minute after it s pollys holiday i can go and see her and if there is anything in it i shall find it out  fanny dropped her face into her hands with a little shiver as she said that then got up looking as pale and resolute as if going to meet some dreadful doom and putting on her things went away to pollys as fast as her dignity would allow  saturday morning was pollys clearingup day and fan found her with a handkerchief tied over her head and a big apron on just putting the last touches to the tidy little room which was as fresh and bright as water air and a pair of hands could make it  all ready for company i ll just whisk off my regimentals and polly the maid becomes polly the missis it was lovely of you to come early take off your things another new bonnet you extravagant wretch how is your mother and maudie it s a nice day and we ll have a walk wont we  by the time pollys welcome was uttered she had got fan on the little sofa beside her and was smiling at her in such an infectious manner that fan could nt help smiling back  i came to see what you have been doing with yourself lately you dont come and report and i got anxious about you said fanny looking into the clear eyes before her  i ve been so busy and i knew you would nt care to hear about my doings for they are nt the sort you like answered polly  your lessons did nt use to take up all your time it s my private opinion that you are taking as well as giving lessons miss said fan putting on a playfully stern air to hide her real anxiety  yes i am answered polly soberly  in what love  a quick color came to pollys cheeks as she laughed and said looking away no friendship and good works  oh indeed may i ask who is your teacher  i ve more than one but miss mills is head teacher  she instructs in good works who gives the friendship lessons  such pleasant girls i wish you knew them fan so clever and energetic and kind and happy it always does me good to see them cried polly with a face full of enthusiasm  is that all and fan gave her a curious look of mingled disappointment and relief  there i told you my doings would not interest you and they dont they sound flat and prosy after your brilliant adventures let s change the subject said polly looking relieved herself  dear me which of our sweethearts sends us dainty bouquets of violets so early in the morning asked fanny suddenly spying the purple cluster in a graceful little vase on the piano  he sends me one every week he knows i love them so and pollys eyes turned that way full of pride and pleasure  i d no idea he was so devoted said fanny stooping to smell the flowers and at the same time read a card that lay near them  you need nt plague me about it now you know it i never speak of our fondness for one another because such things seem silly to other people will is nt all that jimmy was to me but he tries to be and i love him dearly for it  will fannys voice quite startled polly it was so sharp and sudden and her face grew red and pale all in a minute as she upset the little vase with the start she gave  yes of course who did you think i meant asked polly sopping up the water before it damaged her piano  never mind i thought you might be having a quiet little flirtation with somebody i feel responsible you know because i told your mother i d look after you the flowers are all right my head aches so i hardly know what i m doing this morning  fanny spoke fast and laughed uncomfortably as she went back to the sofa wondering if polly had told her a lie polly seemed to guess at her thoughts as she saw the card and turning toward her she held it up saying with a conscious look in her eyes you thought mr sydney sent them well you are mistaken and the next time you want to know anything please ask straight out i like it better than talking at cross purposes  now my dear dont be angry i was only teasing you in fun tom took it into his foolish head that something was going on and i felt a natural interest you know  tom what does he know or care about my affairs demanded polly  he met you two in the street pretty often and being in a sentimental mood himself got up a romance for you and sydney  i m much obliged to him for his interest but it s quite wasted thank you  fans next proceeding gave her friend another surprise for being rather ashamed of herself very much relieved and quite at a loss what to say she took refuge in an hysterical fit of tears which changed pollys anger into tenderness at once  is that the trouble she has been hiding all winter poor dear i wish i d known it sooner thought polly as she tried to soothe her with comfortable pats sniffs of cologne and sympathizing remarks upon the subject of headache carefully ignoring that other feminine affliction the heartache  there i feel better i ve been needing a good cry for some time and now i shall be all right never mind it polly i m nervous and tired i ve danced too much lately and dyspepsia makes me blue and fanny wiped her eyes and laughed  of course it does you need rest and petting and here i ve been scolding you when i ought to have been extra kind now tell me what i can do for you said polly with a remorseful face  talk to me and tell me all about yourself you dont seem to have as many worries as other people whats the secret polly and fan looked up with wet eyes and a wistful face at polly who was putting little dabs of cologne all over her head  well said polly slowly i just try to look on the bright side of things that helps one amazingly why you ve no idea how much goodness and sunshine you can get out of the most unpromising things if you make the best of them  i dont know how said fan despondently  you can learn i did i used to croak and fret dreadfully and get so unhappy i was nt fit for anything i do it still more than i ought but i try not to and it gets easier i find get atop of your troubles and then they are half cured miss mills says  everything is so contrary and provoking said fanny petulantly  now what in the world have you to fret about asked polly rather anxiously  quantities of things began fan and then stopped for somehow she felt ashamed to own that she was afflicted because she could nt have a new set of furs go to paris in the spring and make mr sydney love her she hunted up something more presentable and said in a despairing tone well mother is very poorly tom and trix quarrel all the time maud gets more and more wilful every day and papa is worried about his affairs  a sad state of things but nothing very desperate cant you lend a hand anywhere that might do good all round  no i have nt the talent for managing people but i see what ought to be done  well dont wail about it keep yourself happy if you can it will help other people to see you cheerful  just what tom saidkeep jolly but dear me how can one when everything is so stupid and tiresome  if ever a girl needed work it s you cried polly you began to be a young lady so early that you are tired of everything at twentytwo i wish you d go at something then you d find how much talent and energy you really had  i know ever so many girls who are just like me sick to death of fashionable life but dont know what to take in its place i d like to travel but papa says he cant afford it so i can only drag about and get on as i may  i pity you rich girls so much you have so many opportunities and dont seem to know how to use them i suppose i should do just the same in your place but it seems now as if i could be very happy and useful with plenty of money  you are that without it there i wont croak any more let us go and take a good walk and dont you tell any one how i came and cried like a baby  never said polly putting on her bonnet  i ought to go and make calls said fanny but i dont feel now as if i ever wanted to see any of the girls again dreadful state of mind is nt it  suppose you come and see some of my friends instead they are not fine or ceremonious but lively odd and pleasant come it will amuse you  i will cried fanny whose spirits seemed improved by the shower nice little old lady is nt she added fan as she caught sight of miss mills on their way out sitting at a table piled with work and sewing away with an energy that made the gray curls vibrate  saint mehitable i call her now there is a rich woman who knew how to get happiness out of her money said polly as they walked away she was poor till she was nearly fifty then a comfortable fortune was left her and she knew just how to use it that house was given her but instead of living in it all alone she filled it with poor gentlefolks who needed neat respectable homes but could nt get anything comfortable for their little money i m one of them and i know the worth of what she does for me two old widow ladies live below me several students overhead poor mrs kean and her lame boy have the back parlor and jenny the little bedroom next miss mills each pays what they can that s independent and makes us feel better but that dear woman does a thousand things that money cant pay for and we feel her influence all through the house i d rather be married and have a home of my own but next to that i should like to be an old maid like miss mills  pollys sober face and emphatic tone made fanny laugh and at the cheery sound a young girl pushing a babycarriage looked round and smiled  what lovely eyes whispered fanny  yes that s little jane returned polly adding when she had passed with a nod and a friendly dont get tired jenny we help one another at our house and every fine morning jenny takes johnny kean out when she goes for her own walk that gives his mother time to rest does both the children good and keeps things neighborly miss mills suggested it and jenny is so glad to do anything for anybody it s a pleasure to let her  i ve heard of miss mills before but i should think she would get tired to death sitting there making hoods and petticoats day after day said fanny after thinking over jennys story for a few minutes for seeing the girl seemed to bring it nearer and make it more real to her  but she dont sit there all the time people come to her with their troubles and she goes to them with all sorts of help from soap and soup to shrouds for the dead and comfort for the living i go with her sometimes and it is more exciting than any play to see and hear the lives and stories of the poor  how can you bear the dreadful sights and sounds the bad air and the poverty that cant be cured  but it is nt all dreadful there are good and lovely things among them if one only has eyes to see them it makes me grateful and contented shows me how rich i am and keeps me ready to do all i can for these poor souls  my good polly and fanny gave her friends arm an affectionate squeeze wondering if it was this alone that had worked the change in polly  you have seen two of my new friends miss mills and jenny now i ll show you two more said polly presently as they reached a door and she led the way up several flights of public stairs rebecca jeffrey is a regularly splendid girl full of talent she wont let us call it genius she will be famous some day i know she is so modest and yet so intent on her work lizzie small is an engraver and designs the most delightful little pictures becky and she live together and take care of one another in true damon and pythias style this studio is their home they work eat sleep and live here going halves in everything they are all alone in the world but as happy and independent as birds real friends whom nothing will part  let a lover come between them and their friendship wont last long said fanny  i think it will take a look at them and you ll change your mind answered polly tapping at a door on which two modest cards were tacked  come in said a voice and obeying fanny found herself in a large queerly furnished room lighted from above and occupied by two girls one stood before a great clay figure in a corner this one was tall with a strong face keen eyes short curly hair and a fine head fanny was struck at once by this face and figure though the one was not handsome and the other half hidden by a great pinafore covered with clay at a table where the light was clearest sat a fraillooking girl with a thin face big eyes and pale hair a dreamy absorbed little person who bent over a block skillfully wielding her tools  becky and bess how do you do this is my friend fanny shaw we are out on a rampage so go on with your work and let us lazy ones look on and admire  as polly spoke both girls looked up and nodded smilingly bess gave fan the one easychair becky took an artistic survey of the newcomer with eyes that seemed to see everything then each went on with her work and all began to talk  you are just what i want polly pull up your sleeve and give me an arm while you sit the muscles here are nt right and you ve got just what i want said becky slapping the round arm of the statue at which fan was gazing with awe  how do you get on asked polly throwing off her cloak and rolling up her sleeves as if going to washing  slowly the idea is working itself clear and i follow as fast as my hands can is the face better do you think said becky taking off a wet cloth and showing the head of the statue  how beautiful it is cried fanny staring at it with increased respect  what does it mean to you asked rebecca turning to her with a sudden shine in her keen eyes  i dont know whether it is meant for a saint or a muse a goddess or a fate but to me it is only a beautiful woman bigger lovelier and more imposing than any woman i ever saw answered fanny slowly trying to express the impression the statue made upon her  rebecca smiled brightly and bess looked round to nod approvingly but polly clapped her hands and said well done fan i did nt think you d get the idea so well but you have and i m proud of your insight now i ll tell you for becky will let me since you have paid her the compliment of understanding her work some time ago we got into a famous talk about what women should be and becky said she d show us her idea of the coming woman there she is as you say bigger lovelier and more imposing than any we see nowadays and at the same time she is a true woman see what a fine forehead yet the mouth is both firm and tender as if it could say strong wise things as well as teach children and kiss babies we could nt decide what to put in the hands as the most appropriate symbol what do you say  give her a sceptre she would make a fine queen answered fanny  no we have had enough of that women have been called queens a long time but the kingdom given them is nt worth ruling answered rebecca  i dont think it is nowadays said fanny with a tired sort of sigh  put a mans hand in hers to help her along then said polly whose happy fortune it had been to find friends and helpers in father and brothers  no my woman is to stand alone and help herself said rebecca decidedly  she s to be strongminded is she and fannys lip curled a little as she uttered the misused words  yes strongminded stronghearted strongsouled and strongbodied that is why i made her larger than the miserable pinchedup woman of our day strength and beauty must go together dont you think these broad shoulders can bear burdens without breaking down these hands work well these eyes see clearly and these lips do something besides simper and gossip  fanny was silent but a voice from besss corner said put a child in her arms becky  not that even for she is to be something more than a nurse  give her a ballotbox cried a new voice and turning round they saw an oddlooking woman perched on a sofa behind them  thank you for the suggestion kate i ll put that with the other symbols at her feet for i m going to have needle pen palette and broom somewhere to suggest the various talents she owns and the ballotbox will show that she has earned the right to use them how goes it and rebecca offered a claydaubed hand which the newcomer cordially shook  great news girls anna is going to italy cried kate tossing up her bonnet like a schoolboy  oh how splendid who takes her has she had a fortune left her tell all about it exclaimed the girls gathering round the speaker  yes it is splendid just one of the beautiful things that does everybody heaps of good it is so generous and so deserved you know anna has been longing to go working and hoping for a chance and never getting it till all of a sudden miss burton is inspired to invite the girl to go with her for several years to italy think of the luck of that dear soul the advantages she ll have the good it will do her and best of all the lovely way in which it comes to her miss burton wants her as a friend asks nothing of her but her company and anna will go through fire and water for her of course now is nt that fine  it was good to see how heartily these girls sympathized in their comrades good fortune polly danced all over the room bess and becky hugged one another and kate laughed with her eyes full while even fanny felt a glow of pride and pleasure at the kind act  who is that she whispered to polly who had subsided into a corner  why it is kate king the authoress bless me how rude not to introduce you here my king is an admirer of yours fanny shaw and my well beloved friend cried polly presenting fan who regarded the shabby young woman with as much respect as if she had been arrayed in velvet and ermine for kate had written a successful book by accident and happened to be the fashion just then  it s time for lunch girls and i brought mine along with me it s so much jollier to eat in sisterhood let s club together and have a revel said kate producing a bag of oranges and several big plummy buns  we ve got sardines crackers and cheese said bess clearing off a table with all speed  wait a bit and i ll add my share cried polly and catching up her cloak she ran off to the grocery store near by  you ll be shocked at our performances miss shaw but you can call it a picnic and never tell what dreadful things you saw us do said rebecca polishing a paint knife by rubbing it up and down in a pot of ivy while kate spread forth the feast in several odd plates and a flat shell or two  let us have coffee to finish off with put on the pot bess and skim the milk added becky as she produced cups mugs and a queer little vase to supply drinking vessels for the party  here s nuts a pot of jam and some cake fan likes sweet things and we want to be elegant when we have company said polly flying in again and depositing her share on the table  now then fall to ladies and help yourselves never mind if the china dont hold out take the sardines by their little tails and wipe your fingers on my brownpaper napkins said kate setting the example with such a relish that the others followed it in a gale of merriment  fanny had been to many elegant lunches but never enjoyed one more than that droll picnic in the studio for there was a freedom about it that was charming an artistic flavor to everything and such a spirit of goodwill and gayety that she felt at home at once as they ate the others talked and she listened finding it as interesting as any romance to hear these young women discuss their plans ambitions successes and defeats it was a new world to her and they seemed a different race of creatures from the girls whose lives were spent in dress gossip pleasure or ennui they were girls still full of spirits fun and youth but below the lightheartedness each cherished a purpose which seemed to ennoble her womanhood to give her a certain power a sustaining satisfaction a daily stimulus that led her on to daily effort and in time to some success in circumstance or character which was worth all the patience hope and labor of her life  fanny was just then in the mood to feel the beauty of this for the sincerest emotion she had ever known was beginning to make her dissatisfied with herself and the aimless life she led men must respect such girls as these she thought yes and love them too for in spite of their independence they are womanly i wish i had a talent to live for if it would do as much for me as it does for them it is this sort of thing that is improving polly that makes her society interesting to sydney and herself so dear to every one money cant buy these things for me and i want them very much  as these thoughts were passing through her mind fanny was hearing all sorts of topics discussed with feminine enthusiasm and frankness art morals politics society books religion housekeeping dress and economy for the minds and tongues roved from subject to subject with youthful rapidity and seemed to get something from the dryest and the dullest  how does the new book come on asked polly sucking her orange in public with a composure which would have scandalized the good ladies of cranford  better than it deserves my children beware of popularity it is a delusion and a snare it puffeth up the heart of man and especially of woman it blindeth the eyes to faults it exalteth unduly the humble powers of the victim it is apt to be capricious and just as one gets to liking the taste of this intoxicating draught it suddenly faileth and one is left gasping like a fish out of water and kate emphasized her speech by spearing a sardine with a penknife and eating it with a groan  it wont hurt you much i guess you have worked and waited so long a large dose will do you good said rebecca giving her a generous spoonful of jam as if eager to add as much sweetness as possible to a life that had not been an easy one  when are you and becky going to dissolve partnership asked polly eager for news of all  never george knows he cant have one without the other and has not suggested such a thing as parting us there is always room in my house for becky and she lets me do as she would if she was in my place answered bess with a look which her friend answered by a smile  the lover wont separate this pair of friends you see whispered polly to fan bess is to be married in the spring and becky is to live with her  by the way polly i ve got some tickets for you people are always sending me such things and as i dont care for them i m glad to make them over to you young and giddy infants there are passes for the statuary exhibition becky shall have those here are the concert tickets for you my musical girl and that is for a course of lectures on literature which i ll keep for myself  as kate dealt out the colored cards to the grateful girls fanny took a good look at her wondering if the time would ever come when women could earn a little money and success without paying such a heavy price for them for kate looked sick tired and too early old then her eye went to the unfinished statue and she said impulsively i hope you ll put that in marble and show us what we ought to be  i wish i could and an intense desire shone in rebeccas face as she saw her faulty work and felt how fair her model was  for a minute the five young women sat silent looking up at the beautiful strong figure before them each longing to see it done and each unconscious that she was helping by her individual effort and experience to bring the day when their noblest ideal of womanhood should be embodied in flesh and blood not clay  the city bells rung one and polly started up  i must go for i promised a neighbor of mine a lesson at two  i thought this was a holiday said fanny  so it is but this is a little labor of love and does nt spoil the day at all the child has talent loves music and needs help i cant give her money but i can teach her so i do and she is the most promising pupil i have help one another is part of the religion of our sisterhood fan  i must put you in a story polly i want a heroine and you will do said kate  me why there never was such a humdrum unromantic thing as i am cried polly amazed  i ve booked you nevertheless so in you go but you may add as much romance as you like it s time you did  i m ready for it when it comes but it cant be forced you know and polly blushed and smiled as if some little spice of that delightful thing had stolen into her life for all its prosaic seeming  fanny was amused to see that the girls did not kiss at parting but shook hands in a quiet friendly fashion looking at one another with eyes that said more than the most gushing words  i like your friends very much polly i was afraid i should find them mannish and rough or sentimental and conceited but they are simple sensible creatures full of talent and all sorts of fine things i admire and respect them and want to go again if i may  oh fan i am so glad i hoped you d like them i knew they d do you good and i ll take you any time for you stood the test better than i expected becky asked me to bring you again and she seldom does that for fashionable young ladies let me tell you  i want to be ever so much better and i think you and they might show me how said fanny with a traitorous tremble in her voice  we ll show you the sunny side of poverty and work and that is a useful lesson for any one miss mills says answered polly hoping that fan would learn how much the poor can teach the rich and what helpful friends girls may be to one another     chapter xiv nipped in the bud   on the evening of fans visit polly sat down before her fire with a resolute and thoughtful aspect she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took puttel into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled polly did not soliloquize aloud as heroines on the stage and in books have a way of doing but the conversation she held with herself was very much like this i m afraid there is something in it i ve tried to think it s nothing but vanity or imagination yet i cant help seeing a difference and feeling as if i ought not to pretend that i dont i know it s considered proper for girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how much mischief is done but i dont think it s doing as we d be done by and it seems a great deal more honest to show a man that you dont love him before he has entirely lost his heart the girls laughed at me when i said so and they declared that it would be a very improper thing to do but i ve observed that they dont hesitate to snub ineligible parties as they call poor very young or unpopular men it s all right then but when a nice person comes it s part of the fun to let him go on to the very end whether the girls care for him or not the more proposals the more credit fan says trix always asks when she comes home after the summer excursions how many birds have you bagged as if men were partridges what wicked creatures we are some of us at least i wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays but some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness i m afraid i ve got a spice of it and if i had the chance should be as bad as any of them i ve tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that nights fun  here polly leaned back and looked up at the little mirror over the chimneypiece which was hung so that it reflected the faces of those about the fire in it polly saw a pair of telltale eyes looking out from a tangle of bright brown hair cheeks that flushed and dimpled suddenly as the fresh mouth smiled with an expression of conscious power half proud half ashamed and as pretty to see as the coquettish gesture with which she smoothed back her curls and flourished a white hand for a minute she regarded the pleasant picture while visions of girlish romances and triumphs danced through her head then she shook her hair all over her face and pushed her chair out of range of the mirror saying with a droll mixture of selfreproach and selfapproval in her tone oh puttel puttel what a fool i am  puss appeared to endorse the sentiment by a loud purr and a graceful wave of her tail and polly returned to the subject from which these little vanities had beguiled her  just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes what a stir it would make and what fun it would be to see the faces of the girls when it came out they all think a great deal of him because he is so hard to please and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered if he liked them whether they chose to marry him or not trix has tried for years to fascinate him and he cant bear her and i m so glad what a spiteful thing i am well i cant help it she does aggravate me so and polly gave the cat such a tweak of the ear that puttel bounced out of her lap in high dudgeon  it dont do to think of her and i wont said polly to herself setting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming what an easy life i should have plenty of money quantities of friends all sorts of pleasures and no work no poverty no cold shoulders or patched boots i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that and polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her fancy painted it was a very bright picture but something seemed amiss with it for presently she sighed and shook her head thinking sorrowfully ah but i dont love him and i m afraid i never can as i ought he s very good and generous and wise and would be kind i know but somehow i cant imagine spending my life with him i m so afraid i should get tired of him and then what should i do polly sydney dont sound well and mrs arthur sydney dont seem to fit me a bit wonder how it would seem to call him arthur and polly said it under her breath with a look over her shoulder to be sure no one heard it it s a pretty name but rather too fine and i should nt dare to say syd as his sister does i like short plain homelike names such as will ned or tom no no i can never care for him and it s no use to try the exclamation broke from polly as if a sudden trouble had seized her and laying her head down on her knees she sat motionless for many minutes  when she looked up her face wore an expression which no one had ever seen on it before a look of mingled pain and patience as if some loss had come to her and left the bitterness of regret behind  i wont think of myself or try to mend one mistake by making another she said with a heavy sigh i ll do what i can for fan and not stand between her and a chance of happiness let me see how can i begin i wont walk with him any more i ll dodge and go roundabout ways so that we cant meet i never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence of his always happening home to dinner just as i go to give the roths their lesson the fact is i like to meet him i am glad to be seen with him and put on airs i dare say like a vain goose as i am well i wont do it any more and that will spare fan one affliction poor dear how i must have worried her all this time and never guessed it she has nt been quite as kind as ever but when she got sharp i fancied it was dyspepsia oh me i wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as this  here puss showed an amiable desire to forgive and forget and polly took her up saying aloud puttel when missis abuses you play it s dyspepsia and dont bear malice because it s a very trying disease my dear  then going back to her thoughts she rambled on again if he does nt take that hint i will give him a stronger one for i will not have matters come to a crisis though i cant deny that my wicked vanity strongly tempts me to try and bag a bird just for the excitement and credit of the thing polly i m ashamed of you what would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you i d write and tell her all the worry only it would nt do any good and would only trouble her i ve no right to tell fans secrets and i m ashamed to tell mine no i ll leave mother in peace and fight it out alone i do think fan would suit him excellently by and by he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her love would do so much toward making her what she might be it s a shame to have the chance lost just because he happens to see me i should think she d hate me but i ll show her that she need nt and do all i can to help her for she has been so good to me nothing shall ever make me forget that it is a delicate and dangerous task but i guess i can manage it at any rate i ll try and have nothing to reproach myself with if things do go contrary  what polly thought of as she lay back in her chair with her eyes shut and a hopeless look on her face is none of our business though we might feel a wish to know what caused a tear to gather slowly from time to time under her lashes and roll down on puttels quakercolored coat was it regret for the conquest she relinquished was it sympathy for her friend or was it an uncontrollable overflow of feeling as she read some sad or tender passage of the little romance which she kept hidden away in her own heart  on monday polly began the delicate and dangerous task instead of going to her pupils by way of the park and the pleasant streets adjoining she took a roundabout route through back streets and thus escaped mr sydney who as usual came home to dinner very early that day and looked disappointed because he nowhere saw the bright face in the modest bonnet polly kept this up for a week and by carefully avoiding the shaws house during calling hours she saw nothing of mr sydney who of course did nt visit her at miss mills minnie happened to be poorly that week and took no lesson so uncle syd was deprived of his last hope and looked as if his allowance of sunshine had been suddenly cut off  now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull hardworking days she liked mr sydney very much for he had always been kind and friendly since the early times when he had treated the little girl with a courtesy which the young woman gratefully remembered i dont think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one with most girls he was very like the other young men of his set except perhaps in a certain grace of manner which was as natural to him as his respect for all womankind but with fanny and polly he showed the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom  polly had seen a good deal of him during her visits at the shaws where he was intimate owing to the friendship between madam and his mother but she had never thought of him as a possible lover for either fanny or herself because he was six or eight years older than they and still sometimes assumed the part of a venerable mentor as in the early days lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself she knew he admired her one talent respected her independence and enjoyed her society but when something warmer and more flattering than admiration respect or pleasure crept into his manner she could not help seeing that one of the good gifts of this life was daily coming more and more within her reach and began to ask herself if she could honestly receive the gift and reward the giver  at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they wont be obedient to reason will or even gratitude polly felt a very cordial friendship for mr sydney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to accept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family and forget herself but this false idea of selfsacrifice did not satisfy for she was not a fashionable girl trained to believe that her first duty was to make a good match and never mind the consequences though they rendered her miserable for life pollys creed was very simple if i dont love him i ought not to marry him especially when i do love somebody else though everything is against me if she had read as many french novels as some young ladies she might have considered it interesting to marry under the circumstances and suffer a secret anguish to make her a romantic victim but pollys education had been neglected and after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do in such cases thought she would wait and see  the discovery of fannys secret seemed to show her something to do for if the wait and see decision was making her friend unhappy it must be changed as soon as possible this finished pollys indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old eve in her composition so day after day she trudged through the dull back streets longing for the sunny park the face that always brightened when it saw her coming and most of all the chance of meeting well it was nt trix  when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but could nt resist stopping at the shaws to leave a little parcel for fan though it was calling time as she stepped in meaning to run up for a word if fanny should chance to be alone two hats on the hall table arrested her  who is here katy  only mr sydney and master tom wont you stop a bit miss polly  not this morning i m rather in a hurry and away went polly as if a dozen eager pupils were clamoring for her presence but as the door shut behind her she felt so left out in the cold that her eyes filled and when nep toms great newfoundland came blundering after her she stopped and hugged his shaggy head saying softly as she looked into the brown benevolent eyes full of almost human sympathy now go back old dear you must nt follow me oh nep it s so hard to put love away when you want it very much and it is nt right to take it a foolish little speech to make to a dog but you see polly was only a tenderhearted girl trying to do her duty  since he is safe with fanny i may venture to walk where i like it s such a lovely day all the babies will be out and it always does me good to see them thought polly turning into the wide sunny street where west enddom promenaded at that hour  the babies were out in full force looking as gay and delicate and sweet as the snowdrops hyacinths and daffodils on the banks whence the snow had melted but somehow the babies did nt do polly the good she expected though they smiled at her from their carriages and kissed their chubby hands as she passed them for polly had the sort of face that babies love one tiny creature in blue plush was casting despairing glances after a very small lord of creation who was walking away with a toddling belle in white while a second young gentleman in gorgeous purple gaiters was endeavoring to console the deserted damsel  take hold of master charleys hand miss mamie and walk pretty like willy and flossy said the maid  no no i want to do wid willy and he wont let me do way tarley i dont lite you cried little bluebonnet casting down her ermine muff and sobbing in a microscopic handkerchief the threadlace edging on which could nt mitigate her woe as it might have done that of an older sufferer  willy likes flossy best so stop crying and come right along you naughty child  as poor little dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid and purplegaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause polly said to herself with a smile and a sigh how early the old story begins  it seemed as if the spring weather had brought out all manner of tender things beside fresh grass and the first dandelions for as she went down the street polly kept seeing different phases of the sweet old story which she was trying to forget  at a street corner a blackeyed schoolboy was parting from a rosyfaced schoolgirl whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering  dont you forget now said the boy looking bashfully into the bright eyes that danced with pleasure as the girl blushed and smiled and answered reproachfully why of course i shant  that little romance runs smoothly so far i hope it may to the end said polly heartily as she watched the lad tramp away whistling as blithely as if his pleasurable emotions must find a vent or endanger the buttons on the round jacket while the girl pranced on her own doorstep as if practising for the joyful dance which she had promised not to forget  a little farther on polly passed a newly engaged couple whom she knew walking arm in arm for the first time both wearing that proud yet conscious look which is so delightful to behold upon the countenances of these temporarily glorified beings  how happy they seem oh dear said polly and trudged on wondering if her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible  a glimpse of a motherlylooking lady entering a door received by a flock of pretty children who cast themselves upon mamma and her parcels with cries of rapture did polly good and when a minute after she passed a gray old couple walking placidly together in the sunshine she felt better still and was glad to see such a happy ending to the romance she had read all down the street  as if the mischievous little god wished to take polly at a disadvantage or perhaps to give her another chance just at that instant mr sydney appeared at her side how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her that she had nt the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met  very warm is nt it he said when he had shaken hands and fallen into step just in the old way  you seem to find it so and polly laughed with a sudden sparkle in her eyes she really could nt help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely  have you given up teaching the roths asked sydney changing the subject  no  do you go as usual  yes  well it s a mystery to me how you get there  as much as it is to me how you got here so suddenly  i saw you from the shaws window and took the liberty of running after you by the back street he said laughing  that is the way i get to the roths answered polly she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself  it s not nearly so pleasant or so short for you as the park  i know it but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try new ones  polly did nt say that quite naturally and sydney gave her a quick look as he asked do you get tired of old friends too miss polly  not often but and there she stuck for the fear of being ungrateful or unkind made her almost hope that he would nt take the hint which she had been carefully preparing for him  there was a dreadful little pause which polly broke by saying abruptly how is fan  dashing as ever do you know i m rather disappointed in fanny for she dont seem to improve with her years said sydney as if he accepted the diversion and was glad of it  ah you never see her at her best she puts on that dashing air before people to hide her real self but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mend her faults though she wont own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got  polly spoke heartily now and sydney looked at her as if fannys defender pleased him more than fannys defence  i m very glad to hear it and willingly take your word for it everybody shows you their good side i think and that is why you find the world such a pleasant place  oh but i dont it often seems like a very hard and dismal place and i croak over my trials like an ungrateful raven  cant we make the trials lighter for you  the voice that put the question was so very kind that polly dared not look up because she knew what the eyes were silently saying  thank you no i dont get more tribulation than is good for me i fancy and we are apt to make mistakes when we try to dodge troubles  or people added sydney in a tone that made polly color up to her forehead  how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion  yes it s the pleasantest walk we have dont you think so asked the artful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell  yes indeed it s always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of the country as it were especially at this season  oh polly polly what a stupid speech to make when you had just given him to understand that you were tired of the park not being a fool or a coxcomb sydney put this and that together and taking various trifles into the account he had by this time come to the conclusion that polly had heard the same bits of gossip that he had which linked their names together that she did nt like it and tried to show she did nt in this way he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for pollys sake as well as his own so when she made her last brilliant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i m going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me  annoyed oh no cried polly earnestly then stopped short not knowing what to say for herself she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i ve no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white lie cleverly sydney knew this and liked her for it but he took advantage of it nevertheless by asking suddenly honestly now would nt you go the old way and enjoy it as much as ever if i was nt anywhere about to set the busybodies gossiping  yes said polly before she could stop herself and then could have bitten her tongue out for being so rude another awful pause seemed impending but just at that moment a horseman clattered by with a smile and a salute which caused polly to exclaim oh there s tom with a tone and a look that silenced the words hovering on sydneys lips and caused him to hold out his hand with a look which made pollys heart flutter then and ache with pity for a good while afterward though he only said good by polly  he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence she did not know what else he had read and comforted herself with the thought that he did not care for her very much since he took the first rebuff so quickly  polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all she sighed over the perversity of things in general and croaked a little over her trials in particular but on the whole got over her loss better than she expected for soon she had other sorrows beside her own to comfort and such work does a body more good than floods of regretful tears or hours of sentimental lamentation  she shunned fanny for a day or two but gained nothing by it for that young lady hearing of sydneys sudden departure could not rest till she discovered the cause of it and walked in upon polly one afternoon just when the dusk made it a propitious hour for tender confidences  what have you been doing with yourself lately asked fanny composing herself with her back toward the rapidly waning light  wagging to and fro as usual whats the news with you answered polly feeling that something was coming and rather glad to have it over and done with  nothing particular trix treats tom shamefully and he bears it like a lamb i tell him to break his engagement and not be worried so but he wont because she has been jilted once and he thinks it s such a mean thing to do  perhaps she ll jilt him  i ve no doubt she will if anything better comes along but trix is getting passe and i should nt wonder if she kept him to his word just out of perversity if nothing else  poor tom what a fate said polly with what was meant to be a comical groan but it sounded so tragical that she saw it would nt pass and hastened to hide the failure by saying with a laugh if you call trix passe at twentythree what shall we all be at twentyfive utterly done with and laid upon the shelf i feel so already for i dont get half the attention i used to have and the other night i heard maud and grace wondering why those old girls did nt stay at home and give them a chance  how is maudie  pretty well but she worries me by her queer tastes and notions she loves to go into the kitchen and mess she hates to study and said right before the vincents that she should think it would be great fun to be a beggargirl to go round with a basket it must be so interesting to see what you d get  minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers  by the way when is her uncle coming back asked fanny who could nt wait any longer and joyfully seized the opening polly made for her  i m sure i dont know  nor care i suppose you hardhearted thing  why fan what do you mean  i m not blind my dear neither is tom and when a young gentleman cuts a call abruptly short and races after a young lady and is seen holding her hand at the quietest corner of the park and then goes travelling all of a sudden we know what it means if you dont  who got up that nice idea i should like to know demanded polly as fanny stopped for breath  now dont be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has nt he proposed  no he has nt  dont you think he means to  i dont think he ll ever say a word to me  well i am surprised and fanny drew a long breath as if a load was off her mind then she added in a changed tone but dont you love him polly  no  truly  truly fan  neither spoke for a minute but the heart of one of them beat joyfully and the dusk hid a very happy face  dont you think he cared for you dear asked fanny presently i dont mean to be prying but i really thought he did  that s not for me to say but if it is so it s only a passing fancy and he ll soon get over it  do tell me all about it i m so interested and i know something has happened i hear it in your voice for i cant see your face  do you remember the talk we once had after reading one of miss edgeworths stories about not letting ones lovers come to a declaration if one did nt love them  yes  and you girls said it was nt proper and i said it was honest anyway well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have mind you i dont say mr sydney loved me for he never said so and never will now but i did fancy he rather liked me and might do more if i did nt show him that it was of no use  and you did cried fanny much excited  i just gave him a hint and he took it he meant to go away before that so dont think his heart is broken or mind what silly tattlers say i did nt like his meeting me so much and told him so by going another way he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss i dare say he thought i was a vain goose and laughed at me for my pains like churchill in helen  no he would nt he d like it and respect you for doing it but polly it would have been a grand thing for you  i cant sell myself for an establishment  mercy what an idea  well that s the plain english of half your fashionable matches i m odd you know and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days  ah but you wont you were made for a nice happy home of your own and i hope you ll get it polly dear said fanny warmly feeling so grateful to polly that she found it hard not to pour out all her secret at once  i hope i may but i doubt it answered polly in a tone that made fanny wonder if she too knew what heartache meant  something troubles you polly what is it confide in me as i do in you said fanny tenderly for all the coldness she had tried to hide from polly had melted in the sudden sunshine that had come to her  do you always asked her friend leaning forward with an irresistible desire to win back the oldtime love and confidence too precious to be exchanged for a little brief excitement or the barren honor of bagging a bird to use trixs elegant expression fanny understood it then and threw herself into pollys arms crying with a shower of grateful tears oh my dear my dear did you do it for my sake  and polly held her close saying in that tender voice of hers i did nt mean to let a lover part this pair of friends if i could help it     chapter xv breakers ahead   going into the shaws one evening polly found maud sitting on the stairs with a troubled face  oh polly i m so glad you ve come cried the little girl running to hug her  whats the matter deary  i dont know something dreadful must have happened for mamma and fan are crying together upstairs papa is shut up in the library and tom is raging round like a bear in the diningroom  i guess it is nt anything very bad perhaps mamma is sicker than usual or papa worried about business or tom in some new scrape dont look so frightened maudie but come into the parlor and see what i ve got for you said polly feeling that there was trouble of some sort in the air but trying to cheer the child for her little face was full of a sorrowful anxiety that went to pollys heart  i dont think i can like anything till i know what the matter is answered maud it s something horrid i m sure for when papa came home he went up to mammas room and talked ever so long and mamma cried very loud and when i tried to go in fan would nt let me and she looked scared and strange i wanted to go to papa when he came down but the door was locked and he said not now my little girl and then i sat here waiting to see what would happen and tom came home but when i ran to tell him he said go away and dont bother and just took me by the shoulders and put me out oh dear everything is so queer and horrid i dont know what to do  maud began to cry and polly sat down on the stairs beside her trying to comfort her while her own thoughts were full of a vague fear all at once the diningroom door opened and toms head appeared a single glance showed polly that something was the matter for the care and elegance which usually marked his appearance were entirely wanting his tie was under one ear his hair in a toss the cherished moustache had a neglected air and his face an expression both excited ashamed and distressed even his voice betrayed disturbance for instead of the affable greeting he usually bestowed upon the young lady he seemed to have fallen back into the bluff tone of his boyish days and all he said was hullo polly  how do you do answered polly  i m in a devil of a mess thank you send that chicken up stairs and come in and hear about it he said as if he had been longing to tell some one and welcomed prudent polly as a special providence  go up deary and amuse yourself with this book and these ginger snaps that i made for you there s a good child whispered polly as maud rubbed away her tears and stared at tom with round inquisitive eyes  you ll tell me all about it by and by wont you she whispered preparing to obey  if i may answered polly  maud departed with unexpected docility and polly went into the diningroom where tom was wandering about in a restless way if he had been raging like a bear polly would nt have cared she was so pleased that he wanted her and so glad to be a confidante as she used to be in the happy old days that she would joyfully have faced a much more formidable person than reckless tom  now then what is it she said coming straight to the point  guess  you ve killed your horse racing  worse than that  you are suspended again  worse than that  trix has run away with somebody cried polly with a gasp  worse still  oh tom you have nt horse whipped or shot any one  came pretty near blowing my own brains out but you see i did nt  i cant guess tell me quick  well i m expelled  tom paused on the rug as he gave the answer and looked at polly to see how she took it to his surprise she seemed almost relieved and after a minute silence said soberly that s bad very bad but it might have been worse  it is worse and tom walked away again with a despairing sort of groan  dont knock the chairs about but come and sit down and tell me quietly  cant do it  well go on then are you truly expelled cant it be made up what did you do  it s a true bill this time i just had a row with the chapel watchman and knocked him down if it was a first offence i might have got off but you see i ve had no end of narrow escapes and this was my last chance i ve lost it and now there ll be the dickens to pay i knew it was all up with me so i did nt wait to be turned out but just took myself off  what will your father say  it will come hard on the governor but the worst of it is there tom stopped and stood a minute in the middle of the room with his head down as if he did nt find it easy to tell even kind little polly then out came the truth all in a breath just as he used to bolt out his boyish misdemeanors and then back up against the wall ready to take the consequences  i owe an awful lot of money that the governor dont know about  oh tom how could you  i ve been an extravagant rascal i know it and i m thundering sorry but that dont help a fellow i ve got to tell the dear old buffer and there s where it cuts  at another time polly would have laughed at the contrast between toms face and his language but there was a sincere remorse which made even the dreadful word buffer rather touching than otherwise  he will be very angry i dare say but he ll help you wont he he always does fan says  that s the worst of it you see he s paid up so often that the last time he said his patience could nt stand it nor his pocket either and if i got into any more scrapes of that sort i must get out as i could i meant to be as steady as bunker hill monument but here i am again worse than ever for last quarter i did nt say anything to father he was so bothered by the loss of those ships just then so things have mounted up confoundedly  what have you done with all your money  hanged if i know  cant you pay it anyway  dont see how as i have nt a cent of my own and no way of getting it unless i try gambling  oh mercy no sell your horse cried polly after a minute of deep meditation  i have but he did nt bring half i gave for him i lamed him last winter and the beggar wont get over it  and that did nt pay up the debts  only about a half of em  why tom how much do you owe  i have dodged figuring it up till yesterday then things were so desperate i thought i might as well face the truth so i overhauled my accounts and there s the result  tom threw a blotted crumpled paper into pollys lap and tramped up and down again faster than ever polly took one look at the total and clasped her hands for to her inexperienced eyes it looked appalling  tidy little sum is nt it asked tom who could nt bear the silence or the startled grieved look in pollys eyes  it s awful i dont wonder you dread telling your father  i d rather be shot i say polly suppose we break it to him easy added tom after another turn  how do you mean  why suppose fan or better still you go and sort of pave the way i cant bear to come down on him with the whole truth at once  so you d like to have me go and tell him for you pollys lip curled a little as she said that and she gave tom a look that would have shown him how blue eyes can flash if he had seen it but he was at the window and did nt turn as he said slowly well you see he s so fond of you we all confide in you and you are so like one of the family that it seems quite natural just tell him i m expelled you know and as much more as you like then i ll come in and we ll have it out  polly rose and went to the door without a word in doing so tom caught a glimpse of her face and said hastily dont you think it would be a good plan  no i dont  why not dont you think he d rather have it told him nicely by you than blurted out as i always do blurt things  i know he d rather have his son go to him and tell the truth like a man instead of sending a girl to do what he is afraid to do himself  if polly had suddenly boxed his ears tom could nt have looked more taken aback than by that burst he looked at her excited face seemed to understand the meaning of it and remembered all at once that he was trying to hide behind a girl he turned scarlet said shortly come back polly and walked straight out of the room looking as if going to instant execution for poor tom had been taught to fear his father and had not entirely outgrown the dread  polly sat down looking both satisfied and troubled i hope i did right she said to herself i could nt bear to have him shirk and seem cowardly he is nt only he did nt think how it seemed to me and i dont wonder he was a little afraid mr shaw is so severe with the poor fellow oh dear what should we do if will got into such scrapes thank goodness he s poor and cant i m so glad of that  then she sat silent beside the halfopen door hearing the murmur of toms voice across the hall and hoping with all her heart that he would nt have a very hard time he seemed to tell his story rapidly and steadily without interruption to the end then polly heard mr shaws deeper voice say a few words at which tom uttered a loud exclamation as if taken by surprise polly could nt distinguish a word so she kept her seat wondering anxiously what was going on between the two men a sudden pause seemed to follow toms ejaculation then mr shaw talked a long time in a low earnest tone so different from the angry one polly had expected to hear that it made her nervous for mr shaw usually blew tom up first and forgave him afterward as maud said presently toms voice was heard apparently asking eager questions to which brief replies were given then a dead silence fell upon the room and nothing was heard but the spring rain softly falling out of doors all of a sudden she heard a movement and toms voice say audibly let me bring polly and he appeared looking so pale and miserable that polly was frightened  go and say something to him i cant poor old father if i d only known and to pollys utter dismay tom threw himself into a chair and laid his head down on the table as if he had got a blow that was too much for him  oh tom what is it cried polly hurrying to him full of fears she dared not speak  without looking up tom answered in a smothered voice failed all gone to smash and tomorrow every one will know it  polly held on to the back of toms chair for a minute for the news took her breath away and she felt as if the world was coming to an end failed was such a vaguely dreadful word to her  is it very bad she asked softly feeling as if anything was better than to stand still and see tom so wretched  yes he means to give up everything he s done his best but it cant be staved off any longer and it s all up with him  oh i wish i had a million to give him cried polly clasping her hands with the tears running down her cheeks how does he bear it tom  like a man polly and i m proud of him said tom looking up all red and excited with the emotions he was trying to keep under everything has been against him and he has fought all alone to stand the pressure but it s too much for him and he s given in it s an honorable failure mind you and no one can say a word against him i d like to see em try it and tom clenched his hands as if it would be an immense relief to him to thrash half a dozen aspersers of his fathers honest name  of course they cant this is what poor maud troubled about he had told your mother and fan before you came and that is why they are so unhappy i suppose  they are safe enough father has nt touched mothers money he could nt rob his girls he said and that s all safe for em is nt he a trump polly and toms face shone with pride even while his lips would twitch with a tenderer feeling  if i could only do anything to help cried polly oppressed with her own powerlessness  you can go and be good to him you know how he needs it enough all alone there i cant do it for i m only a curse instead of a comfort to him  how did he take your news asked polly who for a time had forgotten the lesser trouble in the greater  like a lamb for when i d done he only said my poor lad we must bear with one another and then told his story  i m glad he was kind began polly in a soothing tone but tom cried out remorsefully that s what knocks me over just when i ought to be a pride and a prop to him i bring him my debts and disgrace and he never says a word of blame it s no use i cant stand it and toms head went down again with something very like a sob that would come in spite of manful efforts to keep it back for the poor fellow had the warmest heart that ever was and all the fine waistcoats outside could nt spoil it  that sound gave polly more pain than the news of a dozen failures and expulsions and it was as impossible for her to resist putting her hand tenderly on the bent head as it was for her to help noticing with pleasure how brown the little curls were growing and how soft they were in spite of her sorrow she enjoyed that minute very much for she was a born consoler and it is hardly necessary for me to add loved this reprehensible tom with all her heart it was a very foolish thing for her to do she quite agreed to that she could nt understand it explain it or help it she only felt that she did care for him very much in spite of his faults his indifference and his engagement you see she learned to love him one summer when he made them a visit that was before trix caught him and when she heard that piece of news polly could nt unlove him all at once though she tried very hard as was her duty that engagement was such a farce that she never had much faith in it so she put her love away in a corner of her heart and tried to forget it hoping it would either die or have a right to live it did nt make her very miserable because patience work and commonsense lent her a hand and hope would keep popping up its bright face from the bottom of her pandorabox of troubles now and then when any one said trix would nt jilt tom or that tom did care for trix more than he should polly had a pang and thought she could nt possibly bear it but she always found she could and so came to the conclusion that it was a merciful provision of nature that girls hearts could stand so much and their appetites continue good when unrequited love was starving  now she could not help yearning over this faulty wellbeloved scapegrace tom or help thinking with a little thrill of hope if trix only cared for his money she may cast him off now he s lost it but i ll love him all the better because he s poor with this feeling warm at her heart i dont wonder that pollys hand had a soothing effect and that after a heave or two toms shoulders were quiet and certain smothered sniffs suggested that he would be all right again if he could only wipe his eyes without any ones seeing him do it  polly seemed to divine his wish and tucking a little clean handkerchief into one of his halfopen hands she said i m going to your father now and with a farewell smooth so comforting that tom wished she d do it again she went away  as she paused a minute in the hall to steady herself maud called her from above and thinking that the women might need her more than the men she ran up to find fanny waiting for her in her own room  mammas asleep quite worn out poor dear so we can talk in here without troubling her said fanny receiving her friend so quietly that polly was amazed  let me come too i wont make any fuss it s so dreadful to be shut out everywhere and have people crying and talking and locked up and i not know what it means said maud beseechingly  you do know now i ve told her polly said fan as they sat down together and maud perched herself on the bed so that she might retire among the pillows if her feelings were too much for her  i m glad you take it so well dear i was afraid it might upset you said polly seeing now that in spite of her quiet manner fans eyes had an excited look and her cheeks a feverish color  i shall groan and moan by and by i dare say but at first it sort of dazed me and now it begins to excite me i ought to be full of sorrow for poor papa and i am truly sorry but wicked as it may seem it s a fact polly that i m half glad it s happened for it takes me out of myself and gives me something to do  fannys eyes fell and her color rose as she spoke but polly understood why she wanted to forget herself and put her arm round her with a more tender sympathy than fanny guessed  perhaps things are not as bad as they seem i dont know much about such matters but i ve seen people who have failed and they seemed just as comfortable as before said polly  it wont be so with us for papa means to give up everything and not have a word said against him mammas little property is settled upon her and has nt been risked that touched her so much she dreads poverty even more than i do but she begged him to take it if it would help him that pleased him but he said nothing would induce him to do it for it would nt help much and was hardly enough to keep her comfortable  do you know what he means to do asked polly anxiously  he said his plans were not made but he meant to go into the little house that belonged to grandma as soon as he could for it was nt honest for a bankrupt to keep up an establishment like this  i shant mind that at all i like the little house cause it s got a garden and there s a cunning room with a threecornered closet in it that i always wanted if that s all i dont think bankrupting is so very bad said maud taking a cheerful view of things  ah just wait till the carriage goes and the nice clothes and the servants and we have to scratch along as we can you ll change your mind then poor child said fanny whose ideas of failure were decidedly tragical  will they take all my things away cried maud in dismay  i dare say i dont know what we are allowed to keep but not much i fancy and fan looked as if strung up to sacrifice everything she possessed  they shant have my new earrings i ll hide em and my best dress and my gold smelling bottle oh oh oh i think it s mean to take a little girls things away and maud dived among the pillows to smother a wail of anguish at the prospect of being bereft of her treasures  polly soon lured her out again by assurances that she would nt be utterly despoiled and promises to try and soften the hard hearts of her fathers creditors if the earrings and the smellingbottle were attached  i wonder if we shall be able to keep one servant just till we learn how to do the work said fanny looking at her white hands with a sigh  but maud clapped hers and gave a joyful bounce as she cried now i can learn to cook i love so to beat eggs i ll have an apron with a bib to it like pollys and a feather duster and sweep the stairs maybe with my head tied up like katy oh what fun  dont laugh at her or discourage her let her find comfort in bibs and dustpans if she can whispered polly to fan while maud took a joyful header among the pillows and came up smiling and blowzy for she loved housework and often got lectured for stolen visits to the kitchen and surreptitious sweepings and dustings when the coast was clear  mamma is so feeble i shall have to keep house i suppose and you must show me how polly said fan  good practice maam as you ll find out some day answered polly laughing significantly  fanny smiled then grew both grave and sad this changes everything the old set will drop me as we did the mertons when their father failed and my prospects as we say are quite ruined  i dont believe it your real friends wont drop you and you ll find out which the true ones are now i know one friend who will be kinder than ever  oh polly do you think so and fannys eyes softened with sudden tears  i know who she means cried maud always eager to find out things it s herself polly wont mind if we are poor cause she likes beggars  is that who you meant asked fan wistfully  no it s a much better and dearer friend than i am said polly pinching fannys cheek as it reddened prettily under her eyes you ll never guess maud so i would nt try but be planning what you will put in your cunning threecornered closet when you get it  having got rid of miss paulina pry as tom called maud who was immediately absorbed by her cupboard the older girls soberly discussed the sudden change which had come and polly was surprised to see what unexpected strength and sense fanny showed polly was too unconscious of the change which love had made in herself to understand at first the cause of her friends new patience and fortitude but she rejoiced over it and felt that her prophecy would yet be fulfilled presently maud emerged from her new closet bringing a somewhat startling idea with her  do bankrupting men maud liked that new word always have fits  mercy no what put that into your head child cried polly  why mr merton did and i was thinking perhaps papa had got one down there and it kind of frightened me  mr mertons was a bad disgraceful failure and i dont wonder he had a fit ours is nt and papa wont do anything of that sort you may be sure said fanny with as proud an air as if our failure was rather an honor than otherwise  dont you think you and maud had better go down and see him asked polly  perhaps he would nt like it and i dont know what to say either began fan but polly said eagerly i know he would like it never mind what you say just go and show him that you dont doubt or blame him for this but love him all the more and are ready and glad to help him bear the trouble  i m going i aint afraid i ll just hug him and say i m ever so glad we are going to the little house cried maud scrambling off the bed and running down stairs  come with me polly and tell me what to do said fanny drawing her friend after her  you ll know what to do when you see him better than i can tell you answered polly readily yielding for she knew they considered her quite one of the family as tom said  at the study door they found maud whose courage had given out for mr mertons fit rather haunted her polly opened the door and the minute fanny saw her father she did know what to do the fire was low the gas dim and mr shaw was sitting in his easychair his gray head in both his hands looking lonely old and bowed down with care fanny gave polly one look then went and took the gray head in both her arms saying with a tender quiver in her voice father dear we ve come to help you bear it  mr shaw looked up and seeing in his daughters face something that never had been there before put his arm about her and leaned his tired head against her as if when least expected he had found the consolation he most needed in that minute fanny felt with mingled joy and selfreproach what a daughter might be to her father and polly thinking of feeble selfish mrs shaw asleep up stairs saw with sudden clearness what a wife should be to her husband a helpmeet not a burden touched by these unusual demonstrations maud crept quietly to her fathers knee and whispered with a great tear shining on her little pug nose papa we dont mind it much and i m going to help fan keep house for you i d like to do it truly  mr shaws other arm went round the child and for a minute no one said anything for polly had slipped behind his chair that nothing should disturb the three who were learning from misfortune how much they loved one another presently mr shaw steadied himself and asked where is my other daughter where s my polly  she was there at once gave him one of the quiet kisses that had more than usual tenderness in it for she loved to hear him say my other daughter and then she whispered dont you want tom too  of course i do where is the poor fellow  i ll bring him and polly departed with most obliging alacrity  but in the hall she paused a minute to peep into the glass and see if she was all right for somehow she was more anxious to look neat and pretty to tom in his hour of trouble than she had ever been in his prosperous days in lifting her arms to perk up the bow at her throat she knocked a hat off the bracket now a shiny black beaver is not an object exactly calculated to inspire tender or romantic sentiments one would fancy but that particular stove pipe seemed to touch polly to the heart for she caught it up as if its fall suggested a greater one smoothed out a slight dint as if it was symbolical of the hard knocks its owners head was now in danger of receiving and stood looking at it with as much pity and respect as if it had been the crown of a disinherited prince girls will do such foolish little things and though we laugh at them i think we like them the better for it after all  richard was himself again when polly entered for the handkerchief had disappeared his head was erect his face was steady and his whole air had a dogged composure which seemed to say to fate hit away i m ready he did not hear polly come in for he was looking fixedly at the fire with eyes that evidently saw a very different future there from that which it used to show him but when she said tom dear your father wants you he got up at once held out his hand to her saying come too we cant get on without you and took her back into the study with him  then they had a long talk for the family troubles seemed to warm and strengthen the family affection and confidence and as the young people listened while mr shaw told them as much of his business perplexities as they could understand every one of them blamed him or herself for going on so gayly and blindly while the storm was gathering and the poor man was left to meet it all alone now however the thunderclap had come and after the first alarm finding they were not killed they began to discover a certain halfanxious halfpleasant excitement in talking it over encouraging one another and feeling unusually friendly as people do when a sudden shower drives two or three to the shelter of one umbrella  it was a sober talk but not all sad for mr shaw felt inexpressibly comforted by his childrens unexpected sympathy and they trying to take the downfall cheerfully for his sake found it easier to bear themselves they even laughed occasionally for the girls in their ignorance asked queer questions tom made ludicrously unbusinesslike propositions and maud gave them one hearty peal that did a world of good by pensively remarking when the plans for the future had been explained to her i m so relieved for when papa said we must give up everything and mamma called us all beggars i did think i d got to go round asking for cold vittles with a big basket and an old shawl over my head i said once i d like that but i m afraid i should nt for i cant bear indian cake and cold potatoes that s what the poor children always seem to get and i should hate to have grace and the rest see me scuffing round the back gates  my little girl shall never come to that if i can help it said mr shaw holding her close with a look that made maud add as she laid her cheek against his own but i d do it father if you asked me to for i truly want to help  so do i cried fanny wondering at the same minute how it would seem to wear turned silks and clean her gloves  tom said nothing but drew toward him a paper of figures which his father had drawn up and speedily reduced himself to the verge of distraction by trying to understand them in his ardent desire to prove his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel  we shall pull through children so dont borrow trouble only be ready for discomforts and annoyances put your pride in your pockets and remember poverty is nt disgraceful but dishonesty is  polly had always loved kind mr shaw but now she respected him heartily and felt that she had not done him justice when she sometimes thought that he only cared for making money  i should nt wonder if this was a good thing for the whole family though it dont look so mrs shaw will take it the hardest but it may stir her up so she will forget her nerves and be as busy and happy as mother is said polly to herself in a hopeful mood for poverty was an old friend and she had learned long ago not to fear it but to take its bitter and its sweet and make the best of both  when they parted for the night polly slipped away first to leave them free yet could nt help lingering outside to see how tenderly the girls parted from their father tom had nt a word to say for himself for men dont kiss caress or cry when they feel most and all he could do to express his sympathy and penitence was to wring his fathers hand with a face full of respect regret and affection and then bolt up stairs as if the furies were after him as they were in a mild and modern form     chapter xvi a dress parade   the weeks that followed taught the shaws as many other families have been taught how rapidly riches take to themselves wings and fly away when they once begin to go mr shaw carried out his plans with an energy and patience that worked wonders and touched the hearts of his hardest creditors the big house was given up as soon as possible and the little house taken being made comfortable with the furniture madam left there when she went to live with her son the oldfashioned things had been let with the house and now seemed almost like a gift from grandma doubly precious in these troublous times at the auction several persons tried to show the family that though they had lost their fortune friends still remained for one bid in fannys piano and sent it to her another secured certain luxurious articles for mrs shaws comfort and a third saved such of mr shaws books as he valued most for he had kept his word and given up everything with the most punctilious integrity so the little house was not bare but made pleasant to their eyes by these waifs from the wreck brought them by the tide of sympathy and goodwill which soon set in everybody who knew them hastened to call many from a real regard but more from mere curiosity to see how they took it this was one of the hardest things they had to bear and tom used strong language more than once when some fine lady came to condole and went away to gossip pollys hopes of mrs shaw were disappointed for misfortune did not have a bracing effect she took to her bed at once received her friends in tears and a pointlace cap and cheered her family by plaintively inquiring when she was to be taken to the almshouse this was hard for fanny but after an interval of despair she came to the conclusion that under the circumstances it was the best thing her mother could have done and with something of her fathers energy fanny shouldered the new burden feeling that at last necessity had given her what she had long needed something to do  the poor girl knew as much of household affairs as snip but pride and the resolution to stand by father kept up her courage and she worked away with feverish activity at whatever task came first till just as strength and heart were about to fail order began to emerge from chaos and the vision of a home made happy and comfortable by her skill and care came to repay and sustain her  maud being relieved from the fear of backdoor beggary soon became reconciled to bankruptcy thought it rather a good joke on the whole for children like novelty and dont care much for mrs grundy she regarded the new abode as a baby house on a large scale where she was allowed to play her part in the most satisfactory manner from the moment when on taking possession of the coveted room she opened the doors of the threecornered closet and found a little kettle just like pollys standing there she felt that a good time was coming for her and fell to dusting furniture washing cups and making toast the happiest fussiest little housewife in the city for maud inherited the notable gifts of her grandmother and would have made a capital farmers daughter in spite of her city breeding  polly came and went through all these changes faithful helpful and as cheery as she could be when her friends were in trouble the parts seemed reversed now and it was polly who gave fanny who received for where everything seemed strange and new to fan polly was quite at home and every one of the unfashionable domestic accomplishments now came into play to the comfort of the shaws and the great satisfaction of polly she could not do enough to prove her gratitude for former favors and went toiling and moiling about feeling that the hardest most disagreeable tasks were her especial duty in the moving nothing suited her better than to trot up and down lugging heavy things to pound her fingers black and blue nailing carpets and curtains and the day she nearly broke her neck tumbling down the cellar stairs in her eagerness to see that mrs shaws wine was rightly stored she felt that she was only paying her debts and told tom she liked it when he picked her up looking as grimy as a chimneysweep  you can turn your hand to anything you clever girl so do come and give me some advice for i am in the depths of despair said fanny when the maidofallwork as polly called herself found a leisure hour  what is it moths in the furs a smoky chimney or smallpox next door asked polly as they entered fans room where maud was trying on old bonnets before the lookingglass  actually i have nothing to wear began fan impressively i ve been too busy to think or care till now but here it is nearly may and i have hardly a decent rag to my back usually you know i just go to mrs ogrady and tell her what i want she makes my spring wardrobe papa pays the bill and there i am now i ve looked into the matter and i declare to you polly i m frightened to see how much it costs to dress me  not so much as some girls i know said polly encouragingly  perhaps not for i have a conscience and taste is economy sometimes but really polly i have nt the heart to ask papa for a cent just now and yet i must have clothes you are such a genius for planning and working wonders that i throw myself upon you and ask how shall i make a spring wardrobe out of nothing  let me see the nothing before i advise bring out every rag you ve got and we ll see what can be done said polly looking as if she enjoyed the prospect for she had a great deal of that feminine faculty which we call knack and much practice had increased it  fanny brought out her rags and was astonished to see how many she had for chair sofa bed and bureau were covered and still maud who was burrowing in the closets kept crying here s another  there s a discouraging heap of rubbish for you said fan as she added a faded muslin to the last pile  now to me your rubbish looks very encouraging because there is good material there and not much wornout finery that s my detestation for you cant do anything with it let me see five bonnets put the winter ones away till autumn rip up the summer ones and out of three old ones we ll get a pretty new one if my eyes dont deceive me  i ll rip and then do let me see you make a bonnet it must be so interesting said maud whipping out her scissors and eagerly beginning to reduce a shabby little bonnet to its original elements now the dresses continued polly who had rapidly sorted out the piles  will you have the goodness to look at this said fan holding up a gray street suit faded past cure  polly whisked it wrong side out and showing the clean bright fabric said with a triumphant wave behold your new suit fresh trimming and less of it will finish you off as smart as ever  i never wore a turned dress in my life do you suppose people will know it said fan doubtfully  what if they do it wont hurt you not one in a hundred will ever think anything about your dress except that it is pretty i ve worn turned and dyed gowns all my days and it dont seem to have alienated my friends or injured my constitution  that it has nt i m a goose polly and i ll get over the feeling that it s sort of disgraceful to be poor and have to economize we ll turn the gray and i ll wear it bravely  then it will be more becoming than ever oh here s the pretty violet silk that will make a lovely suit cried polly going on with the review  dont see how two draggled skirts and a stained waist can be transformed into a whole rig said fan sitting on the bed with her garments strewn about her in various attitudes of limp despondency  well maam my plan is this began polly imitating mrs ogradys important tone and bad grammar gores is out and plaits is in therefore as the top of this skirt is quite fresh we will take off the ruffles turn it upside down and leave it plain the upper skirt will be made scanter and finished with a frill then the waist can be refreshed with the best parts of these wide flounces and out of those new bits we will concoct a hat the black lace maud has just taken off the green one will do to edge the violet and with your nice silk mantilla you are complete dont you see  i dont quite see it yet but i have firm faith that i shall in time and consider my calling costume finished said fanny getting more and more interested as she saw her condemned wardrobe coming out fresh again under pollys magic knack  there are two then that piqu is all right if you cut the tail off the jacket and change the trimming a bit the muslins only need mending and doing up to look as well as ever you ought not to put them away torn and soiled my child the two black silks will be good standbys for years if i were you i d have a couple of neat pretty prints for homewear and then i dont see why you are nt fixed well enough for our short season  cant i do anything with this barege it s one of my favorite dresses and i hate to give it up  you wore that thoroughly out and it s only fit for the ragbag yes it was very pretty and becoming i remember but its day is over  fanny let the dress lie in her lap a minute as she absently picked at the fringe smiling to herself over the happy time when she wore it last and sydney said she only needed cowslips in her lap to look like spring presently she folded it up and put it away with a sigh but it never went into the ragbag and my sentimental readers can understand what saved it  the ball dresses had better be put nicely away till next year began polly coming to a rainbow colored heap  my day is over i shall never use them again do what you like with them said fan calmly  did you ever sell your castoff finery as many ladies do asked polly  never i dont like the fashion i give it away or let maud have it for tableaux  i wonder if you would mind my telling you something belle proposed  if it s an offer to buy my clothes i should mind answered fanny sharply  then i wont and polly retired behind a cloud of arsenicgreen gauze which made her look as if she had the cholera  if she wanted to buy that horrid new gooseberrycolored gown as tom calls it i d let her have it cheap put in maud who was of a practical turn  does she want it polly asked fan whose curiosity got the better of her pride  well she merely asked me if i thought you d be mortally offended if she offered to take it off your hands as you d never worn it you dont like it and in another season it will be all out of fashion said polly from her verdant retreat  what did you say  i saw she meant it kindly so i said i d ask now between ourselves fan the price of that dress would give you all you ll want for your spring fixings that s one consideration then here s another which may have some weight with you added polly slyly trix told belle she was going to ask you for the dress as you would nt care to wear it now that made belle fire up and say it was a mean thing to do without offering some return for a costly thing like that and then belle said in her blunt way i ll give fan all she paid for it and more too if it will be any help to her i dont care for the dress but i d like to slip a little money into her pocket for i know she needs it and is too good to ask dear mr shaw for anything she can get on without  did she say that i ll give her the dress and not take a penny for it cried fan flushing up with mingled anger toward trix and gratitude to belle  that wont suit her you let me manage it and dont feel any shame or anxiety about it you did many a kind and generous thing for belle when you had the power and you liked to do it now let her pay her debts and have the same pleasure  if she looks at it in that way it makes a difference perhaps i d better the money would be an immense help only i dont quite like to take it  kings and queens sell their jewels when times are hard or they get turned off their thrones and no one thinks it anything amiss so why need you it s just a little transaction between two friends who exchange things they dont want for things which they do and i d do it if i were you  we ll see about it said fan privately resolving to take pollys advice  if i had lots of things like fan i d have an auction and get all i could for them why dont you asked maud beginning on her third bonnet  we will said polly and mounting a chair she put up bid in and knocked down fans entire wardrobe to an imaginary group of friends with such droll imitations of each one that the room rang with laughter  that s enough nonsense now we ll return to business said polly descending breathless but satisfied with the effect of her fun  these white muslins and pretty silks will keep for years so i should lay them by till they are needed it will save buying and you can go to your stock any time and make over what you want that s the way mother does we ve always had things sent us from richer friends and whatever was nt proper for us to wear at the time mother put away to be used when we needed it such funny bundles as we used to have sometimes odd shoes bonnets without crowns stockings without heels or toes and old finery of all sorts we used to rush when a bundle came and sit round while mother opened it the boys always made fun of the things though they were as grateful really as any of us will made a verse one day which we thought pretty well for a little chap to poor country folks who have nt any clothes rich folks to relieve them send old lace gowns and satin bows  i think that will is going to be as nice a poet as mr shakespeare remarked maud in a tone of serious conviction  he is already a milton but i dont believe he will ever be anything but a poet in name said polly working away while she talked  did nt your mother ever let you wear the nice things that came asked maud  no she thought it was nt the thing for a poor ministers girls to go flourishing about in secondhand finery so she did what i m doing now put away what would be useful and proper for us by and by and let us play with the shabby silk bonnets and dirty flounced gowns such fun as we used to have up in our big garret i remember one day we d been playing have a ball and were all rigged up even the boys some new neighbors came to call and expressed a wish to see us having been told that we were pattern children mother called us but we had paraded out into the garden after our ball and were having a concert as we sat about on the cabbages for green satin seats so we did nt hear the call and just as the company was going a great noise arrested them on the doorstep and round the corner of the house rattled ned in full costume wheeling kitty in a barrow while jimmy will and i ran screaming after looking like bedlamites for we were playing that lady fitz perkins had fainted and was being borne home senseless in a cab i thought mother would kill herself with laughing and you can imagine what a fine impression the strangers received of the model children  maud was so tickled with this youthful prank that she unguardedly sat down to laugh on the edge of an open trunk immediately doubled up fell in and was with difficulty extricated  people in the country have great deal nicer times than we do i never rode in a wheelbarrow i never sat on cabbages and i dont think it s fair she said with an injured expression you need nt save any old silk gowns for me i dont mean to be a fine lady when i grow up i m going to be a farmers wife and make butter and cheese and have ten children and raise pigs she added in one enthusiastic burst  i do believe she will if she can find a farmer anywhere said fanny  oh i m going to have will i asked him and he said all right he s going to preach sundays and work on the farm the rest of the time well he is so you need nt laugh for we ve made all our plans said maud with comical dignity as she tried the effect of an old white bonnet wondering if farmers wives could wear ostrich feathers when they went to meeting  blessed innocence dont you wish you were a child and dared tell what you want murmured fanny  i wish i had seen wills face when maud proposed answered polly with a nod which answered her friends speech better than her words  any news of anybody whispered fan affecting to examine a sleeve with care  still at the south dont think late events have been reported yet that accounts for absence answered polly  i think sir philip was hit harder than was supposed said fan  i doubt it but time cures wounds of that sort amazing quick  wish it did  who is sir philip demanded maud pricking up her ears  a famous man who lived in the time of queen elizabeth answered fan with a look at polly  oh and maud seemed satisfied but the sharp child had her suspicions nevertheless  there will be an immense deal of work in all this fixing over and i hate to sew said fanny to divert a certain persons thoughts  jenny and i are going to help we are your debtors as well as belle and demand the privilege of paying up blessings like curses come home to roost fan  mine come home a good deal bigger than they went answered fanny looking pleased that little favors should be so faithfully remembered  the interest on that sort of investment rolls up beautifully you know now rip that dress for jenny to put in order and i ll toss you up a bonnet in less than no time said polly determined to have things go smoothly for she knew fans feelings had been a good deal tried lately in many ways  i must have something to match my dress and blue inside said fanny bringing out her ribbon boxes  anything you like my dear when it comes to bonnets i am usually inspired i have it there we are and nothing could be nicer cried polly making a dive among the silks fan was turning over with a lost expression this bit of silvergray is all i ask here s enough for a killing bonnet and those forgetmenots are both pretty and appropriate  you wretch be still cried fanny as polly looked up at her with a wicked laugh in her eyes  it will be done in time and the dress likewise so look your prettiest and accept my blessing continued polly seeing that fan liked her raillery  time for what asked paulina pry  your wedding dear sweetly answered fan for pollys pleasant hints and predictions put her in a charming humor and even made old clothes of little consequence  maud gave an incredulous sniff and wondered why big girls need to be so dreadful mysterious about their old secrets  this silk reminds me of kittys performance last summer a little checked silk was sent in our spring bundle from mrs davenport and mother said kit might have it if she could make it do so i washed it nicely and we fussed and planned but it came short by half of one sleeve i gave it up but kit went to work and matched every scrap that was left so neatly that she got out the half sleeve put it on the under side and no one was the wiser how many pieces do you think she put in maud  fifty was the wise reply  no only ten but that was pretty well for a fourteenyearold dressmaker you ought to have seen the little witch laugh in her sleeve when any one admired the dress for she wore it all summer and looked as pretty as a pink in it such things are great fun when you get used to them besides contriving sharpens your wits and makes you feel as if you had more hands than most people  i think we ll get a farm near your house i should like to know kitty said maud feeling a curious interest in a girl who made such peculiar patchwork  the dressparade is over and i m ever so much obliged to you polly for helping me through and showing me how to make the best of things i hope in time to have as many hands as you said fan gratefully when the simple bonnet was done and everything planned out ready to be finished  i hope you will soon have two good strong ones beside your own my dear answered polly as she vanished with a parting twinkle that kept fans face bright all day     chapter xvii playing grandmother   i think tom had the hardest time of all for besides the family troubles he had many of his own to perplex and harass him college scrapes were soon forgotten in greater afflictions but there were plenty of tongues to blame that extravagant dog and plenty of heads to wag ominously over prophecies of the good time tom shaw would now make on the road to ruin as reporters flourish in this country of course tom soon heard all the friendly criticisms passed upon him and his career and he suffered more than anybody guessed for the truth that was at the bottom of the gossip filled him with the sharp regret and impotent wrath against himself as well as others which drives many a proud fellow so placed to destruction or the effort that redeems boyish folly and makes a man of him  now that he had lost his heritage tom seemed to see for the first time how goodly it had been how rich in power pleasure and gracious opportunities he felt its worth even while he acknowledged with the sense of justice that is strong in manly men how little he deserved a gift which he had so misused he brooded over this a good deal for like the bat in the fable he did nt seem to find any place in the new life which had begun for all knowing nothing of business he was not of much use to his father though he tried to be and generally ended by feeling that he was a hindrance not a help domestic affairs were equally out of his line and the girls more frank than their father did not hesitate to tell him he was in the way when he offered to lend a hand anywhere after the first excitement was over and he had time to think heart and energy seemed to die out remorse got hold of him and as generous thoughtless natures are apt to do when suddenly confronted with conscience he exaggerated his faults and follies into sins of the deepest dye and fancied he was regarded by others as a villain and an outcast pride and penitence made him shrink out of sight as much as possible for he could not bear pity even when silently expressed by a friendly hand or a kindly eye he stayed at home a good deal and loafed about with a melancholy and neglected air vanished when anyone came talked very little and was either pathetically humble or tragically cross he wanted to do something but nothing seemed to appear and while he waited to get his poise after the downfall he was so very miserable that i m afraid if it had not been for one thing my poor tom would have got desperate and been a failure but when he seemed most useless outcast and forlorn he discovered that one person needed him one person never found him in the way one person always welcomed and clung to him with the strongest affection of a very feeble nature this dependence of his mothers was toms salvation at that crisis of his life and the gossips who said softly to one another over their muffins and tea it really would be a relief to that whole family if poor dear mrs shaw could be ahem mercifully removed did not know that the invalids weak idle hands were unconsciously keeping the son safe in that quiet room where she gave him all that she had to give motherlove till he took heart again and faced the world ready to fight his battles manfully  dear dear how old and bent poor father does look i hope he wont forget to order my sweetbread sighed mrs shaw one day as she watched her husband slowly going down the street  tom who stood by her idly spinning the curtain tassel followed the familiar figure with his eye and seeing how gray the hair had grown how careworn the florid face and how like a weary old man his once strong handsome father walked he was smitten by a new pang of selfreproach and with his usual impetuosity set about repairing the omission as soon as he discovered it  i ll see to your sweetbread mum goodby back to dinner and with a hasty kiss tom was off  he did nt know exactly what he meant to do but it had suddenly come over him that he was hiding from the storm and letting his father meet it alone for the old man went to his office every day with the regularity of a machine that would go its usual round until it stopped while the young man stayed at home with the women and let his mother comfort him  he has a right to be ashamed of me but i act as if i was ashamed of him dare say people think so i ll show them that i aint yes by the powers i will and tom drew on his gloves with the air of a man about to meet and conquer an enemy  have an arm sir if you dont mind i ll walk down with you little commission for mother nice day is nt it  tom rather broke down at the end of his speech for the look of pleased surprise with which his father greeted him the alacrity with which he accepted and leaned on the strong arm offered him proved that the daily walks had been solitary and doubtless sad ones i think mr shaw understood the real meaning of that little act of respect and felt better for the hopeful change it seemed to foretell but he took it quietly and leaving his face to speak for him merely said thanky tom yes mother will enjoy her dinner twice as much if you order it  then they began to talk business with all their might as if they feared that some trace of sentiment might disgrace their masculine dignity but it made no difference whether they discussed lawsuits or love mortgages or mothers the feeling was all right and they knew it so mr shaw walked straighter than usual and tom felt that he was in his proper place again the walk was not without its trials however for while it did toms heart good to see the cordial respect paid to his father it tried his patience sorely to see also inquisitive or disapproving glances fixed upon himself when hats were lifted to his father and to hear the hearty good day mr shaw drop into a cool or careless that s the son it s hard on him wild fellow do him good  granted but you need nt hit a man when he s down muttered tom to himself feeling every moment a stronger desire to do something that should silence everybody i d cut away to australia if it was nt for mother anything anywhere to get out of the way of people who know me i never can right myself here with all the fellows watching and laying wagers whether i sink or swim hang greek and latin wish i d learned a trade and had something to fall back upon have nt a blessed thing now but decent french and my fists wonder if old bell dont want a clerk for the paris branch of the business that would nt be bad faith i ll try it  and when tom had landed his father safely at the office to the great edification of all beholders he screwed up his courage and went to prefer his request feeling that the prospect brightened a little but mr bell was not in a good humor and only gave tom a severe lecture on the error of his ways which sent him home much depressed and caused the horizon to lower again  as he roamed about the house that afternoon trying to calculate how much an australian outfit would cost the sound of lively voices and clattering spoons attracted him to the kitchen there he found polly giving maud lessons in cookery for the new help not being a highpriced article could not be depended on for desserts and mrs shaw would have felt as if the wolf was at the door if there was not a sweet dish at dinner maud had a genius for cooking and fanny hated it so that little person was in her glory studying receipt books and taking lessons whenever polly could give them  gracious me tom dont come now we are awful busy men dont belong in kitchens cried maud as her brother appeared in the doorway  could nt think what you were about mum is asleep and fan out so i loafed down to see if there was any fun afoot said tom lingering as if the prospect was agreeable he was a social fellow and very grateful just then to any one who helped him to forget his worries for a time polly knew this felt that his society would not be a great affliction to herself at least and whispering to maud he wont know she added aloud come in if you like and stir this cake for me it needs a strong hand and mine are tired there put on that apron to keep you tidy sit here and take it easy  i used to help grandma bat up cake and rather liked it if i remember right said tom letting polly tie a checked apron on him put a big bowl into his hands and settle him near the table where maud was picking raisins and she herself stirring busily about among spiceboxes rollingpins and butterpots  you do it beautifully tom i ll give you a conundrum to lighten your labor why are bad boys like cake asked polly anxious to cheer him up  because a good beating makes them better i doubt that myself though answered tom nearly knocking the bottom of the bowl out with his energetic demonstrations for it really was a relief to do something  bright boy here s a plum for you and polly threw a plump raisin into his mouth  put in lots wont you i m rather fond of plumcake observed tom likening himself to hercules with the distaff and finding his employment pleasant if not classical  i always do if i can there s nothing i like better than to shovel in sugar and spice and make nice plummy cake for people it s one of the few things i have a gift for  you ve hit it this time polly you certainly have a gift for putting a good deal of both articles into your own and other peoples lives which is lucky as we all have to eat that sort of cake whether we like it or not observed tom so soberly that polly opened her eyes and maud exclaimed i do believe he s preaching  feel as if i could sometimes continued tom then his eye fell upon the dimples in pollys elbows and he added with a laugh that s more in your line maam cant you give us a sermon  a short one life my brethren is like plumcake began polly impressively folding her floury hands in some the plums are all on the top and we eat them gayly till we suddenly find they are gone in others the plums sink to the bottom and we look for them in vain as we go on and often come to them when it is too late to enjoy them but in the wellmade cake the plums are wisely scattered all through and every mouthful is a pleasure we make our own cakes in a great measure therefore let us look to it my brethren that they are mixed according to the best receipt baked in a well regulated oven and gratefully eaten with a temperate appetite  good good cried tom applauding with the wooden spoon that s a model sermon polly short sweet sensible and not a bit sleepy i m one of your parish and will see that you get your celery punctooal as old deacon morse used to say  thank you brother my wants is few and ravens scurser than they used to be as dear old parson miller used to answer now maud bring on the citron and polly began to put the cake together in what seemed a most careless and chaotic manner while tom and maud watched with absorbing interest till it was safely in the oven  now make your custards dear tom may like to beat the eggs for you it seems to have a good effect upon his constitution  firstrate hand em along and tom smoothed his apron with a cheerful air by the way syds got back i met him yesterday and he treated me like a man and a brother he added as if anxious to contribute to the pleasures of the hour  i m so glad cried polly clapping her hands regardless of the egg she held which dropped and smashed on the floor at her feet careless thing pick it up maud i ll get some more and polly whisked out of the room glad of an excuse to run and tell fan who had just come in lest hearing the news in public she might be startled out of the wellbred composure with which young ladies are expected to receive tidings even of the most vital importance  you know all about history dont you asked maud suddenly  not quite modestly answered tom  i just want to know if there really was a man named sir philip in the time of queen elizabeth  you mean sir philip sidney yes he lived then and a fine old fellow he was too  there i knew the girls did nt mean him cried maud with a chop that sent the citron flying  what mischief are you up to now you little magpie  i shant tell you what they said because i dont remember much of it but i heard polly and fan talking about some one dreadful mysterious and when i asked who it was fan saidsir philip ho she need nt think i believe it i saw em laugh and blush and poke one another and i knew it was nt about any old queen elizabeth man cried maud turning up her nose as far as that somewhat limited feature would go  look here you are letting cats out of the bag never mind i thought so they dont tell us their secrets but we are so sharp we cant help finding them out can we said tom looking so much interested that maud could nt resist airing her knowledge a little  well i dare say it is nt proper for you to know but i am old enough now to be told anything and those girls better mind what they say for i m not a stupid chit like blanche i just wish you could have heard them go on i m sure there s something very nice about mr sydney they looked so pleased when they whispered and giggled on the bed and thought i was ripping bonnets and did nt hear a word  which looked most pleased asked tom investigating the kitchen boiler with deep interest  well pears to me polly did she talked most and looked funny and very happy all the time fan laughed a good deal but i guess polly is the loveress replied maud after a moments reflection  hold your tongue she s coming and tom began to pump as if the house was on fire  down came polly with heightened color bright eyes and not a single egg tom took a quick look at her over his shoulder and paused as if the fire was suddenly extinguished something in his face made polly feel a little guilty so she fell to grating nutmeg with a vigor which made red cheeks the most natural thing in life maud the traitor sat demurely at work looking very like what tom had called her a magpie with mischief in its head polly felt a change in the atmosphere but merely thought tom was tired so she graciously dismissed him with a stick of cinnamon as she had nothing else just then to lay upon the shrine fans got the books and maps you wanted go and rest now i m much obliged here s your wages bridget  good luck to your messes answered tom as he walked away meditatively crunching his cinnamon and looking as if he did not find it as spicy as usual he got his books but did not read them for shutting himself up in the little room called toms den he just sat down and brooded  when he came down to breakfast the next morning he was greeted with a general happy birthday tom and at his place lay gifts from every member of the family not as costly as formerly perhaps but infinitely dearer as tokens of the love that had outlived the change and only grown the warmer for the test of misfortune in his present state of mind tom felt as if he did not deserve a blessed thing so when every one exerted themselves to make it a happy day for him he understood what it means to be nearly killed with kindness and sternly resolved to be an honor to his family or perish in the attempt evening brought polly to what she called a festive tea and when they gathered round the table another gift appeared which though not of a sentimental nature touched tom more than all the rest it was a most delectable cake with a nosegay atop and round it on the snowy frosting there ran a pink inscription just as it had been every year since tom could remember  name age and date like a nice white tombstone observed maud complacently at which funereal remark mrs shaw who was down in honor of the day dropped her napkin and demanded her salts  whose doing is that asked tom surveying the gift with satisfaction for it recalled the happier birthdays which seemed very far away now  i did nt know what to give you for you ve got everything a man wants and i was in despair till i remembered that dear grandma always made you a little cake like that and that you once said it would nt be a happy birthday without it so i tried to make it just like hers and i do hope it will prove a good sweet plummy one  thank you was all tom said as he smiled at the giver but polly knew that her present had pleased him more than the most elegant trifle she could have made  it ought to be good for you beat it up yourself tom cried maud it was so funny to see you working away and never guessing who the cake was for i perfectly trembled every time you opened your mouth for fear you d ask some question about it that was the reason polly preached and i kept talking when she was gone  very stupid of me but i forgot all about today suppose we cut it i dont seem to care for anything else said tom feeling no appetite but bound to do justice to that cake if he fell a victim to his gratitude  i hope the plums wont all be at the bottom said polly as she rose to do the honors of the cake by universal appointment  i ve had a good many at the top already you know answered tom watching the operation with as much interest as if he had faith in the omen  cutting carefully slice after slice fell apart each firm and dark spicy and rich under the frosty rime above and laying a specially large piece in one of grandmas quaint little china plates polly added the flowers and handed it to tom with a look that said a good deal for seeing that he remembered her sermon she was glad to find that her allegory held good in one sense at least toms face brightened as he took it and after an inspection which amused the others very much he looked up saying with an air of relief plums all through i m glad i had a hand in it but polly deserves the credit and must wear the posy and turning to her he put the rose into her hair with more gallantry than taste for a thorn pricked her head the leaves tickled her ear and the flower was upside down  fanny laughed at his want of skill but polly would nt have it altered and everybody fell to eating cake as if indigestion was one of the lost arts they had a lively tea and were getting on famously afterward when two letters were brought for tom who glanced at one and retired rather precipitately to his den leaving maud consumed with curiosity and the older girls slightly excited for fan thought she recognized the handwriting on one and polly on the other  one half an hour and then another elapsed and tom did not return mr shaw went out mrs shaw retired to her room escorted by maud and the two girls sat together wondering if anything dreadful had happened all of a sudden a voice called polly and that young lady started out of her chair as if the sound had been a thunderclap  do run i m perfectly fainting to know what the matter is said fan  you d better go began polly wishing to obey yet feeling a little shy  he dont want me besides i could nt say a word for myself if that letter was from sydney cried fanny hustling her friend towards the door in a great flutter  polly went without another word but she wore a curiously anxious look and stopped on the threshold of the den as if a little afraid of its occupant tom was sitting in his favorite attitude astride of a chair with his arms folded and his chin on the top rail not an elegant posture but the only one in which he said he could think well  did you want me tom  yes come in please and dont look scared i only want to show you a present i ve had and ask your advice about accepting it  why tom you look as if you had been knocked down exclaimed polly forgetting all about herself as she saw his face when he rose and turned to meet her  i have regularly floored but i m up again and steadier than ever just you read that and tell me what you think of it  tom snatched a letter off the table put it into her hands and began to walk up and down the little room like a veritable bear in its cage as polly read that short note all the color went out of her face and her eyes began to kindle when she came to the end she stood a minute as if too indignant to speak then gave the paper a nervous sort of crumple and dropped it on the floor saying all in one breath i think she is a mercenary heartless ungrateful girl that s what i think  oh the deuce i did nt mean to show that one it s the other and tom took up a second paper looking half angry half ashamed at his own mistake i dont care though every one will know tomorrow and perhaps you ll be good enough to keep the girls from bothering me with questions and gabble he added as if on second thoughts he was relieved to have the communication made to polly first  i dont wonder you looked upset if the other letter is as bad i d better have a chair before i read it said polly feeling that she began to tremble with excitement  it s a million times better but it knocked me worse than the other kindness always does tom stopped short there and stood a minute turning the letter about in his hand as if it contained a sweet which neutralized the bitter in that smaller note and touched him very much then he drew up an armchair and beckoning polly to take it said in a sober steady tone that surprised her greatly whenever i was in a quandary i used to go and consult grandma and she always had something sensible or comfortable to say to me she s gone now but somehow polly you seem to take her place would you mind sitting in her chair and letting me tell you two or three things as will does  mind it polly felt that tom had paid her the highest and most beautiful compliment he could have devised she had often longed to do it for being brought up in the most affectionate and frank relations with her brothers she had early learned what it takes most women some time to discover that sex does not make nearly as much difference in hearts and souls as we fancy joy and sorrow love and fear life and death bring so many of the same needs to all that the wonder is we do not understand each other better but wait till times of tribulation teach us that human nature is very much the same in men and women thanks to this knowledge polly understood tom in a way that surprised and won him she knew that he wanted womanly sympathy and that she could give it to him because she was not afraid to stretch her hand across the barrier which our artificial education puts between boys and girls and to say to him in all good faith if i can help you let me  ten minutes sooner polly could have done this almost as easily to tom as to will but in that ten minutes something had happened which made this difficult reading that trix had given tom back his freedom changed many things to polly and caused her to shrink from his confidence because she felt as if it would be harder now to keep self out of sight for spite of maiden modesty love and hope would wake and sing at the good news slowly she sat down and hesitatingly she said with her eyes on the ground and a very humble voice i ll do my best but i cant fill grandmas place or give you any wise good advice i wish i could  you ll do it better than any one else talk troubles mother father has enough to think of without any of my worries fan is a good soul but she is nt practical and we always get into a snarl if we try to work together so who have i but my other sister polly the pleasure that letter will give you may make up for my boring you  as he spoke tom laid the other paper in her lap and went off to the window as if to leave her free to enjoy it unseen but he could not help a glance now and then and as pollys face brightened his own fell  oh tom that s a birthday present worth having for it s so beautifully given i dont see how you can refuse it arthur sydney is a real nobleman cried polly looking up at last with her fact glowing and her eyes full of delight  so he is i dont know another man living except father who would have done such a thing or who i could bring myself to take it from do you see he s not only paid the confounded debts but has done it in my name to spare me all he could  i see it s like him and i think he must be very happy to be able to do such a thing  it is an immense weight off my shoulders for some of those men could nt afford to wait till i d begged borrowed or earned the money sydney can wait but he wont long if i know myself you wont take it as a gift then  would you  no  then dont think i will i m a pretty poor affair polly but i m not mean enough to do that while i ve got a conscience and a pair of hands  a rough speech but it pleased polly better than the smoothest tom had ever made in her hearing for something in his face and voice told her that the friendly act had roused a nobler sentiment than gratitude making the cancelled obligations of the boy debts of honor to the man  what will you do tom  i ll tell you may i sit here and tom took the low footstool that always stood near grandmas old chair i ve had so many plans in my head lately that sometimes it seems as if it would split continued the poor fellow rubbing his tired forehead as if to polish up his wits i ve thought seriously of going to california australia or some outoftheway place where men get rich in a hurry  oh no cried polly putting out her hand as it to keep him and then snatching it back again before he could turn round  it would be hard on mother and the girls i suppose besides i dont quite like it myself looks as if i shirked and ran away  so it does said polly decidedly  well you see i dont seem to find anything to do unless i turn clerk and i dont think that would suit the fact is i could nt stand it here where i m known it would be easier to scratch gravel on a railroad with a gang of paddies than to sell pins to my friends and neighbors false pride i dare say but it s the truth and there s no use in dodging  not a bit and i quite agree with you  that s comfortable now i m coming to the point where i specially want your advice polly yesterday i heard you telling fan about your brother ned how well he got on how he liked his business and wanted will to come and take some place near him you thought i was reading but i heard and it struck me that perhaps i could get a chance out west somewhere what do you think  if you really mean work i know you could answered polly quickly as all sorts of plans and projects went sweeping through her mind i wish you could be with ned you d get on together i m sure and he d be so glad to do anything he could i ll write and ask straight away if you want me to  suppose you do just for information you know then i shall have something to go upon i want to have a feasible plan all ready before i speak to father there s nothing so convincing to business men as facts you know  polly could not help smiling at toms new tone it seemed so strange to hear him talking about anything but horses and tailors dancing and girls she liked it however as much as she did the sober expression of his face and the way he had lately of swinging his arms about as if he wanted to do something energetic with them  that will be wise do you think your father will like this plan  pretty sure he will yesterday when i told him i must go at something right off he said anything honest tom and dont forget that your father began the world as a shopboy you knew that did nt you  yes he told me the story once and i always liked to hear it because it was pleasant to see how well he had succeeded  i never did like the story a little bit ashamed i m afraid but when we talked it over last night it struck me in a new light and i understood why father took the failure so well and seems so contented with this poorish place it is only beginning again he says and having worked his way up once he feels as if he could again i declare to you polly that sort of confidence in himself and energy and courage in a man of his years makes me love and respect the dear old gentleman as i never did before  i m so glad to hear you say that tom i ve sometimes thought you did nt quite appreciate your father any more than he knew how much of a man you were  never was till today you know said tom laughing yet looking as if he felt the dignity of his one and twenty years odd is nt it how people live together ever so long and dont seem to find one another out till something comes to do it for them perhaps this smashup was sent to introduce me to my own father  there s philosophy for you said polly smiling even while she felt as if adversity was going to do more for tom than years of prosperity  they both sat quiet for a minute polly in the big chair looking at him with a new respect in her eyes tom on the stool near by slowly tearing up a folded paper he had absently taken from the floor while he talked  did this surprise you he asked as a little white shower fluttered from his hands  no  well it did me for you know as soon as we came to grief i offered to release trix from the engagement and she would nt let me continued tom as if having begun the subject he wished to explain it thoroughly  that surprised me said polly  so it did me for fan always insisted it was the money and not the man she cared for her first answer pleased me very much for i did not expect it and nothing touches a fellow more than to have a woman stand by him through thick and thin  she dont seem to have done it  fan was right trix only waited to see how bad things really were or rather her mother did she s as cool hard and worldly minded an old soul as i ever saw and trix is bound to obey she gets round it very neatly in her note i wont be a burden will sacrifice her hopes and always remain my warm friend but the truth is tom shaw rich was worth making much of but tom shaw poor is in the way and may go to the devil as fast as he likes  well he is nt going cried polly defiantly for her wrath burned hotly against trix though she blessed her for setting the bondman free  came within an ace of it muttered tom to himself adding aloud in a tone of calm resignation that assured polly his heart would not be broken though his engagement was it never rains but it pours specially in hard times but when a man is down a rap or two more dont matter much i suppose it s the first blow that hurts most  glad to see you take the last blow so well there was an ironical little twang to that speech and polly could nt help it tom colored up and looked hurt for a minute then seemed to right himself with a shrug and said in his outspoken way to tell the honest truth polly it was not a very hard one i ve had a feeling for some time that trix and i were not suited to one another and it might be wiser to stop short but she did not or would not see it and i was not going to back out and leave her to wear any more willows so here we are i dont bear malice but hope she ll do better and not be disappointed again upon my word i do  that s very good of you quite sydneyesque and noble said polly feeling rather ill at ease and wishing she could hide herself behind a cap and spectacles if she was to play grandma to this confiding youth  it will be all plain sailing for syd i fancy observed tom getting up as if the little cricket suddenly ceased to be comfortable  i hope so murmured polly wondering what was coming next  he deserves the very best of everything and i pray the lord he may get it added tom poking the fire in a destructive manner  polly made no answer fearing to pay too much for she knew fan had made no confidant of tom and she guarded her friends secret as jealously as her own you ll write to ned tomorrow will you i ll take anything he s got for i want to be off said tom casting down the poker and turning round with a resolute air which was lost on polly who sat twirling the rose that had fallen into her lap  i ll write tonight would you like me to tell the girls about trix and sydney she asked as she rose feeling that the council was over  i wish you would i dont know how to thank you for all you ve done for me i wish to heaven i did said tom holding out his hand with a look that polly thought a great deal too grateful for the little she had done  as she gave him her hand and looked up at him with those confiding eyes of hers toms gratitude seemed to fly to his head for without the slightest warning he stooped down and kissed her a proceeding which startled polly so that he recovered himself at once and retreated into his den with the incoherent apology i beg pardon could nt help it grandma always let me on my birthday  while polly took refuge up stairs forgetting all about fan as she sat in the dark with her face hidden wondering why she was nt very angry and resolving never again to indulge in the delightful but dangerous pastime of playing grandmother     chapter xviii the woman who did not dare   polly wrote enthusiastically ned answered satisfactorily and after much corresponding talking and planning it was decided that tom should go west never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him  of course there was much lamentation among the women but every one felt it was the best thing for him so while they sighed they sewed packed visions of a brilliant future away with his new pocket handkerchiefs and rejoiced that the way was open before him even in the act of bedewing his boots with tears sydney stood by him to the last like a man and a brother which expression of toms gave fanny infinite satisfaction and will felt entirely consoled for neds disappointment at his refusal to go and join him since tom was to take the place ned had kept for him  fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts but in spite of the silence the work and the hurry i think they came to know one another better in that busy little space of time than in all the years that had gone before for the best and bravest in each was up and stirring and the small house was as full of the magnetism of love and friendship selfsacrifice and enthusiasm as the world outside was full of spring sunshine and enchantment pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the partings that must be  tom was off to the west polly went home for the summer maud was taken to the seaside with belle and fanny left alone to wrestle with housekeeping help and heartache if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear fanny forwarded her bits of news to polly polly sent back all the extracts from neds letters concerning tom and by putting the two reports together they gained the comfortable assurance that tom was well in good spirits hard at work and intent on coming out strong in spite of all obstacles  polly had a quiet summer at home resting and getting ready in mind and body for another winters work for in the autumn she tried her plan again to the satisfaction of her pupils and the great joy of her friends she never said much of herself in her letters and fannys first exclamation when they met again was an anxious why polly dear have you been sick and never told me  no i m only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a trifle blue i shall soon brighten up when i get to my work again answered polly bustling about to put away her things  you dont look a bit natural what have you been doing to your precious little self persisted fanny troubled by the change yet finding it hard to say wherein it lay  polly did not look sick though her cheeks were thinner and her color paler than formerly but she seemed spiritless and there was a tired look in her eyes that went to fannys heart  i m all right enough as you ll see when i m in order i m proper glad to find you looking so well and happy does all go smoothly fan asked polly beginning to brush her hair industriously  answer me one question first said fanny looking as if a sudden fear had come over her tell me truly have you never repented of your hint to sydney  never cried polly throwing back the brown veil behind which she had half hidden her face at first  on your honor as an honest girl  on my honor as anything you please why do you suspect me of it demanded polly almost angrily  because something is wrong with you it s no use to deny it for you ve got the look i used to see in that very glass on my own face when i thought he cared for you forgive me polly but i cant help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can  fannys face was full of agitation and she spoke fast and frankly for she was trying to be generous and found it very hard polly understood now and put her fear at rest by saying almost passionately i tell you i dont love him if he was the only man in the world i would nt marry him because i dont want to  the last three words were added in a different tone for polly had checked herself there with a halffrightened look and turned away to hide her face behind her hair again  then if it s not him it s some one else you ve got a secret polly and i should think you might tell it as you know mine said fanny unable to rest till everything was told for pollys manner troubled her  there was no answer to her question but she was satisfied and putting her arm round her friend she said in her most persuasive tone my precious polly do i know him  you have seen him  and is he very wise good and splendid dear  no  he ought to be if you love him i hope he is nt bad cried fan anxiously still holding polly who kept her head obstinately turned  i m suited that s enough  oh please just tell me one thing more dont he love back again  no now dont say another word i cant bear it and polly drew herself away as she spoke in a desperate sort of tone  i wont but now i m not afraid to tell you that i think i hope i do believe that sydney cares a little for me he s been very kind to us all and lately he has seemed to like to see me always when he comes and miss me if i m gone i did nt dare to hope anything till papa observed something in his manner and teased me about it i try not to deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me  thank heaven for that cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice now come and tell me all about it she added sitting down on the couch with the air of one who has escaped a great peril  i ve got some notes and things i want to ask your opinion about if they really mean anything you know said fanny getting out a bundle of papers from the inmost recesses of her desk there s a photograph of tom came in his last letter good is nt it he looks older but that s the beard and the rough coat i suppose dear old fellow he is doing so well i really begin to feel quite proud of him  fan tossed her the photograph and went on rummaging for a certain note she did not see polly catch up the picture and look at it with hungry eyes but she did hear something in the low tone in which polly said it dont do him justice and glancing over her shoulder fans quick eye caught a glimpse of the truth though polly was half turned away from her without stopping to think fan dropped her letters took polly by the shoulders and cried in a tone full of astonishment polly is it tom  poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say none were needed her telltale face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hunters are after it  oh polly i am so glad i never thought of it you are so good and he s such a wild boy i cant believe it but it is so dear of you to care for him  could nt help it tried not to but it was so hard you know fan you know said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion which tom had once condemned  the last words and the appealing hand outstretched to her told fanny the secret of her friends tender sympathy for her own love troubles and seemed so pathetic that she took polly in her arms and cried over her in the fond foolish way girls have of doing when their hearts are full and tears can say more than tongues the silence never lasts long however for the feminine desire to talk it over usually gets the better of the deepest emotion so presently the girls were hard at it polly very humble and downcast fanny excited and overflowing with curiosity and delight  really my sister you dear thing how heavenly that will be she cried  it never will be answered polly in a tone of calm despair  what will prevent it  maria bailey was the tragic reply  what do you mean is she the western girl she shant have tom i ll kill her first  too late let me tell you is that door shut and maud safe  fanny reconnoitered and returning listened breathlessly while polly poured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul  has nt he mentioned maria in his letters  once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation he cant have time for much of that fun he s so busy  ned writes good gossipy letters i taught him how and he tells me all that s going on when he d spoken of this girl several times they board with her mother you know i asked about her quite carelessly and he told me she was pretty good and well educated and he thought tom was rather smitten that was a blow for you see fan since trix broke the engagement and it was nt wrong to think of tom i let myself hope just a little and was so happy now i must give it up and now i see how much i hoped and what a dreadful loss it s going to be  two great tears rolled down pollys cheeks and fanny wiped them away feeling an intense desire to go west by the next train wither maria bailey with a single look and bring tom back as a gift to polly  it was so stupid of me not to guess before but you see tom always seems so like a boy and you are more womanly for your age than any girl i know so i never thought of your caring for him in that way i knew you were very good to him you are to every one my precious and i knew that he was fond of you as he is of me fonder if anything because he thinks you are perfect but still i never dreamed of his loving you as more than a dear friend  he does nt sighed polly  well he ought and if i could get hold of him he should  polly clutched fan at that and held her tight saying sternly if you ever breathe a word drop a hint look a look that will tell him or any one else about me i ll yes as sure as my name is mary milton i ll proclaim from the housetops that you like ar polly got no further for fans hand was on her mouth and fans alarmed voice vehemently protested i wont i promise solemnly i ll never say a word to a mortal creature dont be so fierce polly you quite frighten me  it s bad enough to love some one who dont love you but to have them told of it is perfectly awful it makes me wild just to think of it oh fan i m getting so illtempered and envious and wicked i dont know what will happen to me  i m not afraid for you my dear and i do believe things will go right because you are so good to every one how tom could help adoring you i dont see i know he would if he had stayed at home longer after he got rid of trix it would be the making of him but though he is my brother i dont think he s good enough for you polly and i dont quite see how you can care for him so much when you might have had a person so infinitely superior  i dont want a superior person he d tire me if he was like a s besides i do think tom is superior to him in many things well you need nt stare i know he is or will be he s so different and very young and has lots of faults i know but i like him all the better for it and he s honest and brave and has got a big warm heart and i d rather have him care for me than the wisest best most accomplished man in the world simply because i love him  if tom could only have seen pollys face when she said that it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of pollys loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry she had thought her love for sydney very romantic because she did not really care whether he was rich or poor though she never dared to say so even to polly for fear of being laughed at she began to see now what true love was and to feel that the sentiment which she could not conquer was a treasure to be accepted with reverence and cherished with devotion  i dont know when i began to love tom but i found out that i did last winter and was as much surprised as you are continued polly as if glad to unburden her heart i did nt approve of him at all i thought he was extravagant reckless and dandified i was very much disappointed when he chose trix and the more i thought and saw of it the worse i felt for tom was too good for her and i hated to see her do so little for him when she might have done so much because he is one of the men who can be led by their affections and the woman he marries can make or mar him  that s true cried fan as polly paused to look at the picture which appeared to regard her with a grave steady look which seemed rather to belie her assertions  i dont mean that he s weak or bad if he was i should hate him but he does need some one to love him very much and make him happy as a good woman best knows how said polly as if answering the mute language of toms face  i hope maria bailey is all he thinks her she added softly for i could nt bear to have him disappointed again  i dare say he dont care a fig for her and you are only borrowing trouble what do you say ned answered when you asked about this inconvenient girl said fanny turning hopeful all at once  polly repeated it and added i asked him in another letter if he did nt admire miss b as much as tom and he wrote back that she was a nice girl but he had no time for nonsense and i need nt get my white kids ready for some years yet unless to dance at toms wedding since then he has nt mentioned maria so i was sure there was something serious going on and being in toms confidence he kept quiet  it does look bad suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if there is anything to tell i m willing but you must let me see the letter i cant trust you not to hint or say too much  you shall i ll keep my promise in spite of everything but it will be hard to see things going wrong when a word would set it right  you know what will happen if you do and polly looked so threatening that fan trembled before her discovering that the gentlest girls when roused are more impressive than any shrew for even turtle doves peck gallantly to defend their nests  if it is true about maria what shall we do said fanny after a pause  bear it people always do bear things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her  but if it is nt cried fan unable to endure the sight  then i shall wait and pollys face changed so beautifully that fan hugged her on the spot fervently wishing that maria bailey never had been born  then the conversation turned to lover number two and after a long confabulation polly gave it as her firm belief that a s had forgotten m m and was rapidly finding consolation in the regard of f s with this satisfactory decision the council ended after the ratification of a loyal league by which the friends pledged themselves to stand staunchly by one another through the trials of the coming year  it was a very different winter from the last for both the girls fanny applied herself to her duties with redoubled ardor for a s was a domestic man and admired housewifely accomplishments if fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mr sydney at least for he was more the housefriend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him  fanny had been afraid that pollys return might endanger her hopes but sydney met polly with the old friendliness and very soon convinced her that the nipping in the bud process had been effectual for being taken early the sprouting affection had died easy and left room for an older friendship to blossom into a happier love  fanny seemed glad of this and polly soon set her heart at rest by proving that she had no wish to try her power she kept much at home when the days work was done finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming over book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shaws  fan dont need me and sydney dont care whether i come or not so i ll keep out of the way she would say as if to excuse her seeming indolence  polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most will got very anxious she was so quiet pale and spiritless and distracted poor polly by his affectionate stupidity till she completed his bewilderment by getting cross and scolding him so he consoled himself with maud who now being in her teens assumed dignified airs and ordered him about in a style that afforded him continued amusement and employment  western news continued vague for fans general inquiries produced only provokingly unsatisfactory replies from tom who sang the praises of the beautiful miss bailey and professed to be consumed by a hopeless passion for somebody in such halfcomic halftragic terms that the girls could not decide whether it was all that boys mischief or only a cloak to hide the dreadful truth  we ll have it out of him when he comes home in the spring said fanny to polly as they compared the letters of their brothers and agreed that men were the most uncommunicative and provoking animals under the sun for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole bailey question and left them in utter darkness  hunger of any sort is a hard thing to bear especially when the sufferer has a youthful appetite and polly was kept on such a short allowance of happiness for six months that she got quite thin and interesting and often when she saw how big her eyes were getting and how plainly the veins on her temples showed indulged the pensive thought that perhaps spring dandelions might blossom oer her grave she had no intention of dying till toms visit was over however and as the time drew near she went through such alternations of hope and fear and lived in such a state of feverish excitement that spirits and color came back and she saw that the interesting pallor she had counted on would be an entire failure  may came at last and with it a burst of sunshine which cheered even poor pollys muchenduring heart fanny came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them  prepare yourself somebody is engaged she said in a solemn tone that made polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow no dont look like that my poor dear it is nt tom it s i  of course there was a rapture followed by one of the deliciously confidential talks which bosom friends enjoy interspersed with tears and kisses smiles and sighs  oh polly though i ve waited and hoped so long i could nt believe it when it came and dont deserve it but i will for the knowledge that he loves me seems to make everything possible said fanny with an expression which made her really beautiful for the first time in her life  you happy girl sighed polly then smiled and added i think you deserve all that s come to you for you have truly tried to be worthy of it and whether it ever came or not that would have been a thing to be proud of  he says that is what made him love me answered fanny never calling her lover by his name but making the little personal pronoun a very sweet word by the tone in which she uttered it he was disappointed in me last year he told me but you said good things about me and though he did nt care much then yet when he lost you and came back to me he found that you were not altogether mistaken and he has watched me all this winter learning to respect and love me better every day oh polly when he said that i could nt bear it because in spite of all my trying i m still so weak and poor and silly  we dont think so and i know you ll be all he hopes to find you for he s just the husband you ought to have  thank you all the more then for not keeping him yourself said fanny laughing the old blithe laugh again  that was only a slight aberration of his he knew better all the time it was your white cloak and my idiotic behavior the night we went to the opera that put the idea into his head said polly feeling as if the events of that evening had happened some twenty years ago when she was a giddy young thing fond of gay bonnets and girlish pranks  i m not going to tell tom a word about it but keep it for a surprise till he comes he will be here next week and then we ll have a grand clearing up of mysteries said fan evidently feeling that the millennium was at hand  perhaps said polly as her heart fluttered and then sunk for this was a case where she could do nothing but hope and keep her hands busy with wills new set of shirts  there is a good deal more of this sort of silent suffering than the world suspects for the women who dare are few the women who stand and wait are many but if workbaskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read for women often sew the tragedy or comedy of life into their work as they sit apparently safe and serene at home yet are thinking deeply living whole hearthistories and praying fervent prayers while they embroider pretty trifles or do the weekly mending     chapter xix toms success        come philander let us be a marching      every one his true love a searching  would be the most appropriate motto for this chapter because intimidated by the threats denunciations and complaints showered upon me in consequence of taking the liberty to end a certain story as i liked i now yield to the amiable desire of giving satisfaction and at the risk of outraging all the unities intend to pair off everybody i can lay my hands on  occasionally a matrimonial epidemic appears especially toward spring devastating society thinning the ranks of bachelordom and leaving mothers lamenting for their fairest daughters that spring the disease broke out with great violence in the shaw circle causing paternal heads much bewilderment as one case after another appeared with alarming rapidity fanny as we have seen was stricken first and hardly had she been carried safely through the crisis when tom returned to swell the list of victims as fanny was out a good deal with her arthur who was sure that exercise was necessary for the convalescent polly went every day to see mrs shaw who found herself lonely though much better than usual for the engagement had a finer effect upon her constitution than any tonic she ever tried some three days after fans joyful call polly was startled on entering the shaws door by maud who came tumbling down stairs sending an avalanche of words before her he s come before he said he should to surprise us he s up in mammas room and was just saying how s polly when i heard you come in your creepmouse way and you must go right up he looks so funny with whiskers but he s ever so nice real big and brown and he swung me right up when he kissed me never mind your bonnet i cant wait  and pouncing upon polly maud dragged her away like a captured ship towed by a noisy little steamtug  the sooner it s over the better for me was the only thought polly had time for before she plunged into the room above propelled by maud who cried triumphantly there he is aint he splendid  for a minute everything danced before pollys eyes as a hand shook hers warmly and a gruffish voice said heartily how are you polly then she slipped into a chair beside mrs shaw hoping that her reply had been all right and proper for she had not the least idea what she said  things got steady again directly and while maud expatiated on the great surprise polly ventured to look at tom feeling glad that her back was toward the light and his was not it was not a large room and tom seemed to fill it entirely not that he had grown so very much except broader in the shoulders but there was a brisk genial freeandeasy air about him suggestive of a stirring outofdoor life with people who kept their eyes wide open and were not very particular what they did with their arms and legs the roughandready travelling suit stout boots brown face and manly beard changed him so much that polly could find scarcely a trace of elegant tom shaw in the heartylooking young man who stood with one foot on a chair while he talked business to his father in a sensible way which delighted the old gentleman polly liked the change immensely and sat listening to the state of western trade with as much interest as if it had been the most thrilling romance for as he talked tom kept looking at her with a nod or a smile so like old times that for a little while she forgot maria bailey and was in bliss  by and by fanny came flying in and gave tom a greater surprise than his had been he had not the least suspicion of what had been going on at home for fan had said to herself with girlish malice if he dont choose to tell me his secrets i m not going to tell mine and had said nothing about sydney except an occasional allusion to his being often there and very kind therefore when she announced her engagement tom looked so staggered for a minute that fan thought he did nt like it but after the first surprise passed he showed such an affectionate satisfaction that she was both touched and flattered  what do you think of this performance asked tom wheeling round to polly who still sat by mrs shaw in the shadow of the bedcurtains  i like it very much she said in such a hearty tone that tom could not doubt the genuineness of her pleasure  glad of that hope you ll be as well pleased with another engagement that s coming out before long and with an odd laugh tom carried sydney off to his den leaving the girls to telegraph to one another the awful message it is maria bailey  how she managed to get through that evening polly never knew yet it was not a long one for at eight oclock she slipped out of the room meaning to run home alone and not compel any one to serve as escort but she did not succeed for as she stood warming her rubbers at the diningroom fire wondering pensively as she did so if maria bailey had small feet and if tom ever put her rubbers on for her the little overshoes were taken out of her hands and toms voice said reproachfully did you really mean to run away and not let me go home with you  i m not afraid i did nt want to take you away began polly secretly hoping that she did nt look too pleased  but i like to be taken away why it s a whole year since i went home with you do you remember that said tom flapping the rubbers about without any signs of haste  does it seem long  everlasting  polly meant to say that quite easily and smile incredulously at his answer but in spite of the coquettish little rosecolored hood she wore and which she knew was very becoming she did not look or speak gayly and tom saw something in the altered face that made him say hastily i m afraid you ve been doing too much this winter you look tired out polly  oh no it suits me to be very busy and she began to drag on her gloves as if to prove it  but it does nt suit me to have you get thin and pale you know  polly looked up to thank him but never did for there was something deeper than gratitude in the honest blue eyes that could not hide the truth entirely tom saw it flushed all over his brown face and dropping the rubbers with a crash took her hands saying in his old impetuous way polly i want to tell you something  yes i know we ve been expecting it i hope you ll be very happy tom and polly shook his hands with a smile that was more pathetic than a flood of tears  what cried tom looking as if he thought she had lost her mind  ned told us all about her he thought it would be so and when you spoke of another engagement we knew you meant your own  but i did nt neds the man he told me to tell you it s just settled  is it maria cried polly holding on to a chair as if to be prepared for anything  of course who else should it be  he did nt say you talked about her most and so we thought stammered polly falling into a sudden flutter  that i was in love well i am but not with her  oh and polly caught her breath as if a dash of cold water had fallen on her for the more in earnest tom grew the blunter he became  do you want to know the name of the girl i ve loved for more than a year well it s polly as he spoke tom stretched out his arms to her with the sort of mute eloquence that cannot be resisted and polly went straight into them without a word  never mind what happened for a little bit love scenes if genuine are indescribable for to those who have enacted them the most elaborate description seems tame and to those who have not the simplest picture seems overdone so romancers had better let imagination paint for them that which is above all art and leave their lovers to themselves during the happiest minutes of their lives  before long tom and polly were sitting side by side enjoying the blissful state of mind which usually follows the first step out of our workaday world into the glorified region wherein lovers rapturously exist for a month or two tom just sat and looked at polly as if he found it difficult to believe that the winter of his discontent had ended in this glorious spring but polly being a true woman asked questions even while she laughed and cried for joy  now tom how could i know you loved me when you went away and never said a word she began in a tenderly reproachful tone thinking of the hard year she had spent  and how could i have the courage to say a word when i had nothing on the face of the earth to offer you but my worthless self answered tom warmly  that was all i wanted whispered polly in a tone which caused him to feel that the race of angels was not entirely extinct  i ve always been fond of you my polly but i never realized how fond till just before i went away i was nt free you know and besides i had a strong impression that you liked sydney in spite of the damper which fan hinted you gave him last winter he s such a capital fellow i really dont see how you could help it  it is strange i dont understand it myself but women are queer creatures and there s no accounting for their tastes said polly with a sly look which tom fully appreciated  you were so good to me those last days that i came very near speaking out but could nt bear to seem to be offering you a poor disgraced sort of fellow whom trix would nt have and no one seemed to think worth much no i said to myself polly ought to have the best if syd can get her let him and i wont say a word i ll try to be better worthy her friendship anyway and perhaps when i ve proved that i can do something and am not ashamed to work then if polly is free i shant be afraid to try my chance so i held my tongue worked like a horse satisfied myself and others that i could get my living honestly and then came home to see if there was any hope for me  and i was waiting for you all the time said a soft voice close to his shoulder for polly was much touched by toms manly efforts to deserve her  i did nt mean to do it the first minute but look about me a little and be sure syd was all right but fans news settled that point and just now the look in my pollys face settled the other i could nt wait another minute or let you either and i could nt help stretching out my arms to my little wife god bless her though i know i dont deserve her  toms voice got lower and lower as he spoke and his face was full of an emotion of which he need not be ashamed for a very sincere love ennobled him making him humble where a shallower affection would have been proud of its success polly understood this and found the honest hearty speech of her lover more eloquent than poetry itself her hand stole up to his cheek and she leaned her own confidingly against the rough coat as she said in her frank simple way tom dear dont say that as if i was the best girl in the world i ve got ever so many faults and i want you to know them all and help me cure them as you have your own waiting has not done us any harm and i love you all the better for your trial but i m afraid your year has been harder than mine you look so much older and graver than when you went away you never would complain but i ve had a feeling that you were going through a good deal more than any of us guessed  pretty tough work at first i own it was all so new and strange i m afraid i should nt have stood it if it had not been for ned he d laugh and say pooh if he heard me say it but it s true nevertheless that he s a grand fellow and helped me through the first six months like a well a brother as he is there was no reason why he should go out of his way to back up a shiftless party like me yet he did and made many things easy and safe that would have been confoundedly hard and dangerous if i d been left to myself the only way i can explain it is that it s a family trait and as natural to the brother as it is to the sister  it s a shaw trait to do the same but tell me about maria is ned really engaged to her  very much so you ll get a letter full of raptures tomorrow he had nt time to send by me i came off in such a hurry maria is a sensible pretty girl and ned will be a happy old fellow  why did you let us think it was you  i only teased fan a little i did like maria for she reminded me of you sometimes and was such a kind cosy little woman i could nt help enjoying her society after a hard days work but ned got jealous and then i knew that he was in earnest so i left him a clear field and promised not to breathe a word to any one till he had got a yes or no from his maria  i wish i d known it sighed polly people in love always do such stupid things  so they do for neither you nor fan gave us poor fellows the least hint about syd and there i ve been having all sorts of scares about you  serves us right brothers and sisters should nt have secrets from each other  we never will again did you miss me very much  yes tom very very much  my patient little polly  did you really care for me before you went  see if i did nt and with great pride tom produced a portly pocketbook stuffed with businesslike documents of a most imposing appearance opened a private compartment and took out a wornlooking paper unfolded it carefully and displayed a small brown object which gave out a faint fragrance  that s the rose you put in the birthday cake and next week we ll have a fresh one in another jolly little cake which you ll make me you left it on the floor of my den the night we talked there and i ve kept it ever since there s love and romance for you  polly touched the little relic treasured for a year and smiled to read the words my pollys rose scribbled under the crumbling leaves  i did nt know you could be so sentimental she said looking so pleased that he did not regret confessing his folly  i never was till i loved you my dear and i m not very bad yet for i dont wear my posy next my heart but where i can see it every day and so never forget for whom i am working should nt wonder if that bit of nonsense had kept me economical honest and hard at it for i never opened my pocketbook that i did nt think of you  that s lovely tom and polly found it so touching that she felt for her handkerchief but tom took it away and made her laugh instead of cry by saying in a wheedlesome tone i dont believe you did as much for all your romance did you now  if you wont laugh i ll show you my treasures i began first and i ve worn them longest  as she spoke polly drew out the old locket opened it and showed the picture tom gave her in the bag of peanuts cut small and fitted in on one side on the other was a curl of reddish hair and a black button how tom laughed when he saw them  you dont mean you ve kept that frightful guy of a boy all this time polly polly you are the most faithful loveress as maud says that was ever known  dont flatter yourself that i ve worn it all these years sir i only put it in last spring because i did nt dare to ask for one of the new ones the button came off the old coat you insisted on wearing after the failure as if it was your duty to look as shabby as possible and the curl i stole from maud are nt we silly  he did not seem to think so and after a short pause for refreshments polly turned serious and said anxiously when must you go back to your hard work  in a week or two but it wont seem drudgery now for you ll write every day and i shall feel that i m working to get a home for you that will give me a fortymanpower and i ll pay up my debts and get a good start and then ned and i will be married and go into partnership and we ll all be the happiest busiest people in the west  it sounds delightful but wont it take a long time tom  only a few years and we need nt wait a minute after syd is paid if you dont mind beginning rather low down polly  i d rather work up with you than sit idle while you toil away all alone that s the way father and mother did and i think they were very happy in spite of the poverty and hard work  then we ll do it by another year for i must get more salary before i take you away from a good home here i wish oh polly how i wish i had a half of the money i ve wasted to make you comfortable now  never mind i dont want it i d rather have less and know you earned it all yourself cried polly as tom struck his hand on his knee with an acute pang of regret at the power he had lost  it s like you to say it and i wont waste any words bewailing myself because i was a fool we will work up together my brave polly and you shall yet be proud of your husband though he is poor tom shaw  she was as sure of that as if an oracle had foretold it and was not deceived for the loving heart that had always seen believed and tried to strengthen all good impulses in tom was well repaid for its instinctive trust by the happiness of the years to come  yes she said hopefully i know you will succeed for the best thing a man can have is work with a purpose in it and the will to do it heartily  there is one better thing polly answered tom turning her face up a little that he might see his inspiration shining in her eyes  what is it dear  a good woman to love and help him all his life as you will me please god  even though she is oldfashioned whispered polly with happy eyes the brighter for their tears as she looked up at the young man who through her had caught a glimpse of the truest success and was not ashamed to owe it to love and labor two beautiful old fashions that began long ago with the first pair in eden  lest any of my young readers who have honored maud with their interest should suffer the pangs of unsatisfied curiosity as to her future i will add for their benefit that she did not marry will but remained a busy lively spinster all her days and kept house for her father in the most delightful manner  wills ministerial dream came to pass in the course of time however and a gentle brighteyed lady ruled over the parsonage whom the reverend william called his little jane  farther into futurity even this rash pen dares not proceed but pauses here concluding in the words of the dear old fairy tales and so they were married and all lived happily till they died
