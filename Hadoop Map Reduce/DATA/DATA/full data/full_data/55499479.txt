cimmerian darkness oer the parting soul    campbell    complete in one volume   1860     preface    if any thing connected with the hardness of the human heart could surprise us it surely would be the indifference with which men live on engrossed by their worldly objects amid the sublime natural phenomena that so eloquently and unceasingly speak to their imaginations affections and judgments so completely is the existence of the individual concentrated in self and so regardless does he get to be of all without that contracted circle that it does not probably happen to one man in ten that his thoughts are drawn aside from this intense study of his own immediate wants wishes and plans even once in the twentyfour hours to contemplate the majesty mercy truth and justice of the divine being that has set him as an atom amid the myriads of the hosts of heaven and earth  the physical marvels of the universe produce little more reflection than the profoundest moral truths a million of eyes shall pass over the firmament on a cloudless night and not a hundred minds shall be filled with a proper sense of the power of the dread being that created all that is therenot a hundred hearts glow with the adoration that such an appeal to the senses and understanding ought naturally to produce this indifference in a great measure comes of familiarity the things that we so constantly have before us becoming as a part of the air we breathe and as little regarded  one of the consequences of this disposition to disregard the almighty hand as it is so plainly visible in all around us is that of substituting our own powers in its stead in this period of the world in enlightened countries and in the absence of direct idolatry few men are so hardy as to deny the existence and might of a supreme being but this fact admitted how few really feel that profound reverence for him that the nature of our relations justly demands it is the want of a due sense of humility and a sad misconception of what we are and for what we were created that misleads us in the due estimate of our own insignificance as compared with the majesty of god  very few men attain enough of human knowledge to be fully aware how much remains to be learned and of that which they never can hope to acquire we hear a great deal of godlike minds and of the farreaching faculties we possess and it may all be worthy of our eulogiums until we compare ourselves in these as in other particulars with him who produced them then indeed the utter insignificance of our means becomes too apparent to admit of a cavil we know that we are born and that we die science has been able to grapple with all the phenomena of these two great physical facts with the exception of the most material of allthose which should tell us what is life and what is death something that we cannot comprehend lies at the root of every distinct division of natural phenomena thus far shalt thou go and no farther seems to be imprinted on every great fact of creation there is a point attained in each and all of our acquisitions where a mystery that no human mind can scan takes the place of demonstration and conjecture this point may lie more remote with some intellects than with others but it exists for all arrests the inductions of all conceals all  we are aware that the more learned among those who disbelieve in the divinity of christ suppose themselves to be sustained by written authority contending for errors of translation mistakes and misapprehensions in the ancient texts nevertheless we are inclined to think that ninetenths of those who refuse the old and accept the new opinion do so for a motive no better than a disinclination to believe that which they cannot comprehend this pride of reason is one of the most insinuating of our foibles and is to be watched as a most potent enemy  how completely and philosophically does the venerable christian creed embrace and modify all these workings of the heart we say philosophically for it were not possible for mind to give a juster analysis of the whole subject than st pauls most comprehensive but brief definition of faith it is this faith which forms the mighty feature of the church on earth it equalizes capacities conditions means and ends holding out the same encouragement and hope to the least as to the most gifted of the race counting gifts in their ordinary and more secular points of view  it is when health or the usual means of success abandon us that we are made to feel how totally we are insufficient for the achievement of even our own purposes much less to qualify us to reason on the deep mysteries that conceal the beginning and the end it has often been said that the most successful leaders of their fellow men have had the clearest views of their own insufficiency to attain their own objects if napoleon ever said as has been attributed to him je propose et je dispose it must have been in one of those fleeting moments in which success blinded him to the fact of his own insufficiency no man had a deeper reliance on fortune cast the result of great events on the decrees of fate or more anxiously watched the rising and setting of what he called his star this was a faith that could lead to no good but it clearly denoted how far the boldest designs the most ample means and the most vaulting ambition fall short of giving that sublime consciousness of power and its fruits that distinguish the reign of omnipotence  in this book the design has been to pourtray man on a novel field of action and to exhibit his dependence on the hand that does not suffer a sparrow to fall unheeded the recent attempts of science which employed the seamen of the four greatest maritime states of christendom made discoveries that have rendered the polar circles much more familiar to this age than to any that has preceded it so far as existing records show we say existing records for there is much reason for believing that the ancients had a knowledge of our hemisphere though less for supposing that they ever braved the dangers of the high latitudes many are just at this moment much disposed to believe that ophir was on this continent though for a reason no better than the circumstance of the recent discoveries of much gold such savans should remember that peacocks came from ancient ophir if this be in truth that land the adventurers of israel caused it to be denuded of that bird of beautiful plumage  such names as those of parry sabine ross franklin wilkes hudson ringgold c c with those of divers gallant frenchmen and russians command our most profound respect for no battles or victories can redound more to the credit of seamen than the dangers they all encountered and the conquests they have all achieved one of those named a resolute and experienced seaman it is thought must at this moment be locked in the frosts of the arctic circle after having passed half a life in the endeavour to push his discoveries into those remote and frozen regions he bears the name of the most distinguished of the philosophers of this country and nature has stamped on his featuresby one of those secret laws which just as much baffle our means of comprehension as the greatest of all our mysteries the incarnation of the son of goda resemblance that of itself would go to show that they are of the same race any one who has ever seen this emprisoned navigator and who is familiar with the countenances of the men of the same name who are to be found in numbers amongst ourselves must be struck with a likeness that lies as much beyond the grasp of that reason of which we are so proud as the sublimest facts taught by induction science or revelation parties are at this moment out in search of him and his followers and it is to be hoped that the providence which has so singularly attempered the different circles and zones of our globe placing this under a burning sun and that beneath enduring frosts will have included in its divine forethought a sufficient care for these bold wanderers to restore them unharmed to their friends and country in a contrary event their names must be transmitted to posterity as the victims to a laudable desire to enlarge the circle of human knowledge and with it we trust to increase the glory due to god     the sea lions     chapter i      when thats gone   he shall drink naught but brine    tempest   while there is less of that high polish in america that is obtained by long intercourse with the great world than is to be found in nearly every european country there is much less positive rusticity also there the extremes of society are widely separated repelling rather than attracting each other while among ourselves the tendency is to gravitate towards a common centre thus it is that all things in america become subject to a mean law that is productive of a mediocrity which is probably much above the average of that of most nations possibly of all england excepted but which is only a mediocrity after all in this way excellence in nothing is justly appreciated nor is it often recognised and the suffrages of the nation are pretty uniformly bestowed on qualities of a secondary class numbers have sway and it is as impossible to resist them in deciding on merit as it is to deny their power in the ballotboxes time alone with its great curative influence supplying the remedy that is to restore the public mind to a healthful state and give equally to the pretender and to him who is worthy of renown his proper place in the pages of history  the activity of american life the rapidity and cheapness of intercourse and the migratory habits both have induced leave little of rusticity and local character in any particular sections of the country distinctions that an acute observer may detect do certainly exist between the eastern and the western man between the northerner and the southerner the yankee and middle states man the bostonian manhattanese and philadelphian the tuckahoe and the cracker the buckeye or wolverine and the jersey blue nevertheless the world cannot probably produce another instance of a people who are derived from so many different races and who occupy so large an extent of country who are so homogeneous in appearance characters and opinions there is no question that the institutions have had a material influence in producing this uniformity while they have unquestionably lowered the standard to which opinion is submitted by referring the decisions to the many instead of making the appeal to the few as is elsewhere done still the direction is onward and though it may take time to carve on the social column of america that graceful and ornamental capital which it forms the just boast of europe to possess when the task shall be achieved the work will stand on a base so broad as to secure its upright attitude for ages  notwithstanding the general character of identity and homogenity that so strongly marks the picture of american society exceptions are to be met with in particular districts that are not only distinct and incontrovertible but which are so peculiar as to be worthy of more than a passing remark in our delineations of national customs our present purpose leads us into one of these secluded districts and it may be well to commence the narrative of certain deeply interesting incidents that it is our intention to attempt to portray by first referring to the place and people where and from whom the principal actors in our legend had their origin  every one at all familiar with the map of america knows the position and general form of the two islands that shelter the wellknown harbour of the great emporium of the commerce of the country these islands obtained their names from the dutch who called them nassau and staten but the english with little respect for the ancient house whence the first of these appellations is derived and consulting only the homely taste which leads them to a practical rather then to a poetical nomenclature in all things have since virtually dropped the name of nassau altogether substituting that of long island in its stead  long island or the island of nassau extends from the mouth of the hudson to the eastern line of connecticut forming a sort of seawall to protect the whole coast of the latter little territory against the waves of the broad atlantic three of the oldest new york counties as their names would imply kings queens and suffolk are on this island kings was originally peopled by the dutch and still possesses as many names derived from holland as from england if its towns which are of recent origin be taken from the account queens is more of a mixture having been early invaded and occupied by adventurers from the other side of the sound but suffolk which contains nearly if not quite twothirds of the surface of the whole island is and ever has been in possession of a people derived originally from the puritans of new england of these three counties kings is much the smallest though next to new york itself the most populous county in the state a circumstance that is owing to the fact that two suburban offsets of the great emporium brooklyn and williamsburg happen to stand within its limits on the waters of what is improperly called the east river an arm of the sea that has obtained this appellation in contradistinction to the hudson which as all manhattanese well know is as often called the north river as by its proper name in consequence of these two towns or suburbs of new york one of which contains nearly a hundred thousand souls while the other must be drawing on towards twenty thousand kings county has lost all it ever had of peculiar or local character the same is true of queens though in a diminished degree but suffolk remains suffolk still and it is with suffolk alone that our present legend requires us to deal of suffolk then we purpose to say a few words by way of preparatory explanation  although it has actually more seacoast than all the rest of new york united suffolk has but one seaport that is ever mentioned beyond the limits of the county itself nor is this port one of general commerce its shipping being principally employed in the hardy and manly occupation of whaling as a whaling town sag harbour is the third or fourth port in the country and maintains something like that rank in importance a whaling haven is nothing without a whaling community without the last it is almost hopeless to look for success new york can and has often fitted whalers for sea having sought officers in the regular whaling ports but it has been seldom that the enterprises have been rewarded with such returns as to induce a second voyage by the same parties  it is as indispensable that a whaler should possess a certain esprit de corps as that a regiment or a ship of war should be animated by its proper spirit in the whaling communities this spirit exists to an extent and in a degree that is wonderful when one remembers the great expansion of this particular branch of trade within the last fiveandtwenty years it may be a little lessened of late but at the time of which we are writing or about the year 1820 there was scarcely an individual who followed this particular calling out of the port of sag harbour whose general standing on board ship was not as well known to all the women and girls of the place as it was to his shipmates success in taking the whale was a thing that made itself felt in every fibre of the prosperity of the town and it was just as natural that the singleminded population of that part of suffolk should regard the bold and skilful harpooner or lancer with favour as it is for the belle at a wateringplace to bestow her smiles on one of the young heroes of contreras or churubusco his peculiar merit whether with the oar lance or harpoon is bruited about as well as the number of whales he may have succeeded in making fast to or those which he caused to spout blood it is true that the great extension of the trade within the last twenty years by drawing so many from a distance into its pursuits has in a degree lessened this local interest and local knowledge of character but at the time of which we are about to write both were at their height and nantucket itself had not more of this intelligence office propensity or more of the true whaling esprit de corps than were to be found in the district of country that surrounded sag harbour  long island forks at its eastern end and may be said to have two extremities one of these which is much the shortest of the two legs thus formed goes by the name of oyster pond point while the other that stretches much farther in the direction of blok island is the wellknown cape called montauk within the fork lies shelter island so named from the snug berth it occupies between shelter island and the longest or southern prong of the fork are the waters which compose the haven of sag harbour an estuary of some extent while a narrow but deep arm of the sea separates this island from the northern prong that terminates at oyster pond  the name of oyster pond point was formerly applied to a long low fertile and pleasant reach of land that extended several miles from the point itself westward towards the spot where the two prongs of the fork united it was not easy during the first quarter of the present century to find a more secluded spot on the whole island than oyster pond recent enterprises have since converted it into the terminus of a railroad and green port once called sterling is a name well known to travellers between new york and boston but in the earlier part of the present century it seemed just as likely that the santa casa of loretto should take a new flight and descend on the point as that the improvement that has actually been made should in truth occur at that outoftheway place it required indeed the keen eye of a railroad projector to bring this spot in connection with anything nor could it be done without having recourse to the water by which it is almost surrounded using the last it is true means have been found to place it in a line between two of the great marts of the country and thus to put an end to all its seclusion its simplicity its peculiarities and we had almost said its happiness  it is to us ever a painful sight to see the rustic virtues rudely thrown aside by the intrusion of what are termed improvements a railroad is certainly a capital invention for the traveller but it may be questioned if it is of any other benefit than that of pecuniary convenience to the places through which it passes how many delightful hamlets pleasant villages and even tranquil county towns are losing their primitive characters for simplicity and contentment by the passage of these fiery trains that drag after them a sort of bastard elegance a pretension that is destructive of peace of mind and an uneasy desire in all who dwell by the wayside to pry into the mysteries of the whole length and breadth of the region it traverses  we are writing of the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and nineteen in that day oyster pond was in one of the best acceptations of the word a rural district it is true that its inhabitants were accustomed to the water and to the sight of vessels from the twodecker to the little shabbylooking craft that brought ashes from town to meliorate the sandy lands of suffolk only five years before an english squadron had lain in gardiners bay here pronounced garners watching the race or eastern outlet of the sound with a view to cut off the trade and annoy their enemy that game is up for ever no hostile squadron english french dutch or all united will ever again blockade an american port for any serious length of time the young hercules passing too rapidly from the gristle into the bone any longer to suffer antics of this nature to be played in front of his cradle but such was not his condition in the war of 1812 and the good people of oyster pond had become familiar with the checkered sides of twodeck ships and the venerable and beautiful ensign of old england as it floated above them  nor was it only by these distant views and by means of hostilities that the good folk on oyster pond were acquainted with vessels new york is necessary to all on the coast both as a market and as a place to procure supplies and every creek or inlet or basin of any sort within a hundred leagues of it is sure to possess one or more craft that ply between the favourite haven and the particular spot in question thus was it with oyster pond there is scarce a better harbour on the whole american coast than that which the narrow arm of the sea that divides the point from shelter island presents and even in the simple times of which we are writing sterling had its two or three coasters such as they were but the true maritime character of oyster pond as well as that of all suffolk was derived from the whalers and its proper nucleus was across the estuary at sag harbour thither the youths of the whole region resorted for employment and to advance their fortunes and generally with such success as is apt to attend enterprise industry and daring when exercised with energy in a pursuit of moderate gains none became rich in the strict signification of the term though a few got to be in reasonably affluent circumstances many were placed altogether at their ease and more were made humbly comfortable a farm in america is well enough for the foundation of family support but it rarely suffices for all the growing wants of these days of indulgence and of a desire to enjoy so much of that which was formerly left to the undisputed possession of the unquestionably rich a farm with a few hundreds per annum derived from other sources makes a good base of comfort and if the hundreds are converted into thousands your farmer or agriculturalist becomes a man not only at his ease but a proprietor of some importance the farms on oyster pond were neither very extensive nor had they owners of large incomes to support them on the contrary most of them were made to support their owners a thing that is possible even in america with industry frugality and judgment in order however that the names of places we may have occasion to use shall be understood it may be well to be a little more particular in our preliminary explanations  the reader knows that we are now writing of suffolk county long island new york he also knows that our opening scene is to be on the shorter or most northern of the two prongs of that fork which divides the eastern end of this island giving it what are properly two capes the smallest territorial division that is known to the laws of new york in rural districts is the township as it is called these townships are usually larger than the english parish corresponding more properly with the french canton they vary however greatly in size some containing as much as a hundred square miles which is the largest size while others do not contain more than a tenth of that surface  the township in which the northern prong or point of long island lies is named southold and includes not only all of the long low narrow land that then went by the common names of oyster pond sterling c but several islands also which stretch off in the sound as well as a broader piece of territory near riverhead oyster pond which is the portion of the township that lies on the point is or was for we write of a remote period in the galloping history of the state only a part of southold and probably was not then a name known in the laws at all  we have a wish also that this name should be pronounced properly it is not called oyster pond as the uninitiated would be very apt to get it but oyster pùnd the last word having a sound similar to that of the cockneys pound in his two pùnd two this discrepancy between the spelling and the pronunciation of proper names is agreeable to us for it shows that a people are not put in leading strings by pedagogues and that they make use of their own in their own way we remember how great was our satisfaction once on entering holmes hole a wellknown bay in this very vicinity in our youth to hear a boatman call the port humses hull it is getting to be so rare to meet with an american below the higher classes who will consent to cast this species of veil before his schoolday acquisitions that we acknowledge it gives us pleasure to hear such good homely oldfashioned english as garners island humses hull and oyster pund  this plainness of speech was not the only proof of the simplicity of former days that was to be found in suffolk in the first quarter of the century the eastern end of long island lies so much out of the track of the rest of the world that even the new railroad cannot make much impression on its inhabitants who get their pigs and poultry butter and eggs a little earlier to market than in the days of the stagewagons it is true but they fortunately as yet bring little back except it be the dross that sets every thing in motion whether it be by rail or through the sands in the former toilsome mode  the season at the precise moment when we desire to take the reader with us to oyster pond was in the delightful month of september when the earlier promises of the year are fast maturing into performance although suffolk as a whole can scarcely be deemed a productive county being generally of a thin light soil and still covered with a growth of small wood it possesses nevertheless spots of exceeding fertility a considerable portion of the northern prong of the fork has this latter character and oyster pond is a sort of garden compared with much of the sterility that prevails around it plain but respectable dwellings with numerous outbuildings orchards and fruittrees fences carefully preserved a painstaking tillage good roads and here and there a meetinghouse gave the fork an air of rural and moral beauty that aided by the water by which it was so nearly surrounded contributed greatly to relieve the monotony of so dead a level there were heights in view on shelter island and bluffs towards riverhead which if they would not attract much attention in switzerland were by no means overlooked in suffolk in a word both the season and the place were charming though most of the flowers had already faded and the apple and the pear and the peach were taking the places of the inviting cherry fruit abounded notwithstanding the close vicinity of the district to salt water the airs from the sea being broken or somewhat tempered by the land that lay to the southward  we have spoken of the coasters that ply between the emporium and all the creeks and bays of the sound as well as of the numberless rivers that find an outlet for their waters between sandy hook and rockaway wharves were constructed at favourable points inside the prong and occasionally a sloop was seen at them loading its truck or discharging its ashes or street manure the latter being a very common return cargo for a long island coaster at one wharf however now lay a vessel of a different mould and one which though of no great size was manifastly intended to go outside this was a schooner that had been recently launched and which had advanced no farther in its first equipment than to get in its two principal spars the rigging of which hung suspended over the mastheads in readiness to be set up for the first time the day being sunday work was suspended and this so much the more because the owner of the vessel was a certain deacon pratt who dwelt in a house within half a mile of the wharf and who was also the proprietor of three several parcels of land in that neighbourhood each of which had its own buildings and conveniences and was properly enough dignified with the name of a farm to be sure neither of these farms was very large their acres united amounting to but little more than two hundred but owing to their condition the native richness of the soil and the mode of turning them to account they had made deacon pratt a warm man for suffolk  there are two great species of deacons for we suppose they must all be referred to the same genera one species belong to the priesthood and become priests and bishops passing away as priests and bishops are apt to do with more or less of the savour of godliness the other species are purely laymen and are sui generis they are ex officio the most pious men in a neighbourhood as they sometimes are as it would seem to us ex officio also the most grasping and mercenary as we are not in the secrets of the sects to which these lay deacons belong we shall not presume to pronounce whether the individual is elevated to the deaconate because he is prosperous in a worldly sense or whether the prosperity is a consequence of the deaconate but that the two usually go together is quite certain which being the cause and which the effect we leave to wiser heads to determine  deacon pratt was no exception to the rule a tighter fisted sinner did not exist in the county than this pious soul who certainly not only wore but wore out the form of godliness while he was devoted heart and hand to the daily increase of worldly gear no one spoke disparagingly of the deacon notwithstanding so completely had he got to be interwoven with the churchmeeting we ought to sayin that vicinity that speaking disparagingly of him would have appeared like assailing christianity it is true that many an unfortunate fellowcitizen in suffolk had been made to feel how close was the gripe of his hand when he found himself in its grasp but there is a way of practising the most ruthless extortion that serves not only to deceive the world but which would really seem to mislead the extortioner himself phrases take the place of deeds sentiments those of facts and grimaces those of benevolent looks so ingeniously and so impudently that the wronged often fancy that they are the victims of a severe dispensation of providence when the truth would have shown that they were simply robbed  we do not mean however that deacon pratt was a robber he was merely a hard man in the management of his affairs never cheating in a direct sense but seldom conceding a cent to generous impulses or to the duties of kind he was a widower and childless circumstances that rendered his love of gain still less pardonable for many a man who is indifferent to money on his own account will toil and save to lay up hoards for those who are to come after him the deacon had only a niece to inherit his effects unless he might choose to step beyond that degree of consanguinity and bestow a portion of his means on cousins the churchor to be more literal the meetinghad an eye on his resources however and it was whispered it had actually succeeded by means known to itself in squeezing out of his tight grasp no less a sum than one hundred dollars as a donation to a certain theological college it was conjectured by some persons that this was only the beginning of a religious liberality and that the excellent and godlyminded deacon would bestow most of his property in a similar way when the moment should come that it could be no longer of any use to himself this opinion was much in favour with divers devout females of the deacons congregation who had daughters of their own and who seldom failed to conclude their observations on this interesting subject with some such remark as well in that case and it seems to me that every thing points that way mary pratt will get no more than any other poor mans daughter  little did mary the only child of israel pratt an elder brother of the deacon think of all this she had been left an orphan in her tenth year both parents dying within a few months of each other and had lived beneath her uncles roof for nearly ten more years until use and natural affection and the customs of the country had made her feel absolutely at home there a less interested or less selfish being than mary pratt never existed in this respect she was the very antipodes of her uncle who often stealthily rebuked her for her charities and acts of neighbourly kindness which he was wont to term waste but mary kept the even tenor of her way seemingly not hearing such remarks and doing her duty quietly and in all humility  suffolk was settled originally by emigrants from new england and the character of its people is to this hour of modified new england habits and notions now one of the marked peculiarities of connecticut is an indisposition to part with anything without a quid pro quo those little services offerings and conveniences that are elsewhere parted with without a thought of remuneration go regularly upon the daybook and often reappear on a settlement years after they have been forgotten by those who received the favours even the man who keeps a carriage will let it out for hire and the manner in which money is accepted and even asked for by persons in easy circumstances and for things that would be gratuitous in the middle states often causes disappointment and sometimes disgust in this particular scottish and swiss thrift both notorious and the latter particularly so are nearly equalled by new england thrift more especially in the close estimate of the value of services rendered so marked indeed is this practice of looking for requitals that even the language is infected with it thus should a person pass a few months by invitation with a friend his visit is termed boarding it being regarded as a matter of course that he pays his way it would scarcely be safe indeed without the precaution of passing receipts on quitting for one to stay any time in a new england dwelling unless prepared to pay for his board the free and frank habits that prevail among relatives and friends elsewhere are nearly unknown there every service having its price these customs are exceedingly repugnant to all who have been educated in different notions yet are they not without their redeeming qualities that might be pointed out to advantage though our limits will not permit us at this moment so to do  little did mary pratt suspect the truth but habit or covetousness or some vague expectation that the girl might yet contract a marriage that would enable him to claim all his advances had induced the deacon never to bestow a cent on her education or dress or pleasures of any sort that the money was not regularly charged against her in that nefarious work that he called his daybook as for the selfrespect and the feelings of caste which prevent a gentleman from practising any of these tradesmens tricks the deacon knew nothing of them he would have set the man down as a fool who deferred to any notions so unprofitable with him not only every man but every thing had its price and usually it was a good price too at the very moment when our tale opens there stood charged in his book against his unsuspecting and affectionate niece items in the way of schooling dress board and pocketmoney that amounted to the considerable sum of one thousand dollars money fairly expended the deacon was only intensely mean and avaricious while he was as honest as the day not a cent was overcharged and to own the truth mary was so great a favourite with him that most of his charges against her were rather of a reasonable rate than otherwise     chapter ii      marry i saw your niece do more favours   to the counts servingman than ever she bestowed   upon me i saw it i the orchard    twelfth night   on the sunday in question deacon pratt went to meeting as usual the building in which divine service was held that day standing less than two miles from his residence but instead of remaining for the afternoons preaching as was his wont he got into his onehorse chaise the vehicle then in universal use among the middle classes though now so seldom seen and skirred away homeward as fast as an active wellfed and powerful switchtailed mare could draw him the animal being accompanied in her rapid progress by a colt of some three months existence the residence of the deacon was unusually inviting for a man of his narrow habits it stood on the edge of a fine appleorchard having a dooryard of nearly two acres in its front this dooryard which had been twice mown that summer was prettily embellished with flowers and was shaded by four rows of noble cherrytrees the house itself was of wood as is almost uniformly the case in suffolk where little stone is to be found and where brick constructions are apt to be thought damp but it was a respectable edifice with five windows in front and of two stories the siding was of unpainted cedarshingles and although the house had been erected long previously to the revolution the siding had been renewed but once about ten years before the opening of our tale and the whole building was in a perfect state of repair the thrift of the deacon rendered him careful and he was thoroughly convinced of the truth of the familiar adage which tells us that a stitch in time saves nine all around the house and farm was in perfect order proving the application of the saying as for the view it was sufficiently pleasant the house having its front towards the east while its end windows looked the one set in the direction of the sound and the other in that of the arm of the sea which belongs properly to peconic bay we believe all this water some of which was visible over points and among islands together with a smiling and fertile though narrow stretch of foreground could not fail of making an agreeable landscape  it was little however that deacon pratt thought of views or beauty of any sort as the mare reached the open gate of his own abode mary was standing in the stoop or porch of the house and appeared to be anxiously awaiting her uncles return the latter gave the reins to a black one who was no longer a slave but who was a descendant of some of the ancient slaves of the pratts and in that character consented still to dawdle about the place working for half price on alighting the uncle approached the niece with somewhat of interest in his mariner  well mary said the former how does he get on now  oh my dear sir he cannot possibly live i think and i do most earnestly entreat that you will let me send across to the harbour for dr sage  by the harbour was meant sags and the physician named was one of merited celebrity in old suffolk so healthy was the country in general and so simple were the habits of the people that neither lawyer nor physician was to be found in every hamlet as is the case today both were to be had at riverhead as well as at sag harbour but if a man called out squire or doctor in the highways of suffolk sixteen men did not turn round to reply as is said to be the case in other regions one half answering to the one appellation and the second half to the other the deacon had two objections to yielding to his nieces earnest request the expense being one though it was not in this instance the greatest there was another reason that he kept to himself but which will appear as our narrative proceeds  a few weeks previously to the sunday in question a seagoing vessel inward bound had brought up in gardiners bay which is a usual anchorage for all sorts of craft a wornout and battered seaman had been put ashore on oyster pond by a boat from this vessel which sailed to the westward soon after proceeding most probably to new york the stranger was not only well advanced in life but he was obviously wasting away with disease  the account given of himself by this seaman was sufficiently explicit he was born on marthas vineyard but as is customary with the boys of that island he had left home in his twelfth year and had now been absent from the place of his birth a little more than half a century conscious of the decay which beset him and fully convinced that his days were few and numbered the seaman who called himself tom daggett had felt a desire to close his eyes in the place where they had first been opened to the light of day he had persuaded the commander of the craft mentioned to bring him from the west indies and to put him ashore as related the vineyard being only a hundred miles or so to the eastward of oyster pond point he trusted to luck to give him the necessary opportunity of overcoming these last hundred miles  daggett was poor as he admitted as well as friendless and unknown he had with him nevertheless a substantial seachest one of those that the sailors of that day uniformly used in merchantvessels a manofwar compelling them to carry their clothes in bags for the convenience of compact stowage the chest of daggett however was a regular inmate of the forecastle and from its appearance had made almost as many voyages as its owner the last indeed was heard to say that he had succeeded in saving it from no less than three shipwrecks it was a reasonably heavy chest though its contents when opened did not seem to be of any very great value  a few hours after landing this man had made a bargain with a middleaged widow in very humble circumstances and who dwelt quite near to the residence of deacon pratt to receive him as a temporary inmate or until he could get a chance across to the vineyard at first daggett kept about and was much in the open air while able to walk he met the deacon and singular nay unaccountable as it seemed to the niece the uncle soon contracted a species of friendship for not to say intimacy with this stranger in the first place the deacon was a little particular in not having intimates among the necessitous and the widow white soon let it be known that her guest had not even a red cent he had chattels however that were of some estimation among seamen and roswell gardiner or garner as he was called the young seaman par excellence of the point one who had been not only a whaling but who had also been a sealing and who at that moment was on board the deacons schooner in the capacity of master had been applied to for advice and assistance by the agency of mr garner as the young mate was then termed sundry palms sets of sailneedles a fid or two and various other similar articles that obviously could no longer be of any use to daggett were sent across to the harbour and disposed of there to advantage among the many seamen of the port by these means the stranger was for a few weeks enabled to pay his way the board he got being both poor and cheap  a much better result attended this intercourse with gardiner than that of raising the wornout seamans immediate ways and means between mary pratt and roswell gardiner there existed an intimacy of long standing for their years as well as of some peculiar features to which there will be occasion to advert hereafter mary was the very soul of charity in all its significations and this gardiner knew when therefore daggett became really necessitous in the way of comforts that even money could not command beneath the roof of the widow white the young man let the fact be known to the deacons niece who immediately provided sundry delicacies that were acceptable to the palate of even disease as for her uncle nothing was at first said to him on the subject although his intimacy with daggett went on increasing and they were daily more and more together in long and secret conference not a suggestion was ever made by the deacon in the way of contributing to his new friends comforts to own the truth to give was the last idea that ever occurred to this mans thoughts  mary pratt was observant and of a mind so constituted that its observations usually led her to safe and accurate deductions great was the surprise of all on the point when it became known that deacon pratt had purchased and put into the water the new seagoing craft that was building on speculation at southold not only had he done this but he had actually bought some halfworn copper and had it placed on the schooners bottom as high as the bends ere he had her launched while the whole neighbourhood was exercised with conjectures on the motive which could induce the deacon to become a shipowner in his age mary did not fail to impute it to some secret but powerful influence that the sick stranger had obtained over him he now spent nearly half his time in private communications with daggett and on more than one occasion when the niece had taken some light article of food over for the use of the last she found him and her uncle examining one or two dirty and wellworn charts of the ocean as she entered the conversation invariably was changed nor was mrs white ever permitted to be present at one of these secret conferences  not only was the schooner purchased and coppered and launched and preparations made to fit her for sea but young garner was appointed to command her as respects roswell gardiner or garner as it would be almost thought a breach of decorum in suffolk not to call him there was no mystery sixandtwenty years before the opening of our legend he had been born on oyster pond itself and of one of its best families indeed he was known to be a descendant of lyon gardiner that engineer who had been sent to the settlement of the lords saye and seal and brook since called saybrook near two centuries before to lay out a town and a fort this lyon gardiner had purchased of the indians the island in that neighbourhood which still bears his name this establishment on the island was made in 1639 and now at an interval of two hundred and nine years it is in possession of its ninth owner all having been of the name and blood of its original patentee this is great antiquity for america which while it has produced many families of greater wealth and renown and importance than that of the gardiners has seldom produced any of more permanent local respectability this is a feature in society that we so much love to see and which is so much endangered by the uncertain and migratory habits of the people that we pause a moment to record this instance of stability so pleasing and so commendable in an age and country of changes  the descendants of any family of two centuries standing will as a matter of course be numerous there are exceptions certainly but such is the rule thus is it with lyon gardiner and his progeny who are now to be numbered in scores including persons in all classes of life though it carries with it a stamp of caste to be known in suffolk as having come direct from the loins of old lyon gardiner roswell of that name if not of that ilk the island then being the sole property of david johnson gardiner the predecessor and brother of its present proprietor was allowed to have this claim though it would exceed our genealogical knowledge to point out the precise line by which this descent was claimed young roswell was of respectable blood on both sides without being very brilliantly connected or rich on the contrary early left an orphan fatherless and motherless as was the case with mary pratt he had been taken from a country academy when only fifteen and sent to sea that he might make his own way in the world hitherto his success had not been of a very flattering character he had risen notwithstanding to be the chief mate of a whaler and bore an excellent reputation among the people of suffolk had it only been a year or two later when speculation took hold of the whaling business in a larger way he would not have had the least difficulty in obtaining a ship as it was however great was his delight when deacon pratt engaged him as master of the new schooner which had been already named the sea lionor sea lyon as roswell sometimes affected to spell the word in honour of his old progenitor the engineer  mary pratt had noted all these proceedings partly with pain partly with pleasure but always with great interest it pained her to find her uncle in the decline of life engaging in a business about which he knew nothing it pained her still more to see one whom she loved from habit if not from moral sympathies wasting the few hours that remained for preparing for the last great change in attempts to increase possessions that were already much more than sufficient for his wants this consideration in particular deeply grieved mary pratt for she was profoundly pious with a conscience that was so sensitive as materially to interfere with her happiness as will presently be shown while her uncle was merely a deacon it is one thing to be a deacon and another to be devoted to the love of god and to that love of our species which we are told is the consequence of a love of the deity the two are not incompatible neither are they identical this mary had been made to see in spite of all her wishes to be blind as respects the particular subject from whom she had learned the unpleasant lesson the pleasure felt by our heroine for such we now announce mary pratt to be was derived from the preferment bestowed on roswell gardiner she had many a palpitation of the heart when she heard of his good conduct as a seaman as she always did whenever she heard his professional career alluded to at all on this point roswell was without spot as all suffolk knew and confessed on oyster pond he was regarded as a species of sea lion himself so numerous and so exciting were the incidents that were related of his prowess among the whales but there was a dark cloud before all these glories in the eyes of mary pratt which for two years had disinclined her to listen to the young mans tale of love which had induced her to decline accepting a hand that had now been offered to her with a seamans ardour a seamans frankness and a seamans sincerity some twenty times at least which had induced her to struggle severely with her own heart which she had long found to be a powerful ally of her suitor that cloud came from a species of infidelity that is getting to be so widely spread in america as no longer to work in secret but which lifts its head boldly among us claiming openly to belong to one of the numerous sects of the land mary had reason to think that roswell gardiner denied the divinity of christ while he professed to honour and defer to him as a man far elevated above all other men and as one whose blood had purchased the redemption of his race  we will take this occasion to say that our legend is not polemical in any sense and that we have no intention to enter into discussions or arguments connected with this subject beyond those that we may conceive to be necessary to illustrate the picture which it is our real aim to drawthat of a confiding affectionate nay devoted womans heart in conflict with a deep sense of religious duty  still mary rejoiced that roswell gardiner was to command the sea lion whither this little vessel a schooner of about one hundred and forty tons measurement was to sail she had not the slightest notion but go where it might her thoughts and prayers were certain to accompany it these are womans means of exerting influence and who shall presume to say that they are without results and useless on the contrary we believe them to be most efficacious and thrice happy is the man who as he treads the mazes and wiles of the world goes accompanied by the petitions of such gentle and pureminded beings at home as seldom think of approaching the throne of grace without also thinking of him and of his necessities the romanists say and say it rightly too could one only believe in their efficacy that the prayers they offer up in behalf of departed friends are of the most endearing nature but it would be difficult to prove that petitions for the souls of the dead can demonstrate greater interest or bind the parties more closely together in the unity of love than those that are constantly offered up in behalf of the living  the interest that mary pratt felt in roswells success needs little explanation in all things he was most agreeable to her but in the one just mentioned their ages their social positions their habits their orphan condition even their prejudicesand who that dwells aside from the world is without them when most of those who encounter its collisions still cherish them so stronglyall united to render them of interest to each other nor was deacon pratt at all opposed to the connection on the contrary he appeared rather to favour it  the objections came solely from mary whose heart was nearly ready to break each time that she was required to urge them as for the uncle it is not easy to say what could induce him to acquiesce in to favour indeed the addresses to his niece and nearest relative of one who was known not to possess five hundred dollars in the world as his opinions on this subject were well known to all on oyster pond they had excited a good deal of speculation exercising the whole neighbourhood as was very apt to be the case whenever anything occurred in the least out of the ordinary track the several modes of reasoning were something like these  some were of opinion that the deacon foresaw a successful career to and eventual prosperity in the habits and enterprise of the young mate and that he was willing to commit to his keeping not only his niece but the three farms his money at use and certain shares he was known to own in a whaler and no less than three coasters as well as an interest in a store at southold that is to say to commit them all to the keeping of young garner when he was himself dead for no one believed he would part with more than mary in his own lifetime  others fancied he was desirous of getting the orphan off his hands in the easiest possible way that he might make a bequest of his whole estate to the theological institution that had been coquetting with him now for several years through its recognised agents and to which he had already made the liberal donation of one hundred dollars it was well ascertained that the agents of that institution openly talked of getting deacon pratt to sit for his portrait in order that it might be suspended among those of others of its benefactors  a third set reasoned differently from both the foregoing the garners were a better family than the pratts and the deacon being so well to do it was believed by these persons that he was disposed to unite money with name and thus give to his family consideration from a source that was somewhat novel in its history this class of reasoners was quite small however and mainly consisted of those who had rarely been off of oyster pond and who passed their days with garners island directly before their eyes a few of the gossips of this class pretended to say that their own young sailor stood next in succession after the immediate family actually in possession should run out of which there was then some prospect and that the deacon sly fellow knew all about it for this surmise to prevent useless expectations in the reader it may be well to say at once there was no foundation whatever roswells connection with the owner of the island being much too remote to give him any chance of succeeding to that estate or to anything else that belonged to him  there was a fourth and last set among those who speculated on the deacons favour towards young garner and these were they who fancied that the old man had opened his heart towards the young couple and was disposed to render a deserving youth and a beloved niece happy this was the smallest class of all and what is a little remarkable it contained only the most reckless and least virtuous of all those who dwelt on oyster pond the parson of the parish or the pastor as he was usually termed belonged to the second category that good man being firmly impressed that most if not all of deacon pratts worldly effects would eventually go to help propagate the gospel  such was the state of things when the deacon returned from meeting as related in the opening chapter at his nieces suggestion of sending to the harbour for dr sage he had demurred not only on account of the expense but for a still more cogent reason to tell the truth he was exceedingly distrustful of any ones being admitted to a communication with daggett who had revealed to him matters that he deemed to be of great importance but who still retained the key to his most material mystery nevertheless decency to say nothing of the influence of what folks would say the archimedean lever of all society of puritanical origin exhorted him to consent to his nieces proposal  it is such a roundabout road to get to the harbour mary the uncle slowly objected after a pause  boats often go there and return in a few hours  yes yesboats but im not certain it is lawful to work boats of a sabbath child  i believe sir it was deemed lawful to do good on the lords day  yes if a body was certain it would do any good to be sure sage is a capital doctoras good as any going in these partsbut half the time money paid for doctors stuff is thrown away  still i think it our duty to try to serve a fellowcreature that is in distress and daggett i fear will not go through the week if indeed he go through the night  i should be sorry to have him die exclaimed the deacon looking really distressed at this intelligence right sorry should i be to have him diejust yet  the last two words were uttered unconsciously and in a way to cause the niece to regret that they had been uttered at all but they had come notwithstanding and the deacon saw that he had been too frank the fault could not now be remedied and he was fain to allow his words to produce their own effect  die he will i fear uncle returned mary after a short pause and sorry should i be to have it so without our feeling the consolation of knowing we had done all in our power to save him or to serve him  it is so far to the harbour that no good might come of a messenger and the money paid him would be thrown away too  i dare say roswell gardner would be glad to go to help a fellowcreature who is suffering he would not think of demanding any pay  yes that is true i will say this for garner that he is as reasonable a young man when he does an odd job as any one i know i like to employ him  mary understood this very well it amounted to neither more nor less than the deacons perfect consciousness that the youth had again and again given him his time and his services gratuitously and that too more than once under circumstances when it would have been quite proper that he should look for a remuneration a slight colour stole over the face of the niece as memory recalled to her mind these different occasions was that sensitive blush owing to her perceiving the besetting weakness of one who stood in the light of a parent to her and towards whom she endeavoured to feel the affection of a child we shall not gainsay this so far as a portion of the feeling which produced that blush was concerned but certain it is that the thought that roswell had exerted himself to oblige her uncle obtruded itself somewhat vividly among her other recollections  well sir the niece resumed after another brief pause we can send for roswell if you think it best and ask him to do the poor man this act of kindness  your messengers after doctors are always in such a hurry i dare say garner would think it necessary to hire a horse to cross shelter island and then perhaps a boat to get across to the harbour if no boat was to be found it might be another horse to gallop away round the head of the bay why five dollars would scarce meet the cost of such a race  if five dollars were needed roswell would pay them out of his own pocket rather than ask another to assist him in doing an act of charity but no horse will be necessary the whaleboat is at the wharf and is ready for use at any moment  true i had forgotten the whaleboat if that is home the doctor might be brought across at a reasonable rate especially if garner will volunteer i dare say daggetts effects will pay the bill for attendance since they have answered as yet to meet the widow whites charges as i live here comes garner at this moment and just as we want him  i knew of no other to ask to cross the bays sir and sent for roswell before you returned had you not got back as you did i should have taken on myself the duty of sending for the doctor  in which case girl you would have made yourself liable i have too many demands on my means to be scattering dollars broadcast but here is garner and i dare say all will be made right  gardiner now joined the uncle and niece who had held this conversation in the porch having hastened up from the schooner the instant he received marys summons he was rewarded by a kind look and a friendly shake of the hand each of which was slightly more cordial than those that prudent and thoughtful young woman was accustomed to bestow on him he saw that mary was a little earnest in her manner and looked curious as well as interested to learn why he had been summoned at all sunday was kept so rigidly at the deacons that the young man did not dare visit the house until after the sun had set the new england practice of commencing the sabbath of a saturday evening and bringing it to a close at the succeeding sunset prevailing among most of the people of suffolk the episcopalians forming nearly all the exceptions to the usage sunday evening consequently was in great request for visits it being the favourite time for the young people to meet as they were not only certain to be unemployed but to be in their best roswell gardiner was in the practice of visiting mary pratt on sunday evenings but he would almost as soon think of desecrating a church as think of entering the deacons abode on the sabbath until after sunset or sundown to use the familiar americanism that is commonly applied to this hour of the day here he was now however wondering and anxious to learn why he had been sent for  roswell said mary earnestly slightly colouring again as she spoke we have a great favour to ask you know the poor old sailor who has been staying at the widow whiles this month or morehe is now very low so low we think he ought to have better advice than can be found on oyster pond and we wish to get dr sage over from the harbour how to do it has been the question when i thought of you if you could take the whaleboat and go across the poor man might have the benefit of the doctors advice in the course of a few hours  yes put in the uncle and i shall charge nothing for the use of the boat so that if you volunteer garner it will leave so much towards settling up the mans accounts when settling day comes  roswell gardiner understood both uncle and niece perfectly the intense selfishness of the first was no more a secret to him than was the entire disinterestedness of the last he gazed a moment in fervent admiration at mary then he turned to the deacon and professed his readiness to volunteer knowing the man so well he took care distinctly to express the word so as to put the mind of this votary of mammon at ease  garner will volunteer then rejoined the uncle and i shall charge nothing for the use of the boat this is doing as we would be done by and is all right considering that daggett is sick and among strangers the wind is fair or nearly fair to go and to come back and youll make a short trip of it yes it will cost nothing and may do the poor man good  now go at once roswell said mary in an entreating manner and show the same skill in managing the boat that you did the day you won the race against the harbour oarsmen  i will do all a man can to oblige you mary as well as to serve the sick if dr sage should not be at home am i to look for another physician mr pratt  sage must be at homewe can employ no other your old longestablished physicians understand how to consider practice and dont make mistakesby the way garner you neednt mention my name in the business at all just say that a sick man at the widow whites needs his services and that you had volunteered to take him across that will bring himi know the man  again gardiner understood what the deacon meant he was just as desirous of not paying the physician as of not paying the messenger mary understood him too and with a face still more sad than anxiety had previously made it she walked into the house leaving her uncle and lover in the porch after a few more injunctions from the former in the way of prudent precaution the latter departed hurrying down to the waterside in order to take to the boat     chapter iii      all that glisters is not gold   often have you heard that told   many a man his life hath sold   but my outside to behold    merchant of venice   no sooner was deacon pratt left alone than he hastened to the humble dwelling of the widow white the disease of daggett was a general decay that was not attended with much suffering he was now seated in a homely armchair and was able to converse he was not aware indeed of the real danger of his case and still had hopes of surviving many years the deacon came in at the door just as the widow had passed through it on her way to visit another crone who lived hard by and with whom she was in the constant habit of consulting she had seen the deacon in the distance and took that occasion to run across the road having a sort of instinctive notion that her presence was not required when the two men conferred together what was the subject of their frequent private communications the widow white did not exactly know but what she imagined will in part appear in her discourse with her neighbour the widow stone  heres the deacon agin cried the widow white as she bolted hurriedly into her friends presence this makes the third time he has been at my house since yesterday morning what can he mean  oh i dare say betsy he means no more than to visit the sick as he pretends is the reason of his many visits  you forget it is sabba day added the widow white with emphasis  the better day the better deed betsy  i know that but its dreadful often for a man to visit the sickthree times in twentyfour hours  yes t would have been more natral for a woman a body must own returned the widow stone a little drily had the deacon been a woman i dare say betsy you would not have thought so much of his visits  i should think nothing of them at all rejoined the sister widow innocently enough but it is dreadful odd in a man to be visiting about among the sick so muchand he a deacon of the meeting  yes it is not as common as it might be particularly among deacons but come in betsy and i will show you the text from which minister preached this morning its well worth attending to for it touches on our forlorn state hereupon the two relicts entered an inner room where we shall leave them to discuss the merits of the sermon interrupted by many protestations on the part of the widow white concerning the dreadful character of deacon pratts many visits to her cottage sabba days as well as week days  in the meanwhile the interview between the deacon himself and the sick mariner had its course after the first salutations and the usual inquiries the visiter with some parade of manner alluded to the fact that he had sent for a physician for the others benefit  i did it of my own head added the deacon or i might better say of my own heart it was unpleasant to me to witness your sufferings without doing something to alleviate them to alleviate sorrow and pain and the throes of conscience is one of the most pleasant of all the christian offices yes i have sent young garner across the bays to the harbour and three or four hours hence we may look for him back with dr sage in his boat  i only hope i shall have the means to pay for all this expense and trouble deacon returned daggett in a sort of doubting way that for a moment rendered his friend exceedingly uncomfortable go i know i must sooner or later but could i only live to get to the vineyard twould be found that my share of the old homestead would make up for all my wants i may live to see the end of the other business  among the other tales of daggett was one which said that he had never yet received his share of his fathers property an account that was true enough though the truth might have shown that the old man had left nothing worth dividing he had been a common mariner like the son and had left behind him a common mariners estate the deacon mused a moment and then he took an occasion to advert to the subject that had now been uppermost in his thoughts ever since he had been in the habit of holding secret conferences with the sick man what that subject was will appear in the course of the conversation that ensued  have you thought of the chart daggett asked the deacon and given an eye to that journal  both sir your kindness to me has been so great that i am not a man apt to forget it  i wish you would show me yourself the precise places on the chart where them islands are to be found there is nothing like seeing a thing with ones own eyes  you forget my oath deacon pratt every man on us took his bible oath not to point out the position of the islands until ater the year 1820 then each and all on us is at liberty to do as he pleases but the chart is in my chest and not only the islands but the key is so plainly laid down that any mariner could find em with that chest however i cannot part so long as i live get me well and i will sail in the sea lion and tell your captain garner all he will have occasion to know the mans fortune will be made who first gets to either of them places  yes i can imagine that easy enough from your accounts daggettbut how am i to be certain that some other vessel will not get the start of me  because the secret is now my own there was but seven on us in that brig all told of them seven four died at the islands of the fever homeward bound and of the other three the captain was drowned in the squall i told you of when he was washed overboard that left only jack thompson and me and jack i think must be the very man whose death i seed six months since as being killed by a whale on the false banks  jack thompson is so common a name a body never knows besides if he was killed by that whale he may have told the secret to a dozen before the accident  theres his oath agin it jack was sworn as well as all on us and he was a man likely to stand by what he swore to this was none of your customhouse oaths of which a chap might take a dozen of a morning and all should be false but it was an oath that put a seaman on his honour since it was a goodfellowship affair all round  deacon pratt did not tell daggett that thompson might have as good reasons for disregarding the oath as he had himself but he thought it these are things that no wise man utters on such occasions and this opinion touching the equality of the obligation of that oath was one of them  there is another hold upon jack continued daggrett after reflecting a moment he never could make any fist of latitude and longitude at all and he kept no journal now should he get it wrong he and his friends might hunt a year without finding either of the places  you think there was no mistake in the pirates account of that key and of the buried treasure asked the deacon anxiously  i would swear to the truth of what he said as freely as if i had seen the box myself they was necessitated as you may suppose or they never would have left so much gold in sich an uninhabited place but leave it they did on the word of a dying man  dyingyou mean the pirate i suppose  to be sure i do we was shut up in the same prison and we talked the matter over at least twenty times before he was swung off when they was satisfied i had nothing to do with the pirates i was cleared and i was on my way to the vineyard to get some craft or other to go ater these two treasures for one is just as much a treasure as tother when i was put ashore here its much the same to me whether the craft sails from oyster pond or from the vineyard  of course well as much to oblige you and to put your mind at rest as anything else ive bought this sea lion and engaged young roswell garner to go out in her as her master shell be ready to sail in a fortnight and if things turn out as you say a good voyage will she make all interested in her will have reason to rejoice i see but one thing needful just now and that is that you should give me the chart at once in order that i may study it well before the schooner sails  do you mean to make the vyge yourself deacon asked daggett in some surprise  not in person certainly was the answer im getting somewhat too old to leave home for so long a time and though born and brought up in sight of saltwater ive never tried it beyond a trip to york or one to boston still i shall have my property in the adventure and its natral to keep an eye on that now the chart well studied beforehand would be much more useful it seems to me than it can possibly be if taken up at a late hour  there will be time enough for captain garner to overhaul his chart well afore he reaches either of his ports returned the mariner evasively if i sail with him as i suppose i must nothing will be easier than for me to give all the courses and distances  this reply produced a long and brooding silence by this time the reader will have got a clue to the nature of the secret that was discussed so much and so often between these two men daggett finding himself sick poor and friendless among strangers had early cast about him for the means of obtaining an interest with those who might serve him he had soon got an insight into the character of deacon pratt from the passing remarks of the widow white who was induced to allude to the uncle in consequence of the charitable visits of the niece one day when matters appeared to be at a very low ebb with him and shortly after he had been put ashore the sick mariner requested an interview with the deacon himself the request had been reluctantly granted but during the visit daggett had managed so well to whet his visiters appetite for gain that henceforth there was no trouble in procuring the deacons company little by little had daggett let out his facts always keeping enough in reserve to render himself necessary until he had got his new acquaintance in the highest state of feverish excitement the schooner was purchased and all the arrangements necessary to her outfit were pressed forward as fast as prudence would at all allow the chart and the latitude and longitude were the circumstances over which daggett retained the control these he kept to himself though he averred that he had laid down on the charts that were in his chest the two important points which had been the subjects of his communications  although this man had been wily in making his revelations and had chosen his confidant with caution and sagacity most of that which he related was true he had belonged to a sealer that had been in a very high southern latitude where it had made some very important discoveries touching the animals that formed the objects of its search it was possible to fill a vessel in those islands in a few weeks and the master of the sealer daggett having been his mate had made all his people swear on their bible oaths not to reveal the facts except under prescribed circumstances his own vessel was full when he made the discoveries but misfortune befel her on her homewardbound passage until she was herself totally lost in the west indies and that in a part of the ocean where she had no business to be  in consequence of these several calamities daggett and one more man were the sole living depositories of the important information these men separated and as stated daggett had reason to think that his former shipmate had been recently killed by a whale the life and movements of a sailor are usually as eccentric as the career of a comet after the loss of the sealingvessel daggett remained in the west indies and on the spanish main for some time until falling into evil company he was imprisoned on a charge of piracy in company with one who better deserved the imputation while in the same cell the pirate had made a relation to daggett of all the incidents of a very eventful life among other things revealed was the fact that on a certain occasion he and two others had deposited a very considerable amount of treasure on a key that he described very minutely and which he now bestowed on daggett as some compensation for his present unmerited sufferings his companions having both been drowned by the upsetting of their boat on the return from the key in question subsequently this pirate had been executed and daggett liberated he was not able to get to the key without making friends and confidants on whom he could rely and he was actually making the best of his way to marthas vineyard with that intent when put ashore on oyster pond in most of that which this man had related to the deacon therefore he had told the truth though it was the truth embellished as is so apt to be the case with men of vulgar minds he might have been misled by the narrative of the pirate but it was his own opinion that he had not been the man was a scot prudent wary and sagacious and in the revelations he made he appeared to be governed by a conviction that his own course was run and that it was best that his secret should not die with him daggett had rendered him certain services too and gratitude might have had some influence  my mind has been much exercised with this matter of the hidden gold resumed the deacon after the long pause already mentioned you will remember that there may be lawful owners of that money should garner even succeed in finding it  t would be hard for em to prove their claims sir if what mcgosh told me was true accordin to his account the gold came from all sidesstarboard and larboard as a body might sayand it was jumbled together and so mixed that a young girl could not pick out her lovers keepsake from among the other pieces t was the arnins of three years cruisin as i understood him to say and much of the stuff had been exchanged in port especially to get the customhouse officers and kings officers out of its wake theres kings officers among them bloody spaniards deacon pratt all the same as among the english  be temperate in your language friend a rough speech is unseemly particularly of the lords day  daggett rolled the tobacco over his tongue and his eyes twinkled with a sort of leer which indicated that the fellow was not without some humour he submitted patiently to the rebuke however making no remonstrance against its reception  no no he added presently a starn chase they say is a long chase and the owners of them doubloons if owners they can now be called must be out of sight long before this accordin to mcgosh some of the gold raally captured had passed back through the hands of them that sent it to sea and they did not know their own children  it is certainly hard to identify coin and it would be a bold man who should stand up in open court and make oath to its being the same he had once held i have heard of the same golds having answered the purposes of twenty banks one piece being so like another  ay ay sir gold is gold and any of it is good enough for me though doubloons is my favourites when a fellow has got halfadozen doubloons alongside of his ribs he can look the landlord full in the eye and no one thinks of saying to sich as he its time to think of shipping agin  from the nature of this discourse it will not be easy for the reader to imagine the real condition of daggett at the very moment he was thus conversing of money and incidentally manifesting his expectations of accompanying roswell gardiner in the expedition that was about to sail the man had not actually fourandtwenty hours of life in him mary pratt had foreseen his true state accustomed as she was to administer to the wants of the dying but no one else appeared to be aware of it not even the deacon it was true that the fellow spoke as it might be from his throat only and that his voice was hollow and sometimes reduced to a whisper but he ascribed this himself to the circumstance that he had taken a cold whether the deacon believed this account or not it might be difficult to say but he appeared to give it full credit perhaps his mind was so much occupied with the subject of his discussions with daggett that it did not sufficiently advert to the real condition of the man  twice that afternoon did deacon pratt go between the cottage of the widow white and his own dwelling as often did the relict fly across the way to express her wonder to the widow stone at the frequency of the rich mans visits the second time that he came was when he saw the whaleboat rounding the end of shelter island and he perceived by means of his glass that dr sage was in it at this sight the deacon hurried off to the cottage again having something to say to daggett that could no longer be delayed  the whaleboat will soon be in he observed as soon as he had taken his seat and we shall shortly have the doctor here that young garner does what he has to do always with a jerk there was no such haste but he seems to be ever in a hurry  do what is to be done at once and then lie by is the sailors rule deacon rejoined the mariner squalls and gusts and reefin and brailin up and haulin down wont wait for the seamans leisure his work must be done at once or it will not be done at all im not afeard of the doctor so let him come as soon as he pleases medicine cant hurt a body if he dont take it  theres one thing i wish to say to you daggett before dr sage comes in talking too much may excite you especially talking of matters that are of interest and you may give him a false impression of your state should you get the pulse up and the cheek flushed by overtalking  i understand you deacon my secret is my secret and no doctor shall get it out of me as long as i know what i say im not so friendly with them as to seek counsel among doctors  then its the lords day added the pharisee and it is not seemly to dwell too much on worldly interests on the sabbath  a novice might have been surprised after what had passed at the exceeding coolness with which the deacon uttered this sentiment daggett was not so in the least however for he had taken the measure of his new confidants conscience and had lived long enough to know how marked was the difference between professions and practice nothing indeed is more common than to meet with those who denounce that in others which is of constant occurrence with themselves and who rail at vices that are so interwoven with their own moral being as to compose integral portions of their existence as for the deacon he really thought it would be unseemly and of evil example for daggett to converse with dr sage touching these doubloons of the lords day while he had felt no scruples himself a short hour before to make them the theme of a long and interesting discussion in his own person it might not repay us for the trouble to look for the salve that the worthy man applied to his own conscience by way of reconciling the apparent contradiction though it probably was connected with some fancied and especial duty on his part of taking care of the sick mans secrets sickness it is well known forms the apology for many an error both of omission and commission  dr sage now arrived a shrewd observant intelligent man who had formerly represented the district in which he lived in congress he was skilful in his profession and soon made up his mind concerning the state of his patient as the deacon never left him for a moment to him he first communicated his opinion after the visit as the two walked back towards the wellknown dwelling of the pratts  this poor man is in the last stages of a decline said the physician coolly and medicine can do him no good he may live a month though it would not surprise me to hear of his death in an hour  do you think his time so short exclaimed the deacon i was in hopes he might last until the sea lion goes out and that a voyage might help to set him up  nothing will ever set him up again deacon you may depend on that no seavoyage will do him any good and it is better that he should remain on shore on account of the greater comforts he will get does he belong on oyster pond  he comes from somewhere east answered the deacon careful not to let the doctor know the place whence the stranger had come though to little purpose as will presently be seen he has neither friend nor acquaintance here though i should think his effects sufficient to meet all charges  should they not be he is welcome to my visit answered the doctor promptly for he well understood the deacons motive in making the remark i have enjoyed a pleasant sail across the bays with young garner who has promised to take me back again i like boating and am always better for one of these sailing excursions could i carry my patients along half of them would be benefited by the pure air and the exercise  its a grateful thing to meet with one of your temperament doctorbut daggett  is this man named daggett interrupted the physician  i believe that is what he calls himself though a body never is certain of what such people say  thats true deacon your rambling houseless sailor is commonly a great liarat least so have i always found him most of their logbooks will not do to read or for that matter to be written out in full but if this mans name is really daggett he must come from the vineyard there are daggetts there in scores yes he must be a vineyard man  there are daggetts in connecticut as i know of a certainty  we all know that for it is a name of weight there but the vineyard is the cradle of the breed the man has a vineyard look about him too i dare say now he has not been home for many a day  the deacon was in an agony he was menaced with the very thing he was in the hope of staving off or a discussion on the subject of the sick mans previous life the doctor was so mercurial and quick of apprehension that once fairly on the scent he was nearly certain he would extract every thing from the patient this was the principal reason why the deacon did not wish to send for him the expense though a serious objection to one so niggardly being of secondary consideration when so many doubloons were at stake it was necessary however to talk on boldly as any appearance of hesitation might excite the doctors distrust the answers therefore came instantaneously  it may be as you say doctor returned the deacon for them vineyard folks anglice folk are great wanderers  that are they i had occasion to pass a day there a few years since on my way to boston and i found five women on the island to one man it must be a particularly conscientious person who could pass a week there and escape committing the crime of bigamy as for your bachelors i have heard that a poor wretch of that description who unluckily found himself cast ashore there was married three times the same morning  as the doctor was a little of a wag deacon pratt did not deem it necessary religiously to believe all that now escaped him but he was glad to keep him in this vein in order to prevent his getting again on the track of daggetts early life the device succeeded marthas vineyard being a standing joke for all in that quarter of the world on the subject of the ladies  mary was in the porch to receive her uncle and the physician it was unnecessary for her to ask any questions for her speaking countenance said all that was required in order to obtain an answer  hes in a bad way certainly young lady observed the doctor taking a seat on one of the benches and i can give no hope how long he may live is another matter if he has friends whom he wishes to see or if he has any affairs to settle the truth should be told him at once and no time lost  he knows nothing of his friends interrupted the deacon quite thrown off his guard by his own eagerness and unconscious at the moment of the manner in which he was committing himself on the subject of a knowledge of the sick mans birthplace not having been on the vineyard or heard from there since he first left home quite fifty years since  the doctor saw the contradiction and it set him thinking and conjecturing but he was too discreet to betray himself an explanation there probably was and he trusted to time to ascertain it  what has become of captain garner he asked looking curiously around as if he expected to find him tied to the nieces apronstring  mary blushed but she was too innocent to betray any real confusion  he has gone back to the schooner in order to have the boat ready for your return  and that return must take place young lady as soon as i have drunk two cups of your tea i have patients at the harbour who must yet be visited this evening and the wind goes down with the sun let the poor man take the draughts i have left for himthey will soothe him and help his breathingmore than this my skill can do nothing for him deacon you need say nothing of this visiti am sufficiently repaid by the air the sail and miss marys welcome i perceive that she is glad to see me and that is something between so young a woman and so old a man and now for the two cups of tea  the tea was drunk and the doctor took his leave shaking his head as he repeated to the niece that the medical science could do nothing for the sick man  let his friends know his situation at once deacon he said as they walked towards the wharf where the whaleboat was all ready for a start there is not an hour to lose now i think of it the flash captain smith is to take a cargo of oil to boston and sails tomorrow i can write a line by her as it is ten to one she will go into the hole all our craft get into that hole or into tarpaulin cove before they venture across the shoals and a letter addressed to any person of the name of daggett might find the right man ill write it this very evening  the announcement of this intention threw the deacon into a coldsweat but he did not think it prudent to say aught against it he had bought the sea lion engaged roswell gardiner and otherwise expended a large sum of money in the expectation of handling those doubloons to say nothing of the furs and here was a chance of all his calculations being defeated by the interference of impertinent and greedy relatives there was no remedy but patience and this the deacon endeavoured to exercise  deacon pratt did not accompany the doctor beyond the limits of his own orchard it was not deemed seemly for a member of the meeting to be seen walking out on the sabbath and this was remembered in season to prevent neighbourly comments it is true the doctor might furnish an apology but your strictly religious people when they undertake the care of other peoples consciences do not often descend to these particulars  no sooner had gardiner and the physician reembarked than the deacon returned to the cottage of the widow white here he had another long and searching discourse with the sick mariner poor daggett was wearied with the subject but dr sages predictions of an early termination of the case and the possibility that kinsmen might cross over from the vineyard in order to learn what the long absent man had in his possession acted on him as keen incentives by learning the most material facts now the sea lion might get so far ahead of all competitors as to secure the prizes even should daggett let others into the secret and start another vessel on the same expedition his own schooner was nearly ready for sea whereas time would be needed in order to make an entire outfit  but daggett did not appear to be disposed to be more communicative than heretofore he went over the narrative of the discovery of the sealingisland and gave a graphic account of the number and tame condition of the animals who frequented it a man might walk in their midst without giving the smallest alarm in a word all that a gang of good hands would have to do would be to kill and skin and secure the oil it would be like picking up dollars on a seabeach sadly sadly indeed was the deacons cupidity excited by this account a vivid picture of whales or seals having some such effect on the imagination of a true suffolk county man or more properly on that of an eastender as those who live beyond riverhead are termed as a glowing account of a prairie covered with wheat has on that of a wolverine or a buck eye or an enumeration of cent per cent has on the feelings of a wallstreet broker never before had deacon pratt been so much exercised with a love of mammon the pirates tale which was also recapitulated with much gusto scarce excited him as much as daggetts glowing account of the number condition and size of the seals  nothing was withheld but the latitudes and longitudes no art of the deacons and he practised many could extort from the mariner these most material facts without which all the rest were useless and the old man worked himself into a fever almost as high as that which soon came over daggett in the effort to come at these factsbut all in vain  at that hour the pulse of the sick man usually quickened but on this occasion it fairly thumped he had excited himself as well as his listener and the inconsiderate manner in which both had yielded up their energies to these enticing images of wealth contributed largely to increase the evil at length exhaustion came to put an end to the scene which was getting to be dramatic as well as revolting  so conscious was the deacon on returning home that evening that his mind was not in such a condition as it behoved him to keep it in on the lords day that he was afraid to encounter the placid eye of his devout and singleminded niece instead of joining her and uniting in the services that were customary at that hour he walked in the adjoining orchard until near nine oclock mammon was uppermost in the place of the deity and habit offered too strong a barrier to permit him to bring as it were the false god openly into the presence of the true     chapter iv      oh mourn not for them their grief is oer   oh weep not for them they weep no more   for deep is their sleep though cold and hard   their pillow may be in the old kirkyard    bayly   early on the succeeding morning the whole household of deacon pratt himself included were up and doing it was as the sun came up out of the waters that mary and her uncle met in the porch as if to greet each other  yonder comes the widow white and seemingly in a great hurry said the niece anxiously i am afraid her patient is worse  he seemed better when i left him last evening though a little tired with talking returned the uncle the man would talk do all i could to stop him i wanted to get but two or three words from him and he used a thousand without once using the few i wished most to hear a talking man is that daggett i can tell you mary  hell never talk agin deacon exclaimed the widow white who had got so near as to hear the concluding words of the last speakerhell never say good or evil more  the deacon was so confounded as to be speechless as for mary she expressed her deep regrets that the summons should have been so sudden and that the previous preparation was so small matters that gave her far more concern than any other consideration they were not long left to conjectures the voluble widow soon supplying all the facts that had occurred it appeared that daggett died in the night the widow having found him stiff and cold on visiting his bedside a few minutes before that this somewhat unexpected event as to the time at least was hastened by the excitement of the conversation mentioned there can be little doubt though no comment was made on the circumstance the immediate cause of death was suffocation from the effects of suppuration as so often occurs in rapid consumption  it would be representing deacon pratt as a worse man than he actually was to say that this sudden death had no effect on his feelings for a short time it brought him back to a sense of his own age and condition and prospects for half an hour these considerations troubled him but the power of mammon gradually resumed its sway and the unpleasant images slowly disappeared in others that he found more agreeable then he began seriously to bethink him of what the circumstances required to be done  as there was nothing unusual in the death of daggett the investigations of the coroner were not required it was clearly a natural though a sudden death it remained therefore only to give directions about the funeral and to have an eye to the safekeeping of the effects of the deceased the deacon assumed the duty of taking charge of everything the chest of daggett was removed to his house for safekeeping the key having been taken from the pocket of his vest and the necessary orders were given for the final disposition of the body  the deacon had another serious and even painful half hour when he first looked upon the corpse there it lay a senseless shell deserted by its immortal tenant and totally unconscious of that subject which had so lately and so intensely interested them both it appeared as if the ghastly countenance expressed its sense of the utter worthlessness of all earthly schemes of wealth and happiness eternity seemed stamped upon the pinched and sunken features not eternity in the sense of imperishable matter but in the sense of the fate of man had all the gold of the indies lain within his reach the arm of daggett was now powerless to touch it his eye could no longer gloat upon treasure nor any part of his corporeal system profit by its possession a more striking commentary on the vanity of human wishes could not just then have been offered to the consideration of the deacon his moral being was very strangely constituted from early childhood he had been accustomed to the cant of religion and in many instances impressions had been made on him that produced effects that it was easy to confound with the fruits that real piety brings forth this is a result that we often find in a state of society in which appearances are made to take the place of reality what is more it is a result that we may look for equally among the formalists of established sects and among the descendants of those who once deserted the homes of their fathers in order to escape from the impiety of so meretricious an abuse of the substance of godliness in the case of the latter appearances occupy the mind more than that love of god which is the one great test of human conversion from sin to an improving state of that holiness without which we are told no man shall see his creator without which indeed no man could endure to look upon that dread being face to face  the deacon had all the forms of godliness in puritanical perfection he had never taken the name of his god in vain throughout the course of a long life but he had abstained from this revolting and gratuitous sin more because it was a part of the teachings of his youth so to do and because the neighbours would have been shocked at its commission than because he felt the deep reverence for his maker which it became the insignificant being that was the work of his hand to entertain and which would of itself most effectually have prevented any wanton use of his holy name let the neighbours feel or think as they might on the subject in this way deacon pratt might be said to have respected most of the commands of the decalogue not however because the spirit of god impelled him through love to reverence and obey but because he had been brought up in a part of the country where it was considered seemly and right to be moral to the senses at least if not to the allseeing eye above it was in this way that the deacon had arrived at his preferment in the meeting he had all the usual sectarian terms at the end of his tongue never uttered a careless expression was regular at meeting apparently performed all the duties that his church required of its professors in the way of mere religious observances yet was he as far from being in that state which st paul has described succinctly as for me to live in christ and to die is gain as if he had been a pagan it was not the love of god that was active in his soul but the love of self and he happened to exhibit his passion under these restrained and deceptive forms simply because he had been born and educated in a state of society where they composed an integral part of existence covetousness was the deacons besetting sin and as it is a vice that may be pretty well concealed with a little attention to appearances it was the less likely to expose him to comments than almost any other sin it is true that the neighbourhood sometimes fancied him close or as they expressed it cluss and men got to look sharply to their own interests in their dealings with him but on the whole there was perhaps more reason to apprehend in such a community that the example of so good a man should be accepted as authority than that his acts should impeach his character or endanger his standing  very different were the situation feelings and motives of the niece she devoutly loved god and as a consequence all of those whom he had created and placed around her her meek and gentle spirit led her to worship in sincerity and truth and all that she thought said and did was under the correction of the principles such motives could best produce her womans love for roswell gardiner alone troubled her otherwise happy and peaceful existence that indeed had caused her more than once to falter in her way but she struggled with the weakness and had strong hopes of being able to overcome it to accept of any other man as a husband was in her eyes impossible with the feelings she was fully conscious of entertaining towards him it would have been both indelicate and unjust but to accept him while he regarded the redeemer as only man however pure and exalted she felt would be putting herself willingly or wilfully into the hands of the great enemy of her salvation often and often had she prayed for her lover even more devoutly and with hotter tears than she had ever prayed for herself but so far as she could discover without any visible fruits his opinions remained unchanged and his frank nature forbade him from concealing their state from mary in this way then was unhappiness stealing on the early and innocent hours of one who might otherwise have been so contented and blessed it formed a somewhat peculiar feature in her case that her uncle favoured the views of her suitor this rendered the trials of the niece so much the more severe as she had no other judgment to sustain her than her own fortified as that was however by the consciousness of right and the support of that great power which never deserts the faithful  such was the state of feeling among some of the principal actors of our tale when the sudden death of daggett occurred the body was not removed from the house of the widow white but the next morning it was conveyed to the graveyardchurchyard would have sounded too episcopaland interred in a corner that was bestowed on the unhonoured and unknown it was then only that the deacon believed he was the sole depository of the important secrets he had the charts in his possession and no more revelations could pass the lips of daggett should the friends of the deceased sailor hear of his death and come to look after his effects there was very little probability of their finding anything among them to furnish a clue to either the new sealingground or to the buried treasure of the pirate in order to be secured he even went a little beyond his usual precautions actually discharging all indebtedness of the deceased to the widow white out of his own pocket by giving to her the sum of ten dollars this was handsome compensation in her eyes as well as in his and he quieted the suspicions so great and unusual an act of liberality would be apt to awaken by saying he would look to the friends or if they failed him to the effects for his returns for it was better he should lose by the stranger than a lone widow he also paid for the coffin the digging of the grave and the other light expenses of the interment in a word the deacon endeavoured to hush all impertinent inquiries by applying the salve of silver wherever it was needed  the chest had been removed to a large light closet that communicated with the deacons own room when all his accounts were settled thither he repaired armed with the key that was to expose so much treasure to his longing eyes some slight qualms arose after he had locked himself in the room touching the propriety of his opening the chest it was not his certainly but he put such a construction on the nature of the revelations of daggett as he thought would fully justify him in proceeding he had purchased the schooner expressly to go in quest of the seals and the treasure this he had done with daggetts knowledge and acquiescence nor did he conceive that his own rights were lessened by the mariners decease as for himself the deacon had never believed that the marthas vineyard man could accompany the expedition so that his presence or absence could have no influence on his own rights it is true the deacon possessed no direct legal transfer of the charts but he inferred that all the previous circumstances gave him sufficient claims to justify him in at least looking into their contents  it was a solemn as well as an anxious moment to the deacon when he first raised the lid of the chest solemn because it was not possible to forget the recent decease of its late owner and anxious inasmuch as he had no certainty that he should find even on the charts the places of which he sought the latitudes and longitudes certainly nothing like treasure presented itself to his eyes when all that daggett had left behind him lay exposed to view the chest of a common sailor is usually but illfurnished unless it may be just after his return from a long and wellpaid voyage and before he has had time to fall back on his purchases of clothes as a fund to supply his cravings for personal gratification this of daggetts formed no exception to the rule the few clothes it contained were of the lightest sort having been procured in warm climates and were well worn in addition the palms needles and shells and carving in whalebone had all been sold to meet their owners wants and nothing of that sort remained there were two old dirty and ragged charts and on these the deacon laid his hands much as the hawk in its swoop descends on its prey as it did however a tremor came over him that actually compelled him to throw himself into a chair and to rest for a moment  the first of the charts opened the deacon saw at a glance was that of the antarctic circle there sure enough was laid down in ink three or four specks for islands with lat °  and long °  written out at its side we are under obligations not to give the figures that stand on the chart for the discovery is deemed to be important by those who possess the secret even to the present hour we are at liberty to tell the whole story with this one exception and we shall proceed to do so with a proper regard to the pledges made in the premises  the deacon scarcely breathed as he assured himself of the important fact just mentioned and his hands trembled to such a degree as to fairly cause the paper of the chart to rattle then he had recourse to an expedient that was strictly characteristic of the man he wrote the latitude and longitude in a memorandumbook that he carried on his person after which he again sat down and with great care erased the island and the writing from the chart with the point of a penknife this done his mind felt infinitely relieved nor was this all charts purchased for the schooner were lying on a table in his own room and he projected on one of them as well as his skill would allow the sealingislands he had just removed from the chart left by daggett there he also wrote in pencil the important figures that we are commanded not to reveal  the second chart was then opened it was of the west indies and particularly of certain keys one of these last was pointed out in a way to leave no doubt that it was meant for the key indicated by the pirate the same prohibition existing as to this key that exists in respect to the sealingisland we cannot be more explicit the writing near this key being in pencil it was effectually removed by means of indiarubber when this was done the deacon used the precaution to rub some material on the clean place made by his knife on the other chart when he believed no eye could detect what had just been done having marked the proper key on his own chart of the west indies he replaced the charts of daggett in the chest and locked all up again the verbal accounts of the sick mariner he had already transferred to paper and he now believed himself secure of all the information that was necessary to render him the richest man in suffolk  when they next met mary was surprised at the gaiety of her uncle and that so soon after a funeral he had a lightened heart however for after leading him on step by step until he had gone so far as to purchase and fit out the schooner daggett had pertinaciously refused to enter into those minute particulars which it is even now forbidden us to state and a want of which would have rendered his previous expenditures useless death however had lifted the veil and the deacon now believed himself secure in his knowledge  an hour or two later deacon pratt and his niece were seated in company with two others at the dinnertable the fare was simple but good fish enters largely into the domestic consumption of all those who dwell near the water in that part of the country and on that particular occasion the uncle had in the lightness of his heart indulged in what for him was a piece of extravagance in all such regions there are brokendown elderly men who live by taking fish liquor has usually been their great enemy and all have the same generic character of laziness shiftless and illregulated exertions followed by much idleness and fits of intemperance that in the end commonly cause their deaths such a man fished between oyster pond and shelter island being known to all who dwelt within his beat by the familiar appellation of baiting joe  shortly after the discovery of the latitudes and longitudes on the charts the deacon had gone to the wharf in his impatience to see how roswell gardiner got on with the sea lion the young man with his gang of hands was hard at work and a very material difference was to be observed in the state of the schooner from that in which she was described in our opening chapter her rigging had all been set up every spar was in its place and altogether she had a look of preparation and completeness her water was taking in and from time to time a country wagon or an oxcart delivered alongside articles belonging to her stores of cargo proper there was none or next to none a sealer carrying little besides salt and her stores in a word the work was rapidly advancing and captain garner told his impatient owner that the craft would be ready to put to sea in all that week  i have succeeded in engaging the first officer i wanted added the young man and he is now busy in looking up and shipping hands at stonington we must get halfadozen reliable men on the main and then we can take some of our neighbours here as beginners just to please them  yes ship a goodly number of green hands said the deacon zealously they work at cheap lays and leave the owners the greater profits well well captain garner things seem to be doing well in your hands and i will leave you about two hours after dinner i shall want to have a word with you in private and will thank you just to step across to the house where you will be certain to find me baiting joe seems to have hooked something there in arnest  that has he ill answer for it that he has a sheepshead at the end of his line that will weigh eight or ten pounds  the words of gardiner proved true for joe actually pulled in a fish of the description and weight he had just mentioned it was this sight that in the lightness of his heart tempted the deacon to a little extravagance joe was called ashore and after a good deal of chaffering the deacon bought the prize for half a dollar as mary was celebrated for her skill in preparing this particular fish the deacon before he left the wharf with the sheepshead hanging from one hand fairly invited captain garner so to time his visit to the house as to be present at the feast  nor was this all before the deacon had settled with joe the rev mr whittle came on the wharf confessedly in quest of something to eat the regular occupations of this divine were writing sermons preaching holding conferences marrying christening and burying and hunting up something to eat about half of his precious time was consumed in the last of these pursuits we do not wish to represent this clergyman as having an undue gastronomic propensity but as having a due one and a salary that was so badly paid as quite to disable him from furnishing his larder or cellar with anything worth mentioning in advance now he was short of flour then the potatoes were out next the pork was consumed and always there was a great scarcity of groceries and other necessaries of that nature this neglect on the part of the parishioners coupled with a certain improvidence on that of the pastor left the clergymans family completely in that state which is usually described as being in the from hand to mouth condition and which consequently occupied so large a portion of the good mans time in providing  deacon pratt felt a little conscious and awkward at encountering the rev mr whittle it was not the fish that caused the first any concern fifty times had he met and gone by his pastor running about with a perplexed and hungry look when his own hands or chaise or wagon as the case might be contained enough to render the divines family happy and contented for a week no compunctions of that sort ever troubled the deacons breast but he had missed the afternoons meeting the last sabbath a delinquency for which he felt an awkwardness in accounting while he saw its necessity the salutations passed as usual the one party thinking intently on the absence from service and the other of the sheepshead now it happily occurred to the deacon to invite his pastor also to partake of the fish there was enough for all and though no one on oyster pond was much in the habit of entertaining at dinner it was by no means unusual for the parishioners to have their pastor for a guest this lucky invitation so occupied the parties that nothing was said about an occurrence so very unusual as the deacons absence from meeting the last sabba day afternoon  by these simple means the party at table consisted of the deacon himself mary roswell gardiner and the rev mr whittle the fish was excellent being so fresh and so skilfully prepared and mary was highly complimented by all who ate of it for her share in the entertainment but mary pratt seemed sad she had not yet recovered from the melancholy feelings awakened by the recent death and funeral and then her thoughts recurred with few interruptions to the long voyage of roswell and most especially to the unhappy state of religious belief in which he would undertake so hazardous an expedition several times had she hinted to the clergyman her desire that he would talk to roswell but the good man though wellenough inclined had really so much to do in providing that it was not a very easy matter for him to go beyond the beaten track in order to probe the consciences of particular individuals he promised fairly but always forgot to perform and in this he imitated closely the example set him by his parishioners in reference to his own salary  roswell gardiner therefore remained in his unbelief or what was tantamount to it under the influence of a set of opinions that conflicted with all that the church had taught since the time of the apostlesat least so thought mary and so think we  on the contrary the pastor and the deacon were particularly gay for men of their habitual sobriety although those were not the days of temperance par excellence neither of the guests was what might be termed even a moderate drinker for a novelty in a sailor roswell gardiner seldom touched anything but water while the other two took their rum and water but it was in moderation as all the gifts of god should be used as for the intemperate cry which makes it a sin to partake of any liquor however prudently it was then never heard in the land on the whole the clergy of all denominations might be set down as brandyandwater men a few occasionally carrying out their principle to exaggeration but the rev mr whittle was a sober man and though he saw no great harm in enlivening his heart and cheering his spirits with brandy taken in small quantities he was never known to be any the worse for his libations it was the same with the deacon though he drank rumandwater of choice and no other beverage marys currantwine and cider excepted was ever seen on his table  one thing may be said of liquor whether it be in its favour or not it usually brings out all there is of the facetious in a man rendering him conversable and pleasant for the time being at least this was apt to be peculiarly the case with the rev mr whittle and his deacons in their ordinary intercourse with their fellowcreatures these good people had taken up the idea that in order to be religious their countenances must be sombre and that care and anxiety should be stamped on their faces just as if they had no confidence in the efficacy of the redemption few indeed are they who vindicate their professions by living at peace with god and man at oyster pond it was much the fashion to imagine that the more a person became impressed with the truths of his and articularly with those of her lost condition the more it became the party to be cynical and to pry into and comment on the backslidings of the entire community this weakness however was characteristic of neither the pastor nor the deacon each of whom regarded his professions too much in the light of a regular business transaction to descend into these little abuses as for mary good creature her humility was so profound as to cause her to believe herself among the weakest and least favoured of all who belonged to meeting  i was sorry that my late journey into connecticut prevented my seeing the poor man who was so suddenly taken away from the house of widow white observed the rev mr whittle some little time after he had made his original attack on the sheepshead they tell me it was a hopeless case from the first  so dr sage considered it answered the deacon captain garner volunteered to go across for the doctor in my boat with a heavy emphasis on the possessive pronounand we had him to look at the patient but if the saltwater be good for consumptive people as some pretend i think there is generally little hope for seamen whose lungs once give way  the poor man was a mariner was he i did not know his calling but had rather got the impression that he was a husbandman did he belong to oyster pond  no we have none of the name of daggett here which is a tribe on the vineyard most of the daggetts are seafaring folks folk anglice and this man was one of that class i believe though i know nothing of him or of his pursuits except by a word here and there dropped in discourse  the deacon thought himself safe in venturing this little departure from the literal truth inasmuch as no one had been present or he thought no one had ever been present at his many secret conferences with the deceased mariner little however did he understand the character of the widow white if he flattered himself with holding any discourse under her roof in which she was not to participate in its subject so far from this having been the case the good woman had contrived to obtain not only a listeningplace but a peepinghole where she both heard and saw most of that which passed between her guest and the deacon had her powers of comprehension been equal to her will or had not her mind been prepossessed with the notion that the deacon must be after herself old suffolk would have rung with the marvels that were thus revealed not only would an unknown sealingisland been laid before the eastenders but twenty such islands and keys without number each of which contained more hidden treasure than garners island oyster pond the plumb and fishers and all the coasts of the sound put together enriched as each and all of these places were thought to be by the hidden deposits of kidd  nothing but an accident had prevented these rumours from being circulated it happened that on only one occasion daggett was explicit and connected in his narrative at all other times his discourse was broken consisting more in allusions to what had been previously said than in direct and clear revelations the widow most unfortunately for her means of information was with neighbour stone when the connected narrative was given and all that she knew was disjointed obscure and a little contradictory still it was sufficient to set her thinking intensely and sufficient to produce a material influence on the future fortunes of the sea lion as will appear in the sequel  it is always a misfortune for a human being to take his departure away from home and friends observed the rev mr whittle here was an immortal soul left to take its last great flight unsupported i dare say except by the prayers of a few pious neighbours i regret having been absent during the time he was here getting home of a friday only i was compelled to devote saturday to preparations for the sabbath and sabbathnight as i understand it he departed  we are all in the hands of divine providence said the deacon with a sober mien and it is our duty to submit to my thinking oyster pond catches more of its share of the poor and needy who are landed from vessels passing east and west and add considerably to our burthens  this was said of a spot as much favoured by divine providence in the way of abundance as any other in highlyfavoured america some eight or ten such events as the landing of a stranger had occurred within the last halfcentury and this was the only instance in which either of them had cost the deacon a cent but so little was he accustomed and so little was he disposed to give that even a threatened danger of that sort amounted in his eyes nearly to a loss  well exclaimed the literal roswell gardiner i think deacon that we have no great reason to complain southold shelter island and all the islands about here for that matter are pretty well off as to poor and it is little enough that we have to pay for their support  thats the idea of a young man who never sees the taxgatherers returned the deacon however there are islands captain garner that are better off still and i hope you will live to find them  is our young friend to sail in the sea lion in quest of any such inquired the pastor a little curiously  the deacon now repented him of the allusion but his heart had warmed with the subject and the rumandwater had unlocked some of its wards so timid and nervous had he become however that the slightest indication of anything like a suspicion that his secrets were known threw him into a sweat  not at allnot at allthe captain goes on wellknown and beaten groundsam what is wanting now  here is baiting joe comed up from the wharf wanting to see master returned a greyheaded negro who had formerly been a slave and who now lived about the place giving his services for his support  baiting joe he is not after his sheepshead i hopeif he is he is somewhat late in the day  ay ay put in the young sailor laughingtell him sam that no small part of it is bound to the southward meaning to cross the line in my company and that right soon  i paid joe his halfdollar certainlyyou saw me pay him captain garner  i dont think its any sich thing master there is a stranger with joe that he has ferried across from shelter island and hes comed up from the wharf too yesthats it master  a stranger who could it be a command was given to admit him and no sooner did mary get a sight of his person than she quietly arose to procure a plate in order that he too might have his share of the fish     chapter v      stranger i fled the home of grief   at connoeht morans tomb to fall   i found the helmet of my chief   his bow still hanging on our wall    campbell   amphibious exclaimed roswell gardiner in an aside to mary as the stranger entered the room following baiting joes lead the last only came for his glass of rumandwater served with which by the aid of the negro he passed the back of his hand across his mouth napkinfashion nodded his goodday and withdrew as for the stranger roswell gardiners term being particularly significant it may be well to make a brief explanation  the word amphibious is or rather was well applied to many of the seamen whalers and sealers who dwelt on the eastern end of long island or the vineyard around stonington and perhaps we might add in the vicinity of new bedford the nantucket men had not base enough in the way of terra firma to come properly within the category the class to which the remark strictly applied were sailors without being seamen in the severe signification of the term while they could do all that was indispensably necessary to take care of their vessels were surpassed by no other mariners in enterprise and daring and hardihood they knew little about crowning cables carrickbends and all the mysteries of knotting graffing and splicing a regular delawarebay seaman would have turned up his nose in contempt at many of their ways and at much of their real ignorance but when it came to the drag or to the oar or to holding out in bad weather or to any of the more manly qualities of the business he would be certain to yield his respect to those at whom it had originally been his disposition to laugh it might best describe these men to say that they bore some such relation to the thoroughbred tar as the volunteer bears to the regular soldier  as a matter of course the stranger was invited to take his seat at the table this he did without using many phrases and mary had reason to believe by his appetite that he thought well of her culinary skill there was very little of the sheepshead left when this its last assailant shoved his plate back the signal that he could do no more he then finished a glass of rumandwater and seemed to be in a good condition to transact the business that had brought him there until this moment he had made no allusion to the motive of his visit leaving the deacon full of conjectures  the fish of peconic and garners is as good as any i know coolly observed this worthy after certainly having established some claim to give an opinion on the subject we think ourselves pretty well off in this respect on the vineyard  on the vineyard interrupted the deacon without waiting to hear what was to follow  yes sir on marthas vineyardfor thats the place i come from perhaps i ought to have introduced myself a little more particularlyi come from marthas vineyard and my name is daggett  the deacon fairly permitted the knife with which he was spreading some butter to fall upon his plate daggett and the vineyard sounded ominously could it be that dr sage had managed to get a message so far in so short a time and had this amphibious inhabitant of the neighbouring island come already to rob him of his treasure the perceptions of the deacon at first were far from clear and he even imagined that all he had expended on the sea lion was thrown away and that he might be even called on to give some sort of an account in a court of chancery of the information obtained from the deceased a little reflection however sufficed to get the better of this weakness and he made a civil inclination of his head as much as to tell the stranger notwithstanding his name and place of residence that he was welcome of course no one but the deacon himself knew of the thoughts that troubled him and after a very brief delay the guest proceeded with his explanations of the object of his visit  the daggetts are pretty numerous on the vineyard continued the stranger and when you name one of them it is not always easy to tell just what family he belongs to one of our coasters came into the hull holmes hole was meant a few weeks since and reported that she spoke an inwardbound brig off new haven from which she heard that the people of that craft had put ashore at oyster pond a seafaring man who belonged to the vineyard and who was bound home arter an absence of fifty years and whose name was thomas daggett the word passed through the island and a great stir it made among all us daggetts theres plenty of our vineyard people wandering about the arth and sometimes one drops in upon the island just to die as most of them that come back bring something with them its genrally thought a good sign to hear of their arrival after casting about and talking with all the old folks it has been concluded that this thomas daggett must be a brother of my fathers who went to sea about fifty years since and has never been seen or heard of since hes the only person of the name for whom we cant account and the family have got me to come across to look him up  i am sorry mr daggett that you are so late answered the deacon slowly as if unwilling to give pain had you come last week you might have seen and conversed with your relation or had you come early this morning only you might have attended his funeral he came among us a stranger and we endeavoured to imitate the conduct of the good samaritan i believe he had all the comforts that oyster pond can give and certainly he had the best advice dr sage of sag harbour attended him in his last illnessdr sage of the harbour doubtless you have heard him mentioned  i know him by reputation and make no doubt all was done that could be done as the sloop i named lay by the brig some time in a calm the two captains had a long talk together and ours had prepared us to hear of our kinsmans speedy dissolution he was in a decline when he landed and we suppose that no human skill could have saved him as he had so skilful a physician and one who came so far i suppose my uncle must have left property  this was a homethrust but fortunately for the deacon he had already prepared himself with an answer  seafaring men that are landed on points and capes from inwardbound vessels are not very apt to be overloaded with worldly goods he said smiling when a man prospers in that calling he usually comes ashore at a wharf in some large place and gets into his coach to ride up to some grand tavern i have remarked pastor that seafaring men love comforts and freeliving unaccountably when they can fairly get a chance at em  that is natural deaconquite natural and what is natural is very likely to happen the natural man loves all sorts of indulgences and these among others  as there was no gainsaying this commonplace commentary on the species it was permitted to pass unanswered  i hope my kinsman has not been a burthen to any on oyster pond said the nephew inquiringly  i cannot say that he has returned the deacon he was at little cost at first and got along by selling a few odd things that he owned as providence had placed him in the dwelling of a poor widow i thought it might be pleasing to the friendsand every man has some friends i supposeto settle with her this i did this very morning taking her receipt in full as you can see passing the paper to the stranger as a sort of security for my advances i had the chest of the deceased removed to this house and it is now upstairs ready to be examined it feels light and i do not think much silver or gold will be found in it  to own the truth the vineyard seaman looked a little disappointed it was so natural that a man who has been absent fifty years should bring back the fruits of his labour that he had expected some slight reward for the trouble he was now taking to be bestowed in this particular form this however was not the specific object of his visit as will appear as we proceed keeping in view his real motive the nephew continued his inquiries always putting his questions a little indirectly and receiving answers that were as evasive and cautious as his own interrogatories all this was characteristic of the wary people from which both had sprung who seldom speak in a matter of business without bearing in mind all the possible constructions of what they are saying after a discourse of some fifteen minutes in which the history of the chest in its outlines was fully given and during which the stranger produced written evidence of his right to interfere it was determined to make an inventory on the spot of the property left by daggett for the benefit of all who might have any interest in it accordingly the whole party including mary was soon assembled in the deacons own room with the seachest placed invitingly in the centre all eyes were fastened on the lid in curious anticipations of the contents for the deacon excepted all supposed that those contents were a profound secret the widow white could have told them better she having rummaged that chest a dozen times at least though without abstracting even a pin curiosity had been her ruling motive far more than cupidity it is true the good woman had a prudent regard to her own interests and felt some anxiety to learn the prospects of her receiving the stipulated price for boardonly 150 per weekbut the sales of the needles and palms and carved whalebone having kept her accounts reasonably square solicitude on this particular interest was not at is height no curiosity pure female curiosity a little quickened by the passion which is engendered among the vulgar by the possession of a slight degree of instruction was really at the bottom of her researches not only had she handled every article in the chest but she had read and reread every paper it contained halfadozen letters included and made her own surmises on their nature still the good woman was very little the wiser for her inquiries of the great secret she knew absolutely nothing unless the broken hints collected in her many listenings could be so considered but here her ignorance ceased every hole in a shirt every patch in a pair of trousers and every darn in a stocking had been examined and its probable effect on the value of the garment duly estimated the only thing that had escaped her scrutiny was a small till that was locked into that she could not look and there were moments when she would have parted with a finger in order to overhaul it  this jacket might sell for a dollar had the widow white calculated but for the hole in the elbow and that well patched would bring seventyfive cents them trowsers must have cost two dollars but they arnt worth half price now that peejacket is the best article in the chest and sent across to the harbour about the time the ships are going out it would bring enough to maintain daggett a month  such had been the character of the widows visitations to the chest though no one knew anything of her discoveries not even her sisterrelict neighbour stone  here is the key said the deacon producing that instrument from the drawer of a table as if he had laid it carefully aside for some such moment i dare say it will be found to fit for i remember to have seen daggett use it once or twice myself  roswell gardiner as the youngest man and the one on whom the labouring oar ought to fall now took the key applied it to the lock turned it without difficulty and then lifted the lid disappointment appeared on every face but that of the deacon at the meagre prospect before the company not only was the chest more than half empty but the articles it did contain were of the coarsest materials well worn seaclothes that had seen their best days and which had never been more than the coarse common attire of a foremast hand  there is little here to pay a man for crossing from the vineyard observed roswell gardiner a little drily for he did not half like the appearance of cupidity that shone through the nephews tardy concern for the fate of the uncle the last voyage has not been prosperous i fear or the owners failed before the vessel got in what is to be done with all this dunnage deacon  it would be best to take out the contents article by article answered the other and examine each and all now that we have made a beginning with the inventory it is best to go through with it  the young man obeyed calling out the name of each article of dress as he raised it from its receptacle and passing it over to him who stood there in the character of a sort of heiratlaw the last gave each garment a sharp look and prudently put his hand into every pocket in order to make sure that it was empty before he laid the article on the floor nothing was discovered for some time until a small key was found in the fob of a pair of old goashore pantaloons as there was the till to the chest already mentioned and a lock on that till the heir atlaw kept the key saying nothing touching its existence  the deceased does not appear to have been much afflicted with this worlds wealth said the rev mr whittle whose expectations to own the truth had been a little disappointed this may have been all the better for him when the moment of departure drew near  i dare say he would have borne the burthen cheerfully put in roswell gardiner to have been a little more comfortable i never knew a person seaman or landsman who was ever the worse for having things snug about him and for holding on to the better end of his cheer as long as he could  your notion of what is best for man as he draws near to his end captain garner is not likely to be of the most approved nature the sea does not produce many very orthodox divines  the young sailor coloured bit his lip cast a glance at mary and began a nearly inaudible whistle in a moment he forgot the rebuke he had received and laughingly went on with the inventory  well he cried this is rather a poorer outfit than jack is apt to carry infit i suppose it should be called as the poor fellow who owned it was inward bound when he brought up on oyster pond youll hardly think it worth while captain daggett to take this dunnage across to the vineyard  it is scarce worth the trouble though friends and relations may set a value on it that strangers do not i see a couple of charts therewill you hand them this way if you please they may have a value with a seafaring man as old mariners sometimes make notes that are worth as much as the charts themselves  this was said very naturally and simply but it gave the deacon a good deal of concern nor was this feeling at all lessened by the earnest not to say eager manner in which daggett as we shall now call this member of the family spread the chart on the bed and began to pry into its records the particular chart first opened in this way was the one including the antarctic circle and of course was that from which the deacon had been at so much pains to erase the sealingislands that the deceased mariner had laid down with so great precision and care it was evident that the marthas vineyardman was looking for something that he could not find and that he felt disappointment instead of looking at the chart indeed he may be said to have been peering at it in all its holes and crannies of which there were not a few in consequence of the torn condition of the paper several minutes elapsed ere the investigation terminated the stranger seeming all that time to feel no interest in the remainder of his relations wardrobe  this is an old chart and of the date of 1802 observed daggett raising himself erect as a man who has long been bent takes the creaks out of his back so old a chart as to be of little use nowaday our sealers have gone over so much of the ground to the southward of the two capes as to be able to do much better than this now  your uncle had the appearance of an oldfashioned sailor coldly observed the deacon and it may be that he most liked oldfashioned charts  if such was the case he must have pretty well forgotten his vineyard schooling there is not a woman there who doesnt know that the latest chart is commonly the best i own im disappinted somewhat for the master of the sloop gave me to understand he had heard from the master of the brig that some valuable information was to be found on the old gentlemans charts  the deacon started as here was an indication that the deceased had talked of his knowledge to others as well as to himself it was so natural for a man like daggett to boast of what his charts were worth that he saw the extreme probability that a difficulty might arise from this source it was his cue however to remain silent and let the truth develop itself in due course his attention was not likely to be drawn aside by the shirts and old clothes for the stranger began a second time to examine the chart and what was more in the high latitudes at no great distance from the very spot where the sealingislands had been placed and from which they had been so carefully erased  it is unaccountable that a man should wear out a chart like this and leave so few notes on it said the vineyardman much as one complains of a delinquency here is white water noted in the middle of the ocean where i dare say no other white water was seen but that which is made by a fish and nothing is said of any islands what do you think of this captain garner laying his finger on the precise spot where the deacon had been at work so long that very morning erasing the islands this looks wellfingered if nothing else eh  its a shoal laid down in dirt answered roswell gardiner laughinglets see thats about lat °  and long °  there can be no known land thereaway as even captain cook did not succeed in getting as far south thats been a favourite spot with the skipper for taking hold of his chart ive known one of those oldfashioned chaps put his hand on a chart in that way and never miss his holding ground for three years on a stretch mighty gobyrule people are some of our whalingmasters in particular who think they know the countenances of some of the elderly fish who are too cunning to let a harpoon get fast to em  youve been often in them seas i some think captain garner said the other inquiringly  i was brought up in the business and have a hankering for it yet returned the young man frankly nor do i care so much for charts they are well enough when a vessel is on her road but as for whales or seals the man who wishes to find either in these times has to look for them as i tell my owner according to reports the time has been when a craft had only to get an offing to fall in with something that was worth putting a harpoon into but those days are gone captain daggett and whales are to be looked after out at sea much as money is to be looked for ashore here  is the craft i saw at the wharf fitting out for a whaler then  she is going after luck and will accept of it in whatever form it may turn up  she is rather small for the whaling business though vessels of that size have done well by keeping close in upon our own coast  we shall know better what she will do after she has been tried returned gardiner evasively what do you think of her for the banks of newfoundland  the marthas vineyardman gave his brother tar a quick impatient glance which pretty plainly said tell that to the marines when he opened the second chart which as yet had been neglected  sure enough he muttered in a low tone though loud enough to be heard by the keenly attentive deacon here it isa chart of the west indies and of all the keys  by this casual spontaneous outbreaking as it might be the deacon got another clue to the strangers knowledge that gave him increased uneasiness he was now convinced that by means of the masters of the brig and the sloop such information had been sent to the relatives of daggett as had prepared them to expect the very revelations on which he hoped to establish his own fortunes to what extent these revelations had been made of course he could only conjecture but there must have been a good deal of particularity to induce the individual who had come over to oyster pond to look into the two charts so closely under the circumstances therefore he felicitated himself on the precaution he had so early taken to erase the important notations from the paper  captain garner your eyes are younger than mine said the vineyardman holding the chart up to the lightwill you be good enough to look heredoes it not seem as if that key had been noted and the words rubbed off the chart  this caused the deacon to peer over roswell gardiners shoulder and glad enough was he to ascertain that the stranger had placed his finger on a key that must lie several hundred miles from that which was supposed to hold the buried treasure of the pirates something like an erasure did appear at the indicated point but the chart was so old and dirty that little satisfaction could be had by examining it should the inquirer settle down on the key he evidently had in his eye all would be well since it was far enough from the spot really noted  it is strange that so old a seafaring man should wear out a chart and make no observation on it repeated the stranger who was both vexed and at a loss what to conjecture all my charts are written over and marked off just as if i meant to get out an edition for myself  men differ in their tastes and habits answered roswell gardiner carelessly some navigators are for ever finding rocks and white water and scribbling on their charts or in the newspapers when they get back but i never knew any good come of it the men who make the charts are most to be trusted for my part i would not give a sixpence for a note made by a man who passes a shoal or a rock in a squall or a gale  what would you say to the note of a sealer who should lay down an island where the seals lie about on the beach like pigs in a pen sunning themselves would you not call a chart so noted a treasure  that would alter the case sure enough returned gardiner laughing though i should not think of looking into this chest for any such riches most of our masters navigate too much at random to make their charts of any great value they can find the places they look for themselves but dont seem to know how to tell other people the road i have known my old man lay down a shoal that he fancied he saw quite a degree out of the way now such a note as that would do more harm than good it might make a foul wind of a fair one and cause a fellow to go about or ware ship when there was not the least occasion in the world for doing anything of the sort  ay ay this will do for nervous men who are always thinking they see danger ahead but it is different with islands that a craft has actually visited i do not see much use deacon pratt in your giving yourself any further trouble my uncle was not a very rich man i perceive and i must go to work and make my own fortune if i wish more than ive got already if there is any demand against the deceased i am ready to discharge it  this was coming so much to the point that the deacon hardly knew what to make of it he recollected his own ten dollars and the covetousness of his disposition so far got the better of his prudence as to induce him to mention the circumstance  dr sage may have a chargeno doubt has one that ought to be settled but your uncle mainly paid his way as he went on i thought the widow who took care of him was entitled to something extra and i handed her ten dollars this morning which you may repay to me or not just as you please  captain daggett drew forth his wallet and discharged the obligation on the spot he then replaced the charts and without opening the till of the chest he shut down the lid locked it and put the key in his pocket saying that he would cause the whole to be removed much as if he felt anxious to relieve the deacon of an incumbrance this done he asked a direction to the dwelling of the widow white with whom he wished to converse ere he left the point  i shall have the questions of so many cousins to answer when i get home he said smiling that it will never do for me to go back without taking all the talk i can get with me if you will be kind enough to show me the way captain garner i will promise to do as much for you when you come to hunt up the leavings of some old relation on the vineyard  roswell gardiner very cheerfully complied not observing the look of dissatisfaction with which his owner listened to the request away the two went then and were soon at the widows door here the young man left his companion having duty to attend to on board the sea lion the widow white received her guest with lively interest it forming one of the greatest pleasures of her existence to be imparting and receiving intelligence  i dare say you found my uncle a companionable man observed the captain as soon as amicable relations were established between the parties by means of a few flattering remarks on one side and on the other the vineyard folks are generally quite conversable  that he was captain daggett and when the deacon had not been over to perplex him and wake up the worldly spirit in him he was as well inclined to preparation as any sick person i ever waited on to be sure it was different arter the deacon had paid one of his visits  was deacon pratt in the habit of coming to read and pray with the sick  he pray i dont believe he as much as went through a single sentence of a prayer in all his visits their whull talk was about islands and seals when they was by themselves  indeed exclaimed the nephew manifesting a new interest in the discourse and what could they find to say on such subjects islands and seals were a strange topic for a dying man  i know itanswered the widow sharply i knowd it at the time but what could a lone woman do to set em right and he a deacon of the meetin the whull time if they would talk of worldly things at such times it wasnt for one like me to put em right  then this discourse was held openly in your presencebefore your face as it might be maam  i cant say that it was just that nor was it altogether when my back was turned they talked and i overheard what was said as will happen when a body is about you know  the stranger did not press the point having been brought up in what might almost be termed a land of listeners an island that is cut off from much communication with the rest of the earth and from which twothirds of the males must be periodically absent would be very likely to reach perfection in the art of gossiping which includes that of the listener  yes he answered one picks up a good deal he doesnt know how so they talked of islands and seals  thus questioned the widow cheerfully opened her stores of knowledge as she proceeded in her account of the secret conferences between deacon pratt and her late inmate her zeal became quickened and she omitted nothing that she had ever heard besides including a great deal that she had not heard but her companion was accustomed to such narratives and knew reasonably well how to make allowances he listened with a determination not to believe more than half of what she said and by dint of long experience he succeeded in separating the credible portions of the womans almost breathless accounts from those that ought to have been regarded as incredible with a surprising degree of success the greatest difficulty in the way of comprehending the widow whites report arose from the fact that she had altogether missed the preliminary and most explicit conference this left so much to be understood and inferred that in her own efforts to supply the deficiencies she made a great deal of confusion in the statements captain daggett was fully assured that the deacon knew of the existence of the sealingisland at least though he was in doubt whether the rumour that had been brought to him touching the buried treasure had also been imparted to this person the purchase and equipment of the sea lion taken in connection with the widows account were enough of themselves to convince one of his experience and foresight that an expedition after seal was then fitting out on the information derived from his deceased relative of this much he had no doubt but he was not able to assure himself quite so satisfactorily that the key was to be looked at by the way  the interview between captain daggett and the widow white lasted more than an hour in that time the former had gleaned all the information the latter could give and they parted on the best terms in the world it is true that the captain gave the widow nothinghe had acquitted his conscience on this score by repaying the deacon the money the last had advancedbut he listened in the most exemplary manner to all she had to say and with a certain class of vehement talkers the most favoured being in the world is your good listener interest had given the stranger an air of great attention and the delighted woman had poured out her torrent of words in a way that gratified in the highest degree her intense desire to be imparting information when they separated it was with an understanding that letters on the same interesting subject should pass between them  that afternoon captain daggett found means to remove the chest of his late kinsman across the bays to sag harbour whither he proceeded himself by the same conveyance there he passed an hour or two in making inquiries touching the state of equipment and the probable time of the departure of the sea lion the fitting out of this schooner was the cause of a good deal of discourse in all that region and the marthas vineyardman heard numberless conjectures but very little accurate information on the whole however he arrived at the conclusion that the sea lion would sail within the next ten days that her voyage was to be distant that her absence was expected to exceed a twelvemonth and that it was thought she had some other scheme in view in addition to that of sealing that night this hardy marinerhalf agriculturist as he wasgot into his whaleboat and sailed for the vineyard all alone taking the chest with him this was nothing however for quite often before had he been off at sea in his boat alone looking out for inwardbound vessels to pilot     chapter vi      launch thy bark mariner     christian god speed thee   let loose the rudderbands     good angels lead thee   set thy sails warily     tempests will come   steer thy course steadily     christian steer home    mrs southey   the visit of captain daggett taken in connection with all that he had said and done while on oyster pond and at sag harbour had the effect greatly to hasten the equipments of the sea lion deacon pratt knew the characters of the seamen of the island too well to trifle in a matter of so much moment how much the vineyard folk had been told in reference to his great secrets he did not know but he felt assured that they knew enough and had learned enough in this visit to quicken all their desires for riches and to set them in motion towards the antarctic circle with such a people distance and difficulties are of no account a man who has been cradling oats today in his own retired fields where one would think ambition and the love of change could never penetrate being ready to quit home at twentyfour hours notice assuming the marlingspike as he lays aside the fork and setting forth for the uttermost confines of the earth with as little hesitation as another might quit his home for an ordinary journey of a week such did the deacon well know was the character of those with whom he had now to deal and he foresaw the necessity of the utmost caution perseverance diligence and activity  philip hazard the mate mentioned by roswell gardiner was enjoined to lose no time and the men engaged for the voyage soon began to cross the sound and to make their appearance on board the schooner as for the craft herself she had all that was necessary for her wants below hatches and the deacon began to manifest some impatience for the appearance of two or three men of particular excellence of whom phil hazard was in quest and whom captain gardiner had made it a point should be obtained little did the worthy owner suspect that the vineyard people were tampering with these very hands and keeping them from coming to terms in order that they might fit out a second sea lion which they had now been preparing for near a month having purchased her at new bedford with a view to profit by the imperfect information that had reached them through the masters of the brig and sloop the identity in the name was accidental or it might be better to say had been naturally enough suggested by the common nature of the enterprise but once existing it had been the means of suggesting to the vineyard company a scheme of confounding the vessels out of which they hoped to reap some benefit but which it would be premature now fully to state  after a delay of several days hazard sent across from stonington a man by the name of watson who had the reputation of being a firstclass sealer this accession was highly prized and in the absence of his mates both of whom were out looking for hands roswell gardiner to whom command was still novel consulted freely with this experienced and skillful mariner it was fortunate for the schemes of the deacon that he had left his young master still in the dark as respected his two great secrets gardiner understood that the schooner was to go after seals sealions seaelephants and all animals of the genus phoca but he had been told nothing concerning the revelations of daggett or of the real motives that had induced him to go so far out of his usual course in the pursuit of gain we say it was fortunate that the deacon had been so wary for watson had no intention whatever to sail out of oyster pond having been actually engaged as the second officer of the rival sea lion which had been purchased at new bedford and was then in an active state of forwardness in its equipments with a view to compete with the craft that was still lying so quietly and unconsciously alongside of deacon pratts wharf in a word watson was a spy sent across by the vineyardmen to ascertain all he could of the intentions of the schooners owner to worm himself into gardiners confidence and to report from time to time the state of things generally in order that the eastenders might not get the start of his real employers it is a common boast of americans that there are no spies in their country this may be true in the everyday signification of the term though it is very untrue in all others this is probably the most spying country in christendom if the looking into other peoples concerns be meant extensive and recognised systems of espionage exist among merchants and nearly every man connected with the press has enlisted himself as a sort of spy in the interests of politicsmany in those of other concerns also the reader therefore is not to run away with impressions formed under general assertions that will scarce bear investigation and deny the truth of pictures that are drawn with daguerreotype fidelity because they do not happen to reflect the cant of the day the man watson who had partially engaged to go out in the sea lion captain roswell gardiner was not only a spy but a spy sent covertly into an enemys camp with the meanest motives and with intentions as hostile as the nature of the circumstances would permit  such was the state of things on oyster pond for quite a week after the nephew had been to look after the effects of the deceased uncle the schooner was now quite ready for sea and her master began to talk of hauling off from the wharf it is true there was no very apparent reason why this step preliminary to sailing should be taken in that port where there were so few opportunities for her peoples running into excesses but it sounded shipshape and captain gardiner had been heard to express an intention to that effect the men arrived but slowly from the main and something like impatience was manifested by the young commander who had long before got all his green hands or youths from the neighbourhood on board and was gradually breaking them in to the ways of a vessel indeed the best reason he could give to himself for hauling off was the practice it might give to these lads with the oars  i dont know what hazard and green are aboutcalled out roswell gardiner to his owner the first being on the quarterdeck of the sea lion and the last on the wharf while watson was busy in the mainrigging theyve been long enough on the main to ship a dozen crews for a craft of this size and we are still short two hands even if this man sign the papers which he has not yet done by the way watson its time we saw your handwriting  im a poor scholar captain garner returned the cunning mariner and it takes time for me to make out even so small a matter as my name  ay ay you are a prudent fellow and i like you all the better for it but you have had leisure and a plenty of it too to make up your mind you must know the schooner from her keel up by this time and ought to be able to say now that you are willing to take lucks chances in her  ay ay sir thats all true enough so far as the craft is concerned if this was a west india vyge i wouldnt stand a minute about signing the articles nor should i make much question if the craft was large enough for a common whalin vyge but sealin is a different business and one onprofitable hand may make many an onprofitable lay  all this is true enough but we do not intend to take any unprofitable hands or to have any unprofitable lays you know me  oh if all was like you captain garner i wouldnt stand even to wipe the pen your repitation was made in the southward and no man can dispute your skill  well both mates are old hands at the business and we intend that all the ables shall be as good men as you are yourself  it needs good men sir to be operatin among some of them seaelephants seadogs for seadogs is my sayin they tell of seals getting scurce but i say its all in knowin the businesstheres young captain garner says i thats fittin out a schooner for some onknown part of the world says i maybe for the south pole fortiknow or for some sich outoftheway hole now hell come back full or im no judge o the business says i  well if this is your way of thinking you have only to clap your name to the articles and take your lay  ay ay sir when ive seed my shipmates there isnt the business under the sun that so much needs that every man should be true as the seaelephant trade smaller animals may be got along with with a narvous crew perhaps but when it comes to the raal old bulls or bulldogs as a body might better call em give me stout hearts as well as stout hands  well now to my notion watson it is less dangerous to take a seaelephant than to fasten to a regular old bullwhale that may be has had half a dozen irons in him already  yes sir thats sometimes skeary work too though i dont think so much of a whale as i do of a seaelephant or of a sealion let me know my shipmates say i on a sealin expedition  captain garner said the deacon who necessarily overheard this discourse you ought to know at once whether this man is to go in the schooner or not the mates believe he is and may come across from the main without a hand to take his place should he leave us the thing should be settled at once  im willing to come to tarms this minute returned watson as boldly as if he were perfectly sincere only let me understand what i undertake if i knowd to what islands the schooner was bound it might make a difference in my judgment  this was a welldevised question of the spys though it failed of its effect in consequence of the deacons great caution in not having yet told his secret even to the master of his craft had gardiner known exactly where he was about to go the desire to secure a hand as valuable as watson might have drawn from him some imprudent revelation but knowing nothing himself he was obliged to make the best answer he could  going he said why we are going after seals to be sure and shall look for them where they are most to be found as experienced a hand as yourself ought to know where that is  ay ay sir answered the fellow laughingits just neither here nor therethats all  captain garner interrupted the deacon solemnly this is trifling and we must come to terms with this man or write to mr hazard to engage another in his place come ashore sir i have business with you up at the house  the serious manner in which this was uttered took both the captain and the man a little by surprise as for the first he went below to conceal his goodlooking throat beneath a black handkerchief before he followed the deacon where it was most probable he should meet with mary while he was thus occupied watson came down out of the mainrigging and descended into the forecastle as the young captain was walking fast towards the dwelling of deacon pratt watson came on deck again and hailed baiting joe who was fishing at no great distance from the wharf in a few minutes watson was in joes boat bag and allhe had not brought a chest on boardand was under way for the harbour from the harbour he sailed the same evening in a whaleboat that was kept in readiness for him carrying the news over to holmess hole that the sea lion of oyster pond would certainly be ready to go out as early as the succeeding week although watson thus seemingly deserted his post it was with a perfect understanding with his real employers he had need of a few days to make his own preparations before he left the 41st degree of north latitude to go as far south as a vessel could proceed he did not however leave his post entirely vacant one of deacon pratts neighbours had undertaken for a consideration to let the progress of events be known and tidings were sent by every opportunity reporting the movements of the schooner and the prospects of her getting to sea these last were not quite as flattering as roswell gardiner hoped and believed the agents of the vineyard company having succeeded in getting away two of hazards best men and as reliable sealers were not to be picked up as easily as pebbles on a beach the delay caused by this new stroke of management might even be serious all this time the sea lion of holmes hole was getting ahead with untiring industry and there was every prospect of her being ready to go out as soon as her competitor but to return to oyster pond  deacon pratt was in his porch ere roswell gardiner overtook him there the deacon gave his young friend to understand he had private business of moment and led the way at once into his own apartment which served the purposes of office bedroom and closet the good man being accustomed to put up his petition to the throne of mercy there as well as transact all his temporal affairs shutting the door and turning the key not a little to roswells surprise the old man faced his companion with a most earnest and solemn look telling him at once that he was now about to open his mind to him in a matter of the last concern the young sailor scarce knew what to think of it all but he hoped that mary was in some way connected with the result  in the first place captain garner continued the deacon i must ask you to take an oath  an oath deaconthis is quite new for the sealing businessas ceremonious as uncle sams people  yes sir an oath and an oath that must be most religiously kept and on this bible without the oath our whole connection must fall through captain garner  rather than that should happen deacon i will cheerfully take two oaths one to clench the other  it is well i ask you roswell garner to swear on this holy book that the secrets i shall now reveal to you shall not be told to any other except in a manner prescribed by myself that in no other mans employment will you profit by them and that you will in all things connected with them be true and faithful to your engagements to me and to my interestsso help you god  roswell gardiner kissed the book while he wondered much and was dying with curiosity to know what was to follow this great point secured the deacon laid aside the sacred volume opened a drawer and produced the two allimportant charts to which he had transferred the notes of daggett  captain garner resumed the deacon spreading the chart of the antarctic sea on the bed you must have known me and my ways long enough to feel some surprise at finding me at my time of life first entering into the shipping concern  if ive felt any surprise deacon it is that a man of your taste and judgment should have held aloof so long from the only employment that i think fit for a man of real energy and character  ay this is well enough for you to say as a seaman yourself though you will find it hard to persuade most of those who live on shore into your own ways of thinking  that is because people ashore think and act as they have been brought up to do now just look at that chart deacon see how much of it is water and how little of it is land minister whittle told us only the last sabbath that nothing was created without a design and that a wise dispensation of divine providence was to be seen in all the works of nature now if the land was intended to take the lead of the water would there have been so much more of the last than of the first deacon that was the idea that came into my mind when i heard the ministers words and had not mary  what of mary demanded the deacon perceiving that the young man paused  only i was in hopes that what you had to say deacon might have some connection with her  what i have to say is better worth hearing than fifty marys as to my niece garner you are welcome to her if she will have you and why she does not is to me unaccountable but you see that chartlook at it well and tell me if you find anything new or remarkable about it  it looks like old times deacon and here are many places that i have visited and know what have we here islands laid down in pencil with the latitude and longitude in figures who says there is land thereaway deacon pratt if i may be so free as to ask the question  i doand capital good land it is for a sealing craft to get alongside of them islands garner may make your fortune as well as mine no matter how i know they are thereit is enough that i do know it and that i wish you to carry the sea lion to that very spot as straight as you can go fill her up with elephants oil ivory and skins and bring her back again as fast as she can travel  islands in that latitude and longitude said roswell gardiner examining the chart as closely as if it were of very fine print indeedi never heard of any such land before  tis there notwithstanding and like all land in distant seas that men have not often troubled plentifully garnished with what will pay the mariner well for his visit  of that i have little doubt should there be actually any land there it may be a cape fly away that some fellow has seen in thick weather the ocean is full of such islands  this is none of them it is bony fidy arth as i know from the man who trod it you must take good care garner and not run the schooner on itwith a small chuckling laugh such as a man little accustomed to this species of indulgence uses when in high goodhumour i am not rich enough to buy and fit out sea lions for you to cast em away  thats a high latitude deacon to carry a craft into cook himself fell short of that somewhat  never mind cookhe was a kings navigatormy man was an american sealer and what he has once seen he knows where to find again there are the islandsthree in number and there you will find em with animals on their shores as plenty as clamshells on the south beach  i hope it may be so if land is there and youll risk the schooner ill try to get a look at it i shall want you to put it down in black and white however that im to go as high as this  you shall have any authority a man may ask on that point there can be no difficulty between me and you the risk of the schooner must be mine of course but i rely on you to take as good care of her as a man can go then direct to that point and fill up the schooner but garner my business doesnt end with this as soon as the schooner is full you will come to the southward and get her clear of everything like ice as fast as possible  that i should be very likely to do deacon though you had said nothing on the subject  yes by all accounts them are stormy seas and the sooner a body is shut of them the better and now garner i must swear you again i have another secret to tell you and an oath must go with each kiss this sacred volume once more and swear to me never to reveal to another that which i am about to reveal to you unless it may be in a court of law and at the command of justice so help you god  what a second oath deaconyou are as bad as the customhouses which take you on all tacks and dont believe you when youve done surely im sworn in already  kiss the book and swear to what i have put to you said the deacon sternly or never go to sea in a craft of mine never to reveal what i shall now tell you unless compelled by justice so help you god  thus cornered roswell gardiner hesitated no longer but swore as required kissing the book gravely and reverently this was the young mans first command and he was not going to lose it on account of so small a matter as swearing to keep his owners secrets having obtained the pledge the deacon now produced the second chart which was made to take the place of the other on the bed  there he exclaimed in a sort of triumphthat is the real object of your voyage  that key why deacon that is in north latitude °  and you make a crooked road of it truly when you tell me to go as far south as °  in order to reach it  it is well to have two strings to a bodys bow when you hear what you are to bring from that key you will understand why i send you south before you are to come here to top off your cargo  it must be with turtle then said roswell gardiner laughing nothing grows on these keys but a few stunted shrubs and nothing is ever to be found on them but turtle once in a while a fellow may pick up a few turtle if he happen to hit the right key  garner rejoined the deacon still more solemnlythat island low and insignificant as it is contains treasure pirates made their deposits here a long time ago and the knowledge of that fact is now confined to myself  the young man stared at the deacon as if he had some doubts whether the old man were in his right mind he knew the besetting weakness of his character well and had no difficulty in appreciating the influence of such a belief as that he had just expressed on his feelings but it seemed so utterly improbable that he living on oyster pond should learn a fact of this nature which was concealed from others that at first he fancied his owner had been dreaming of money until its images had made him mad then he recollected the deceased mariner the deacons many conferences with him the interest he had always appeared to take in the man and the suddenness as well as the time of the purchase of the schooner and he at once obtained a clue to the whole affair  daggett has told you this deacon prattsaid gardiner in his offhand way and he is the man who has told you of those sealingislands too  admitting it to be so why not daggett as well as any other man  certainly if he knew what he was saying to be truebut the yarn of a sailor is not often to be taken for gospel  daggett was near his end and cannot be classed with those who talk idly in the pride of their health and strengthmen who are ever ready to saytush god has forgotten  why was this told to you when the man had natural friends and relatives by the dozen over on the vineyard  he had been away from the vineyard and them relatives fifty years a length of time that weakens a bodys feelings considerably take you away from mary only a fourth part of that time and you would forget whether her eyes are blue or black and altogether how she looks  if i should a most miserable and contemptible dog should i account myself no deacon twice fifty years would not make me forget the eyes or the looks of mary  ay so all youngsters think and feel and talk but let em try the world and theyll soon find out their own foolishness but daggett made me his confidant because providence put me in his way and because he trusted to being well enough to go in the schooner and to turn the expedition to some account in his own behalf  had the man the impudence to confess that he had been a pirate and helped to bury treasure on this key  that is not by any means his history daggett was never a pirate himself but accident placed him in the same prison and same room as that in which a real pirate was confined there the men became friends and the condemned prisoner for such he was in the end gave this secret to daggett as the last service he could do him  i hope deacon you do not expect much in the way of profit from this part of the voyage  i expect the most from it garner as you will too when you come to hear the whole story  the deacon then went into all the particulars of the revelations made by the pirate to his fellowprisoner much as they had been given by daggett to himself the young man listened to this account at first with incredulity then with interest and finally with a feeling that induced him to believe that there might be more truth in the narrative than he had originally supposed possible this change was produced by the earnest manner of the deacon as much as by the narrative itself for he had become graphic under the strong impulses of that which with him was a master passion so deep had been the impression made on the mind of the old man by daggetts account and so intense the expectations thereby awakened that he omitted nothing observed the most minute accuracy in all his details and conveyed just as distinct impressions to his listener as had been conveyed to himself when the story was first told to him  this is a most extrornary account take it on whatever tack you will exclaimed roswell gardiner as soon as a pause in the deacons story enabled him to put in another word the most extrornary tale i ever listened to how came so much gold and silver to be abandoned for so long a time  them three officers hid it there fearing to trust their own crew with it in their vessel their pretence was to stop for turtle just as you must do whilst the hands were turtling the captain and his mates walked about the key and took occasion to make their deposits in that hole on the coral rock as you have heard me say oh its all too natural not to be true  roswell gardiner saw that the old mans hopes were too keenly excited to be easily cooled and that his latent covetousness was thoroughly awakened of all the passions to which poor human nature is the slave the love of gold is that which endures the longest and is often literally carried with us to the verge of the grave indeed in minds so constituted originally as to submit to an undue love of money the passion appears to increase as others more dependent on youth and strength and enterprise and ambition gradually become of diminished force slowly but surely usurping the entire sway over a being that was once subject to many masters thus had it been with the deacon nearly all his passions now centred in this one he no longer cared for preferment in politics though once it had been the source of a strong desire to represent suffolk at albany even the meeting and its honours was loosening its hold on his mind while his fellowmen his kindred included were regarded by him as little more than so many competitors or tools  a lie may be made to seem very natural answered roswell gardiner if it has been put together by one who understands knotting and splicing in such matters did this daggett name the amount of the sum that he supposed the pirates may have left on that key  he did returned the deacon the whole of his narrow and craving soul seeming to gleam in his two sunken eyes as he answered according to the account of the pirate there could not have been much less than thirty thousand dollars and nearly all of it in good doubloons of the coin of the kingsdoubloons that will weigh their full sixteens to the pounday and to spare  the sea lions cargo well chosen and well stowed would double that deacon if the right animals can only be found  may be sobut just think gardnerthis will be in good bright coined gold  but what right can we have to that gold even admitting that it is there and can be found  right exclaimed the deacon staring does not that which divine providence gives man become his own  by the same rule it might be said divine providence gave it to the pirates there must be lawful owners to all this money if one could only find them  ay if one could only find them harkee garner have you spent a shilling or a quarter lately  a good many of both deacon answered the young man again betraying the lightness of his heart with a laugh i wish i had more of your saving temper and i might get rich yes i spent a quarter only two hours since in buying fish for the cabin of old baiting joe  well tell me the impression of that quarter had it a head or only pillars what was its date and in whose reign was it struck maybe it was from the mint at philadelphiaif so had it the old eagle or the new in a word could you swear to that quarter garner or to any quarter you ever spent in your life  perhaps not deacon a fellow doesnt sit down to take likenesses when he gets a little silver or gold  nor is it very probable that any one could saythat is my doubloon  still there must be a lawful owner to each piece of that money if any such money be there returned roswell gardiner a little positively have you ever talked with mary deacon on this subject  i talk of such a matter with a woman do you think im mad garner if i wanted to have the secret run through old suffolk as fire runs over the salt meadows in the spring i might think of such a thing but not without i have talked with no one but the master of the craft that i am about to send out in search of this gold as well as in search of the sealingislands i have shown you had there been but one object in view i might not have ventured so much but with two before my eyes it would seem like flying in the face of divine providence to neglect so great an opportunity  roswell gardiner saw that arguments would avail nothing against a cupidity so keenly aroused he abstained therefore from urging any more of the objections that suggested themselves to his mind but heard all that the deacon had to tell him taking full notes of what he heard it would seem that daggett had been sufficiently clear in his directions for finding the hidden treasure provided always that his confidant the pirate had been as clear with him and had not been indulging in a mystification the probability of the last had early suggested itself to one of deacon pratts cautious temperament but daggett had succeeded in removing the impression by his forcible statements of his friends sincerity there was as little doubt of the sincerity of the belief of the marthas vineyard mariner as there was of that of the deacon himself  the day that succeeded this conference the sea lion hauled off from the wharf and all communications with her were now made only by means of boats the sudden disappearance of watson may have contributed to this change men being more under control with a craft at her moorings than when fast to a wharf three days later the schooner lifted her anchor and with a light air made sail she passed through the narrow but deep channel which separates shelter island from oyster pond quitting the waters of peconic altogether there was not an air of departure about her notwithstanding the deacon was not much concerned and some of roswell gardiners clothes were still at his washerwomans circumstances that were fully explained when the schooner was seen to anchor in gardiners bay which is an outer roadstead to all the ports and havens of that region     chapter vii     walk in the light so shalt thou know     that fellowship of love   his spirit only can bestow     who reigns in light above   walk in the light and sin abhorrd     shall neer defile again   the blood of jesus christ the lord     shall cleanse from every stain    bernard barton   about an hour after the sea lion of oyster pond had let go her anchor in gardiners bay a coasting sloop approached her coming from the westward there are two passages by which vessels enter or quit long island sound at its eastern termination the main channel is between plum and fishers islands and from the rapidity of its currents is known by the name of the race the other passage is much less frequented being out of the direct line of sailing for craft that keep midsound it lies to the southward of the race between plum island and oyster pond point and is called by the anglosaxon appellation of plum gut the coaster just mentioned had come through this latter passage and it was the impression of those who saw her from the schooner that she was bound up into peconic or the waters of sag harbour instead of luffing up into either of the channels that would have carried her into these places however she kept off crossing gardiners bay until she got within hail of the schooner the wind being quite light there was time for the following short dialogue to take place between the skipper of this coaster and roswell gardiner before the sloop had passed beyond the reach of the voice  is that the sea lion of oyster pond demanded the skipper boldly  ay ay answered roswell gardiner in the sententious manner of a seaman  is there one watson of marthas vineyard shipped in that craft  he was aboard here for a week but left us suddenly as he did not sign articles i cannot say that he run  he changed his mind then returned the other as one expresses a slight degree of surprise at hearing that which was new to him watson is apt to whiffle about though a prime fellow if you can once fasten to him and get him into blue water does your schooner go out tomorrow captain garner  not till next day i think said roswell gardiner with the frankness of his nature utterly free from the slightest suspicion that he was communicating with one in the interests of rivals my mates have not yet joined me and i am short of my complement by two good hands had that fellow watson stuck by me i would have given him a look at water that no lead ever sounded  ay ay hes a whiffler but a good man on a seaelephant then you think youll sail day ater tomorrow  if my mates come over from the main they wrote me yesterday that they had got the hands and were then on the lookout for something to get across in ive come out here to be ready for them and to pick em up that they neednt go all the way up to the harbour  thats a good traverse and will save a long pull perhaps they are in that boat  at this allusion to a boat roswell gardiner sprang into his main rigging and saw sure enough that a boat was pulling directly towards the schooner coming from the main and distant only a short half mile a glass was handed to him and he was soon heard announcing cheerfully to his men that mr hazard and the second officer were in the boat with two seamen and that he supposed they should now have their complement all this was overheard by the skipper of the sloop who caught each syllable with the most eager attention  youll soon be travelling south im thinking captain garner called out this worthy again in a sort of felicitating waythems your chaps and theyll set you up  i hope so with all my heart for there is nothing more tiresome than waiting when one is all ready to trip my owner is getting to be impatient too and wants to see some skins in return for his dollars  ay ay thems your chaps and youll be off the day ater tomorrow at the latest well a good time to you captain garner and a plenty of skinning its a long road to travel especially when a craft has to go as far south as yours is bound  how do you know friend whither i am bound you have not asked me for my sealing ground nor is it usual in our business to be hawking it up and down the country  all that is true enough but ive a notion notwithstanding now as youll be off so soon and as i shall not see you again for some time at least i will give you a piece of advice if you fall in with a consort dont fall out with her and make a distant vyge a cruise for an enemy but come to tarms and work in company lay for lay and make fair weather of what cant be helped  the men on board the sloop laughed at this speech while those on board the schooner wondered to roswell gardiner and his people the allusions were an enigma and the former muttered something about the strangers being a dunce as he descended from the rigging and gave some orders to prepare to receive the boat  the chap belongs to the hole rejoined the master of the schooner and all them vineyard fellows fancy themselves better bluejackets than the rest of mankind i suppose it must be because their island lies further out to sea than anything we have here inside of montauk  thus ended the communications with the stranger the sloop glided away before a light south wind and favoured by an ebb tide soon rounded the spit of sand that shelters the anchorage and hauling up to the eastward she went on her way towards holmes hole the skipper was a relative of half of those who were interested in fitting out the rival sea lion and had volunteered to obtain the very information he took with him knowing how acceptable it would be to those at home sooth to say a deep but wary excitement prevailed on the vineyard touching not only the sealingislands but also in respect to the buried treasure the information actually possessed by the relations of the deceased mariner was neither very full nor very clear it consisted principally of sayings of daggett uttered during his homewardbound passage and transmitted by the master of the brig to him of the sloop in the course of conferences that wore away a long summers afternoon as the two vessels lay becalmed within a hundred fathoms of each other these sayings however had been frequent and intelligible all men like to deal in that which makes them of importance and the possession of his secrets had just the effect on daggetts mind that was necessary to render him boastful under such impulses his tongue had not been very guarded and facts leaked out which when transmitted to his native island through the medium of half a dozen tongues and as many fancies amounted to statements sufficient to fire the imaginations of a people much duller than those of marthas vineyard accustomed to converse and think of such expeditions it is not surprising that a few of the most enterprising of those who first heard the reports should unite and plan the adventure they now actually had in hand when the intelligence of what was going on on oyster pond reached them everything like hesitation or doubt disappeared and from the moment of the nephews return in quest of his uncles assets the equipment of the humses hull craft had been pressed in a way that would have done credit to that of a government cruiser even henry eckford so well known for having undertaken to cut the trees and put upon the waters of ontario two doublebank frigates if frigates they could be termed each of which was to mount its hundred guns in the short space of sixty days scarce manifested greater energy in carrying out his contract than did these rustic islanders in preparing their craft to compete with that which they were now certain was about to sail from the place where their kinsman had breathed his last  these keen and spirited islanders however did not work quite as much in the dark as our accounts unexplained might give the reader reason to suppose it will be remembered that there was a till to the chest which had not been examined by the deacon this till contained an old mutilated journal not of the last but of one or two of the earlier voyages of the deceased though it had detached entries that evidently referred to different and distant periods of time by dint of study and by putting together sundry entries that at first sight might not be supposed to have any connection with each other the present possessor of that chest had obtained what he deemed to be very sufficient clues to his uncles two great secrets there were also in the chest several loose pieces of paper on which there were rude attempts to make charts of all the islands and keys in question giving their relative positions as it respected their immediate neighbours but in no instance giving the latitudes and longitudes in addition to these significant proofs that the reports brought through the two masters were not without a foundation there was an unfinished letter written by the deceased and addressed as a sort of legacy to any or all of marthas vineyard of the name of daggett this address was sufficiently wide including probably some hundreds of persons a clan in fact but it was also sufficiently significant the individual into whose hands it first fell being of the name read it first as a matter of course when he carefully folded it up and placed it in a pocketbook which he was much in the habit of carrying in his own pocket on what principle this letter unfinished and without a signature with nothing indeed but its general and comprehensive address to point out its origin as well as its destination was thus appropriated to the purposes of a single individual we shall not stop to inquire such was the fact however and none connected with the equipment of the sea lion of holmes hole knew anything of the existence of that document its present possessor excepted he looked it over occasionally and deemed the information it conveyed of no trifling import under all the circumstances of the case  both the enterprises of which we have given an opening account were perfectly characteristic of the state of society in which they were brought into existence deacon pratt if he had any regular calling was properly a husbandman though the love of money had induced him to invest his cash in nearly every concern around him which promised remunerating returns the principal owners of the sea lion of holmes hole were husbandmen also folk who literally tilled the earth cradled their own oats and rye and mowed their own meadows notwithstanding neither of these men those of the vineyard any more than he of oyster pond had hesitated about investing of his means in a maritime expedition just as if they were all regular shipowners of the largest port in the union with such men it is only necessary to exhibit an account with a fair prospect of large profits and they are ever ready to enter into the adventure heart hand and pocket last season it may have been to look for whales on the coast of japan the season before that to search for islands frequented by the seals this season possibly to carry a party out to hunt for camelopards set nets for young lions and beat up the quarters of the rhinoceros on the plains of africa while the next they may be transporting ice from long pond to calcutta and kingstonnot to say to london itself of such materials are those descendants of the puritans composed a mixture of good and evil of the religion which clings to the past in recollection rather than in feeling mingled with a worldlymindedness that amounts nearly to rapacity all cloaked and rendered decent by a conventional respect for duties and respectable and useful by frugality enterprise and untiring activity  roswell gardiner had not mistaken the persons of those in the boat they proved to be phil hazard his first officer tim green the second mate and the two sealers whom it had cost so much time and ingenuity to obtain although neither of the mates even suspected the truth no sooner had they engaged the right sort of man than he was tampered with by the agents of the marthas vineyard concern and spirited away by means of more tempting proposals before he had got quite so far as to sign the articles one of the motives for sending watson across to oyster pond had been to induce captain gardiner to believe he had engaged so skilful a hand which would effectually prevent his attempting to procure another until at the last moment he might find himself unable to put to sea for the want of a complement a whaling or a sealing voyage requires that the vessel should take out with her the particular hands necessary to her specific object though of late years the seamen have got so much in the habit of running especially in the pacific that it is only the craft that strictly belong to what may be termed the whaling communities that bring back with them the people they carry out and not always them  but here had roswell gardiner his complement full and nearly everything ready to sea he had only to go up to the harbour and obtain his clearance have a short interview with his owner a longer with mary and be off for the antarctic circle if indeed the ice would allow him to get as far south there were now sixteen souls on board the sea lion a very sufficient number for the voyage on which she was about to sail the disposition or rating of the crew was as follows viz     1 roswell gardiner master    2 philip hazard chief mate    3 timothy green second do    4 david weeks carpenter    5 nathan thompson seaman    6 sylvester havens do    7 marcus todd do    8 hiram flint do    9 joshua short seaman   10 stephen stimson do   11 bartlett davidson do   12 peter mount landsman   13 arcularius mott do   14 robert smith do   15 cato livingston cook   16 primus floyd boy  this was considered a good crew on the whole every man was a native american and most of them belonged to old suffolk thompson and flint and short and stimson four capital fellows in their way came from the main the last it was said from as far east as kennebunk no matter they were all reasonably young hale active fellows with a promise of excellent service about every man of them livingston and floyd were coloured persons who bore the names of the two respectable families in which they or their progenitors had formerly been slaves weeks was accustomed to the sea and might have been rated indifferently as a carpenter or as a mariner mount and mott though shipped as landsmen were a good deal accustomed to the water also having passed each two seasons in coasters though neither had ever yet been really outside or seen blue water  it would not have been easy to give to the sea lion a more efficient crew yet there was scarce a real seaman belonging to hera man who could have been made a captain of the forecastle on board a frigate or a ship of the line even gardiner the best man in his little craft in nearly every respect was deficient in many attainments that mark the thorough seadog he would have been remarkable anywhere for personal activity for courage readiness hardihood and all those qualities which render a man useful in the business to which he properly belonged but he could hardly be termed a skilful leadsman knew little of the finesse of his calling and was wanting in that inandin breeding which converts habit into an instinct and causes the thorough seaman to do the right thing blow high or blow low in the right way and at the right moment in all these respects however he was much the best man on board and he was so superior to the rest as fully to command all their respect stimson was probably the next best seaman after the master  the day succeeding that on which the sea lion received the remainder of her people roswell gardiner went up to the harbour where he met deacon pratt by appointment the object was to clear the schooner out which could be done only at that place mary accompanied her uncle to transact some of her own little domestic business and it was then arranged between the parties that the deacon should make his last visit to his vessel in the returnboat of her master while roswell gardiner should take mary back to oyster pond in the whaleboat that had brought her and her uncle over as baiting joe as usual had acted as ferryman it was necessary to get rid of him the young sailor desiring to be alone with mary this was easily enough effected by a present of a quarter of a dollar the boat having two lugg sails and the wind being light and steady at southwest there was nothing to conflict with roswell gardiners wishes  the young sailor left the wharf at sag harbour about ten minutes after the deacon had preceded him on his way to the schooner as the wind was so light and so fair he soon had his sheets in and the boat gliding along at an easy rate which permitted him to bestow nearly all his attention on his charming companion roswell gardiner had sought this occasion that he might once more open his heart to mary and urge his suit for the last time previously to so long an absence this he did in a manly frank way that was far from being unpleasant to his gentle listener whose inclinations for a few minutes blinded her to the resolutions already made on principle so urgent was her suitor indeed that she should solemnly plight her faith to him ere he sailed that a soft illusion came over the mind of one as affectionate as mary and she was halfinclined to believe her previous determination was unjustifiable and obdurate but the head of one of her high principles and clear views of duty could not long be deceived by her heart and she regained the selfcommand which had hitherto sustained her in all her former trials in connection with this subject  perhaps it would have been better roswell she said had i taken leave of you at the harbour and not incurred the risk of the pain that i foresee i shall both give and bear in our present discourse i have concealed nothing from you possibly i have been more sincere than prudence would sanction you know the only obstacle there is to our union but that appears to increase in strength the more i ask you to reflect on itto try to remove it  what would you have me do mary surely not to play the hypocrite and profess to believe that which i certainly do not and which after all my inquiries i cannot believe  i am sorry it is so on every account returned mary in a low and saddened tone sorry that one of so frank ingenuous a mind should find it impossible to accept the creed of his fathers and sorry that it must leave so impassable a chasm between us for ever  no mary that can never be nothing but death can separate us for so long a time while we meet we shall at least be friends and friends love to meet and to see each other often  it may seem unkind at a moment like this roswell but it is in truth the very reverse if i say we ought not to meet each other here if we are bent on following our own separate ways towards a future world my god is not your god and what can there be of peace in a family when its two heads worship different deities i am afraid that you do not think sufficiently of the nature of these things  i did not believe you to be so illiberal mary had the deacon said as much i might not have been surprised but for one like you to tell me that my god is not your god is narrow indeed  is it not so roswell and if so why should we attempt to gloss over the truth by deceptive words i am a believer in the redeemer as the son of god as one of the holy trinity while you believe in him only as a mana righteous and just a sinless man if you will but as a man only now is not the difference in these creeds immense is it not in truth just the difference between god and man i worship my redeemer regard him as the equal of the fatheras a part of that divine being while you look on him as merely a man without sinas a man such as adam probably was before the fall  do we know enough of these matters mary to justify us in allowing them to interfere with our happiness  we are told that they are allessential to our happinessnot in the sense you may mean roswell but in one of far higher importand we cannot neglect them without paying the penalty  i think you carry these notions too far dearest mary and that it is possible for man and wife most heartily to love each other and to be happy in each other without their thinking exactly alike on religion how many good and pious women do you see who are contented and prosperous as wives and mothers and who are members of meeting but whose husbands make no profession of any sort  that may be true or not i lay no claim to a right to judge of any others duties or manner of viewing what they ought to do thousands of girls marry without feeling the very obligations that they profess to reverence and when in after life deeper convictions come they cannot cast aside the connections they have previously formed if they would and probably would not if they could that is a different thing from a young woman who has a deep sense of what she owes to her redeemer becoming deliberately and with a full sense of what she is doing the wife of one who regards her god as merely a mani care not how you qualify this opinion by saying a pure and sinless man it will be man still the difference between god and man is too immense to be frittered away by any such qualifications as that  but if i find it impossible to believe all you believe mary surely you would not punish me for having the sincerity to tell you the truth and the whole truth  no indeed roswell answered the honest girl gently not to say tenderly nothing has given me a better opinion of your principles roswella higher notion of what your upright and frank character really is than the manly way in which you have admitted the justice of my suspicions of your want of faithof faith as i consider faith can alone exist this fair dealing has made me honour you and esteem you in addition to the more girlish attachment that i do not wish to conceal from you at least i have so long felt  blessed mary exclaimed roswell gardiner almost ready to fall down on his knees and worship the pretty enthusiast who sat at his side with a countenance in which intense interest in his welfare was beaming from two of the softest and sweetest blue eyes that maiden ever bent on a youth in modest tenderness whatever disposition he might be in to accept her god as his god how can one so kind in all other respects prove so cruel in this one particular  because that one particular as you term it roswell is all in all to her answered the girl with a face that was now flushed with feeling i must answer you as joshua told the israelites of oldchoose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord  do you class me with the idolaters and pagans of palestine demanded gardiner reproachfully  you have said it roswell it is not i but yourself who have thus classed you you worship your reason instead of the one true and living god this is idolatry of the worst character since the idol is never seen by the devotee and he does not know of its existence  you consider it then idolatry for one to use those gifts which he has received from his maker and to treat the most important of all subjects as a rational being instead of receiving a creed blindly and without thought  if what you call thought could better the matter if it were sufficient to comprehend and master this subject there might be force in what you say but what is this boasted reason after all it is not sufficient to explain a single mystery of the creation though there are thousands i know there are nay there must be a variety of opinions among those who look to their reasons instead of accepting the doctrine of revelation for the character of christ but i believe all who are not open infidels admit that the atonement of his death was sufficient for the salvation of men now can you explain this part of the theory of our religion any more than you can explain the divine nature of the redeemer can you reason any more wisely touching the fall than touching the redemption itself i know i am unfit to treat of matters of this profound nature continued mary modestly though with great earnestness and beauty of manner but to me it seems very plain that the instant circumstances lead us beyond the limits of our means of comprehension we are to believe in and not to reason on revelation the whole history of christianity teaches this its first ministers were uneducated men men who were totally ignorant until enlightened by their faith and all the lessons it teaches are to raise faith and faith in the redeemer high above all other attainments as the one great acquisition that includes and colours every other when such is the fact the heart does not make a stumblingblock of every thing that the head cannot understand  i do not know how it is answered roswell gardiner influenced though unconvinced but when i talk with you on this subject mary i cannot do justice to my opinions or to the manner in which i reason on them with my male friends and acquaintance i confess it does appear to me illogical unreasonablei scarce know how to designate what i meanbut improbable that god should suffer himself or his son to be crucified by beings that he himself created or that he should feel a necessity for any such course in order to redeem beings he had himself brought into existence  if there be any argument in the last roswell it is an argument as much against the crucifixion of a man as against the crucifixion of one of the trinity itself i understand you to believe that such a being as jesus of nazareth did exist that he was crucified for our redemption and that the atonement was accepted and acceptable before god the father now is it not just as difficult to understand how or why this should be as to understand the common creed of christians  surely there is a vast difference between the crucifixion of a subordinate being and the crucifixion of one who made a part of the godhead itself mary i can imagine the first though i may not pretend to understand its reasons or why it was necessary it should be so but i am certain you will not mistake my motive when i say i cannot imagine the other  make no apologies to me roswell look rather to that dread being whose teachings through chosen ministers you disregard as for what you say i can fully feel its truth i do not pretend to understand why such a sacrifice should be necessary but i believe it feel it and believing and feeling it i cannot but adore and worship the son who quitted heaven to come on earth and suffered that we might possess eternal life it is all mystery to me as is the creation itself our existence god himself and all else that my mind is too limited to comprehend but roswell if i believe a part of the teachings of the christian church i must believe all the apostles who were called by christ in person who lived in his very presence who knew nothing except as the holy spirit prompted worshipped him as the son of god as one who thought it not robbery to be equal with god and shall i ignorant and uninspired pretend to set up my feeble means of reasoning in opposition to their written instructions  yet must each of us stand or fall by the means he possesses and the use he makes of them  that is quite true roswell and ask yourself the use to which you put your own faculties i do not deny that we are to exercise our reason but it is within the bounds set for its exercise we may examine the evidence of christianity and determine for ourselves how far it is supported by reasonable and sufficient proofs beyond this we cannot be expected to go else might we be required to comprehend the mystery of our own existence which just as much exceeds our understanding as any other we are told that man was created in the image of his creator which means that there is an immortal and spiritual part of him that is entirely different from the material creature one perishes temporarily at leasta limb can be severed from the body and perish even while the body survives but it is not so with that which has been created in the image of the deity that is imperishable immortal spiritual though doomed to dwell awhile in a tenement of clay now why is it more difficult to believe that pure divinity may have entered into the person of one man than to believe nay to feel that the image of god has entered into the persons of so many myriads of men you not only overlook all this roswell but you commit the to me inexplicable mistake of believing a part of a mystery while you hesitate about believing all were you to deny the merits of the atonement altogether your position would be much stronger than it is in believing what you do but roswell we will not embitter the moment of separation by talking more on this subject now i have other things to say to you and but little time to say them in the promise you have asked of me to remain single until your return i most freely make it costs me nothing to give you this pledge since there is scarce a possibility of my ever marrying another  mary repeated these words or rather this idea in other words to roswell gardiners great delight and again and again he declared that he could now penetrate the icy seas with a light heart confident he should find her on his return disengaged and as he hoped as much disposed to regard him with interest as she then was nevertheless gardiner did not deceive himself as to marys intentions he knew her and her principles too well to fancy that her resolution would be very likely to falter notwithstanding their long and intimate knowledge of each other at no time had she ever betrayed a weakness that promised to undermine her high sense of duty and as time increased her means of judging of what those duties were her submission to them seemed to be stronger and stronger had there been anything stern or repulsive in marys manner of manifesting the feeling that was uppermost in her mind one of roswell gardiners temperament would have been very apt to shake off her influence but so far from this being the case she ever met him and parted from him with a gentle and ingenuous interest in his welfare and occasionally with much womanly tenderness he knew that she prayed for him daily as fervently as she prayed for herself and even this he hoped would serve to keep alive her interest in him during his absence in this respect our young sailor showed no bad comprehension of human nature nothing being more likely to maintain an influence of this sort than the conviction that on ourselves depends the happiness or interests of the person beloved     chapter viii       and i have loved thee ocean and my joy     of youthful sports was on thy breast to be     borne like thy bubbles onward from a boy     i wantond with thy breakersthey to me     were a delight and if the freshening sea     made them a terrortwas a pleasing fear     for i was as it were a child of thee   and trusted to thy billows far and near   and laid my hand upon thy maneas i do here    byron   it was past the turn of the day when roswell gardiner reached his vessel after having carefully and with manly interest in all that belonged to her seen mary to her home and taken his final leave of her of that parting we shall say but little it was touching and warmhearted and it was rendered a little solemn by mary pratts putting into her lovers hand a pocketbible with an earnest request that he would not forget to consult its pages she added at the same time that she had carefully marked those passages which she wished him most to study and reflect on the book was accepted in the spirit in which it was offered and carefully placed in a little case that contained about a hundred volumes of different works  as the hour approached for lifting the anchor the nervousness of the deacon became very apparent to the commander of his schooner at each instant the former was at the latters elbow making some querulous suggestion or asking a question that betrayed the agitated and unsettled state of his mind it really seemed as if the old man at the last moment had not the heart to part with his property or to trust it out of his sight all this annoyed roswell gardiner disposed as he was at that instant to regard every person and thing that in any manner pertained to mary pratt with indulgence and favour  you will be particular about them islands captain garner and not get the schooner ashore said the deacon for the tenth time at least they tell me the tide runs like a horse in the high latitudes and that seamen are often stranded by them before they know where they are  ay ay sir ill try and bear it in mind answered gardiner vexed at being importuned so often to recollect that which there was so little likelihood of his forgetting i am an old cruiser in those seas deacon and know all about the tides well mr hazard what is the news of the anchor  we are short sir and only wait for orders to go on and get clear of the ground  trip at once sir and so farewell to americaor to this end of it at least  then the keys they tell me are dangerous navigation garner and a body needs have all his eyes about him  all places have their dangers to your sleepy navigator deacon but the man who keeps his eyes open has little to fear had you given us a chronometer there would not have been onehalf the risk there will be without one  this had been a bone of contention between the master of the sea lion and his owner chronometers were not by any means in as general use at the period of our tale as they are today and the deacon abhorred the expense to which such an article would have put him could he have got one at a fourth of the customary price he might have been tempted but it formed no part of his principles of saving to anticipate and prevent waste by liberality  no sooner was the schooner released from the ground than her sails were filled and she went by the low spit of sand already mentioned with the light southwest breeze still blowing in her favour and an ebb tide everything appeared propitious and no vessel probably ever left home under better omens the deacon remained on board until baiting joe who was to act as his boatman reminded him of the distance and the probability that the breeze would go down entirely with the sun as it was they had to contend with wind and tide and it would require all his own knowledge of the eddies to get the whaleboat up to oyster pond in anything like reasonable time thus admonished the owner tore himself away from his beloved craft giving young garner as many last words as if he were about to be executed roswell had a last word on his part however in the shape of a message to mary  tell mary deacon said the young sailor in an aside that i rely on her promise and that i shall think of her whether it be under the burning sun of the line or among the ice of the antarctic  yes yes thats as it should be answered the deacon heartily i like your perseverance garner and hope the gal will come round yet and i shall have you for a nephew theres nothing that takes the womens minds like money fill up the schooner with skins and ile and bring back that treasure and you make as sure of mary for a wife as if the parson had said the benediction over you  such was deacon pratts notion of his niece as well as of the female sex for months he regarded this speech as a coup de maitre while roswell gardiner forgot it in half an hour so much better than the uncle did the lover comprehend the character of the niece  the sea lion of oyster pond had now cast off the last ligament which connected her with the land she had no pilot none being necessary or usual in those waters all that a vessel had to do being to give long island a sufficient berth in rounding its eastern extremity the boat was soon shut in by gardiners island and thenceforth nothing remained but the ties of feeling to connect those bold adventurers with their native country it is true that connecticut and subsequently rhode island was yet visible on one hand and a small portion of new york on the other but as darkness came to close the scene even that means of communication was soon virtually cut off the light on montauk for hours was the sole beacon for these bold mariners who rounded it about midnight fairly meeting the long rolling swell of the broad atlantic then the craft might be said to be at sea for the first time  the sea lion was found to perform well she had been constructed with an eye to comfort as well as to sailing and possessed that just proportion in her hull which carried her over the surface of the waves like a duck this quality is of more importance to a small than to a large vessel for the want of momentum renders what is termed burying a very deadening process to a light craft in this very important particular roswell was soon satisfied that the shipwright had done his duty  as the wind still stood at southwest the schooner was brought upon an easy bowline as soon as she had montauk light dead to windward this new course carried her out to sea steering southsoutheast a little easterly under everything that would draw the weather appearing settled and there being no signs of a change gardiner now went below and turned in leaving the care of the vessel to the proper officer of the watch with an order to call him at sunrise fatigue soon asserted its power and the young man was shortly in as profound a sleep as if he had not just left a mistress whom he almost worshipped for an absence of two years and to go on a voyage that probably would expose him to more risks and suffering than any other enterprise then attempted by seafaring men our young sailor thought not of the last at all but he fell asleep dreaming of mary  the master of the sea lion of oyster pond was called precisely at the hour he had named five minutes sufficed to bring him on deck where he found everything as he had left it with the exception of the schooner itself in the six hours he had been below his vessel had moved her position out to sea nearly forty miles no land was now to be seen the american coast being very tame and unpicturesque to the eye as the purest patriot if he happen to know anything of other parts of the world must be constrained to admit a low monotonous coast that is scarcely visible at a distance of five leagues is certainly not to be named in the same breath with those glorious shores of the mediterranean for instance where nature would seem to have exhausted herself in uniting the magnificent with the bewitching on this continent or on our own portion of it at least we must be content with the useful and lay no great claims to the beautiful the rivers and bays giving us some compensation in their admirable commercial facilities for the sameness not to say tameness of the views we mention these things in passing as a people that does not understand its relative position in the scale of nations is a little apt to fall into errors that do not contribute to its character or respectability more especially when they exhibit a selflove founded altogether on ignorance and which has been liberally fed by flattery  the first thing a seaman does on coming on deck after a short absence is to look to windward in order to see how the wind stands and what are the prospects of the weather then he turns his eyes aloft to ascertain what canvass is spread and how it draws occasionally the order of these observations is changed the first look being sometimes bestowed on the sails and the second on the clouds roswell gardiner however cast his first glance this morning towards the southward and westward and perceived that the breeze promised to be steady on looking aloft he was well satisfied with the manner in which everything drew then he turned to the second mate who had the watch whom he addressed cheerfully and with a courtesy that is not always observed among sailors  a fine morning sir said roswell gardiner and a goodbye to america weve a long road to travel mr green but weve a fast boat to do it in here is an offing ready made to our hands nothing in sight to the westward not so much as a coaster even its too early for the outwardbound craft of the last ebb and too late for those that sailed the tide before i never saw this bight of the coast clearer of canvass  ay ay sir it does seem empty like heres a chap however to leeward who appears inclined to try his rate of sailing with us here he is sir a very little abaft the beam and as near as i can make him out hes a foretawsail schooner of about our own dimensions if youll just look at him through this glass captain gardner youll see he has not only our rig but our canvass set  you are right enough mr green returned roswell after getting his look he is a schooner of about our tonnage and under precisely our canvass how long has the fellow bore as he does now  he came out from under blok island a few hours since and we made him by moonlight the question with me is where did that chap come from a stunninton man would have naturally passed to windward of blok island and a newport or providence fellow would not have fetched so far to windward without making a stretch or two on purpose that schooner has bothered me ever since it was daylight for i cant place him where he is by any traverse my poor parnin can work  she does seem to be out of her way possibly it is a schooner beating up for the hook and finding herself too close in she is standing to the southward to get an offing again  not she sir she came out from behind blok and a craft of her size that wanted to go to the westward and which found itself so close in would have taken the first of the flood and gone through the race like a shot no no captain garner this fellow is bound south as well as ourselves and it is quite onaccountable how he should be just where he isso far to windward or so far to leeward as a body might say a southsoutheast course from any place behind point judith would have taken him off near no mans land and here he is almost in a line with blok island  perhaps he is out of new london or some of the ports on the main and being bound to the west indies he has been a little careless about weathering the island its no great matter after all  it is some such matter captain garner as walkin round a meetinus when your arnd is in at the door in front but there was no such craft in at stunnintun or new london as i know from havin been at both places within the last eightandforty hours  you begin to make me as curious about this fellow as you seem to be yourself sir and now i think the matter all over it is somewhat extrornary he should be just where he is it is however a very easy thing to get a nearer look at him and its no great matter to us intending as we do to make the islands off the cape de verde if we do lose a little of our weatherly positionkeep the schooner away a point and get a small pull on your weather bracesgive her a little sheet too fore and aft sir so that will dokeep her steady at thatsoutheast and by south in two hours we shall just about speak this outoftheway joker  as every command was obeyed the sea lion was soon running off free her bowlines hanging loose and all her canvass a rap full the change in her line of sailing drought the sail to leeward a little forward of her beam but the movement of the vessel that made the freest wind was consequently the most rapid in the course of half an hour the stranger was again a little abaft the beam and he was materially nearer than when first seen no change was made in the route of the stranger who now seemed disposed to stand out to sea with the wind as it was on an easy bowline without paying any attention to the sail in sight  it was noon ere the two schooners came within hail of each other of course as they drew nearer and nearer it was possible for those on board of each to note the appearance equipments and other peculiarities of his neighbour in size there was no apparent difference between the vessels and there was a somewhat remarkable resemblance in the details  that fellow is no west india drogger said roswell gardiner when less than a mile from the stranger he carries a boat on deck as we do and has one on each quarter too can it be possible that he is bound after seals as well as we are ourselves  i believe youre right sir answered hazard the chiefmate who was now on deck theres a sealing look about the gentleman if i know my own complexion its odd enough captain garner that two of us should come together out here in the offing and both of us bound to the other end of the arth  there is nothing so very remarkable in that mr hazard when we remember that the start must be properly timed for those who wish to be off cape horn in the summer season we shall neither of us get there much before december and i suppose the master of you schooner knows that as well as i do myself the position of this craft puzzles me far more than anything else about her from what port can a vessel come that she should be just here with the wind at southwest  ay sir put in green who was moving about the decks coiling ropes and clearing things away thats what i tell the chiefmate where can a craft come from to be just here with this wind if she dont come from stunnintun even from stunnintun shed be out of her way but no such vessel has been in that port any time these six weeks here you stimson come this way a bit didnt you tell me something of having seen a schooner at new bedford that was about our build and burthen and that you understood had been bought for a sealer  ay ay sir answered stimson as bluff an old seadog as ever flattened in a jibsheet and thats the craft as im a thinkin mr green she had an animal for a figurehead and that craft has an animal as well as i can judge at this distance  you are right enough there stephen cried roswell gardiner and that animal is a seal its the twinbrother of the sea lion we carry under our own bowsprit theres some proof in that tastes agree sometimes even if they do differ generally what became of the schooner you saw  i heard sir that she was bought up by some vineyard men and was taken across to humses hull they sometimes fit out a craft there as well as on the main i should have crossed myself to see what they was at but i fell in with mr green and shipped aboard here  an adventure by which i hope you will not be a loser my hearty put in the captain and you think that is the craft which was built at new bedford and fitted out on the vineyard  sartain of it sir for i know the figurehead and all about her build  hand me the trumpet mr green we shall soon be near enough for a hail and it will be easy to learn the truth  roswell gardiner waited a few minutes for the two schooners to close and was in the very act of applying the trumpet to his mouth when the usual salutation was sent across the water from the stranger during the conversation that now took place the vessels gradually drew nearer to each other until both parties laid aside their trumpets and carried on the discourse with the unaided voice  schooner ahoy was the greeting of the stranger and a simple hilloa the answer  what schooner is that pray  the sea lion of oyster pond long island bound to the southward after seal as i suppose you know by our outfit  when did you leave oyster pondand how did you leave your owner the good deacon pratt  we sailed yesterday afternoon on the first of the ebb and the deacon left us as we weighed anchor he was well and full of hope for our luck what schooner is that pray  the sea lion of humses hull bound to the southward after seals as you probably knew by our outfit who commands that schooner  captain roswell garnerwho commands aboard you pray  captain jason daggett showing himself more plainly by moving out of the line of the mainrigging i had the pleasure of seeing you when i was on the pint looking after my uncles dunnage you may remember captain garner t was but the other day and you are not likely to have forgotten my visit  not at all not at all captain daggett though i had no idea then that you intended to make a voyage to the southward so soon when did you leave the hole sir  day before yesterday afternoon we came out of the hull about five oclock  how had you the wind sir  souwest and souwest and by south there has been but little change in that these three days  roswell gardiner muttered something to himself but he did not deem it prudent to utter the thoughts that were just then passing through his mind aloud  ay ay he answered after a moments pause the wind has stood there the whole week but i think we shall shortly get a change there is an easterly feeling in the air  waal let it come with this offing we could clear hatteras with anything that wasnt worse than a southeaster theres a southerly set in here down the coast for two or three hundred miles  a heavy southeaster would jam us in here between the shoals in a way i shouldnt greatly relish sir i like always to get to the eastward of the stream as soon as i can in running off the land  very true captain garnervery true sir it is best to get outside the stream if a body can once there i call a craft at sea eightandforty hours more of this wind would just about carry us there waal sir as were bound on the same sort of vyge im happy to have fallen in with you and i see no reason why we should not be neighbourly and gam it a little when weve nothing better to do i like that schooner of yours so well that ive made my own to look as nearly resembling her as i could you see our paint is exactly the same  i have observed that captain daggett and you might say the same of the figureheads  ay ay when i was over on the pint they told me the name of the carver in boston who cut your seal and i sent to him to cut me a twin if they lay in a shipyard side by side i dont think you could tell one from the other  so it seems sir pray havent you a man aboard there of the name of watson  ay ayhes my secondmate i know what you mean captain garner you re right enough tis the same hand who was aboard you but wanting a second officer i offered him the berth and he thought that better than taking a foremast lay in your craft  this explanation probably satisfied all who heard it though the truth was not more than half told in point of fact watson was engaged as daggetts second mate before he had ever laid eyes on roswell gardiner and had been sent to watch the progress of the work on oyster pond as has been previously stated it was so much in the natural order of events for a man to accept preferment when offered however that even gardiner himself blamed the delinquent for the desertion far less than he had previously done in the mean time the conversation proceeded  you told us nothing of your having that schooner fitting when you were on the point observed roswell gardiner whose thoughts just then happened to advert to this particular fact  my mind was pretty much taken up with the affairs of my poor uncle i suppose captain garner death must visit each of us once nevertheless it makes us all melancholy when he comes among friends  now roswell gardiner was not in the least sentimental nor had he the smallest turn towards indulging in moral inferences from ordinary events but this answer seemed so proper that it found no objection in his mind still the young man had his suspicions on the subject of the equipment of the other schooner and suspicions that were now active and keen and which led him directly to fancy that daggett had also some clue to the very objects he was after himself singular as it may seem at first deacon pratts interests were favourably affected by this unexpected meeting with the sea lion of holmes hole from the first roswell gardiner had been indisposed to give full credit to the statements of the deceased mariner ascribing no small part of his account to artifice stimulated by a desire to render himself important but now that he found one of this mans family embarked in an enterprise similar to his own his views of its expediency were sensibly changed perfectly familiar with the wary economy with which every interest was regulated in that part of the world he did not believe a company of marthas vineyard men would risk their money in an enterprise that they had not good reasons for believing would succeed although it exceeded his means to appreciate fully the information possessed by the vineyard folk and covetousness did not quicken his faculties on this subject as they had quickened those of the deacon he could see enough to satisfy his mind that either the sealingislands or the booty of the pirates or both had a reality in the judgments of others which had induced them also to risk their money in turning their knowledge to account the effect of this conviction was very natural it induced roswell to regard the charts and his instructions and all connected with his voyage as much more serious matters than he had originally been inclined to do until now he had thought it well enough to let the deacon have his fancies relying on his own ability to obtain a cargo for the schooner by visiting sealing stations where he had been before but now he determined to steer at once for daggetts islands as he and his owner named the land revealed to them and ascertain what could be done there he thought it probable the other sea lion might wish to keep him company but the distance was so great that a hundred occasions must occur when it would be in his power to shake off such a consort should he deem it necessary  for several hours the two schooners stood on in company keeping just without hailing distance apart and sailing so nearly alike as to render it hard to say which craft had the best of it there was nothing remarkable in the fact that two vessels built for the same trade should have a close general resemblance to each other but it was not common to find them so moulded stowed sparred and handled that their rate of sailing should be nearly identical if there was any difference it was slightly in favour of the sea lion of the vineyard which rather drew ahead of her consort if consort the other sea lion could be termed in the course of the afternoon  it is scarcely necessary to say that many were the speculations that were made on board these rival vesselscompetitors now for the commonest glories of their pursuits as well as in the ultimate objects of their respective voyages on the part of roswell gardiner and his two mates they did not fail in particular to comment on the singularity of the circumstance that the sea lion of the vineyard should be so far out of her direct line of sailing  although we have had the wind at sowwest sowwest always as pronounced by every seaman from the lord high admiral of england when there happens to be such a functionary down to the greenest hand on board the greenest sealer for these last few days said hazard anybody can see we shall soon have easterly weather theres an easterly feel in the air and all last night the water had an easterly glimmer about it now why a man who came out of the vineyard sound and who had nothing to do but just to clear the west end of his own island and then lay his course off yonder to the southward and eastward should bear up cluss anglicé close under blok and stretch out to sea for all the world as if he was a stunnintun chap or a new lunnoner that had fallen a little to leeward is more than i can understand captain garner depend on it sir theres a reason fort men dont put schooners into the water nowadays and give them costly outfits with three whaleboats and sealin gear in abundance just for the fun of making fancy traverses on or off a coast like your yacht gentry who never know what they would be at and who never make a vyge worth speaking on  i have been turning all this over in my mind mr hazard answered the young master who was amusing himself at the moment with strapping a small block while he threw many a glance at the vessel that was just as close under his lee as comported with her sailing there is a reason for it as you say but i can find no other than the fact that she has come so much out of her way in order to fall in with us knowing that we were to come round montauk at a particular time  well sir that may have been her play men bound the same way often wish to fall into good company to make the journey seem the shorter by making it so much the pleasanter  those fellows can never suppose the two schooners will keep in sight of each other from fortyone degrees north all the way to seventy south or perhaps further south still if we remain near each other a week t will be quite out of the common way  i dont know that sir i was once in a sealer that do all she could couldnt get shut of a curious neighbour when seals are scarce and the master dont know where to look for em he is usually glad to drop into some vessels wake if it be only to pick up her leavins  outfits are not made on such chances as that these vineyard people know where they are going as well as we know ourselves perhaps better  there is great confidence aboard here in the master captain garner i overheard the watch talking the matter over early this morning and there was but one opinion among them i can tell you sir  which opinion was mr hazard  that a lay aboard this craft would be worth a lay and a half aboard any other schooner out of all america sailors go partly on skill and partly on luck ive known hands that wouldnt ship with the best masters that ever sailed a vessel if they didnt think they was lucky as well as skilful  ay ay its all luck little do these fellows think of providenceor of deserving or undeserving well i hope the schooner will not disappoint themor her master either but whaling and sealing and trusting to the chances of the ocean and our most flattering hopes may mislead us after all  ay ay sir nevertheless captain garner has a name and men will trust to it  our young master could not but be flattered at this which came at a favourable moment to sustain the resolutions awakened by the competition with the rival schooner although so obviously competitors and that in a matter of trade the interest which above all others is apt to make men narrowminded and hostile to each other though the axiom would throw this particular reproach on doctors there were no visible signs that the two vessels did not maintain the most amicable relations as the day advanced the wind fell and after many passages of nautical compliments by means of signals and the trumpet roswell gardiner fairly lowered a boat into the water and went a gamming as it is termed on board the other schooner  each of these little vessels was well provided with boats and those of the description in common use among whalers a whaleboat differs from the ordinary jollyboat launch or yawlgigs barges dinguis c c being exclusively for the service of vessels of warin the following particulars vizit is sharp at both ends in order that it may back off as well as pull on it steers with an oar instead of with a rudder in order that the bows may be thrown round to avoid danger when not in motion it is buoyant and made to withstand the shock of waves at both ends and it is light and shallow though strong that it may be pulled with facility when it is remembered that one of these little eggshellslittle as vessels though of good size as boatsis often dragged through troubled waters at the rate of ten or twelve knots and frequently at even a swifter movement one can easily understand how much depends on its form buoyancy and strength among seamen it is commonly thought that a whaleboat is the safest craft of the sort in which men can trust themselves in rough water  captain daggett received his guest with marked civility though in a quiet eastern way the rum and water were produced and a friendly glass was taken by one after the other the two masters drank to each others success and many a conventional remark was made between them on the subject of sealions seaelephants and the modes of capturing such animals even watson semideserter as he was was shaken cordially by the hand and his questionable conduct overlooked the ocean has many of the aspects of eternity and often disposes mariners to regard their fellowcreatures with an expansiveness of feeling suited to their common situations its vastness reminds them of the time that has neither beginning nor end its ceaseless movement of the nevertiring impulses of human passions and its accidents and dangers of the providence which protects all alike and which alone prevents our being abandoned to the dominion of chance  roswell gardiner was a kindhearted man moreover and was inclined to judge his fellows leniently thus it was that his good evening at parting to watson was just as frank and sincere as that he bestowed on captain daggett himself     chapter ix      roll on thou deep and dark blue oceanroll   ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain   man marks the earth with ruinhis control   stops with the shoreupon the watery plain   the wrecks are all thy deeds nor doth remain   a shadow of mans ravage save his own   when for a moment like a drop of rain   he sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan   without a grave unknelld uncoffind and unknown    byron   that evening the sun set in clouds though the eastern horizon was comparatively clear there was however an unnatural outline to objects by which their dimensions were increased and in some degree rendered indefinite we do not know the reason why the wind at east should produce these phenomena nor do we remember ever to have met with any attempt at a solution but of the fact we are certain by years of observation in what is called easterly weather objects are seen through the medium of a refraction that is entirely unknown in a clear northwester the crests of the seas emit a luminous light that is far more apparent than at other times and the face of the ocean at midnight often wears the aspect of a clouded day the nerves too answer to this power of the eastern winds we have a barometer within that can tell when the wind is east without looking abroad and one that never errs it is true that allusions are often made to these peculiarities but where are we to look for the explanation on the coast of america the seabreeze comes from the rising sun while on that of europe it blows from the land but no difference in these signs of its influence could we ever discover on account of this marked distinction  roswell gardiner found the scene greatly changed when he came on deck next morning the storm which had been brewing so long had come at last and the wind was blowing a little gale from southeast the quarter from which the air came had compelled the officer of the watch to haul up on the larboard tack or with the schooners head to the southward and westward a course that might do for a few days provided it did not blow too heavily the other tack would not have cleared the shoals which stretched away to a considerable distance to the eastward hazard had got in his flyingjib and had taken the bonnets off his foresail and jib to prevent the craft burying he had also singlereefed his mainsail and foretopsail the sea lion of the vineyard imitated each movement and was brought down precisely to the same canvass as her consort and on the same tack at that moment the two vessels were not a cables length asunder the oyster ponders being slightly to leeward their schooner however had a trifling advantage in sailing when it blew fresh and the water was rough which advantage was now making itself apparent as the two craft struggled ahead through the troubled element  i wish we were two hundred miles to the eastward observed the young master to his first officer as soon as his eye had taken in the whole view i am afraid we shall get jammed in on cape hatteras that place is always in the way with the wind at southeast and a vessel going to the southward we are likely to have a dirty time of it mr hazard  ay ay sir dirty enough was the careless answer ive known them that would go back and anchor in fort pond bay or even in gardiners until this southeaster had blown itself out  i couldnt think of that we are a hundred miles southeast of montauk and if i run the craft into any place it shall be into charleston or some of the islands along that coast besides we can always ware off the land and place ourselves a days run further to the southward and we can then give the shoals a wide berth on the other tack if we were in the bight of the coast between long island and jersey t would be another matter but out here where we are i should be ashamed to look the deacon in the face if i didnt hold on  i only made the remark captain garner by way of saying something as for getting to the southward close in with our own coast i dont know that it will be of much use to a craft that wishes to stand so far to the eastward since the trades must be met well to windward or they had better not be met at all for my part i would as soon take my chance of making a passage to the cape de verds or their neighbourhood by lifting my anchor from gardiners bay three days hence as by meeting the next shift of wind down south off charleston or tybee  we should be only five hundred miles to windward in the latter case did the wind come from the southwest again as at this season of the year it is very likely to do but it is of no consequence men bound where we have got to go ought not to run into port every time the wind comes out foul you know as well as i do mr hazard that away down south yonder a fellow thinks a gale of wind is a relief provided it brings clear water with it i would rather run a week among islands than a single day among icebergs one knows where to find land for that never moves but your mountains that float about are here today and there tomorrow  quite true sir returned hazard and men that take their lays in sealers are not to expect anything but squalls im ready to hold on as long as our neighbour yonder he seems to be trimming down to it as if in raal earnest to get ahead  this was true enough the sea lion of the vineyard was doing her best all this time and though unable to keep her station on her consorts weather bow where she had been most of the morning she was dropped so very slowly as to render the change nearly imperceptible now it was that the officers and crews of these two craft watched their behaviour as it is technically termed with the closest vigilance and deepest interest those in the oyster pond vessel regarded the movements of their consort much as a belle in a ballroom observes the effect produced by the sister belles around her or a rival physician notes the progress of an operation that is to add new laurels or to cause old ones to wither now the lurch was commented on then the pitch was thought to be too heavy and green was soon of opinion that their competitor was not as easy on her spars as their own schooner in short every comparison that experience jealousy or skill could suggest was freely made and somewhat as a matter of course in favour of their own vessel that which was done on board the sea lion of oyster pond was very freely emulated by those on board her namesake of the vineyard they made their comparisons and formed their conclusions with the same deference to selfesteem and the same submission to hope as had been apparent among their competitors it would seem to be a law of nature that men should thus flatter themselves and perceive the mote in the eye of their neighbour while the beam in their own escapes  had there been an impartial judge present he might have differed from both sets of critics such a person would have seen that one of these schooners excelled in this quality while the other had an equal advantage in another in this way by running through the list of properties that are desirable in a ship he would most probably have come to the conclusion that there was not much to choose between the two vessels but that each had been constructed with an intelligent regard to the particular service in which she was about to be employed and both were handled by men who knew perfectly well how to take care of craft of that description  the wind gradually increased in strength and sail was shortened in the schooners until each was finally brought down to a closereefed foresail this would have been heaving the vessels to had they not been kept a little off in order to force them through the water to lieto in perfection some aftersail might have been required but neither master saw a necessity as yet of remaining stationary it was thought better to wade along some two knots than to be pitching and lurching with nothing but a drift or leeward set in this both masters were probably right and found their vessels farther to windward in the end than if they had endeavoured to hold their own by lyingto the great difficulty they had to contend with in keeping a little off was the danger of seas coming on board but as yet the ocean was not sufficiently aroused to make this very hazardous and both schooners having no real cargoes were light and buoyant and floated dry had they encountered the sea there was with full freights in their holds it might have been imprudent to expose them even to this remote chance of having their decks swept water comes aboard of small vessels almost without an exception in head winds and seas though the contrivances of modern naval architecture have provided defences that make merchant vessels now infinitely more comfortable in this respect than they were at the period of which we are writing  at the end of three days roswell gardiner supposed himself to be about the latitude of cape henry and some thirty or forty leagues from the land it was much easier to compute the last than the first of these material facts of course he had no observations the sun had not been visible since the storm commenced and nearly half the time during the last day the two vessels were shut in from one another by mists and a small rain it blew more in squalls than it had done and the relative positions of the schooners were more or less affected by the circumstance sometimes one would be to windward and ahead then the other would obtain a similar advantage once or twice they seemed about to separate the distance between them getting to be so considerable as apparently to render it impossible to keep in company then the craft would change places by a slow process passing quite near to each other again no one could tell at the moment precisely why these variations occurred though the reasons generally were well understood by all on board them squalls careless steering currents eddies and all the accidents of the ocean contribute to create these vacillating movements which will often cause two vessels of equal speed and under the same canvass to seem to be of very different qualities in the nights the changes were greatest often placing the schooners leagues asunder and seemingly separating them altogether but roswell gardiner became satisfied that captain daggett stuck by him intentionally for on all such occasions if his schooner happened to be out of the way he managed to close again ere the danger of separating became too great to be overcome  our mariners judged of their distance from the land by means of the lead if the american coast is wanting in the sublime and picturesque and every traveller must admit its defects in both it has the essential advantage of graduated soundings so regular is the shoaling of the water and so studiously have the fathoms been laid down that a cautious navigator can always feel his way in to the coast and never need place his vessel on the beach as is so often done without at least knowing that he was about to do so men become adventurous by oftenrepeated success and the struggles of competition the goaheadism of the national character and the trouble it gives to sound in deep water all contribute to cast away the reckless and dashing navigator on this as well as on other coasts and this to his own great surprise but whenever such a thing does happen unless in cases of stress of weather the reader may rest assured it is because those who have had charge of the stranded vessel have neglected to sound the milestones on a highway do not more accurately note the distances than does the lead on nearly the whole of the american coast thus roswell gardiner judged himself to be about thirtytwo or three marine leagues from the land on the evening of the third day of that gale of wind he placed the schooner in the latitude of cape henry on less certain data though that was the latitude in which he supposed her to be by dead reckoning  i wish i knew where daggett makes himself out said the young master just as the day closed on a most stormy and dirtylooking night i dont half like the appearance of the weather but i do not wish to ware off the land with that fellow ahead and nearer to the danger if there be any than we are ourselves  here roswell gardiner manifested a weakness that lies at the bottom of half our blunders he did not like to be outdone by a competitor even in his mistakes if the sea lion of holmes hole could hold on on that tack why might not the sea lion of oyster pond do the same it is by this process of human vanity that men sustain each other in wrong and folly obtains the sanction of numbers if not that of reason in this practice we see one of the causes of the masses becoming misled and this seldom happens without their becoming oppressive  roswell gardiner however did not neglect the lead the schooner had merely to luff close to the wind and they were in a proper state to sound this they did twice during that night and with a very sensible diminution in the depth of the water it was evident that the schooner was getting pretty close in on the coast the wind coming out nearly at south in squalls her commander held on for he thought there were indications of a change and he still did not like to ware so long as his rival of the vineyard kept on the larboard tack in this way each encouraging the other in recklessness did these two craft run nearly into the lions jaw as it might be for when the day reappeared the wind veered round to the eastward a little northerly bringing the craft directly on a leeshore blowing at the time so heavily as to render a foresail reefed down to a mere rag more canvass than the little vessels could well bear as the day returned and the drizzle cleared off a little land was seen to leeward stretching slightly to seaward both ahead and astern on consulting his charts and after getting a pretty good look at the coast from aloft roswell gardiner became satisfied that he was off currituck which placed him near six degrees to the southward of his port of departure and about four to the westward our young man now deeply felt that a foolish rivalry had led him into an error and he regretted that he had not wore the previous evening when he might have had an offing that would have enabled him to stand in either direction clearing the land as things were he was not by any means certain of the course he ought to pursue  little did gardiner imagine that the reason why daggett had thus stood on was solely the wish to keep him company for that person in consequence of gardiners running so close in towards the coast had taken up the notion that the sea lion of oyster pond meant to pass through the west indies visiting the key which was thought to contain treasure and of which he had some accounts that had aroused all his thirst for gold without giving him the clue necessary to obtain it thus it was that a mistaken watchfulness on one side and a mistaken pride on the other had brought these two vessels into as dangerous a position as could have been obtained for them by a direct attempt to place them in extreme jeopardy  about ten the gale was at its height the wind still hanging at east a little northerly in the course of the morning the officers on board both schooners profiting by lulls and clear moments had got so many views of the land from aloft as to be fully aware of their respective situations all thoughts of competition and watchfulness had now vanished each vessel was managed with a reference solely to her safety and as might have been foreseen when true seamen handled both they had recourse to the same expedients to save themselves the mainsails of both crafts were set balancereefed and the hulls were pressed up against the wind and sea while they were driven ahead with increased momentum  that mainmast springs like a whalebone whiphandle sir said hazard when this new experiment had been tried some ten minutes or more she jumps from one sea to another like a frog in a hurry to hop into a puddle  she must stand it or go ashore answered gardiner coolly though in secret he was deeply concerned did deacon pratt forgive me should we lose the schooner i never could forgive myself  should we lose the schooner captain garner few of us would escape drowning to feel remorse or joy look at that coast sirit is clear now and a body can see a good bit of itnever did i put eyes upon a less promising landfall for strangers to make  roswell gardiner did look as desired and he fully agreed with hazard in opinion ahead and astern the land trended to seaward placing the schooners in a curve of the coast or what seamen term a bight rendering it quite impossible for the vessels to lay out past either of the headlands in sight the whole coast was low and endless lines of breakers were visible along it flashing up with luminous crests that left no doubt of their character or of the dangers that they so plainly denoted at times columns of water shot up into the air like enormous jets and the spray was carried inland for miles then it was that gloom gathered around the brows of the seamen who fully comprehended the nature of the danger that was so plainly indicated the green hands were the least concerned knowing nothing and fearing nothing as the older seamen are apt to express their sense of this indifference on the part of the boys and landsmen  according to the calculations of those on board the sea lion of oyster pond they had about two miles of drift before they should be in the breakers they were on the best tack to all appearances and that was the old one or the same leg that had carried them into the bight to ware now indeed would be a very hazardous step since every inch of room was of importance gardiners secret hope was that they might find the inlet that led into currituck which was then open though we believe it has since been closed in whole or in part by the sands this often happens on the american coast very tolerable passages existing this year for vessels of an easy draught that shall be absolutely shut up and be converted into visible beach a few years later the waters within will then gain head and break out cutting themselves a channel that remains open until a succession of gales drives in the sands upon them from the outside once more  gardiner well knew he was on the most dangerous part of the whole american coast in one sense at least the capacious sounds that spread themselves within the long beaches of sand were almost as difficult of navigation as any shoals to the northward yet would he gladly have been in one in preference to clawing off breakers on their outside as between the two schooners the vineyardmen had rather the best of it being near a cables length to windward and so much further removed from destruction the difference however was of no great account in the event of the gale continuing escape being utterly impossible for either in that case so critical was the situation of both craft becoming indeed that neither could now afford to yield a single fathom of the ground she held  all eyes were soon looking for the inlet it having been determined to keep the sea lion of oyster pond away for it should it appear to leeward under circumstances that would allow of her reaching it the line of breakers was now very distinctly visible and each minute did it not only appear to be but it was in fact nearer and nearer anchors were cleared away and ranges of cable overhauled anchoring being an expedient that a seaman felt bound to resort to previously to going ashore though it would be with very little hope of groundtackles holding  the schooner had been described by hazard as jumping into the sea this expression is not a bad one as applied to small vessels in short seas and it was particularly apt on this occasion although constructed with great care forward as to buoyancy this vessel made plunges into the waves she met that nearly buried her and once or twice the shocks were so great that those on board her could with difficulty persuade themselves they had not struck the bottom the lead nevertheless still gave water sufficient though it was shoaling fast and with a most ominous regularity such was the actual state of things when the schooner made one of her mad plunges and was met by a force that seemed to check her forward movement as effectually as if she had hit a rock the mainmast was a good spar in some respects but it wanted wood an inch or two more in diameter might have saved it but the deacon had been induced to buy it to save his money though remonstrated with at the time this spar now snapped in two a few feet from the deck and falling to leeward it dragged after it the head of the foremast leaving the sea lion of oyster pond actually in a worse situation just at that moment than if she had no spars at all  roswell gardiner now appeared in a new character hitherto he had been silent but observant issuing his orders in a way not to excite the men and with an air of unconcern that really had the effect to mislead most of them on the subject of his estimate of the danger they were in concealment however was no longer possible and our young master came out as active as circumstances required foremost in every exertion and issuing his orders amid the gale trumpettongued his manner so full of animation resolution and exertion probably prevented despair from getting the ascendancy at that important moment he was nobly sustained by both his mates and three or four of the older seamen now showed themselves men to be relied on to the last  the first step was to anchor fortunately the foresight of gardiner had everything ready for this indispensable precaution without anchoring ten minutes would probably have carried the schooner directly down upon the breakers leaving no hope for the life of any on board her and breaking her up into chips both bowers were let go at once and long ranges of cable given the schooner was snubbed without parting anything and was immediately brought head to sea this relieved her at once and there was a moment that her people fancied she might ride out the gale where she was could they only get clear of the wreck axes hatchets and knives were freely used and roswell gardiner saw the mass of spars and rigging float clear of him with a delight he did not desire to conceal as it drove to leeward he actually cheered a lead was instantly dropped alongside in order to ascertain whether the anchors held this infallible test however gave the melancholy certainty that the schooner was still drifting her length in rather less than two minutes  the only hope now was that the flukes of the anchors might catch in better holding ground than they had yet met with the bottom was hard sand however which never gives a craft the chance that it gets from mud by roswell gardiners calculations an hour at the most would carry them into the breakers possibly less time the sea lion of holmes hole was to windward a cables length when this accident happened to her consort and about half a mile to the southward just at that instant the breakers trended seaward ahead of that schooner rendering it indispensable for her to ware this was done bringing her head to the southward and she now came struggling directly on towards her consort the operation of waring had caused her to lose ground enough to bring her to leeward of the anchored craft and nearer to the danger  roswell gardiner stood on his own quarterdeck anxiously watching the drift of the other schooner as she drew near in her laboured way struggling ahead through billows that were almost as white as the breakers that menaced them with destruction to leeward the anchored vessel though drifting had so slow a movement that it served to mark the steady and rapid set of its consort towards its certain fate at first it seemed to gardiner that daggett would pass just ahead of him and he trembled for his cables which occasionally appeared above water stretched like bars of iron for the distance of thirty or forty fathoms but the leeward set of the vessel under way was too fast to give her any chance of bringing this new danger on her consort when a cables length distant the sea lion of the vineyard did seem as if she might weather her consort but ere that short space was passed over it was found that she fell off so fast by means of her drift as to carry her fairly clear of her stern the two masters holding with one hand to some permanent object by which to steady themselves and each pressing his tarpaulin firmly down on his head with the other had a minutes conversation when the schooners were nearest together  do your anchors hold demanded daggett who was the first to speak and who put his question as if he thought his own fate depended on the answer  im sorry to say they do not we drift our length in about two minutes  that will put off the evil moment an hour or two look what a wake we are making  sure enough that wake was frightful no sooner was the head of the sea lion of the vineyard fairly up with the stern of the sea lion of oyster pond than gardiner perceived that she went off diagonally moving quite as fast to leeward as she went ahead this was so very obvious that a line drawn from the quarter of roswells craft in a quartering direction would almost have kept the other schooner in its range from the moment that her bow hove heavily past  god bless yougod bless you cried roswell gardiner waving his hand in adieu firmly persuaded that he and the vineyard master were never to meet again in this world the survivors must let the fate of the lost be known at the pinch i shall out boats if i can  the other made no answer it would have been useless indeed to attempt it since no human voice had power to force itself up against such a gale the distance that had now to be overcome  that schooner will be in the breakers in half an hour said hazard who stood by the side of young gardiner why dont he anchor no power short of divine providence can save her  and divine providence will do itthanks to almighty god for his goodness exclaimed roswell gardiner did you perceive that mr hazard  the that of our young mariner was in truth a most momentous omen the wind had lulled so suddenly that the rags of sails which the other schooner carried actually flapped at first our seamen thought she had been becalmed by the swell but the change about themselves was too obvious to admit of any mistake it blew terribly again for a minute then there was another lull gardiner sprang to the leadline to see the effect on his own vessel she no longer dragged her anchor  god is with us exclaimed the young masterblessed for ever be his holy name  and that of his only and true son responded a voice from one at his elbow  notwithstanding the emergency and the excitement produced by this sudden change roswell gardiner turned to see from whom this admonition had come the oldest seaman on board who was stimson a kennebunk man and who had been placed there to watch the schooners drift had uttered these unusual words the fervour with which he spoke produced more impression on the young master than the words themselves the former being very unusual among seafaring men though the language was not so much so subsequently gardiner remembered that little incident which was not without its results  i do believe sir cried hazard that the gale is broken it often happens on our own coast that the southeasters chop round suddenly and come out norwesters i hope this will not be too late to save the vineyard chap though he slips down upon them breakers at a most fearful rate  there goes his foresail againand here is another lull rejoined gardiner i tell you mr hazard we shall have a shift of windnothing short of which could save either of us from these breakers  which comes from the marcy of god almighty through the intercession of his only son added stimson with the same fervour of manner though he spoke in a very low tone of voice  roswell gardiner was again surprised and for another moment he forgot the gale and its dangers gale it was no longer however for the lull was now decided and the two cables of the schooner were distended only when the roll of the seas came in upon her this wash of the waves still menaced the other schooner driving her down towards the breakers though less rapidly than before  why dont the fellow anchor exclaimed gardiner in his anxiety all care for himself being now over unless he anchor he will yet go into the white water and be lost  so little does he think of that that he is turning out his reefs answered hazard see there is a hand aloft loosening his topsailand there goes up a whole mainsail already  sure enough daggett appeared more disposed to trust to his canvass than to his groundtackle in a very brief space of time he had his craft under whole sail and was struggling in the puffs to claw off the land presently the wind ceased altogether the canvass flapping so as to be audible to gardiner and his companions at the distance of half a mile then the cloth was distended in the opposite direction and the wind came off the land the schooners head was instantly brought to meet the seas and the lead dropped at her side showed that she was moving in the right direction these sudden changes sometimes destructive and sometimes providential as acts of mercy always bring strong countercurrents of air in their train  now we shall have it said hazarda true norwester and buttend foremost  this opinion very accurately described that which followed in ten minutes it was blowing heavily in a direction nearly opposite to that which had been the previous current of the wind as a matter of course the sea lion of the vineyard drew off the land wallowing through the meeting billows that still came rolling in from the broad atlantic while the sea lion of oyster pond tended to the new currents of air and rode as it might be suspended between the two opposing forces with little or no strain on her cables gardiner expected to see his consort stand out to sea and gain an offing but instead of this captain daggett brought his schooner quite near to the disabled vessel and anchored this act of neighbourly kindness was too unequivocal to require explanation it was the intention of the vineyard men to lie by their consort until she was relieved from all apprehensions of danger the buttend of the norwester was too large to admit of intercourse until next morning when that which had been a small gale had dwindled to a good steady breeze and the seas had gone down leaving comparatively smooth water all along the coast the line of white water which marked the breakers was there and quite visible but it no longer excited apprehension the jurymasts on board the disabled craft were got up and what was very convenient just at that moment the wreck came floating out on the ebb so near to her as to enable the boats to secure all the sails and most of the rigging the mainboom too an excellent spar was towed alongside and saved     chapter x      the shadow from thy brow shall melt   the sorrow from thy strain   but where thy earthly smile hath dwelt   our hearts shall thirst in vain    mrs hemans   as soon as it would do to put his boats in the water or at daylight next morning captain daggett came alongside of his consort he was received with a seamans welcome and his offers of services were accepted just as frankly as under reversed circumstances they would have been made in all this there was a strange and characteristic admixture of neighbourly and christian kindness blended with a keen regard of the main chance if the former duties are rarely neglected by the descendants of the puritans it may be said with equal truth that the latter are never lost sight of speculation and profit are regarded as so many integral portions of the duty of man and as our kinsmen of old england have set up an idol to worship in the form of aristocracy so do our kinsmen of new england pay homage to the golden calf in point of fact daggett had a double motive in now offering his services to gardiner the one being the discharge of his moral obligations and the other a desire to remain near the sea lion of oyster pond lest she should visit the key of which he had some very interesting memorandums without having enough to find the place unless led there by those who were better informed on the subject of its precise locality than he was himself  the boats of daggett assisted in getting the wreck alongside and in securing the sails and rigging then his people aided in fitting jurymasts and by noon both vessels got under way and stood along the coast to the southward and westward hatteras was no longer terrible for the wind still stood at northwest and they kept in view of those very breakers which only the day before they would have given the value of both vessels to be certain of never seeing again that night they passed the formidable cape a spit of sand projecting far to seaward and which is on a low beach and not on any main land at all once around this angle in the coast they had a lee hauling up to the southwest with the wind abeam they stood on the rest of the day picking up a pilot the next night they doubled cape look out a very good landmark for those going north to keep in view as a reminder of the stormy and sunken hatteras and arrived off beaufort harbour just as the sun was rising the succeeding morning by this time the northwester was done and both schooners entered beaufort with a light southerly breeze there being just water enough to receive them this was the only place on all that coast into which it would have answered their purposes to go and it was perhaps the very port of all others that was best suited to supply the present wants of roswell gardiner pine timber and spars of all sorts abounded in that region and the banker who acted as pilot told our young master that he could get the very sticks he needed in one hours time after entering the haven this term of banker applies to a scattering population of wreckers and fishermen who dwell on the long low narrow beaches which extend along the whole of this part of the coast reaching from cape fear to near cape henry a distance of some hundred and fifty miles within lie the capacious sounds already mentioned including albemarle and pimlico and which form the watery portals to the seashores of all north carolina well is the last headland of that region but one which the schooners did not double named cape fear it is the commencement on that side of the dangerous part of the coast and puts the mariner on his guard by its very appellation admonishing him to be cautious and prudent  off the entrance of beaufort a very perfect and beautiful haven if it had a greater depth of water the schooners hoveto in waiting for the tide to rise a little and roswell gardiner took that occasion to go on board the sister craft and express to daggett a sense of the obligations he felt for the services the other had rendered  of course you will not think of going in captain daggett continued our hero in dwelling on the subject after having put yourself already to so much unnecessary trouble if i find the spars the banker talks of i shall be out again in eightandforty hours and we may meet some months hence off cape horn  ill tell you what it is garner returned the vineyard mariner pushing the rum towards his brother master im a plain sort of a fellow and dont make much talk when i do a thing but i like goodfellowship we came near going both of usnearer than i ever was before and escape wrackin but escape we didand when men have gone through such trials in company i dont like the notion of casting off till i see you all atanto agin and with as many legs and arms as i carry myself thats just my feelin garner and i wont say whether its a right feelin or nothelp yourself  its a right feeling as between you and me captain daggett as i can answer for my heart tells me you are right and i thank you from it for these marks of friendship but you must not forget there are such persons as owners in this world i shall have trouble enough on my hands with my owner and i do not wish you to have trouble with yours here is a nice little breeze to take you out to sea again and by passing to the southward of bermuda you can make a short cut and hit the trades far enough to windward to answer all your purposes  thankee thankee garneri know the road and can find the places im going to though no great navigator now i never took a lunar in my life and cant do anything with a chronometer but as for finding the way between marthas vineyard and cape horn ill turn my back on no shipmaster living  im afraid captain daggett that we have both of us turned our backs on our true course when we suffered ourselves to get jammed away down here on hatteras why i never saw the place before and never wish to see it again its as much out of the track of a whaler or sealer as jupiter is out of the track of mars or venus  oh there go your lunars about which i know nothing and care nothing i tell you garner a man with a good judgment can just as well jog about the arth without any acquaintance with lunars as he can with then your sealer hasnt half as much need of your academysort of navigation as another man more than half of our calling is luck and all the best sealing stations i ever heard of have been blundered on by some chap who has lost his way i despise lunars if the truth must be said yet i like to go straight to my port of destination take a little sugar with your rumandwaterwe vineyard folks like sweetening  for which purpose or that of going straight to your port captain daggett youve come down here on your way to the pacific or about five hundred miles out of your way  i came here for company garner we hadnt much choice you must allow for we couldnt have weathered the shoals on the other tack i see no great harm in our positions if you hadnt got dismasted thats a two or three hundred dollar job and may make your owner grumble a little but its no killing matter ill stick by you and you can tell the deacon as much in the letter youll write him when we get in  it seems like doing injustice to your owners as well as to my own keeping you here captain daggett returned roswell innocently for he had not the smallest suspicion of the true motive of all this apparent goodfellowship and i really wish you would now quit me  i couldnt think of it garner twould make an awful talk on the vineyard was i to do anything of the sort stick by your consort is an eleventh commandment in our island  which is the reason why there are so many old maids there i suppose daggett cried roswell gardiner laughing well i thank you for your kindness and will endeavour to remember it when you may have occasion for some return but the tide must be making and we ought to lose no time unnecessarily heres a lucky voyage to us both captain daggett and a happy return to sweethearts and wives  daggett tossed off his glass to this toast and the two then went on deck roswell gardiner thought that a kinder ships company never sailed together than this of the sea lion of holmes hole for notwithstanding the interest of every man on board depended on the returns of their own voyage each and all appeared willing to stick by him and his craft so long as there was a possibility of being of any service  whalers and sealers do not ship their crews for wages in money as is done with most vessels so much depends on the exertions of the people in these voyages that it is the practice to give every man a direct interest in the result consequently all on board engage for a compensation to be derived from a division of the return cargo the terms on which a party engages are called his lay and he gets so many parts of a hundred according to station experience and qualifications the owner is paid for his risk and expenses in the same way the vessel and outfits usually taking about twothirds of the whole returns while the officers and crew get the other these conditions vary a little as the proceeds of whaling and sealing rise or fall in the market and also in reference to the cost of equipments it follows that captain daggett and his crew were actually putting their hands into their own pockets when they lost time in remaining with the crippled craft this gardiner knew and it caused him to appreciate their kindness at a rate so much higher than he might otherwise have done  at first sight it might seem that all this unusual kindness was superfluous and of no avail this however was not really the case since the crew of the second schooner was of much real service in forwarding the equipment of the disabled vessel beaufort has an excellent harbour for vessels of a light draught of water like our two sealers but the town is insignificant and extra labourers especially those of an intelligence suited to such work very difficult to be had at the bottom therefore roswell gardiner found his friendly assistants of much real advantage the two crews pushing the work before them with as much rapidity as suited even a seamans impatience aided by the crew of his consort gardiner got on fast with his repairs and on the afternoon of the second day after he had entered beaufort he was ready to sail once more his schooner probably in a better state for service than the day she left oyster pond  the lightningline did not exist at the period of which we are writing it is our good fortune to be an intimate acquaintance of the distinguished citizen who has bestowed this great gift on his own countryone that will transmit his name to posterity side by side with that of fulton in his case as in that of the lastnamed inventor attempts have been made to rob him equally of the honours and the profits of his very ingenious invention as respects the last we hold that it is every hour becoming less and less possible for any american to maintain his rights against numbers there is no question that the government of this great republic was intended to be one of wellconsidered and upright principles in which certain questions are to be referred periodically to majorities as the wisest and most natural as well as the most just mode of disposing of them such a government well administered and with an accurate observance of its governing principles would probably be the best that human infirmity will allow men to administer but when the capital mistake is made of supposing that mere numbers are to control all things regardless of those great fundamental laws that the state has adopted for its own restraint it may be questioned if so loose and capricious and selfish a system is not in great danger of becoming the very worst scheme of polity that cupidity ever set in motion the tendencynot the spirit of the institutions the two things being the very antipodes of each other though common minds are so apt to confound themthe tendency of the institutions of this country in flagrant opposition to their spirit or intentions which were devised expressly to restrain the disposition of men to innovate is out of all question to foster this great abuse and to place numbers above principles even when the principles were solemnly adopted expressly to bring numbers under the control of a sound fundamental law this influence of numbers this dire mistake of the very nature of liberty by placing men and their passions above those great laws of right which come direct from god himself is increasing in force and threatens consequences which may set at naught all the welldevised schemes of the last generation for the security of the state and the happiness of that very people who can never know either security or even peace until they learn to submit themselves without a thought of resistance to those great rules of right which in truth form the spirit of their institutions and which are only too often in opposition to their own impulses and motives  we pretend to no knowledge on the subject of the dates of discoveries in the arts and sciences but well do we remember the earnestness and singleminded devotion to a laudable purpose with which our worthy friend first communicated to us his ideas on the subject of using the electric spark by way of a telegraph it was in paris and during the winter of 18312 and the succeeding spring a time when we were daily together and we have a satisfaction in recording this date that others may prove better claims if they can had morse set his great invention on foot thirty years earlier roswell gardiner might have communicated with his owner and got a reply ere he again sailed considerable as was the distance between them as things then were he was fain to be content with writing a letter which was put into the deacons hand about a week after it was written by his niece on his own return from a short journey to southold whither he had been to settle and discharge a tardy claim against his schooner  here is a letter for you uncle said mary pratt struggling to command her feelings though she blushed with the consciousness of her own interest in the missive it came from the harbour by some mistake baiting joe bringing it across just after you left home  a letter with a postmarkbeaufort ncwho in natur can this letter be fromwhat a postage too to charge on a letter fifty cents  that is a proof sir that beaufort must be a long way off besides the letter is double i think the handwriting is roswells  had the niece fired a sixpounder under her uncles ears he would scarcely have been more startled he even turned pale and instead of breaking the wafer as he had been about to do he actually shrunk from performing the act like one afraid to proceed  what can this mean said the deacon taking a moment to recover his voice garners handwriting so it is i declare if that imprudent young man has lost my schooner ill never forgive him in this world whatever a body may be forced to do in the next  it is not necessary to believe anything as bad as that uncle letters are often written at sea and sent in by vessels that are met i dare say roswell has done just this  not henot hethe careless fellow he has lost that schooner and all my property is in the hands of wrackers who are worse than so many rats in a larder beaufort nc yes that must be one of the bahamas and nc stands for new providenceahs me ahs me  but nc does not stand for new providenceit would be np in that case uncle  nc or np they sound so dreadfully alike that i dont know what to think take the letter and open it oh how big it isthere must be a protest or some other costly thing inclosed  mary did take the letter and she opened it though with trembling hands the inclosure soon appeared and the first glance of her eye told her it was a letter addressed to herself  what is it marywhat is it my child do not be afraid to tell me said the deacon in a low faltering voice i hope i know how to meet misfortunes with christian fortitude has it one of them awfullooking seals that notary publics use when they want money  mary blushed rosyred and she appeared very charming at that moment though as resolute as ever to give her hand only to a youth whose god should be her god  it is a letter to me sirnothing else i do assure you uncle roswell often writes to me as you know he has sent one of his letters inclosed in this to you  yes yesim glad its no worse well where was his letter written does he mention the latitude and longitude it will be some comfort to learn that he was well to the southward and eastward  marys colour disappeared and a paleness came over her face as she ran through the few first lines of the letter then she summoned all her resolution and succeeded in telling her uncle the facts  a misfortune has befallen poor roswell she said her voice trembling with emotion though it does not seem to be half as bad as it might have been the letter is written at beaufort in north carolina where the schooner has put in to get new masts having lost those with which she sailed in a gale of wind off cape hatteras  hatteras interrupted the deacon groaningwhat in natur had my vessel to do down there  i am sure i dont know sirbut i had better read you the contents of roswells letter and then you will hear the whole story  mary now proceeded to read aloud gardiner gave a frank explicit account of all that had happened since he parted with his owner concealing nothing and not attempting even to extenuate his fault of the sea lion of holmes hole he wrote at large giving it as his opinion that captain daggett really possessed some cluewhat he did not knowto the existence of the sealing islands though he rather thought that he was not very accurately informed of their precise position as respected the key roswell was silent for it did not at all occur to him that daggett knew anything of that part of his own mission in consequence of this opinion not the least suspicion of the motive of the vineyardman in sticking by him presented itself to gardiners mind and nothing on the subject was communicated in the letter on the contrary our young master was quite eloquent in expressing his gratitude to daggett and his crew for the assistance they had volunteered and without which he could not have been ready to go to sea again in less than a week as it was the letter was partly written as the schooner repassed the bar and was sent ashore by the pilot to be mailed this fact was stated in full in a postscript  volunteered groaned the deacon aloud as if a man ever volunteers to work without his pay  roswell tells us that captain daggett did uncle answered mary and that it is understood between them he is to make no charge for his going into beaufort or for anything he did while there vessels often help each other in this kind way i should hope for the sake of christian charity sir  not without salvage not without salvage charity is a good thing and it is our duty to exercise it on all occasions but salvage comes into charity all the same as into any other interest this schooner will ruin me i fear and leave me in my old age to be supported by the town  that can hardly happen uncle since you owe nothing for her and have your farms and all your other property unencumbered it is not easy to see how the schooner can ruin you  yes i am undonereturned the deacon beating the floor with his foot in nervous agitationas much undone as ever roswell garners father was and he might have been the richest man between oyster pond and riverhead had he kept out of the way of speculation i remember him much better off than i am myself and he died but little more than a beggar yes yes i see how it is this schooner has undone me  but roswell sends an account of all that he has paid and draws a bill on you for its payment the entire amount is but one hundred and sixteen dollars and seventytwo cents  thats not for salvage the next thing will be a demand for salvage in behalf of the owners and crew of the sea lion of humses hull i know how it will be child i know how it will be garner has undone me and i shall go down into my grave a beggar as his father has done already  if such be the fact uncle no one but i would be the sufferer and i will strive not to grieve over your losses but here is a paper that roswell has inclosed in his letter to me by mistake no doubt see sir it is an acknowledgment signed by captain daggett and all his crew admitting that they went into beaufort with roswell out of good feeling and allowing that they have no claims to salvage here it is sir you can read it for yourself  the deacon did not only read ithe almost devoured the paper which as mary suggested had been inclosed in her letter by mistake the relief produced by this document so far composed the uncle that he not only read gardiners letter himself with a very close attention to its contents but he actually forgave the cost of the repairs incurred at beaufort while he was in the height of his joy at this change in the aspect of things the niece stole into her own room in order to read the missive she had received by herself  the tears that mary pratt profusely shed over roswells letter were both sweet and bitter the manifestations of his affection for her which were manly and frank brought tears of tenderness from her eyes while the recollection of the width of the chasm that separated them had the effect to embitter these proofs of love most females would have lost the sense of duty which sustained our heroine in this severe trial and in accepting the man of their heart would have trusted to time and her own influence and the mercy of divine providence to bring about the change she desired but mary pratt could not thus blind herself to her own high obligations the tie of husband and wife she rightly regarded as the most serious of all the obligations we can assume and she could notwould not plight her vows to any man whose god was not her god  still there was much of sweet consolation in this littleexpected letter from roswell he wrote as he always did simply and naturally and attempted no concealments this was just as true of his acts as the master of the schooner as it was in his character of a suitor to mary he told the whole story of his weakness acknowledging that a silly spirit of pride which would not permit him to seem to abandon a trial of the qualities of the two schooners had induced him to stand on to the westward longer than he should otherwise have done and the currents had come to assist in increasing the danger as for daggett he supposed him to have been similarly influenced though he did not withhold his expressions of gratitude for the generous manner in which that seaman had stuck to him to the last  for weary months did mary pratt derive sweet consolation from her treasure of a letter it was perhaps no more than human nature or womans nature at least that in time she got most to regard those passages which best answered to the longings of her own heart and that she came at last to read the missive forgetful in a degree that it was written by one who had deliberately and as a matter of faith adopted the idea that the redeemer was not in what may be called the catholic sense of the term the son of god the papers gave an account of the arrival of the twin sea lions as the article styled them in the port of beaufort to repair damages and of their having soon sailed again in company this paragraph she cut out of the journal in which it met her eye and enclosing it in roswells last letter there was not a day in the succeeding year in which both were not in her hand and read for the hundredth time or more these proofs of tenderness however are not to be taken as evidence of any lessening of principle or as signs of a disposition to let her judgment and duty submit to her affection so far from this her resolution grew with reflection and her mind became more settled in a purpose that she deemed sacred the longer she reflected on the subject but her prayers in behalf of her absent lover grew more frequent and much more fervent  in the mean time the twin lions sailed on leaving beaufort they ran off the coast with a smart breeze from southwest making a leading wind of it there had been some variance of opinion between daggett and gardiner touching the course they ought to steer the last was for hauling up higher and passing to the southward of bermuda while the first contended for standing nearly due east and going to the northward of those islands gardiner felt impatient to repair his blunder and make the shortest cut he could whereas daggett reasoned more coolly and took the winds into the account keeping in view the main results of the voyage perhaps the last wished to keep his consort away from all the keys until he was compelled to alter his course in a way that would leave no doubt of his intentions of one thing the last was now certain he knew by a long trial that the sea lion of oyster pond could not very easily run away from the sea lion of holmes hole and he was fully resolved that she should not escape from him in the night or in squalls as for roswell gardiner not having the smallest idea of looking for his key until he came north after visiting the antarctic circle he had no notion whatever of the reason why the other stuck to him so closely and least of all why he wished to keep him clear of the west indies until ready to make a descent on his el dorado  beaufort lies about two degrees to the northward of the four hundred rocks islets and small islands which are known as the bermudas an advanced naval station that belongs to a rival commercial power and which is occupied by that power solely as a check on this republic in the event of war had the views of real statesmen prevailed in america instead of those of mere politicians the whole energy of this republic would have been long since directed to the object of substituting our own flag for that of england in these islands as things are there they exist a station for hostile fleets a receptacle for prizes and a depot for the munitions of war as if expressly designed by nature to hold the whole american coast in command while little men with great names are wrangling about southwestern acquisitions and northeastern boundaries that are of no real moment to the growth and power of the republic these islands that ought never to be out of the mind of the american statesman have not yet entered into the account at all a certain proof how little the minds that do or ought to influence events are really up to the work they have been delegated to perform military expeditions have twice been sent from this country to canada when both the canadas are not of onehalf the importance to the true security and independence of the countryno nation is independent until it holds the control of all its greater interests in its own handsas the bermudas when england asked the cession of territory undoubtedly american because it overshadowed quebec she should have been met with this plain propositiongive us the bermudas and we will exchange with you you hold those islands as a check on our power and we will hold the angle of maine for a check on yours unless you will consent to make a fair and mutual transfer we will not attack you for the possession of the bermudas for we deem a just principle even more important than such an accession but when you ask us to cede we hold out our hands to take an equivalent in return the policy of this nation is not to be influenced by sawlogs but by these manifest important and ulterior interests if you wish maine give us bermuda in exchange or go with your wishes ungratified happily among us events are stronger than men and the day is not distant when the mere force of circumstances will compel the smallfry of diplomacy to see what the real interests and dignity of the republic demand in reference to this great feature of its policy  roswell gardiner and daggett had several discussions touching the manner in which they ought to pass those islands there were about four degrees to spare between the trades and the bermudas and the former was of opinion that they might pass through this opening and make a straighter wake than by going farther north these consultations took place from quarterdeck to quarterdeck as the two schooners ran off free steering directly for the islands as a sort of compromise between the two opinions the distance from the main to the bermudas is computed at about six hundred miles which gave sufficient leisure for the discussion of the subject in all its bearings the conversations were amicable and the weather continuing mild and the wind standing they were renewed each afternoon when the vessels closed as if expressly to admit of the dialogue in all this time five days altogether it was farther ascertained that the difference in sailing between the twin lions as the sailors now began to call the two schooners was barely perceptible if anything it was slightly in favour of the vineyard craft though there yet remained many of the vicissitudes of the seas in which to make the trial while this uncertainty as to the course prevailed the low land appeared directly ahead when daggett consented to pass it to the southward keeping the cluster in sight however as they went steadily on towards the southward and eastward     chapter xi      with glossy skin and dripping mane     and reeling limbs and reeking flank   the wild steeds sinewy nerves still strain     up the repelling bank    mazeppa    roswell gardiner felt as if he could breathe more freely when they had run the summers group fairly out of sight and the last hummock had sunk into the waves of the west he was now fairly quit of america and hoped to see no more of it until he made the wellknown rock that points the way into that most magnificent of all the havens of the earth the bay of rio de janeiro travellers dispute whether the palm ought to be given to this port or to those of naples and constantinople each certainly has its particular claims to surpassing beauty which ought to be kept in view in coming to a decision seen from its outside with its minarets and golden horn and bosphorus constantinople is probably the most glorious spot on earth ascend its mountains and overlook the gulfs of salerno and gaeta as well as its own waters the campugna felici and the memorials of the past all seen in the witchery of an italian atmosphere and the mind becomes perfectly satisfied that nothing equal is to be found elsewhere but enter the bay of rio and take the whole of the noble panorama in at a glance and even the experienced traveller is staggered with the stupendous as well as bewitching character of the loveliness that meets his eye witchery is a charm that peculiarly belongs to italy as all must feel who have ever been brought within its influence but it is a witchery that is more or less shared by all regions of low latitudes  our two sea lions met with no adventures worthy of record until they got well to the southward of the equator they had been unusually successful in getting through the calm latitudes and fortysix days from montauk they spoke a sag harbour whaler homeward bound that had come out from rio only the preceding week where she had been to dispose of her oil by this ship letters were sent home and as gardiner could now tell the deacon that he should touch at rio even before the time first anticipated he believed that he should set the old mans heart at peace a little occurrence that took place the very day they parted with the whaler added to the pleasure this opportunity of communicating with the owner had afforded as the schooners were moving on in company about a cables length asunder hazard saw a sudden and extraordinary movement on board the vineyard lion as the men now named that vessel to distinguish her from her consort  look out for a spout shouted the mate to stimson who happened to be on the foretopsailyard at work when this unexpected interruption to the quiet of the passage occurred there is a man overboard from the other schooner or they see a spout  a spout a spout shouted stimson in return and a spalm sperm or spermaceti was meant whale in the bargain here he is sir two pints on our weather beam  this was enough if any one has had the misfortune to be in a coach drawn by four horses when a sudden fright starts them off at speed he can form a pretty accurate notion of the movement that now took place on board of deacon pratts craft every one seemed to spring into activity as if a single will directed a common set of muscles those who were below literally tumbled up as seamen express it and those who were aloft slid down to the deck like flashes of lightning captain gardiner sprang out of his cabin seemingly at a single bound at another he was in the whaleboat that hazard was in the very act of lowering into the water as the schooner roundedto perceiving himself anticipated here the mate turned to the boat on the other quarter and was in her and in the water almost as soon as his commanding officer  although neither of the schooners was thoroughly fitted for a whaler each had lines lances harpoons c in readiness in their quarterboats prepared for any turn of luck like this which now offered the process of paddling up to whales which is now so common in the american ships was then very little or not at all resorted to it is said that the animals have got to be so shy in consequence of being so much pursued that the old mode of approaching them will not suffice and that it now requires much more care and far more art to take one of these creatures than it did thirty years since on this part of the subject we merely repeat what we hear though we think we can see an advantage in the use of the paddle that is altogether independent of that of the greater quiet of that mode of forcing a boat ahead he that paddles looks ahead and the approach is more easily regulated when the whole of the boats crew are apprised by means of their own senses of the actual state of things than when they attain their ideas of them through the orders of an officer the last must govern in all cases but the men are prepared for them when they can see what is going on and will be more likely to act with promptitude and intelligence and will be less liable to make mistakes  the four boats two from each schooner dropped into the water nearly about the same time daggett was at the steeringoar of one as was roswell at that of another hazard and macy the chief mate of the vineyard craft were at the steeringoars of the two remaining boats all pulled in the direction of the spot on the ocean where the spouts had been seen it was the opinion of those who had been aloft that there were several fish and it was certain that they were of the most valuable species or the spermaceti one barrel of the oil of which was worth about as much as the oil of three of the ordinary sort or that of the right whale supposing them all to yield the same quantity in number of barrels the nature or species of the fish was easily enough determined by the spouts the right whale throwing up two high arched jets of water while the spermaceti throws but a single low bushy one  it was not long ere the boats of the two captains came abreast of each other and within speaking distance a stern rivalry was now apparent in every countenance the men pulling might and main and without even a smile among them all every face was grave earnest and determined every arm strung to its utmost powers of exertion the men rowed beautifully being accustomed to the use of their long oars in rough water and in ten minutes they were all fully a mile dead to windward of the two schooners  few things give a more exalted idea of the courage and ingenuity of the human race than to see adventurers set forth in a mere shell on the troubled waters of the open ocean to contend with and capture an animal of the size of the whale the simple circumstance that the last is in its own element while its assailants are compelled to approach it in such light and fragile conveyances that to the unpractised eye it is sufficiently difficult to manage them amid the rolling waters without seeking so powerful an enemy to contend with but little of all this did the crews of our four boats now think they had before them the objects or one of the objects rather of their adventure and so long as that was the case no other view but that of prevailing could rise before their eyes  how is it garner called out the vineyard master shall it be shares or does each schooner whale on her own hook  this was asked in a friendly way and apparently with great indifference as to the nature of the reply but with profound art it was daggetts wish to establish a sort of partnership which taken in connection with the good feeling created by the affair at beaufort would be very apt to lead on to further and more important association luckily for gardiner an idea crossed his mind just as he was about to reply which induced the wisest answer it was the thought that competition would be more likely to cause exertion than a partnership and that the success of all would better repay them for their toils and risks should each vessel act exclusively for itself this is the principle that renders the present state of society more healthful and advantageous than that which the friends of the different systems of associating that are now so much in vogue wish to substitute in its place individuality is an allimportant feeling in the organization of human beings into communities and the political economist who does not use it as his most powerful auxiliary in advancing civilization will soon see it turn round in its tracks and become a dead weight indulging its selflove by living with the minimum of exertion instead of pushing his private advantage with the maximum  i think each vessel had better work for herself and her owners answered roswell gardiner  as the schooners were in the trades there was a regular sea running and one that was neither very high nor much broken still the boats were lifted on it like eggshells or bubbles the immense power of the ocean raising the largest ships groaning under their vast weight of ordnance as if they were feathers in a few minutes gardiner and daggett became a little more separated each looking eagerly for the spouts which had not been seen by either since quitting his vessel all this time the two mates came steadily on until the whole of the little fleet of boats was by this time not less than a marine league distant from the schooners the vessels themselves were working up to windward to keep as near to the boats as possible making short tacks under reduced canvass a shipkeeper the cook steward and one or two other hands being all who were left on board them  we shall suppose that most of our readers are sufficiently acquainted with the general character of that class of animals to which the whale belongs to know that all of the genus breathe the atmospheric air which is as necessary for life to them as it is to man himself the only difference in this respect is that the whale can go longer without renewing his respiration than all purely landanimals though he must come up to breathe at intervals or die it is the exhaling of the old stock of air when he brings the blowholes as seamen call the outlets of his respiratory organs to the surface that forces the water upward and forms the spouts which usually indicate to the whalers the position of their game the spouts vary in appearance as has been mentioned owing to the number and situation of the orifices by which the exhausted air escapes no sooner is the vitiated air exhaled than the lungs receive a new supply and the animal either remains near the surface rolling about and sporting amid the waves or descends again a short distance in quest of its food this food also varies materially in the different species the rightwhale is supposed to live on what may be termed marine insects or the molluscæ of the ocean which it is thought he obtains by running in the parts of the sea where they most abound arresting them by the hairy fibres which grow on the laminæ of bone that in a measure compose his jaws having no teeth the spermaceti however is furnished with regular grinders which he knows very well how to use and with which he often crushes the boats of those who come against him thus the whalers have but one danger to guard against in assaulting the common animal viz his flukes or tail while the spermaceti in addition to the last means of defence possesses those of his teeth or jaws as this latter animal is quite onethird head he has no very great dissemblance to the alligator in this particular  by means of this brief description of the physical formation and habits of the animals of which our adventurers were in pursuit the general reader will be the better able to understand that which it is our duty now to record after rowing the distance named the boats became a little separated in their search for the fish that spouts had been seen there was no doubt though since quitting the schooners no one in the boats had got a further view of the fishif fish animals with respiratory organs can be termed a good lookout for spouts had been kept by each man at the steeringoars but entirely without success had not roswell and daggett previously to leaving their respective vessels seen the signs of whales with their own eyes it is probable that they would now have both been disposed to return calling in their mates but being certain that the creatures they sought were not far distant they continued slowly to separate each straining his eyes in quest of his game as his boat rose on the summit of the rolling and tossing waves water in motion was all around them and the schooners working slowly up against the trades were all that rewarded their vigilant and anxious looks twenty times did each fancy that he saw the dark back or head of the object he sought but as often did it prove to be no more than a lipper of water rolling up into a hummock ere it broke or melted away again into the general mass of the unquiet ocean when it is remembered that the surface of the sea is tossed into a thousand fantastic outlines as its waves roll along it can readily be imagined how such mistakes could arise  at length gardiner discerned that which his practised eye well knew it was the flukes or extremity of the tail of an enormous whale distant from him less than a quarter of a mile and in such a position as to place the animal at about the same breadth of water from daggett it would seem that both of these vigilant officers perceived their enemy at the same instant for each boat started for it as if it had been instinct with life the pike or the shark could not have darted towards its prey with greater promptitude and scarcely with greater velocity than these two boats very soon the whole herd was seen swimming along against the wind an enormous bullwhale leading while half a dozen calves kept close to the sides of their dams or sported among themselves much as the offspring of land animals delight in their youth and strength presently a mother rolled lazily over on her side permitting its calf to suck others followed this example and then the leader of the herd ceased his passage to windward but began to circle the spot as if in complaisance to those considerate nurses who thus waited on the wants of their young at this interesting moment the boats came glancing in among the herd  had the competition and spirit of rivalry been at a lower point among our adventurers than it actually was greater caution might have been observed it is just as dangerous to assault a whale that has its young to defend as to assault most other animals we know that the most delicate women become heroines in such straits and nature seems to have given to the whole sex whether endowed with reason or only with an instinct the same disposition to die in defence of the helpless creatures that so much depend on their care but no one there now thought of the risk he ran it being the vineyard against oyster pond one sea lion against the other and in many instances pocket against pocket  roswell as if disdaining all meaner game pulled quite through the herd and laid the bows of his boat directly on the side of the old bulla hundredbarrel whale at the very least no sooner did the enormous creature feel the harpoon than throwing its flukes upward it descended into the depths of the ocean with a velocity that caused smoke to arise from the chuck through which the line passed ordinarily the movement of a whale is not much faster than an active man can walk and when it runs on the surface its speed seldom exceeds that of a swift vessel under full sail but when suddenly startled with the harpoon in its blubber the animal is capable of making a prodigious exertion when struck it usually sounds as it is termed or runs downward sometimes to the depth of a mile and it is said that instances have been known in which the fish inflicted great injury on itself by dashing its head against rocks  in the case before us after running out three or four hundred fathoms of line the bull to which gardiner had fastened came up to the surface blowed and began to move slowly towards the herd again no sooner was the harpoon thrown than a change took place in the disposition of the crew of the boat which it may be well to explain the harpoon is a barbed javelin fastened to a staff to give it momentum the line is attached to this weapon the proper use of which is to fasten to the fish though it sometimes happens that the animal is killed at the first blow this is when the harpoon has been hurled by a very skilful and vigorous harpooner usually this weapon penetrates some distance into the blubber in which a whale is encased and when it is drawn back by the plunge of the fish the barbed parts get embedded in the tough integuments of the hide together with the blubber and hold the iron of the harpoon being very soft the shank bends under the strain of the line leaving the staff close to the animals body owing to this arrangement the harpoon offers less resistance to the water as the whale passes swiftly through it no sooner did the boatsteerer or harpooner cast his irons as whalers term the harpoon than he changed places with roswell who left the steeringoar and proceeded forward to wield the lance the weapon with which the victory is finally consummated the men now peaked their oars as it is termed or they placed the handles in cleets made to receive them leaving the blades elevated in the air so as to be quite clear of the water this was done to get rid of the oars in readiness for other duty while the instruments were left in the tholes to be resorted to in emergencies this gives a whaleboat a peculiar appearance with its five long oars raised in the air at angles approaching fortyfive degrees in the mean time as the bull approached the herd or school as the whalers term it the boats crew began to haul in line the boatsteerer coiling it away carefully in a tub placed in the sternsheets purposely to receive it any one can understand how important it was that this part of the duty should be well performed since bights of line running out of a boat dragged by a whale would prove so many snares to the mens legs unless previously disposed of in a place proper to let it escape without this risk for this reason it is that the end of a line is never permitted to run out at the bow of a boat at all it might do some injury in its passage and an axe is always applied near the bows when it is found necessary to cut from a whale     we suppose this word to be a corruption of the dutch schule   which we take it means the same thing  it was so unusual a thing to see a fish turn towards the spot where he was struck that roswell did not know what to make of this manoeuvre in his bull at first he supposed the animal meant to make fight and set upon him with its tremendous jaws but it seemed that caprice or alarm directed the movement for after coming within a hundred yards of the boat the creature turned and commenced sculling away to windward with wide and nervous sweeps of its formidable flukes it is by this process that all the fish of this genus force their way through the water their tails being admirably adapted to the purpose as the men had showed the utmost activity in hauling in upon the line by the time the whale went off to windward again they had got the boat up within about four hundred feet of him  now commenced a tow dead to windward it being known that a fish when struck seldom runs at first in any other direction the rate at which the whale moved was not at the height of his speed though it exceeded six knots occasionally this rate was lessened and in several instances his speed was reduced to less than half of that just mentioned whenever one of these lulls occurred the men would haul upon the line gradually getting nearer and nearer to the fish until they were within fifty feet of his tremendous flukes here a turn was taken with the line and an opportunity to use the lance was waited for  whalers say that a fortybarrel bull of the spermaceti sort is much the most dangerous to deal with of all the animals of this species the larger bulls are infinitely the most powerful and drive these halfgrown creatures away in herds by themselves that are called pads a circumstance that probably renders the young bull discontented and fierce the last is not only more active than the larger animal but is much more disposed to make fight commonly giving his captors the greatest trouble this may be one of the reasons why roswell gardiner now found himself towing at a reasonable rate so close upon the flukes of a hundredbarrel whale still there was that in the movements of this animal that induced our hero to be exceedingly wary he was now two leagues from the schooners and half that distance from the other boats neither of which had as yet fastened to a fish this latter circumstance was imputed to the difficulty the different officers had in making their selections cows of the spermaceti breed when they give suck being commonly light and yielding comparatively very small quantities of headmatter and oil in selecting the bull roswell had shown his judgment the male animal commonly returning to its conquerors twice the profit that is derived from the female  the whale to which roswell was fast continued sculling away to windward for quite two hours causing the men to entirely lose sight of the other boats and bringing the topsails of the schooners themselves down to the waters edge fortunately it was not yet noon and there were no immediate apprehensions from the darkness nor did the bull appear to be much alarmed though the boat was towing so close in his rear at first or before the irons were thrown the utmost care had been taken not to make a noise but the instant the crew were fast whispers were changed into loud calls and orders were passed in shouts rather than in verbal commands the wildest excitement prevailed among the men strangely blended with a cool dexterity but it was very apparent that a high sporting fever was raging among them gardiner himself was much the coolest man in his own boat as became his station and very responsible duties  stimson the oldest and the best seaman in the schooner he who had admonished his young commander on the subject of the gratitude due to the deity acted as the masters boatsteerer having first performed the duty of harpooner it was to him that gardiner now addressed the remarks he made after having been fastened to his whale fully two hours  this fellow is likely to give us a long drag said the master as he stood balancing himself on the clumsy elects in the bows of the boat using his lance as an adept in saltation poises his pole on the wire the water curling fairly above the gunwale forward with the rapid movement of the boat i would haul up alongside and give him the lance did i not distrust them flukes i believe he knows we are here  that he doesthat does he captain garner its always best to be moderate and wait your time sir theres a jerk about that chaps flukes that i dont like myself and its best to see what he would be at before we haul up any nearer dont you see sir that every minute or two he strikes down instead of sculling off handsomely and with a wide sweep as becomes a whale  that is just the motion i distrust stephen and i shall wait a bit to see what he would be at i hope those shipkeepers will be busy and work the schooners well up to windward before it gets to be dark our man is asleep half his time and is apt to let the vessel fall off a point or two  mr hazard gave him caution to keep a bright look out sir and i think hell be apt tolook out sirlook out  this warning was welltimed for just at that instant the whale ceased sculling and lifting its enormous tail high in the air it struck five or six blows on the surface of the water that made a noise which might have been heard half a league besides filling the atmosphere immediately around him with spray as the tail first appeared in the air line was permitted to run out of the boat increasing the distance between its bows and the flukes to quite a hundred feet nothing could better show the hardy characters of the whalers than the picture then presented by roswell gardiner and his companions in the midst of the atlantic leagues from their vessel and no other boat in sight there they sat patiently waiting the moment when the giant of the deep should abate in his speed or in his antics to enable them to approach and complete their capture most of the men sat with their arms crossed and bodies halfturned regarding the scene while the two officers the master and boatsteerer if the latter could properly be thus designated watched each evolution with a keenness of vigilance that let nothing like a sign or a symptom escape them  such was the state of things the whale still threshing the sea with his flukes when a cry among his men induced roswell for a moment to look aside there came daggett fast to a small bull which was running directly in the winds eye with great speed dragging the boat after him which was towing astern at a distance of something like two hundred fathoms at first roswell thought he should be compelled to cut from his whale so directly towards his own boat did the other animal direct his course but intimidated most probably by the tremendous blows with which the larger bull continued to belabour the ocean the smaller animal sheered away in time to avoid a collision though he now began to circle the spot where his dreaded monarch lay this change of course gave rise to a new source of apprehension if the smaller bull should continue to encircle the larger there was great reason to believe that the line of daggett might get entangled with the boat of gardiner and produce a collision that might prove fatal to all there in order to be ready to meet this danger roswell ordered his crew to be on the lookout and to have their knives in a state for immediate use it was not known what might have been the consequence of this circular movement as respects the two boats for before they could come together daggetts line actually passed into the mouth of gardiners whale and drawing up tight into the angle of his jaws set the monster in motion with a momentum and power that caused the iron to draw from the smaller whale which by this time had more than half encircled the animal so rapid was the rate of running now that roswell was obliged to let out line his whale sounding to a prodigious depth daggett did the same unwilling to cut as long as he could hold on to his line  at the expiration of five minutes the large bull came up again for breath with both lines still fast to him the one in the regular way or attached to the harpoon and the other jammed in the jaws of the animal by means of the harpoon and staff which formed a sort of toggle at the angle of his enormous mouth in consequence of feeling this unusual tenant the fish compressed its jaws together thus rendering the fastening so much the more secure as both boats had let run line freely while the whale was sounding they now found themselves near a quarter of a mile astern of him towing along side by side and not fifty feet asunder if the spirit of rivalry had been aroused among the crew of these two boats before it was now excited to a degree that menaced acts of hostility  you know of course captain daggett that this is my whale said gardiner i was fast to him regularly and was only waiting for him to become a little quiet to lance him when your whale crossed his course fouled your line and has got you fast in an unaccountable way but not according to whaling law  i dont know that i fastened to a whale captain garner and am fast to a whale now it must be proved that i have no right to the crittur before i give him up  gardiner understood the sort of man with whom he had to deal too well to waste words in idle remonstrances resolved to maintain his just rights at every hazard he ordered his men to haul in upon the line the movement of the whale becoming so slow as to admit of this measure daggetts crew did the same and a warm contest existed between the two boats as to which should now first close with the fish and kill it this was not a moment for prudence and caution it was haul inhaul in boys in both boats without any regard to the danger of approaching the whale a very few minutes sufficed to bring the parties quite in a line with the flukes gardiners boat coming up on the larboard or lefthand side of the animal where its iron was fast and daggetts on the opposite its line leading out of the jaws of the fish in that direction the two masters stood erect on their respective clumsy cleets each poising his lance waiting only to get near enough to strike the men were now at the oars and without pausing for any thing both crews sprung to their ashen instruments and drove the boats headlong upon the fish daggett perhaps was the coolest and most calculating at that moment but roswell was the most nervous and the boldest the boat of the last actually hit the side of the whale as its young commander drove his lance through the blubber into the vitals of the fish at the same instant daggett threw his lance with consummate skill and went to the quick it was now stern all for life each boat backing off from the danger as fast as hands could urge the sea was in a foam the fish going into his flurry almost as soon as struck and both crews were delighted to see the red of the blood mingling its deep hues with the white of the troubled water once or twice the animal spouted but it was a fluid dyed in his gore in ten minutes it turned up and was dead     chapter xii      god save you sir   and you sir you are welcome   travel you far on or are you at the furthest   sir at the furthest for a week or two    shakspeare    gardiner and daggett met face to face on the carcase of the whale each struck his lance into the blubber steadying himself by its handle and each eyed the other in a way that betokened feelings awakened to a keen desire to defend his rights it is a fault of american charactera fruit of the institutions beyond a doubtthat renders men unusually indisposed to give up this stubbornness of temperament that so many mistake for a love of liberty and independence is productive of much good when the parties happen to be right and of quite as much evil when they happen to be wrong it is ever the wisest as indeed it is the noblest course to defer to that which is just with a perfect reliance on its being the course pointed out by the finger of infallible wisdom and truth he who does this need feel no concern for his dignity or for his success being certain that it is intended that right shall prevail in the end as prevail it will and does but both our shipmasters were too much excited to feel the force of these truths and there they stood sternly regarding each other as if it were their purpose to commence a new struggle for the possession of the leviathan of the deep  captain daggett said roswell sharply you are too old a whaler not to know whaling law my irons were first in this fish i never have been loose from it since it was first struck and my lance killed it under such circumstances sir i am surprised that any man who knows the usages among whalers should have stuck by the creature as you have done  its in my natur garner was the answer i stuck by you when you was dismasted under hatteras and i stick by everything that i undertake this is what i call vineyard natur and im not about to discredit my native country  this is idle talk returned roswell casting a severe glance at the men in the vineyard boat among whom a common smile arose as if they highly approved of the reply of their own officer you very well know that vineyard law cannot settle such a question but american law were you man enough to take this whale from me as i trust you are not on our return home you could be and would be made to pay smartly for the act uncle sam has a long arm with which he sometimes reaches round the whole earth before you proceed any further in this matter it may be well to remember that  daggett reflected and it is probable that as he cooled off from the excitement created by his late exertions he fully recognised the justice of the others remarks and the injustice of his own claims still it seemed to him unamerican unvineyard if the reader please to give up and he clung to his error with as much pertinacity as if he had been right  if you are fast i am fast too im not so certain of your law when a man puts an iron into a whale commonly it is his fish if he can get him and kill him but there is a law above all whalers law and that is the law of divine providence providence has fastened us to this crittur as if on purpose to give us a right in it and im by no means so sure states law wont uphold that doctrine then i lost my own whale by means of this and am entitled to some compensation for such a loss  you lost your own whale because he led round the head of mine and not only drew his own iron but came nigh causing me to cut if any one is entitled to damage for such an act it is i who have been put to extra trouble in getting my fish  i do believe it was my lance that did the job for the fellow i darted and you struck in that way i got the start of you and may claim to have made the crittur spout the first blood but hearkee garnertheres my handweve been friends so far and i want to hold out friends i will make you a proposal therefore join stocks from this moment and whale and seal and do all things else in common when we make a final stowage for the return passage we can make a final division and each man take his share of the common adventure  to do roswell justice he saw through the artifice of this proposition the instant it was uttered it had the effect notwithstanding a good deal to mollify his feelings since it induced him to believe that daggett was manoeuvring to get at his great secret rather than to assail his rights  you are part owner of your schooner captain daggett our hero answered while i have no other interest in mine than my lay as her master you may have authority to make such a bargain but i have none it is my duty to fill the craft as fast and as full as i can and carry her back safely to deacon pratt but i dare say your vineyard people will let you cruise about the earth at your pleasure trusting to providence for a profit i cannot accept your offer  this is answering like a man garner and i like you all the better for it forty or fifty barrels of ile shant break friendship between us i helped you into port at beaufort and gave up the salvage and now ill help tow your whale alongside and see you fairly through this business too perhaps i shall have all the better luck for being a little generous  there was prudence as well as art in this decision of daggetts notwithstanding his ingenious pretensions to a claim in the whale he knew perfectly well that no law would sustain it and that in addition to the chances of being beaten on the spot which were at least equal he would certainly be beaten in the courts at home should he really attempt to carry out his declared design then he really deferred to the expectation that his future good fortune might be influenced by his present forbearance superstition forms a material part of a sailors nature if indeed it do not that of every man engaged in hazardous and uncertain adventures how far his hopes were justified in this last respect will appear in the contents of a communication that deacon pratt received from the master of his schooner and to which we will now refer as the clearest and briefest mode of continuing the narrative  the sea lion left oyster pond late in september it was the third day of march in the succeeding year that mary was standing at a window gazing with melancholy interest at that point in the adjacent waters where last she had seen nearly six months before the vessel of roswell disappear behind the woods of the island that bears his family name there had been a long easterly gale but the weather had changed the south wind blew softly and all the indications of an early spring were visible for the first time in three months she had raised the sash of that window and the air that entered was bland and savoured of the approaching season  i dare say unclethe deacon was writing near a very low woodfire which was scarcely more than embersi dare say uncle said the sweet voice of mary which was a little tremulous with feeling that the ocean is calm enough today it is very silly in us to tremble when there is a storm for those who must now be so many many thousand miles away what is the distance between the antarctic seas and oyster pond i wonder  you ought to be able to calculate that yourself gal or what is the use to pay for your schooling  i should not know how to set about it uncle returned the gentle mary though i should be very glad to know  how many miles are there in a degree of latitude child you know that i believe  more than sixtynine sir  well in what latitude is oyster pond  i have heard roswell say that we were a little higher as he calls it than fortyone  well 41 times 69figuring as he spokemake 2829 say we are 3000 miles from the equator the nearest way we can get there then the antarctic circle commences in 23° 30 south which deducted from 90 degrees leave just 66° 30 between the equator and the nearest spot within the sea you have mentioned now 66° 30 give about 4589 statute miles more in a straight line allowing only 69 to a degree the two sums added together make 7589 miles or rather more but the road is not straight by any means as shipmasters tell me and i suppose garner must have gone at the very least 8000 miles to reach his latitude to say nothing of a considerable distance of longitude to travel over to the southward of cape horn  it is a terrible distance to have a friend from us ejaculated mary though in a low dejected tone  it is a terrible distance for a man to trust his property away from him gal and i do not sleep anights for thinking of it when i remember where my own schooner may be all this time  ah here is baiting joe and with a letter in his hand uncle i do declare  it might be a secret hope that impelled mary for away she bounded like a young fawn running to meet the old fisherman at the door no sooner did her eyes fall on the superscription than the large package was pressed to her heart and she seemed for an instant lost in thanksgiving that no one might unnecessarily be a witness of what passed between her uncle and herself joe was directed to the kitchen where a good meal a glass of rum and water and the quarter of a dollar that mary gave him as she showed the way satisfied him with the results of his trouble  here it is uncle cried the nearly breathless girl reentering the keepingroom and unconsciously holding the letter still pressed to her hearta lettera letter from roswell in his own precious hand  a flood of tears gave some relief to feelings that had so long been pent and eased a heart that had been compressed nearly to breaking at any other time and at this unequivocal evidence of the hold the young man had on the affections of his niece deacon pratt would have remonstrated with her on the folly of refusing to become roswell garners wife but the sight of the letter drove all other thoughts from his head concentrating his whole being in the fate of the schooner  look and see if it has the antarctic postmark on it mary said the deacon in a tremulous voice  this request was not made so much in ignorance as in trepidation the deacon very well knew that the islands the sea lion was to visit were uninhabited and were destitute of postoffices but his ideas were confused and apprehension rendered him silly  uncle exclaimed the niece wiping the tears from a face that was now rosy with blushes at her own weakness surely roswell can find no postoffice where he is  but the letter must have some postmark child baiting joe has not brought it himself into the country  it is postmarked new york sir and nothing elseyes here is forwarded by cane spriggs and button rio de janeiro it must have been put into a postoffice there  riohere is more salvage galmore salvage coming to afflict me  but you had no salvage to pay uncle on the other occasion perhaps there will be none to pay on this had i not better open the letter at once and see what has happened  yes open it child answered the deacon in a voice so feeble as to be scarcely audibleopen it at once as you say and let me know my fate anything is better than this torment  mary did not wait for a second permission but instantly broke the seal it might have been the result of education or there may be such a thing as female instinct in these matters but certain it is that the girl turned towards the window as she tore the paper asunder and slipped the letter that bore her own name into a fold of her dress so dexterously that one far more keensighted than her uncle would not have detected the act no sooner was her own letter thus secured than the niece offered the principal epistle to her uncle  read it yourself mary said the last in his querulous tones my eyes are so dim that i could not see to read it  rio di janeiro province of brazil south america nov 14th 1819 commenced the niece  rio di janeiro interrupted the uncle why that is round cape horn isnt it mary  certainly not sir brazil is on the east side of the andes and rio di janeiro is its capital the king of portugal lives there now and has lived there as long as i can remember  yes yes i had forgotten the brazil banks where our whalers go are in the atlantic but what can have taken garner into rio unless it be to spend more money  by reading the letter sir we shall soon know i see there is something about spermaceti oil here  ile and spalm ile do you say exclaimed the deacon brightening up at onceread on mary my good galread the letter as fast as you canread it at a trot  deacon israel prattdear sir continued mary in obedience to this command the two schooners sailed from beaufort north carolina as stated already per mail in a letter written at that port and which has doubtless come to hand we had fine weather and a tolerable run of it until we reached the calm latitudes where we were detained by the usual changes for about a week on the 18th oct the pleasant cry of there she spouts was heard aboard here and we found ourselves in the neighbourhood of whales both schooners lowered their boats and i was soon fast to a fine bull who gave us a long tow before the lance was put into him and he was made to spout blood captain daggett set up some claims to this fish in consequence of his lines getting foul of the creatures jaws but he changed his mind in good season and clapped on to help tow the whale down to the vessel his irons drew from a young bull and a good deal of dissatisfaction existed among the other crew until fortunately the school of young bulls came round quite near us when captain daggett and his people succeeded in securing no less than three of the fish and mr hazard got a very fine one for us  i am happy to say that we had very pleasant weather to cut in and secured every gallon of the oil of both our whales as did captain daggett all of his our largest bull made one hundred and nineteen barrels of which fortythree barrels was headmatter i never saw better case and junk in a whale in my life the smallest bull turned out well too making fiftyeight barrels of which twentyone was head daggett got one hundred and thirtythree barrels from his three fish a very fair proportion of head though not as large as our own having this oil on board we came in here after a pleasant run and i have shipped as per invoice enclosed one hundred and seventyseven barrels of spermaceti oil viz sixtyfour barrels of head and rest in bodyoil to your order care of fish  grinnell new york by the brig jason captain williams who will sail for home about the 20th proximo and to whom i trust this letter  stop mary my dearthis news is overpoweringit is almost too good to be true interrupted the deacon nearly as much unmanned by this intelligence of his good fortune as he had previously been by his apprehensions yes it does seem too good to be true read it again child yes read every syllable of it again  mary complied delighted enough to hear all she could of roswells success  why uncle said the deeplyinterested girl all this oil is spermaceti it is worth a great deal more than so much of that which comes of the right whale  more ay nearly as three for one hunt me up the last spectator girlhunt me up the last spectator and let me see at once at what they quote spalm  mary soon found the journal and handed it to her uncle  yes here it is and quoted 11212 per gallon as i live thats nine shillings a gallon maryjust calculate on that bit of paperthirty times one hundred and seventyseven mary how much is that child  i make it 5310 uncleyes that is right but what are the 30 times for sir  gallons gal gallons each barrel has 30 gallons in it if not more there ought to be 32 by rights but this is a cheating age now multiply 5310 by 9 and see what that comes to  just 47790 sir as near as i can get it  yes thats the shillings now divide 47790 by 8 my dear be actyve mary be actyve  it leaves 5973 with a remainder of 6 sir i believe im right  i dare say you are child yes i dare say you are this is the dollars a body may call them 6000 as the barrels will a little overrun the 30 gallons my share of this will be twothirds and that will nett the handsome sum of say 4000  the deacon rubbed his hands with delight and having found his voice again his niece was astonished at hearing him utter what he had to say with a sort of glee that sounded in her ears as very unnatural coming from him so it was however and she dutifully endeavoured not to think of it  four thousand dollars mary will quite cover the first cost of the schooner that is without including outfit and sparerigging of which her master took about twice as much as was necessary hes a capital fellow is that young garner and will make an excellent husband as ive always told you child a little wasteful perhaps but an excellent youth at the bottom i dare say he lost his spars off cape hatteras in trying to outsail that daggett but i overlook all that now hes a capital youth to work upon a whale or a seaelephant there isnt his equal as ill engage in all ameriky if youll only let him know where to find the creaturs i knew his character before i engaged him for no man but a real skinner shall ever command a craft of mine  roswell is a good fellow answered mary with emphasis the tears filling her eyes as she listened to these eulogiums of her uncle on the youth she loved with all of a womans tenderness at the very moment she scrupled to place her happiness on one whose god was not her god no one knows him better than i uncle and no one respects him more but had i not better read the rest of his letterthere is a good deal more of it  go on child go onbut read the part over again where he speaks of the quantity of the ile he has shipped to fish  grinnell  mary did as requested when she proceeded to read aloud the rest of the communication  i have been much at a loss how to act in regard to captain daggett said roswell in his letter he stood by me so manfully and generously off cape hatteras that i did not like to part company in the night or in a squall which would have seemed ungrateful as well as wearing a sort of runaway look i am afraid he has some knowledge of the existence of our islands though i doubt whether he has their latitude and longitude exactly something there is of this nature on board the other schooner her people often dropping hints to my officers and men when they have been gamming i have sometimes fancied daggett sticks so close to us that he may get the advantage of our reckoning to help him to what he wants to find he is no great navigator anywhere running more by signs and currents in my judgment than by the use of his instruments still he could find his way to any part of the world  stop there mary stop a little and let me have time to consider isnt it awful child  the niece changed colour and seemed really frightened so catching was the deacons distress though she scarce knew what was the matter  what is awful uncle at length she asked anxious to know the worst  this covetousness in them vineyarders i consider it both awful and wicked i must get the rev mr whittle to preach against the sin of covetousness it does gain so much ground in ameriky the whole church should lift its voice against it or it will shortly lift its voice against the church to think of them daggetts fitting out a schooner to follow my craft about the arth in this unheardof manner just as if she was a pilotboat and young garner a pilot i do hope the fellows will make a wrack of it among the ice of the antarctic seas that would be a fit punishment for their impudence and covetousness  i suppose sir they think that they have the same right to sail on the ocean that others have seals and whales are the gifts of god and one person has no more right to them than another  you forget mary that one man may have a secret that another doesnt know in that case he ought not to go prying about like an old woman in a village neighbourhood read on child read on and let me know the worst at once  i shall sail tomorrow having finished all my business here and hope to be off cape horn in twenty days if not sooner in what manner i am to get rid of daggett i do not yet know he outsails me a little on all tacks unless it be in very heavy weather when i have a trifling advantage over him it will be in my power to quit him any dark night but if i let him go ahead and he should really have any right notions about the position of the islands he might get there first and make havoc among the seals  awful awful interrupted the deacon again that would be the worst of all i wont allow it i forbid itit shall not be  alas uncle poor roswell is too far from us now to hear these words no doubt the matter is long since decided and he has acted according to the best of his judgment  it is terrible to have ones property so far away government ought to have steamboats or packets of some sort running between new york and gape horn to carry orders back and forthbut we shall never have things right mary so long as the democrats are uppermost  by this remark which savours very strongly of a species of censure that is much in fashion in the coteries of that great emporium which it is the taste and pleasure of its people to term a commercial emporium especially among elderly ladies the reader will at once perceive that the deacon was a federalist which was somewhat of a novelty in suffolk thirty years since had he lived down to our own times the old man would probably have made all the gyrations in politics that have distinguished the school to which he would have belonged and without his own knowledge most probably would have been as near an example of perpetual motion as the world will ever see through his devotion to what are now called whig principles we are no great politician but time has given us the means of comparing and we often smile when we hear the disciples of hamilton and of adams and of all that hightoned school declaiming against the use of the veto and talking of the one man power and of congress leading the government the deacon was very apt to throw the opprobrium of even a bad season on the administration and the reader has seen what he thought of the subject of running packets between new york and cape horn  there ought to be a large navy mary a monstrous navy so that the vessels might be kept carrying letters about and serving the public but we shall never have things right until rufus king or some man like him gets in if garner lets that daggett get the start of him he never need come home again the islands are as much mine as if i had bought them and im not sure an action wouldnt lie for seals taken on them without my consent yes yes we want a monstrous navy to convoy sealers and carry letters about and keep some folks at home while it lets other folks go about their lawful business  of what islands are you speaking uncle surely the sealing islands where roswell has gone are public and uninhabited and no one has a better right there than another  the deacon perceived that he had gone too far in his tribulation and began to have a faint notion that he was making a fool of himself he asked his niece in a very faint voice therefore to hand him the letter the remainder of which he would endeavour to read himself although every word that roswell gardiner wrote was very precious to mary the gentle girl had a still unopened epistle to herself to peruse and glad enough was she to make the exchange handing the deacon his letter therefore she withdrew at once to her private room in order to read her own  dearest mary said roswell gardiner in this epistle your uncle will tell you what has brought us into this port and all things connected with the schooner i have sent home more than 4000 worth of oil and i hope my owner will forgive the accident off currituck on account of this run of good luck in my opinion we shall yet make a voyage and that part of my fortune will be secure would that i could feel as sure of finding you more disposed to be kind to me on my return i read in your bible every day mary and i often pray to god to enlighten my mind if my views have been wrong as yet i cannot flatter myself with any change for my old opinions appear rather to be more firmly rooted than they were before i sailed here poor mary heaved a heavy sigh and wiped the tears from her eyes she was pained to a degree she could hardly believe possible though she did full credit to roswells frankness like all devout persons her faith in the efficacy of sacred writ was strong and she so much the more lamented her suitors continued blindness because it remained after light had shone upon it still mary the letter added as i have every human inducement to endeavour to be right i shall not throw aside the book by any means in that i fully believe our difference being in what the volume teaches pray for me sweetest girlbut i know you do and will continue to do as long as i am absent  yes indeed roswell murmured maryas long as you and i live  next to this one great concern of my life comes that which this man daggett gives methe letter went on to say i hardly know what to do under all the circumstances keep in his company much longer i cannot without violating my duty to the deacon yet it is not easy in any sense to get rid of him he has stood by me so manfully on all occasions and seems so much disposed to make goodfellowship of the voyage that did it depend on myself only i should at once make a bargain with him to seal in company and to divide the spoils but this is now impossible and i must quit him in some way or other he outsails me in most weathers and it is a thing easier said than done what will make it more difficult is the growing shortness of the nights the days lengthen fast now and as we go south they will become so much longer that by the time when it will be indispensable to separate it will be nearly all day the thing must be done however and i trust to luck to be able to do it as it ought to be effected  and now dearest dearest mary but why should we lift the veil from the feelings of this young man who concluded his letter by pouring out his whole heart in a few sincere and manly sentences mary wept over them most of that day perusing and reperusing them until her eyes would scarce perform their proper office  a few days later the deacon was made a very happy man by the receipt of a letter from fish  grinnell notifying him of the arrival of his oil accompanied by a most gratifying account of the state of the market and asking for instructions the oil was disposed of and the deacon pocketed his portion of the proceeds as soon as possible eagerly looking for a new and profitable investment for the avails great was the reputation roswell gardiner made by this capture of the two spermaceti whales and by sending the proceeds to so good a market in commerce as in war success is all in all though in both success is nearly as often the result of unforeseen circumstances as of calculations and wisdom it is true there are a sort of trade and a sort of war in which prudence and care may effect a great deal yet are both often outstripped by the random exertions and adventures of those who calculate almost as wildly as they act audacity as the french term it is a great quality in war and often achieves more than the most calculated wisdomnay it becomes wisdom in that sort of struggle and we are far from being sure that audacity is not sometimes as potent in trade at all events it was esteemed a bold as well as a prosperous exploit for a little schooner like the sea lion of oyster pond to take a hundredbarrel whale and to send home its ile as the deacon always pronounced the word in common with most others in old suffolk  long and anxious months with one exception succeeded this bright spot of sunshine in mary pratts solicitude in behalf of the absent roswell she knew there was but little chance of hearing from him again until he returned north the exception was a short letter that the deacon received dated two weeks later than that written from rio in latitude fortyone or just as far south of the equator as oyster pond was north of it and nearly fourteen hundred miles to the southward of rio this letter was written in great haste to send home by a pacific trader who was accidentally met nearer the coast than was usual for such vessels to be it stated that all was well that the schooner of daggett was still in company and that gardiner intended to get shut of her as the deacon expressed it on the very first occasion  after the receipt of this letter the third written by roswell gardiner since he left home a long and blank interval of silence succeeded then it was that months passed away in an anxious and dark uncertainty spring followed winter summer succeeded to spring and autumn came to reap the fruits of all the previous seasons without bringing any further tidings from the adventurers then winter made its second appearance since the sea lion had sailed filling the minds of the mariners friends with sad forebodings as they listened to the meanings of the gales that accompanied that bleak and stormy quarter of the year deep and painful were the anticipations of the deacon in whom failing health and a near approach to the last of earth came to increase the gloom as for mary youth and health sustained her but her very soul was heavy as she pondered on so long and uncertain an absence     chapter xiii          safely in harbour   is the kings ship in the deep nook where once   thou calledst me up at midnight to fetch dew   from the still vexd bermoothes there shes hid    tempest   the letter of roswell gardiner last received bore the date of december 10th 1819 or just a fortnight after he had sailed from rio de janeiro we shall next present the schooner of deacon pratt to the reader on the 18th of that month or three weeks and one day after she had sailed from the capital of brazil early in the morning of the day last mentioned the sea lion of oyster pond was visible standing to the northward with the wind light but freshening from the westward and in smooth water land was not only in sight but was quite near less than a league distant towards this land the head of the schooner had been laid and she was approaching it at the rate of some four or five knots the land was broken high of a most sterile aspect where it was actually to be seen and nearly all covered with a light but melting snow though the season was advanced to the middle of the first month in summer the weather was not very cold however and there was a feeling about it that promised it would become still milder the aspect of the neighbouring land so barren rugged and inhospitable chilled the feelings and gave to the scene a sombre hue which the weather itself might not have imparted directly ahead of the schooner rose a sort of pyramid of broken rocks which occupying a small island stood isolated in a measure and some distance in advance of other and equally ragged ranges of mountains which belonged also to islands detached from the main land thousands of years before under some violent convulsions of nature  it was quite apparent that all on board the schooner regarded that ragged pyramid with lively interest most of the crew was collected on the forecastle including the officers and all eyes were fastened on the ragged pyramid which they were diagonally approaching the principal spokesman was stimson the oldest mariner on board and one who had oftener visited those seas than any other of the crew  you know the spot do you stephen demanded roswell gardiner with interest  yes sir theres no mistake thats the horn eleven times have i doubled it and this is the third time that ive been so close in as to get a fair sight of it once i went inside as ive told you sir  i have doubled it six times myself said gardiner but never saw it before most navigators give it a wide berth tis said to be the stormiest spot on the known earth  thats a mistake you may depend on t sir the sowwesters blow great guns hereabouts it is true enough and when they do sich a sea comes tumbling in on that rock as man never seed anywhere else perhaps but on the whull id rather be close in here than two hundred miles further to the southward with the wind at sowwest and heavy a better slant might be made from the southern position but here i know where i am and id go in and anchor and wait for the gale to blow itself out  talking of seas captain garner observed hazard dont you think sir we begin to feel the swell of the pacific smooth as the surface of the water is here is a groundswell rolling in that must be twelve or fifteen feet in height  theres no doubt of that we have felt the swell of the pacific these two hours no man can mistake that the atlantic has no such waves this is an ocean in reality and this is its stormiest part the wind freshens and hauls and im afraid we are about to be caught close in here with a regular sowwest gale  let it come sir let it come put in stimson again if it does weve only to run in and anchor i can stand pilot and i promise to carry the schooner where twenty sowwesters will do her no harm what ive seen done once i know can be done again the time will come when the horn will be a reglar harbour  roswell left the forecastle and walked aft pondering on what had just been said his situation was delicate and demanded decision as well as prudence the manner in which daggett had stuck by him ever since the two vessels took their departure from block island is known to the reader the sea lions had sailed from rio in company and they had actually made staten land together the day preceding that on which we now bring the oyster pond craft once more upon the scene and had closed so near as to admit of a conversation between the two masters it would seem that daggett was exceedingly averse to passing through the straits of le maire an uncle of his had been wrecked there and had reported the passage as the most dangerous one he had ever encountered it has its difficulties no doubt in certain states of the wind and tide but roswell had received good accounts of the place from stimson who had been through several times the wind was rather scant to go through and the weather threatened to be thick as daggett urged his reasons for keeping off and passing outside of staten land a circuit of considerable extent besides bringing a vessel far to leeward with the prevalent winds of that region which usually blow from northwest round to southwest roswell was reflecting on the opportunity the circumstances afforded of giving his consort the slip after discussing the matter for some time he desired daggett to lead on and he would follow this was done though neither schooner was kept off until roswell got a good view of cape st diego on tierra del fuego thereby enabling him to judge of the positions of the principal landmarks without committing himself by any promise therefore he told daggett to lead on and for some time he followed the course being one that did not take him much out of the way the weather was misty and at times the wind blew in squalls the last increased as the schooners drew nearer to staten land daggett being about half a mile ahead felt the full power of one particular squall that came out of the ravines with greater force than common and he kept away to increase his distance from the land at the same time the mist shut in the vessels from each other it was also past sunset and a dark and dreary night was approaching this latter fact had been one of daggetts arguments for going outside profiting by all these circumstances roswell tacked and stood over towards tierra del fuego he knew from the smoothness of the water that an ebbtide was running and trusted to its force to carry him through the straits he saw no more of the sea lion of the vineyard she continued shut in by the mist until night closed around both vessels when he got about midchannel roswell tacked again by this time the current had sucked him fairly into the passage and no sooner did he go about than his movement to the southward was very rapid the squalls gave some trouble but on the whole he did very well next morning he was off cape horn as described by this expression it is generally understood that a vessel is somewhere near the longitude of that worldrenowned cape but not necessarily in sight of it few navigators actually see the extremity of the american continent though they double the cape it being usually deemed the safest to pass well to the southward such was daggetts position who in consequence of having gone outside of staten land was now necessarily a long distance to leeward and who could not hope to beat up abreast of the hermits even did the wind and sea favour him in less than twentyfour hours a great advantage was obtained by coming through the straits of le maire and roswell felt very certain that he should not see his late consort again that day even did he heaveto for him but our hero had no idea of doing any thing of the sort having shaken off his leech he had no wish to suffer it to fasten to him again it was solely with the intention of making sure of this object that he thought of making a harbour  in order that the reader may better understand those incidents of our narrative which we are about to relate it may be well to say a word of the geographical features of the region to which he has been transported in fiction if not in fact at the southern extremity of the american continent is a cluster of islands which are dark sterile rocky and most of the year covered with snow evergreens relieve the aspect of sterility in places that are a little sheltered and there is a meagre vegetation in spots that serve to sustain animal life the first strait which separates this cluster of islands from the main is that of magellan through which vessels occasionally pass in preference to going farther south then comes tierra del fuego which is much the largest of all the islands to the southward of tierra del fuego lies a cluster of many small islands which bear different names though the group farthest south of all and which it is usual to consider as the southern termination of our noble continent but which is not on a continent at all is known by the appropriate appellation of the hermits if solitude and desolation and want and a contemplation of some of the sublimest features of this earth can render a spot fit for a hermitage these islands are very judiciously named the one that is farthest south contains the cape itself which is marked by the ragged pyramid of rock already mentioned placed there by nature a nevertiring sentinel of the war of the elements behind this cluster of the hermits it was that stimson advised his officer to take refuge against the approaching gale of which the signs were now becoming obvious and certain roswells motive however for listening to such advice was less to find a shelter for his schooner than to get rid of daggett for the gale he cared but little since he was a long way from the ice and could stretch off the land to the southward into a waste of waters that seems interminable there are islands to the southward of cape horn and a good many of them too though none very near it is now known also by means of the toils and courage of various seamen including those of the persevering and laborious wilkes the most industrious and the least rewarded of all the navigators who have ever worked for the human race in this dangerous and exhausting occupation that a continent is there also but at the period of which we are writing the existence of the shetlands and palmers land was the extent of the later discoveries in that part of the ocean after pacing the quarterdeck a few minutes when he quitted the forecastle as mentioned roswell gardiner again went forward among the men  you are quite sure that this high peak is the horn stimson he observed inquiringly  sartain of it sir theres no mistaking sich a place which once seen is never forgotten  it agrees with the charts and our reckoning and i may say it agrees with our eyes also here is the pacific ocean plain enough mr hazard  so i think sir we are at the end of ameriky if it has an end anywhere this heavy long swell is an old acquaintance though i never was in close enough to see the land hereabouts before  it is fortunate we have one trusty hand on board who can stand pilot stimson i intend to go in and anchor and i shall trust to you to carry me into a snug berth  ill do it captain garner if the weather will permit it returned the seaman with an unpretending sort of confidence that spoke well for his ability  preparations were now commenced in earnest to come to it was time that some steady course should be adopted as the wind was getting up and the schooner was rapidly approaching the land in half an hour the sea lion was bending to a little gale with her canvass reduced to closereefed mainsail and foresail and the bonnet off her jib the sea was fast getting up though it came in long and mountainlike roswell dreaded the mist could he pass through the narrow channels that stimson had described to him with a clear sky one half of his causes of anxiety would be removed but the wind was not a clear one and he felt that no time was to be lost  it required great nerve to approach a coast like that of cape horn in such weather as the schooner got nearer to the real cape the sight of the seas tumbling in and breaking on its ragged rock and the hollow roaring sound they made actually became terrific to add to the awe inspired in the breast of even the most callousminded man on board came a doubt whether the schooner could weather a certain point of rock the western extremity of the island after she had got so far into a bight as to render waring questionable if not impossible every one now looked grave and anxious should the schooner go ashore in such a place a single minute would suffice to break her to pieces and riot a soul could expect to be saved roswell was exceedingly anxious though he remained cool  the tides and eddies about these rocks and in so high a latitude sweep a vessel like chips he said to his chief mate we have been set in here by an eddy and a terrible place it is  all depends on our gears holding on sir was the answer with a little on providence just watch the point ahead captain garner though we are not actually to leeward of it see with what a drift we have drawn upon it the manner in which these seas roll in from the sowwest is terrific no craft can go to windward against them  this remark of hazards was very just the seas that came down upon the cape resembled a rolling prairie in their outline a single wave would extend a quarter of a mile from trough to trough and as it passed beneath the schooner lifting her high in the air it really seemed as if the glancing water would sweep her away in its force but human art had found the means to counteract even this imposing display of the power of nature the little schooner rode over the billows like a duck and when she sank between two of them it was merely to rise again on a new summit and breast the gale gallantly it was the current that menaced the greatest danger for that unseen except in its fruits was clearly setting the little craft to leeward and bodily towards the rocks by this time our adventurers were so near the land that they almost gave up hope itself cape hatteras and its muchtalkedof dangers seemed a place of refuge compared to that in which our navigators now found themselves could the deepest bellowings of ten thousand bulls be united in a common roar the noise would not have equalled that of the hollow sound which issued from a sea as it went into some cavern of the rocks then the spray filled the air like driving rain and there were minutes when the cape though so frightfully near was hid from view by the vapour  at this precise moment the sea lion was less than a quarter of a mile to windward of the point she was struggling to weather and towards which she was driving under a treble impetus that of the wind acting on her sails and pressing her ahead at the rate of fully five knots for the craft was kept a rap full that of the eddy or current and that of the rolling waters no man spoke for each person felt that the crisis was one in which silence was a sort of homage to the deity some prayed privately and all gazed on the low rocky point that it was indispensable to pass to avoid destruction there was one favourable circumstance the water was known to be deep quite close to the ironbound coast and it was seldom that any danger existed that it was not visible to the eye this roswell knew from stimsons accounts as well as from those of other mariners and he saw that the fact was of the last importance to him should he be able to weather the point ahead that which terminated at the mouth of the passage that led within the hermits it was now certain it could be done only by going fearfully near the rocks  roswell gardiner took his station between the knightheads beckoning to stimson to come near him at the same time hazard himself went to the helm  do you remember this place asked the young master of the old seaman  this is the spot sir and if we can round the rocky point ahead i will take you to a safe anchorage our drift is awful or we are in an eddy tide here sir  it is the eddy answered roswell calmly though our drift is not trifling this is getting frightfully near to that point  hold on sirits our only chancehold on and we may rub and go  if we rub we are lost that is certain enough should we get by this first point there is another a short distance beyond it which must certainly fetch us up i fear seeit opens more as we draw ahead  stimson saw the new danger and fully appreciated it he did not speak however for to own the truth he now abandoned all hope and being a piously inclined person he was privately addressing himself to god every man on board was fully aware of the character of this new danger and all seemed to forget that of the nearest point of rock towards which they were now wading with portentous speed that point might be passed there was a little hope there but as to the point a quarter of a mile beyond with the leeward set of the schooner the most ignorant hand on board saw how unlikely it was that they should get by it  an imposing silence prevailed in the schooner as she came abreast of the first rock it was about fifty fathoms under the lee bow and as to that spot all depended on the distance outward that the dangers thrust themselves this it was impossible to see amid the chaos of waters produced by the collision between the waves and the land roswell fastened his eyes on objects ahead to note the rate of his leeward set and with a seamans quickness he noted the first change  she feels the undertow stephen he said in a voice so compressed as to seem to come out of the depths of his chest and is breasted up to windward  what means that sudden luff sir mr hazard must keep a good full or we shall have no chance  gardiner looked aft and saw that the mate was bearing the helm well up as if he met with much resistance the truth then flashed upon him and he shouted outalls well boys god be praised we have caught the ebbtide under our leebow  these few words explained the reason of the change instead of setting to leeward the schooner was now meeting a powerful tide of some four or five knots which hawsed her up to windward with irresistible force as if conscious of the danger she was in the tight little craft receded from the rocks as she shot ahead and rounded that second point which a minute before had appeared to be placed there purposely to destroy her it was handsomely doubled at the safe distance of a hundred fathoms roswell believed he might now beat his schooner off the land far enough to double the cape altogether could he but keep her in that current it doubtless expended itself however a short distance in the offing as its waters diffused themselves on the breast of the ocean and it was this diffusion of the element that produced the eddy which had proved so nearly fatal  in ten minutes after striking the tide the schooner opened the passage fairly and was kept away to enter it notwithstanding it blew so heavily the rate of sailing by the land did not exceed five knots this was owing to the great strength of the tide which sometimes rises and falls thirty feet in high latitudes and narrow waters stimson now showed he was a man to be relied on conning the craft intelligently he took her in behind the island on which the cape stands luffed her up into a tiny cove and made a cast of the lead there were fifty fathoms of water with a bottom of mud with the certainty that there was enough of the element to keep him clear of the ground at low water and that his anchors would hold roswell made a flying moor and veered out enough cable to render his vessel secure  here then was the sea lion of oyster pond that craft which the reader had seen lying at deacon pratts wharf only three short months before safely anchored in a nook of the rocks behind cape horn no navigator but a sealer would have dreamed of carrying his vessel into such a place but it is a part of their calling to poke about in channels and passages where no one else has ever been it was in this way that stimson had learned to know where to find his present anchorage the berth of the schooner was perfectly snug and entirely landlocked the tremendous swell that was rolling in on the outside caused the waters to rise and fall a little within the passage but there was no strain upon the cables in consequence neither did the rapid tides affect the craft which lay in an eddy that merely kept her steady the gale came howling over the hermits but was so much broken by the rocks as to do little more than whistle through the cordage and spars aloft  three days and as many nights did the gale from the southwest continue the fourth day there was a change the wind coming from the eastward roswell would now have gone out had it not been for the apprehension of falling in with daggett again having at length gotten rid of that pertinacious companion it would have been an act of great weakness to throw himself blindly in his way once more it was possible that daggett might not suppose he had been left intentionally in which case he would be very apt to look for his lost consort in the vicinity of the cape as for the gale it might or it might not have blown him to leeward a good deal would depend on the currents and his distance to the southward near the land gardiner believed the currents favoured a vessel doubling it going west and if daggett was also aware of this fact it might induce him to keep as near the spot as possible  time was very precious to our sealers the season being so short in the high latitudes still they were a little in advance of their calculations having got off the horn fully ten days sooner than they had hoped to be there nearly the whole summer was before them and there was the possibility of their even being too soon for the loosening of the ice further south the wind was the strongest inducement to go out for the point to which our adventurers were bound lay a considerable distance to the westward and fair breezes were not to be neglected under all the circumstances however it was decided to remain within the passage one day longer and this so much the more because hazard had discovered some signs of seaelephants frequenting an island at no great distance the boats were lowered accordingly and the mate went in one direction while the master pulled up to the rocks and landed on the hermit or the island which should bear that name par excellence being that in which the group terminates  taking stimson with him to carry a glass and armed with an old lance as a pikepole to aid his efforts roswell gardiner now commenced the ascent of the pyramid already mentioned it was ragged and offered a thousand obstacles but none that vigour and resolution could not overcome after a few minutes of violent exertion and by helping each other in difficult places both roswell and stimson succeeded in placing themselves on the summit of the elevation which was an irregular peak the height was considerable and gave an extended view of the adjacent islands as well as of the gloomy and menacing ocean to the southward the earth probably does not contain a more remarkable sentinel than this pyramid on which our hero had now taken his station there it stood actually the ultima thule of this vast continent or what was much the same so closely united to it as to seem a part of our own moiety of the globe looking out on the broad expanse of waters the eye saw to the right the pacific in front was the southern or antarctic ocean and to the left was the great atlantic for several minutes both roswell and stephen sat mute gazing on this grand spectacle by turning their faces north they beheld the high lands of terra del fuego of which many of the highest peaks were covered with snow the pyramid on which they were however was no longer white with the congealed rain but stood stern and imposing in its native brown the outlines of all the rocks and the shores of the different islands had an appearance of volcanic origin though the rocks themselves told a somewhat different story the last was principally of trap formation cape pigeons gulls petrels and albatross were wheeling about in the air while the rollers that still came in on this noble seawall were really terrific distant thunder wants the hollow bellowing sound that these waves made when brought in contact with the shores roswell fancied that it was like a groan of the mighty pacific at finding its progress suddenly checked the spray continued to fly and much of the time the air below his elevated seat was filled with vapour  as soon as our young master had taken in the grander features of this magnificent view his eyes sought the sea lion of marthas vineyard there she was sure enough at a distance of only a couple of leagues and apparently standing directly for the cape could it be possible that daggett suspected his manoeuvre and was coming in search of him at the precise spot in which he had taken shelter as respects the vessel there was no question as to her character from the elevation at which he was placed roswell aided by the glass had no difficulty in making her out and in recognising her rig form and character stimson also examined her and knew her to be the schooner on that vast and desolate sea she resembled a speck but the art of man had enabled those she held to guide her safely through the tempest and bring her up to her goal in a time that really seemed miraculous for the circumstances  if we had thought of it captain garner said stephen we might have brought up an ensign and set it on these rocks by way of letting the vineyarders know where we are to be found but we can always go out and meet them should this wind stand  which is just what i have no intention of doing stephen i came in here on purpose to get rid of that schooner  you surprise me sir a consort is no bad thing when a craft is asealin in a high latitude the ice makes such ticklish times that for me im always glad to know there is such a chance for taking a fellow off should there happen to be a wreck  all that is very true but there are reasons which may tell against it i have heard of some islands where seals abound and a consort is not quite so necessary to take them as when one is wrecked  that alters the case captain garner nobody is obliged to tell of his sealing station i was aboard one of the very first craft that found out that the south shetlands was a famous place for seals and no one among us thought it necessary to tell it to all the world some men are weak enough to put sich discoveries in the newspapers but for my part i think it quite enough to put them in the log  that schooner must have the current with her she comes down so fast she ii be abreast of the horn in half an hour longer stephen we will wait and see what she would be at  gardiners prediction was true in half an hour the sea lion of holmes hole glided past the rocky pyramid of the horn distant from it less than a mile had it been the object of her commander to pass into the pacific he might have done so with great apparent ease even with a southwest wind that which blows fully half the time in those seas it would have been in his power to lay past the islands and soon get before it a northeast course with a little offing will clear the islands and when a vessel gets as far north as the main land it would take her off the coast  but daggett had no intention of doing anything of the sort he was looking for his consort which he had hoped to find somewhere near the cape disappointed in this expectation after standing far enough west to make certain nothing was in sight in that quarter he hauled up on an easy bowline and stood to the southward roswell was right glad to see this inasmuch as it denoted ignorance of the position of the islands he sought they lay much farther to the westward and no sooner was he sure of the course steered by the other schooner than he hastened down to the boat in order to get his own vessel under way to profit by the breeze  two hours later the sea lion of oyster pond glanced through the passage which led into the ocean on an ebbtide by that time the other vessel had disappeared in the southern board and gardiner came out upon the open waters again boldly and certain of his course all sail was set and the little craft slipped away from the land with the ease of an aquatic bird that is plying its webfeet studdingsails were set and the pyramid of the horn soon began to lower in the distance as the schooner receded when night closed over the rolling waters it was no longer visible the vessel having fairly entered the antarctic ocean if anything north of the circle can properly so be termed     chapter xiv      all gone tis ours the goodly land     look roundthe heritage behold   go forthupon the mountain stand     then if you can be cold    sprague   it was an enterprising and manly thing for a little vessel like the sea lion to steer with an undeviating course into the mysterious depths of the antarctic circlemysterious far more in that day than at the present hour but the american sealer rarely hesitates he has very little science few charts and those oftener old than new knows little of what is going on among the savans of the earth though his ear is ever open to the lore of men like himself and he has his mind stored with pictures of islands and continents that would seem to have been formed for no other purpose than to meet the wants of the race of animals it is his business to pursue and to capture cape horn and its vicinity have so long been frequented by this class of men that they are at home among their islands rocks currents and sterility but to the southward of the horn itself all seemed a waste at the time of which we are writing much less was known of the antarctic regions than is known today and even now our knowledge is limited to a few dreary outlines in which barrenness and ice compete for the mastery wilkes and his competitors have told us that a vast frozen continent exists in that quarter of the globe but even their daring and perseverance have not been able to determine more than the general fact  we should be giving an exaggerated and false idea of roswell gardiners character did we say that he steered into that great void of the southern ocean in a total indifference to his destination and objects very much the reverse was his state of mind as he saw the high land of the cape sink as it might be foot by foot into the ocean and then lost sight of it altogether although the weather was fine for the region it was dark and menacing such indeed is usually the case in that portion of this globe which appears to be the favourite region of the storms although the wind was no more than a good breeze and the ocean was but little disturbed there were those symptoms in the atmosphere and in the long groundswells that came rolling in from the southwest that taught the mariner the cold lessons of caution we believe that heavier gales of wind at sea are encountered in the warm than in the cold months but there is something so genial in the air of the ocean during summer and something so chilling and repulsive in the rival season that most of us fancy that the currents of air correspond in strength with the fall of the mercury roswell knew better than this it is true but he also fully understood where he was and what he was about as a sealer he had several times penetrated as far south as the ne plus ultra of cook but it had ever before been in subordinate situations this was the first time in which he had the responsibility of command thrown on himself and it was no more than natural that he should feel the weight of this new burthen so long as the sea lion of the vineyard was in sight she had presented a centre of interest and concern to get rid of her had been his first care and almost absorbing object but now that she seemed to be finally thrown out of his wake there remained the momentous and closely approaching difficulties of the main adventure directly before his eyes roswell therefore was thoughtful and grave his countenance offering no bad reflection of the sober features of the atmosphere and the ocean  although the season was that of summer and the weather was such as is deemed propitious in the neighbourhood of cape horn a feeling of uncertainty prevailed over every other sensation to the southward a cold mistiness veiled the view and every mile the schooner advanced appeared like penetrating deeper and deeper into regions that nature had hitherto withheld from the investigation of the mariner ice and its dangers were known to exist a few degrees farther in that direction but islands also had been discovered and turned to good account by the enterprise of the sealers  it was truly a great thing for the sea lion of oyster pond to have thrown off her namesake of the vineyard it is true both vessels were still in the same sea with a possibility of again meeting but roswell gardiner was steering onward towards a haven designated in degrees and minutes while the other craft was most probably left to wander in uncertainty in that remote and stormy ocean our hero thought there was now very little likelihood of his again falling in with his late consort and this so much the more because the islands he sought were not laid down in the vicinity of any other known land and were consequently out of the usual track of the sealers this last circumstance was fully appreciated by our young navigator and gave him confidence of possessing its treasures to himself could he only find the place where nature had hid them  when the sun went down in that vast waste of water which lies to the southward of this continent the little sea lion had fairly lost sight of land and was riding over the long southwestern groundswell like a gull that holds its way steadily towards its nest for many hours her course had not varied half a point being as near as possible to southsouthwest which kept her a little off the wind no sooner however did night come to shut in the view than roswell gardiner went aft to the man at the helm and ordered him to steer to the southward as near as the breeze would conveniently allow this was a material change in the direction of the vessel and should the present breeze stand would probably place her by the return of light a good distance to the eastward of the point she would otherwise have reached hitherto it had been roswells aim to drop his consort but now it was dark and so much time had already passed and been improved since the other schooner was last seen he believed he might venture to steer in the precise direction he desired to go the season is so short in those seas that every hour is precious and no more variation from a real object could be permitted than circumstances imperiously required it was now generally understood that the craft was making the best of her way towards her destined sealingground  independently of the discoveries of the regular explorers a great deal of information has been obtained from the sealers themselves within the present century touching the antarctic seas it is thought that many a headland and various islands that have contributed their shares in procuring the accolades for different european navigators were known to the adventurers from stonington and other byports of this country long before science ever laid its eyes upon them or monarchs their swords on the shoulders of their secondary discoverers  that divers islands existed in this quarter of the ocean was a fact recognised in geography long before the sea lion was thought of probably before her young master was actually born but the knowledge generally possessed on the subject was meagre and unsatisfactory in particular cases nevertheless this remark would not apply there being at that moment on board our little schooner several mariners who had often visited the south shetlands new georgia palmers land and other known places in those seas not one of them all however had ever heard of any island directly south of the present position of the schooner  no material change occurred during the night or in the course of the succeeding day the little sea lion industriously holding her way toward the south pole making very regularly her six knots each hour by the time she was thirtysix hours from the horn gardiner believed himself to be fully three degrees to the southward of it and consequently some distance within the parallel of sixty degrees south palmers land with its neighbouring islands would have been near had not the original course carried the schooner so far to the westward as it was no one could say what lay before them  the third day out the wind hauled and it blew heavily from the northeast this gave the adventurers a great run the blink of ice was shortly seen and soon after ice itself drifting about in bergs the floating hills were grand objects to the eye rolling and wallowing in the seas but they were much worn and melted by the wash of the ocean and comparatively of greatly diminished size it was now absolutely necessary to lose most of the hours of darkness it being much too dangerous to run in the night the great barrier of ice was known to be close at hand and cooks ne plus ultra at that time the great boundary of antarctic navigation was near the parallel of latitude to which the schooner had reached the weather however continued very favourable and after the blow from the northeast the wind came from the south chill and attended with flurries of snow but sufficiently steady and not so fresh as to compel our adventurers to carry very short sail the smoothness of the water would of itself have announced the vicinity of ice not only did gardiners calculations tell him as much as this but his eyes confirmed their results in the course of the fifth day out on several occasions when the weather cleared a little glimpses were had of the ice in long mountainous walls resembling many of the ridges of the alps though moving heavily under the heaving and setting of the restless waters dense fogs from time to time clouded the whole view and the schooner was compelled more than once that day to heaveto in order to avoid running on the sunken masses of ice or fields of which many of vast size now began to make their appearance  notwithstanding the dangers that surrounded our adventurers they were none of them so insensible to the sublime powers of nature as to withhold their admiration from the many glorious objects which that lone and wild scene presented the icebergs were of all the hues of the rainbow as the sunlight gilded their summits or sides or they were left shaded by the interposition of dark and murky clouds there were instances when certain of the huge frozen masses even appeared to be quite black in particular positions and under peculiar lights while others at the same instant were gorgeous in their gleams of emerald and gold  the aquatic birds also had now become numerous again penguins were swimming about filling the air with their discordant cries while there was literally no end of the capepigeons and petrels albatrosses too helped to make up the picture of animated nature while whales were often heard blowing in the adjacent waters gardiner saw many signs of the proximity of land and began to hope he should yet actually discover the islands laid down on his chart as their position had been given by daggett  in that high latitude a degree of longitude is necessarily much shorter than when nearer to the middle of our orb on the equator a degree of longitude measures as is known to most boardingschool young ladies just sixty geographical or sixtynine and a half english statute miles but as is not known to most boardingschool young ladies or is understood by very few of them indeed even when known in the sixtysecond degree of latitude a degree of longitude measures but little more than thirtytwo of those very miles the solution of this seeming contradiction is so very simple that it may assist a certain class of our readers if we explain it by telling them that it arises solely from the fact that these degrees of longitude which are placed sixty geographical miles asunder at the centre or middle of the earth converge towards the poles where they all meet in a point according to the best observations roswell gardiner could obtain he was just one of these short degrees of longitude or twoandthirty miles to the westward of the parallel where he wished to be when the wind came from the southward the change was favourable as it emboldened him to run nearer than he otherwise might have felt disposed to do to the great barrier of ice which now formed a sort of weathershore fortunately the loose bergs and sunken masses had drifted off so far to the northward that once within them the schooner had pretty plain sailing and roswell to lose none of the precious time of the season ventured to run though under very short canvass the whole of the short night that succeeded it is a great assistance to the navigation of those seas that during the summer months there is scarcely any night at all giving the adventurer sufficient light by which to thread his way among the difficulties of his pathless journey  when the sun reappeared on the morning of the sixth day after he had left the horn roswell gardiner believed himself to be far enough west for his purposes it now remained to get a whole degree further to the south which was a vast distance in those seas and in that direction and would carry him a long way to the southward of the ne plus ultra if there was any truth in daggett however that mariner had been there and the instructions of the owner rendered it incumbent on our young man to attempt to follow him more than once that morning did our hero regret he had not entered into terms with the vineyard men that the effort might have been made in company there was something so portentous in a lone vessels venturing within the ice in so remote a region that to say the truth roswell hesitated but pride of profession ambition love of mary dread of the deacon native resolution and the hardihood produced by experience in dangers often encountered and escaped nerved him to the undertaking it must be attempted or the voyage would be lost and our young mariner now set about his task with a stern determination to achieve it  by this time the schooner had luffed up within a cables length of the ice along the margin of which she was running under easy sail gardiner believed himself to be quite as far to the westward as was necessary and his present object was to find an opening by means of which he could enter among the floating chaos that was spread far and wide to windward as the breeze was driving the drifting masses to the northward they became loosened and more separated every moment and glad enough was gardiner to discover at length a clear spot that seemed to favour his views without an instants delay the sheets were flattened in a pull was taken on the braces and away went the little sea lion into a passage that had a hundredfold more real causes of terror than the scylla and charybdis of old  one effect of the vicinity of ice in extensive fields is to produce comparatively still water it must blow a gale and that over a considerable extent of open sea to produce much commotion among the fields and bergs though that heaving and setting which has been likened to the respiration of some monster and which seamen call the groundswell is never entirely wanting among the waters of an ocean on the present occasion our adventurers were favoured in this respect their craft gliding forward unimpeded by anything like opposing billows at the end of four hours the schooner tacking and waring when necessary had worked her way to the southward and westward according to her masters reckoning some fiveandtwenty miles it was then noon and the atmosphere being unusually clear though never without fog gardiner went aloft to take a look for himself at the condition of things around him  to the northward and along the very passage by which the vessel had sailed the ice was closing and it was far easier to go on than to return to the eastward and towards the southeast in particular however did roswell gardiner turn his longing eyes somewhere in that quarter of the ocean and distant now less than ten leagues did he expect to find the islands of which he was in quest if indeed they had any existence at all in that direction there were many passages open among the ice the latter being generally higher than in the particular place to which the vessel had reached once or twice roswell mistook the summits of some of these bergs for real mountains when owing to the manner in which the light fell upon them or rather did not fall upon them directly they appeared dark and earthy each time however the suns rays soon came to undeceive him and that which had so lately been black and frowning was as by the touch of magic suddenly illuminated and became bright and gorgeous throwing out its emerald hues or perhaps a virgin white that filled the beholder with delight even amid the terrors and dangers by which in very truth he was surrounded the glorious alps themselves those wonders of the earth could scarcely compete in scenery with the views that nature lavished in that remote sea on a seeming void but the might and honour of god were there as well as beneath the equator  for one whole hour did roswell gardiner remain in the crosstrees having hailed the deck and caused the schooners head to be turned to the southeast pressing her through the openings as near the wind as she could go the atmosphere was never without fog though the vapour drifted about leaving large vacancies that were totally clear one spot in particular seemed to be a favourite restingplace for these low clouds which just there appeared to light upon the face of the ocean itself a wide field of ice or it were better to say a broad belt of bergs lay between this stationary cloud and the schooner though the existence of the vapour early caught roswells attention and during the hour he was aloft conning the craft through a very intricate and ticklish channel not a minute passed that the young man did not turn a look towards that veiled spot he was in the act of placing a foot on the ratlin below him to descend to the deck when he halfunconsciously turned to take a last glance at this distant and seemingly immovable object just then the vapour which had kept rolling and moving like a fluid in ebullition while it still clung together suddenly opened and the bald head of a real mountain a thousand feet high came unexpectedly into the view there could be no mistake all was too plain to admit of a doubt there beyond all question was land and it was doubtless the most western of the islands described by the dying seaman everything corroborated this conclusion the latitude and longitude were right or nearly so and the other circumstances went to confirm the conjecture or conclusion daggett had said that one island high mountainous ragged and bleak but of some size lay the most westerly in the group while several others were within a few miles of it the last were lower much smaller and little more than naked rocks one of these last however he insisted on it was a volcano in activity and that at intervals it emitted flames as well as a fierce heat by his account however the party to which he belonged had never actually visited that volcanic cauldron being satisfied with admiring its terrors from a distance  as to the existence of the land roswell got several pretty distinct and certain views leaving no doubt of its character and position there is a theory which tells us that the orb of day is surrounded by a luminous vapour the source of heat and light and that this vapour being in constant motion occasionally leaves the mass of the planet itself to be seen forming what it is usual to term the spots on the sun resembling this theory the fogs of the antarctic seas rolled about the mountain now seen withdrawing the curtain at times and permitting a view of the striking and majestic object within well did that lone and nearly barren mass of earth and rock merit these appellations the elevation has already been given and a rock that is nearly perpendicular rising out of the ocean for a thousand feet is ever imposing and grand this was rendered so much the more so by its loneliness its stable and stern position amid floating and moving mountains of ice its brown sides and bald summit the latter then recently whitened with a fall of pure snow and its frowning and fixed aspect amid a scene that might otherwise be said to be ever in motion  roswell gardiners heart beat with delight when assured of success in discovering this the first great goal of his destination to reach it was now his allabsorbing desire by this time the wind had got round to the southwest and was blowing quite fresh bringing him well to windward of the mountain but causing the icebergs to drift in towards the land and placing an impassable barrier along its western shore our young man however remembered that daggett had given the anchorage as on the northeastern side of the island where according to his statements a little haven would be found in which a dozen craft might lie in security to this quarter of the island gardiner consequently endeavoured to get  there was no opening to the northward but a pretty good channel was before the schooner to the southward of the group in this direction then the sea lion was steered and by eight bells four in the afternoon the southern point of the largest island was doubled the rest of the group were made and to the infinite delight of all on board her abundance of clear water was found between the main island and its smaller neighbours the bergs had grounded apparently as they drew near the group leaving this large bay entirely free from ice with the exception of a few small masses that were floating through it these bodies whether field or berg were easily avoided and away the schooner went with flowing sheets into the large basin formed by the different members of the group to render assurance doubly sure as to the information of daggett the smoke of a volcano arose from a rock to the eastward that appeared to be some three or four miles in circumference and which stood on the eastern side of the great basin or some four leagues from sealers land as daggett had at once named the principal island this was in fact about the breadth of the main basin which had two principal passages into it the one from the south and the other from the northeast  once within the islands and reasonably clear of all ice it was an easy thing for the schooner to run across the basin or great bay and reach the northeastern extremity of sealers land as the light would continue some hours longer there being very little night in that high latitude in december the month that corresponds to our june roswell caused a boat to be lowered and manned when he pulled at once towards the spot where it struck him the haven must be found if there were any such place at all everything turned out as it had been described by daggett and great was our young mans satisfaction when he rowed into a cove that was little more than two hundred yards in diameter and which was so completely landlocked as not to feel the influence of any sea outside in general the great difficulty is to land on any of the antarctic rocks the breakers and surf opposing it but in this spot the smallest boat could be laid with its bows on a beach of shingles without the slightest risk of its being injured the lead also announced good anchorage in about eight fathoms of water in a word this little haven was one of those small basins that so often occur in mountainous islands where fragments of rock appear to have fallen from the principal mass as it was forced upward out of the ocean as if purposely intended to meet the wants of mariners  nor was the outer bay or the large basin formed by the entire group by any means devoid of advantages to the navigator from north to south this outer bay was at least six leagues in length while its breadth could not much have fallen short of four of course it was much more exposed to the winds and waves than the little harbour proper though roswell was struck with the great advantages it offered in several essential particulars it was almost clear of ice while so much was floating about outside of the circle of islands thus leaving a free navigation in it for even the smallest boat this was mainly owing to the fact that the largest island had two long crescentshaped capes the one at its northeastern and the other at its southeastern extremity giving to its whole eastern side the shape of a new moon the harbour just described was to the southward of or within the northeastern cape which our young master at once named cape hazard in honour of his chief mates vigilance that officer having been the first to point out the facilities probably offered by the formation of the land for an anchorage  though rocky and broken it was by no means difficult to ascend the rugged banks on the northern side of the harbour and gardiner went up it attended by stimson who of late had much attached himself to the person of his commander the height of this barrier above the waves of the ocean was but a little less than a hundred feet and when the summit was reached a common exclamation of surprise not to say delight broke from the lips of both hitherto not a seal of any sort had been seen and gardiner had felt some misgivings touching the benefits that were to be derived from so much hardship exposure and enterprise all doubts however vanished the instant he got a sight of the northern shore of the island this shore a reach of several miles in extent was fairly alive with the monsters of which he was in search they lay in thousands on the low rocks that lined that entire side of the island basking in the sun of the antarctic seas there they were sure enough sea lions sea elephants huge clumsy fiercelooking and revolting creatures belonging properly to neither sea nor land these animals were constantly going and coming in crowds some waddling to the margin of the rocks and tumbling into the ocean in search of food while others scrambled out of the water and got upon shelves and other convenient places to repose and enjoy the light of day there was very little contention or fighting among these revoltinglooking creatures though nearly every known species of the larger seals was among them  there is famous picking for us master stephen said roswell to his companion fairly rubbing his hands in delight one months smart work will fill the schooner and we can be off before the equinox does it not seem to you that yonder are the bones of sea lions or of seals of some sort lying hereaway as if men had been at work on the creatures  no doubt ont at all captain garner as much out of the way as this island isand i never heard of the place afore old a sealer as i ambut as much out of the way as it is we are not the first to find it somebody has been here and that within a year or two and he has picked up a cargo too depend ont  as all this merely corresponded with daggetts account of the place roswell felt no surprise on the contrary he saw in it a confirmation of all that daggett had stated and as furnishing so much the more reason to hope for a successful termination to the voyage in all its parts while on the rocks roswell took such a survey of the localities as might enable him to issue his orders hereafter with discretion and intelligence the schooner was already making short tacks to get close in with the island in obedience to a signal to that effect and the second mate had pulled out to the entrance of the little haven with a view to act as pilot before the captain had descended from the summit of the northern barrier the vessel came in under her jib the wind being nearly aft and she dropped two anchors in suitable spots making another flying moor of it  general joy now illuminated every face it was in itself a great point gained to get the schooner into a perfectly safe haven where her people could take their natural rest at night or during their watches below without feeling any apprehension of being crushed in the ice but here was not only security but the source of that wealth of which they were in quest and which had induced them all to encounter so many privations and so much danger the crew landed to a man each individual ascending to the summit of the barrier to feast his eyes on the spectacle that lay spread in such affluent abundance along the low rocks of the northern side of the island  as there were yet several hours of light remaining roswell still attended by stimson each armed with a sealing spear or lance not only as a weapon of defence but as a leapingstaff set out to climb as high up the central acclivity of the island as circumstances would allow him to go he was deceived in the distances however and soon found that an entire day would be necessary to achieve such an enterprise could it be performed at all but he did succeed in reaching a low spur of the central mountain that commanded a wide and noble view of all that lay to the north and east of it from this height which must have been a few hundred feet above the level of the ocean our adventurers got a still better view of the whole north coast or of what might have been called the sealing quarter of the island they also got a tolerably accurate idea of the general formation of that lone fragment of rock and earth as well as of the islets and islands that lay in its vicinity the outline of the first was that of a rude and of course an irregular triangle the three principal points of which were the two low capes already mentioned and a third that lay to the northward and westward the whole of the western or southwestern shore seemed to be a nearly perpendicular wall of rock that in the main rose some two or three hundred feet above the ocean against this side of the island in particular the waves of the ocean were sullenly beating while the ice drove up home as sailors express it showing a vast depth of water on the two other sides it was different the winds prevailed most from the southwest which rendered the perpendicular face of the island its weatherwall while the two other sides of the triangle were more favoured by position the north side of course lay most exposed to the sun everything of this nature being reversed in the southern hemisphere from what we have it in the northern while the eastern or northeastern side to be precisely accurate was protected by the group of islands that lay in its front such was the general character of sealers land so far as the hurried observations of its present master enabled him to ascertain the near approach of night induced him now to hasten to get off of the somewhat dangerous acclivities to which he had climbed and to rejoin his people and his schooner     chapter xv      ye dart upon the deep and straight is heard   a wilder roar and men grow pale and pray   ye fling its waters round you as a bird   flings oer his shivering plumes the fountains spray   see to the breaking mast the sailor clings   ye scoop the ocean to its briny springs   and take the mountain billows on your wings   and pile the wreck of navies round the bay    bryants winds   no unnecessary delay was permitted to interfere with the one great purpose of the sealers the season was so short and the difficulties and dangers of entering among and of quitting the ice were so very serious that every soul belonging to the schooner felt the importance of activity and industry the very day that succeeded the vessels arrival not only was great progress made in the preliminary arrangements but a goodly number of furseals of excellent quality were actually killed and secured two noble seaelephants were also lanced animals that measured near thirty feet in length each of which yielded a very ample return for the risk and trouble of taking it in oil the skins of the furseals however were roswells principal object and glad enough was he to find the creature that pays this tribute to the wants and luxuries of man in numbers sufficient to promise him a speedy return to the northward while the slaughter and skinning and curing and trying out were all in active operation our young man paid some attention to certain minor arrangements which had a direct bearing on the comforts of his people as well as the getting in of cargo  an old storehouse of respectable size had stood on the deacons wharf while the schooner was fitting out but it had been taken to pieces in order to make room for a more eligible substitute the materials of this building roswell gardiner had persuaded his owner to send on board and they had all been received and stowed away a part below and a part on deck as a provision for the possible wants of the people as it was necessary to clear the decks and break out the hold all these materials consisting principally of the timbers of the frame the siding and a quantity of planks and boards were now floated ashore in the cove and hauled upon the rocks roswell took a leisure moment to select a place for the site of his building which he intended to erect at once in order to save the time that would otherwise be lost in pulling between the schooner and the shore  it was not difficult to find the sort of spot that was desirable for the dwelling that chosen by gardiner was a shelf of rock of sufficient extent that lay perfectly exposed to the north and northeast or to the sunny side of the island while it was sheltered from the south and southwest by masses of rock that formed a complete protection against the colder winds of the region these walls of stone however were not sufficiently near to permit any snows they might collect to impend over the building but enough space was left between them and the house to admit of a capacious yard in which might be placed any articles that were necessary to the ordinary work or to the wants of the sealers  had it been advisable to set all hands at the business of slaughtering roswell gardiner certainly would not have lost the time he did in the erection of his house but our master was a judicious and wary commander at his calling the seals were now perfectly tame and nothing was easier than to kill them in scores the great difficulty was in removing the spoils across the rocks as it was sometimes necessary to do so for a distance of several miles means were found in the end to use the boats on this service though even then at midsummer the northern shore of the island was frequently so closely beset by the ice as completely to block up the passage this too occurred at times when the larger bay was nearly free and the cove which went by the name of the deacons bight among the men was entirely so in order to prevent a premature panic among the victims of this intended foray then gardiner allowed no one to go out to kill but the experienced hands and no more to be slain each day than could be skinned or cut up at that particular time in consequence of this prudent caution the work soon got into a regular train and it was early found that more was done in this mode than could have been effected by a less guarded assault on the seals  as for the materials of the building they were hauled up the rocks without much difficulty the frame was of some size as is the case generally with most old constructions in america but being of pine thoroughly seasoned the sills and plates were not so heavy but that they might be readily enough handled by the nonsealing portion of the crew robert smith the landsman was a carpenter by trade and it fell to his lot to put together again the materials of the old warehouse had there not been such a mechanic among the crew however a dozen americans could at any time construct a house the rough and ready habits of the people usually teaching them in a rude way a good deal of a great many other arts besides this of the carpenter mott had served a part of his time with a blacksmith and he now set up his forge when the frame was ready all hands assembled to assist in raising it and by the end of the first week the building was actually enclosed the labour amounting to no more than putting each portion in its place and securing it there the saw being scarcely used during the whole process this building had two apartments one of which gardiner appropriated to the uses of a sittingroom and the other to that of a dormitory rough bunks were constructed and the mattresses of the men were all brought ashore and put in the house it was intended that everybody should sleep in the building as it would save a great deal of going to and fro as well as a great deal of time the cargo was to be collected on a shelf of rock that lay about twenty feet below that on which the building stood by following which it was possible to turn the highest point of the pass that which formed the southern protection of the building and come out on the side of the cove at another shelf that was not more than fifty feet above the level of the vessels decks down this last declivity roswell proposed to lower his casks by means of a projecting derrick the rock being sufficiently precipitous to admit of this arrangement while his spare spars furnished him with the necessary means thus was every preparation made with judgment and foresight  in this manner did the first ten days pass every man and boy being as busy as bees to own the truth no attention was paid to the sabbath which would seem to have been left behind them by the people among the descendants of those puritans who were so rigid in their observance of that festival at the end of the time just mentioned a great deal had been done the house such as it was was completed to be sure it was nothing but an old storehouse revamped but it was found to be of infinite service and greatly did all hands felicitate themselves at having brought its materials along with them even those who had most complained of the labour of getting the timbers on board had the most often cursed them for being in the way during the passage and had continued the loudest to deride the idea of sealers turning carpenters were shortly willing to allow that the possession of this dwelling was of the greatest value to them and that so far from the extra works causing them to fall behind in their main operations the comfort they found in having a home like this to go to after a long days toil refreshed them to a degree which enabled every man to return to his labour with a zeal and an energy that might otherwise have been wanting although it was in the warmest season of the year and the nights could scarcely be called nights at all yet the sun never got very low without leaving a chilliness in the air that would have rendered sleeping without a cover and a protection from the winds not only excessively uncomfortable but somewhat dangerous indeed it was often found necessary to light a fire in the old warehouse this was done by means of a capacious boxstove that was almost as old as the building itself and which had also been brought along as an article of great necessity in that climate fuel could not be wanting as long as the scraps from the tryworks abounded and there were many more of these than were needed to try out the seaelephant oil the schooner however had a very ample supply of wood to burn that being an article which abounded on shelter island and which the deacon had consented to lay in in some abundance gardiner got this concession out of the miserly temperament of the old man by persuading him that a sealer could not work to any advantage unless he had the means of occasionally warming himself the miserly propensities of the deacon were not so engrossing that he did not comprehend the wisdom of making sufficient outlay to secure the execution of his main object and among other things of this nature the schooner had sailed with a very large supply of wood as has just been stated wood and onions indeed were more abundant in her than any other stores  the arrangements described were completed by the end of the first fortnight during which period the business of sealing was also carried on with great industry and success so very tame were the victims and so totally unconscious of the danger they incurred from the presence of man that the crew moved round among them seemingly but very little observed and not at all molested the utmost care was taken to give no unnecessary alarm and when an animal was lanced it was done in such a quiet way as to produce as little commotion as possible by the end of the time named however the sealing had got so advanced as to require the aid of all hands in securing the spoils to work then everybody went with a hearty goodwill and the shelf of rock just below the house was soon well garnished with casks and skins had the labour been limited to the mere killing and skinning and curing and barreling of oil it would have been comparatively quite light but the necessity of transporting the fruits of all this skill and luck considerable distances in some cases several miles and this over broken rocks formed the great obstacle to immediate success it was the opinion of roswell gardiner that he could have filled his schooner in a month were it possible to place her directly alongside of the rocks frequented by the seals and prevent all this toil in transporting this however was impossible the waves and the ice rendering it certain destruction to lay a craft anywhere along the northern shore of the island the boats might be and occasionally they were used bringing loads of skin and oil round the cape quite into the cove these little cargoes were immediately transferred to the hold of the schooner a groundtier of large casks having been left in her purposely to receive the oil which was emptied into them by means of a hose by the end of the third week this groundtier was filled and the craft became stiff and was in good ballast trim although the spare water was now entirely pumped out of her  all this time the weather was very fair for so high a latitude and every way propitious the twentythird day after the schooner got in roswell was standing on a spur of the hill at no great distance from the house overlooking the long reach of rocky coast over which the seaelephants and lions and dogs and bears were waddling in as much seeming security as the hour when he first saw them the sun was just rising and the seals were clambering up out of the water to enjoy its warm rays as they placed themselves in positions favourable to such a purpose  that is a pleasant sight to a true sealer captain garner observed stimson who as usual had kept near his officer and one that i can say i never before saw equalled ive been in this business now some fiveandtwenty years and never before have i met with so safe a harbour for a craft and so large herds that have not been stirred up and got to be skeary  we have certainly been very fortunate thus far stephen and i am now in hopes we may fill up and be off in good season to get clear of the ice returned roswell our luck has been surprising all things considered  you call it luck captain garner but in my creed there is a truer and a better word for it sir  ay i know well enough what you mean stephen though i cannot fancy that providence cares much whether we shall take a hundred seals today or none at all  such is not my idee sir and im not ashamed to own it in my humble way of thinking captain garner the finger of divine providence is in all that comes to pass if not straight ahead like as a body would receive a fall still by sartain laws that bring about everything that is to happen just as it does happen i believe now sir that providence does not intend we shall take any seals at all today sir  why not stimson it is the very finest day we have had since we have been on the island  thats true enough and it is this glorious sunny day glorious and sunny for sich a high latitude that makes me feel and think that this day was not intended for work you probably forget it is the sabbath captain garner  sure enough i had forgotten that stephen but we sealers seldom lie by for such a reason  so much the worse for us sealers then sir this is my seventeenth vyge into these seas sir and i will say that more of them have been made with officers and crews that did not keep the sabbath than with officers and crews that did still i have obsarved one thing sir that the man who takes his rest one day in seven and freshens his mind as it might be with thinking of other matters than his everyday consarns comes to his task with so much better will when he does set about it as to turn off greater profit than if he worked night and day sundays and all  roswell gardiner had no great reverence for the christian sabbath and this more because it was so called than for any sufficient reason in itself pride of reason rendered him jealous of everything like a concession to the faith of those who believed in the son of god and he was very apt to dissent from all admission that had even the most remote bearing on its truth still as a kindhearted commander as well as a judicious reasoner on the economy of his fellowcreatures he fully felt the policy of granting relaxation to labour nor was he indisposed to believe in the care of a divine providence or in its justice though less believing in this respect than the illiterate but earnestminded seaman who stood at his side he knew very well that all work and no play makes jack a dull boy and he understood well enough that it was good for man at stated seasons to raise his mind from the cares and business of this world to muse on those of the world that is to come though inclined to deism roswell worshipped in his heart the creator of all he saw and understood as well as much that he could neither scan nor comprehend  this is not the seamans usual way of thinking returned our hero after regarding his companion for a moment a little intently with us there is very little sabbath in bluewater  too little sir much too little depend ont captain garner god is on the face of the waters as well as on the hilltops his spirit is everywhere and it must grieve it to see human beings that have been created in his image so bent on gain as to set apart no time even for rest much less for his worship and praise  i am not certain you are wrong stimson and i feel much more sure that you are right as a political economist than in your religion there should be seasons of rest and reflectionyet i greatly dislike losing a day as fine as this  the better the day the better the deed sir no time is lost to him who stops in his work to think a little of his god our crew is used to having a sabbath and though we work on lays there is not a hand aboard us captain garner who would not be glad to hear the word pass among em which should say this is the lords day and youve to knock off from your labour  as i believe you understand the people stephen and we have had a busy time of it since we got in ill take you at your word and give the order go and tell mr hazard therell be no duty carried on today beyond what is indispensable it is sunday and well make it a day of rest  truth compels us to say that roswell was quite as much influenced in giving this order by recollecting the pleasure it would give mary as by any higher consideration  glad enough was stimson to hear this order and away he hastened to find the mate that it might be at once communicated to the men although this welldisposed seaman a little overrated the motives of a portion of the crew at least he was right enough as to the manner in which they would receive the new regulation rest and relaxation had become in a measure necessary to them and leisure was also needed to enable the people to clean themselves the business in which they had been engaged being one that accumulates oily substances and requiring occasional purifications of the body in order to preserve the health the scurvy that great curse of long voyages is as much owing to neglect of cleanliness as to diet  no sooner was it known that this day was to be treated as the sabbath than soap razors scissors and all the usual appliances of the sailors toilet were drawn out of bags and chests and paraded about on the rocks an hour passed in scrubbing shaving cutting hair holding garments up to the light to look for holes and ascertain their condition and rummaging among properties as the player would term the different wardrobes that were thus brought into view the mates came out of the melee shaven and shorn as well as neatly attired and there was not a man on the island who did not look like a different being from what he had appeared an hour before in consequence of this pause in the regular business of sealing and the promised holiday a strict order was given that no one should go among the seals as it was feared that some indiscretion or other might have a tendency to create an alarm in all other respects the island was placed at the disposal of the men if anything could be made of such a lone spot a speck on the surface of the antarctic seas and nearly encircled by mountains of floating ice  as for roswell himself after reading a chapter or two in mary pratts bible he determined to make another effort to ascend to the summit of the sterile rocks which capped the pile that rose vertically in the centre of the island the day was nearly all before him and summoning stimson as a companion for he had taken a great fancy to this man away he went young active and full of buoyancy almost at the same instant hazard the chief mate pulled out of the cove in one of the whaleboats manned by volunteers and provided with sails with an intention to cross the great bay and get a nearer view of the volcanic hill out of which smoke was constantly pouring and occasionally flames the second mate and one or two of the hands remained near the house to keep a lookout on the vessel and other property  the season had now advanced to the first day of january a month that in the southern hemisphere corresponds with our own july as roswell picked his way among the broken rocks that covered the ascent to what might be termed the tableland of the island if indeed any portion of so ragged a bit of this earth could properly be so named his thoughts recurred to this question of the season and to the probability of his getting a cargo before it would be absolutely necessary to go to the northward on the whole he fancied his chances good and such he found to be stimsons opinion when this experienced sealer was questioned on the subject  weve begun right in all respects but one captain garner said stephen as he closed his remarks on the subject and even in that matter in which we made a small mistake at the outset we are improving and i hope will come out right in the end i said a small mistake but in this im wrong as it was a great mistake  and what was it stephen make no bones of telling me of any blunder i may have committed according to your views of duty you are so much older than myself that ill stand it  why sir its not in seamanship or in sealing if it was id hold my tongue but its in not keeping the lords day from the hour when we lifted our anchor in that bay that bears the name of your family captain garner and which ought to be and i make no doubt is dear to you on that account if for no other reason i rather think from what they tell me that the old lord garner of all had much preaching of the word and much praying to the lord in the old times when he lived there  there never was any lord gardiner among us returned roswell modestly though it was a fashion among the eastenders to give that title to the owner of the island my ancestor who first got the place was lyon gardiner an engineer in the service of the colony of connecticut  well whether he was a lion or a lamb ill answer for it the lord was not forgotten on that island captain garner and he shouldnt be on this no man ever lost anything in this world or in that which is to come ater it by remembering once in seven days to call on his creator to help him on in his path ive heard it said sir that youre a little particlar like in your idees of religion and that you do not altogether hold to the doctrines that are preached up and down the land  roswell felt his cheeks warm at this remark and he thought of mary and of her meek reliance on that saviour whom in the pride of his youth strength and as he fancied of his reason also he doubted about as being the son of god the picture thus presented to his mind had its pleasant and its unpleasant features strange as it may seem it is certain that the young man would have loved would have respected mary less than he now did could he imagine that she entertained the same notions on this very subject as those he entertained himself few men relish infidelity in a woman whose proper sphere would seem to be in believing and in worshipping and not in cavilling or in splitting straws on matters of faith perhaps it is that we are apt to associate laxity of morals with laxity of belief and have a general distaste for releasing the other sex from any even the smallest of the restraints that the dogmas of the church impose but we hold it to be without dispute that with very few exceptions every man would prefer that the woman in whom he feels an interest should err on the side of bigotry rather than on that of what is called liberalism in points of religious belief thus it is with most of us and thus was it with roswell gardiner he could not wonder at marys rigid notions considering her education and on the whole he rather liked her the better for them at the very moment that he felt they might endanger his own happiness if women thoroughly understood how much of their real power and influence with men arises from their seeming dependence there would be very little tolerance in their own circles for those among them who are for proclaiming their independence and their right to equality in all things  while our young mariner and his companion were working their way up to the tableland which lay fully three hundred feet above the level of the sea there was little opportunity for further discourse so rough was the way and so difficult the ascent at the summit however there was a short pause ere the two undertook the mountain proper and they came to a halt to take a look at the aspect of things around them there was the boat a mere white speck on the water flying away with a fresh northerly breeze towards the volcano while the smoke from the latter made a conspicuous and not very distant landmark nearer at home all appeared unusually plain for a region in which fogs were so apt to prevail the cove lay almost beneath them and the schooner just then struck the imagination of her commander as a fearfully small craft to come so far from home and to penetrate so deep among the mazes of the ice it was that ice itself however that attracted most of roswells attention far as the eye could reach north south east and west the ocean was brilliant and chill with the vast floating masses the effect on the air was always perceptible in that region killing the summer as the sealers expressed it but it seemed to be doubly so at the elevation to which the two adventurers had attained still the panorama was magnificent the only part of the ocean that did not seem to be alive with icebergs if one may use such an expression was the space within the group and that was as clear as an estuary in a mild climate it really appeared as if nature had tabooed that privileged spot in order that the communication between the different islands should remain open of course the presence of so many obstacles to the billows without and indeed even to the rake of the winds produced smooth water within the slow breathlike heaving and setting of the ceaseless groundswell being the only perceptible motion to the water in side  tis a very remarkable view stephen said roswell gardiner but there will be one much finer if we can work our way up that cone of a mountain and stand on its naked cap i wish i had brought an old ensign and a small spar along to set up the gridiron in honour of the states were beginning to put out our feelers old stimson and shall have em on far better bits of territory than this before the earth has gone round in its track another hundred years  well to my notion captain garner answered the seaman following his officer towards the base of the cone uncle sam has got more land now than he knows what to do with if a body could discover a bit of ocean or a largish sort of a sea there might be some use in it whales are getting to be skeary and are mostly driven off their old grounds and as for the seals you must bury yourself craft and all up to the truck in ice to get a smile from one of their goodlookin countnances as i always say  im afraid stephen it is all over with the discovery of more seas even the moon they now say is altogether without water having not so much as a lake or a large pond to take a duck in  without water sir exclaimed stimson quite aghast if tis so sir it must be right since the same hand that made the moon made this arth and all it contains but what can they do for seafaring folks in the moon if what you tell me captain garner is the truth  they must do without them i fancy oil and skins are not very much in demand among the moonites stephen whats that off here to the eastward eh eastandby northhalfeast or so  i see what you mean sir it does look wonderfully like a sail and a sail pretty well surrounded by ice too  there was no mistake in the matter the white canvass of a vessel was plainly visible over a vast breadth of fieldice a little to the northward of the island that lay directly opposite the cove although the sails of this stranger were spread it was plain enough he was closely beset if not actually jammed from the first instant he saw the strange craft roswell had not a doubt of her character he felt convinced it was his late consort the sea lion of the vineyard which had found her way to the group by means of some hint that had fallen into daggetts hands if not by a positive nautical instinct so great had been his own success however and so certain did he now feel of filling up in due season that he cared much less for this invasion on his privacy than he would have done a fortnight earlier on the contrary it might be a good thing to have a consort in the event of any accident occurring to his own vessel from the moment then that gardiner felt certain of the character of the strange sail his policy was settled in his own mind it was to receive his old acquaintance with good will and to help fill him up too as soon as he had secured his own cargo in order that they might sail for home in company by his aid and advice the other schooner might save a week in time at that most important season of the year and by the experience and exertions of his people a whole month in filling up might readily be gained  all thoughts of climbing the peak were at once abandoned and in fifteen minutes after the sail was seen roswell and stephen both came panting down to the house so much easier is it to descend in this world than to mount a swivel was instantly loaded and fired as a signal and in half an hour a boat was manned and ready roswell took command himself leaving his second mate to look after the schooner stimson went with his captain and in less than one hour after he had first seen the strange sail our hero was actually pulling out of the cove with a view to go to her assistance roswell gardiner was as goodhearted a fellow as ever lived he had a sufficient regard for his own interests as well as for those of others entrusted to his care but these main points looked after he would cheerfully have worked a month to relieve the vineyardmen from the peril that so plainly beset them setting his sails the instant the boat was clear of the rocks away he went then as fast as ash and canvass could carry him which was at a rate but little short of eight knots in the hour  as he was thus flying towards his object our young mariner formed a theory in his own mind touching the drift of the ice in the adjacent seas it was simply this he had sounded in entering the great bay and had ascertained that comparatively shallow water existed between the southeastern extremity of sealers land and the nearest island opposite it was deep enough to admit the largest vessel that ever floated and a great deal more than this but it was not deep enough to permit an iceberg to pass the tides too ran in races among the islands which prevented the accumulation of ice at the southern entrance while the outer currents seemed to set everything past the group to allow of the floating mountains to collect to the eastward where they appeared to be thronged it was on the western verge of this wilderness of icebergs and ice fields that the strange sail had been seen working her way towards the group which must be plainly in view from her decks as her distance from the nearest of the islands certainly did not exceed two leagues  it required more than two hours for the whaleboat of roswell to cross the bay and reach the margin of that vast field of ice which was prevented from drifting into the open space only by encountering the stable rocks of the first of the group every eye was now turned in quest of an opening by means of which it might be possible to get further to the eastward one at length was discovered and into it gardiner dashed ordering his boats crew to stretch themselves out at their oars though every man with him thought they were plunging into possible destruction on the boat went however now sheering to starboard now to port to avoid projecting spurs of ice until she had ploughed her way through a fearfully narrow and a deviating passage that sometimes barely permitted them to go through until a spot was reached where the two fields which formed this strait actually came in close crushing contact with each other roswell took a look before and behind him saw that his boat was safe owing to the formation of the two outlines of the respective fields when he sprang upon the ice itself bidding the boatsteerer to wait for him a shout broke out of the lips of the young captain the instant he was erect on the ice there lay the schooner the marthas vineyard craft within half a mile of him in plain sight and in as plain jeopardy she was jammed with every prospect as roswell thought of being crushed ere she could get free from the danger     chapter xvi      a scullers notch in the stern he made   an oar he shaped of the bottle blade   then sprung to his seat with a lightsome leap   and launched afar on the calm blue deep    the culprit fay   roswell was hardly on the ice before a sound of a most portentous sort reached his ear he knew at once that the field had been rent in twain by outward pressure and that some new change was to occur that might release or might destroy the schooner he was on the point of springing forward in order to join daggett when a call from the boat arrested his steps  these here fields are coming together captain garner and our boat will soon be crushed unless we get it out of the water  sure enough a single glance behind him sufficed to assure the young master of the truth of this statement the field he was on was slowly swinging bringing its western margin in closer contact with the eastern edge of the floe that lay within it the movement could be seen merely by the closing of the channel through which the boat had come and by the cracking and crushing of the ice on the edges of the two fields so tremendous was the pressure however that cakes as large as a small house were broken off and forced upward on the surface of the field or ground into small fragments as it might be under the vice of a power hitherto unknown to the spectators slow as was the movement of the floe it was too fast to allow of delay and finding a suitable place the boat was hauled up and put in security on the floe that lay nearest the schooner  this may give us a long drag to get back into the water stimson and a night out of our bunks said roswell looking about him as soon as the task was achieved  i do not know that sir was the answer it seems to me that the floe has parted alongside of them rocks and ifsobe that should turn out to be the case the whull on us schooner boat and all hands may drift into the bay for that there is a current setting from this quarter up towards our island im sartain of by the feel of my oar as we come along  it may be sothe currents run all manner of ways and fieldice may pass the shoals though a berg never can i do not remember nevertheless to have ever seen even a floe within the groupnothing beyond large cakes that have got adrift by some means or other  i have sir though only once a few days ater we got in when i was shipkeeper and all hands was down under the rocks of the north eend a field come in at the northern entrance of the bay and went out at the southern it might have been a league athwart it and it drifted as a body might say as if it had some one aboard to give it the right sheer touch it did at the south cape but just winding as handy as a craft could have done it in a good tides way out to sea it went agin bound to the south pole fortinow  well this is good news and may be the means of saving the vineyard craft in the end we do seem to be setting bodily into the bay and if we can only get clear of that island i do not see what is to hinder it here is a famous fellow of a mountain to the northward coming down before the wind as one might say and giving us a cant into the passage i should think that chap must produce some sort of a change whether it be for better or worse  ay ay sir put in thompson who acted as a boatsteerer at need he may do just that but it is all he can do mr green and i sounded out from the cove for a league or more a few days since and we found less than twenty fathoms as far as we went that chap up to the norard there draws something like a hundred fathoms if he draws an inch he shows more above water than a firstrates truck  that does he and a good deal to spare thompson do you and todd remain here and look after the boat while the rest of us will shape our course for the schooner she seems to be in a wicked berth and twill be no more than neighbourly to try to get her out of it  truly enough might roswell call the berth of the sea lion of the vineyard by any expressive name that implied danger when the party reached her they found the situation of that vessel to be as follows she had been endeavouring to work her way through a passage between two large fields when she found the ice closing and that she was in great danger of being nipped daggett was a man of fertile resources and great decision of character perceiving that escape was impossible all means of getting clear being rendered useless by the floes soon touching both before and behind him he set about adopting the means most likely to save his vessel selecting a spot where a curve in the margin of the field to leeward promised temporary security at least he got his vessel into it anchored fast to the floe then he commenced cutting away the ice by means of axes first and of saws afterwards in the hope that he might make such a cavity as by its size and shape would receive the schooners hull and prevent her destruction for several hours had he and his people been at this work when to their joy as well as to their great astonishment they were suddenly joined by roswell and his party the fact was that so intently had every one of the vineyard mens faculties been absorbed by their own danger and so much was each individual occupied by his own duty that not a man among them had seen the boat or even any of the crew until gardiner called out to daggett as he approached announcing his presence by his voice  this is good fortune truly captain garner said daggett shaking his brother master most cordially by the hand good fortune do i call it i was satisfied that i should fall in with you somewhere about this group of islands for they lie just about where my late uncle had given us reason to suppose some good sealing ground might be met with but i did not hope to see you this morning you observe our position captain garner there is every prospect of a most awful nip  there is indeed though i see you have been making some provision for it what luck have you had in digging a slip to let the schooner into  well we might have had worse though better would have been more agreeable its plain sailing so long as we can work above water and you see weve cleared a fine berth for the craft down to the waters edge but below that tis blind work and slow the field is some thirty feet thick and sawing through it is out of the question the most we can do is to get off pieces diagonally i am not without hopes that we have done enough of this to make a wedge on which the schooner will rise if pressed hard on her offside i have heard of such things captain garner though i cannot say i ever saw it  its a ticklish business to trust to such a protector still a great deal must be gained by cutting away so much of this upper ice and it is possible your schooner may be lifted as you seem to expect has anything been done to strengthen the craft inboard  not as yet though ive thought of that too but what is the stoutest ship that ever floated against the pressure of such an enormous field of ice had we not better keep cutting away  you can continue to work the saw and the axes but i will give an eye to strengthening the craft inboard just point out the spars and plank you can spare and well see what can be done at any rate my lads you can now work with the certainty that your lives are safe my schooner lies about six leagues from you as safely moored as if she lay in a dock come captain daggett let me see your spare spars and plank  great encouragement it certainly was to these mariners so far from home and in their imminently perilous condition to know that a countryman and a friend was so near them to afford shelter and protection the american sailor is not a cheering animal like his english relative but he quite as clearly understands what ought to be received with congratulation as those who are apt to make more noise the vineyard men in particular were habitually quiet and thoughtful there being but one seaman in the craft who did not husband his lay and look forward to meet the wants of a future day this is the result of education men usually becoming quiet as they gain ideas and feel that the tongue has been given to us in order to communicate them to our fellows still the joy at receiving this unlookedfor assistance was great among the vineyard men and each party went to work with activity and zeal  the task of roswell gardiner was inboard while that of daggett and his men continued to be on the ice the latter resumed the labour of cutting and sawing the field and of getting up fenders or skids to protect the inner side of their vessel from the effects of a nip as for gardiner he set about his selfassumed duty with great readiness and intelligence his business was to strengthen the craft by getting supports up in her hold this was done without much difficulty all the upper part of the hold being clear and easily come at spars were cut to the proper length plank were placed in the broadest part of the vessel opposite to each other and the spars were wedged in carefully extending from side to side so as to form a great additional support to the regular construction of the schooner in little more than an hour roswell had his task accomplished while daggett did not see that he could achieve much more himself they met on the ice to consult and to survey the condition of things around them  the outer field had been steadily encroaching upon the inner breaking the edges of both until the points of junction were to be traced by a long line of fragments forced upward and piled high in the air open spaces however still existed owing to irregularities in the outlines of the two floes and daggett hoped that the little bay into which he had got his schooner might not be entirely closed ere a shift of wind or a change in the tides might carry away the causes of the tremendous pressure that menaced his security it is not easy for those who are accustomed to look at natural objects in their more familiar aspects fully to appreciate the vast momentum of the weight that was now drifting slowly down upon the schooner the only ray of hope was to be found in the deficiency in one of the two great requisites of such a force momentum being weight multiplied into velocity there were some glimpses visible of a nature to produce a slight degree of expectation that the last might yet be resisted the movement was slow but it was absolutely grand by its steadiness and power any one who has ever stood on a lake or river shore and beheld the undeviating force with which a small cake of ice crumbles and advances before a breeze or in a current may form some idea of the majesty of the movement of a field of leagues in diameter and which was borne upon by a gale of the ocean as well as by currents and by the weight of drifting icebergs from without it is true that the impetus came principally from a great distance and could scarcely be detected or observed by those around the schooner still these last were fully aware of the whole character of the danger which each minute appeared to render more and more imminent and imposing the two fields were obviously closing still and that with a resistless power that boded destruction to the unfortunate vessel the open water near her was already narrowed to a space that half an hour might suffice to close entirely  have you set that nearest island by compass daggett asked roswell gardiner as soon as he had taken a good look around him to me it seems that it bears more to the eastward than it did an hour since if this should be true our inner field here must have a very considerable westerly set  in which case we may still hope to drift clear returned daggett springing on board the schooner and running aft to the binnacle roswell keeping close at his side by george it is as you say the bearings of that island are altered at least two points  in which case our drift has exceeded a leagueha what noise is that can it be an eruption of the volcano  daggett at first was inclined to believe it was a sound produced by some of the internal convulsions of the earth which within as if in mockery of the chill scene that prevailed without was a raging volcano the fierce heats of which found vent at the natural chimneys produced by its own efforts this opinion however did not last long and he gave expression to his new thoughts in his answer  tis the ice he said i do believe the pressure has caused the fields to part on the rocks of that island if so our leeward floe may float away as fast as the weather field approaches  hardly said roswell gazing intently towards the nearest island hardly for the most weatherly of the two will necessarily get the force of the wind and the impetus of those bergs first and make the fastest drift it may lessen the violence of the nip but i do not think it will avert it altogether  this opinion of gardiners fully described all that subsequently occurred the outer floe continued its inroads on the inner breaking up the margins of both until the channel was so nearly closed as to bring the field from which the danger was most apprehended in absolute contact with the side of the schooner when the margin of the outer floe first touched the bilge of the schooner it was at the precise spot where the vessel had just been fortified within fenders had also been provided without and there was just a quarter of a minute during which the two captains hoped that these united means of defence might enable the craft to withstand the pressure this delusion lasted but a moment however the cracking of timbers letting it be plainly seen that the force was too great to be resisted for another quarter of a minute the two masters held their breath expecting to see the deck rise beneath their feet as the ice rose along the points of contact between the floes such in all probability would have been the result had not the pressure brought about another change that was quite as much within the influence of the laws of mechanical forces though not so much expected owing to the wedgelike form of the vessels bottom as well as to the circumstance that the ice of the outer floe had a similar shape projecting beneath the schooners keel the craft was lifted bodily with an upward jerk as if she were suddenly released from some imprisoning power released she was indeed and that most opportunely for another halfminute would have seen her ribs broken in and the schooner a mangled wreck as she now rose roswell gave vent to his delight in a loud cry and all hands felt that the occurrence might possibly save them the surge upward was fearful and several of the men were thrown off their feet but it effectually released the schooner from the nip laying her gradually up in the sort of dock that her people had been so many hours preparing for her reception there she lay inclining a little partly on her bilge or sewed as seamen term it when a vessel gets a list from touching the ground and being left by the tide neither quite upright nor absolutely on her beamends  no sooner was the vessel thus docked than all apprehension of receiving further injury from the outer floe ceased it might force the schooner altogether on the inner field driving the vessel before it as an avalanche of mud in the alps is known to force cottages and hamlets in its front but it could no longer nip it it did not appear probable to the two masters however that the vessel would be forced from its present berth the rending and cracking of the ice sensibly diminishing as the two floes came closer and closer together nor was this all it was soon very obvious that the inner field was drifting with an increased motion into the bay while the larger or outer floe seemed to hang from some cause or other of the fact there was soon no doubt the fissure beginning to open as slowly and steadily as it had closed but noiselessly and without any rending of the ice  we shall get you clear daggett we shall get you clear cried roswell with hearty goodwill forgetting in that moment of generous effort all feelings of competition and rivalry i know what you are after my good fellowhave understood it from the first yonder high land is the spot you seek and along the north shore of that island are elephants lions dogs bears and other animals to fill up all the craft that ever came out of the vineyard  this is hearty garner returned the other giving his brother master a most cordial shake of the hand and its just what i like sealing is a sociable business and a craft should never come alone into these high latitudes accidents will happen to the most prudent man living as you see by what has just befallen me for to own the truth weve had a narrow chance of it  the reader will remember that all which daggett now said was uttered by a man who saw his vessel lying on the ice with a list that rendered it somewhat difficult to move about on her deck and still in circumstances that would have caused half the navigators of this world to despair such was not the fact with daggett however seven thousand miles from home alone in an unknown sea and uncertain of ever finding the place he sought this man had picked his way among mountains and fields of ice with perhaps less hesitation and reluctance than a dandy would encounter the perils of a crossing when the streets were a little moistened by rain even then with his vessel literally shelfed on the ice certain that she had been violently nipped he was congratulating himself on reaching a sealing ground from which he could never return without encountering all the same dangers over again as for roswell he laughed a little at the others opinion of the sealing business for he was morally certain the vineyardman would have kept the secret had it been in his possession alone  well well well forget the past he said all but what weve done to help one another you stood by me off hatteras and ive been of some service to you here you know how it is in our calling daggett first come first served i got here first and have had the cream of the business for this season though i do not by any means wish to be understood as saying that you are too late  i hope not garner twould be vexatious to have all this risk and trouble for nothing how much ile have you stowed  all my groundtier and a few riders it is with the skins that we are doing the best business  daggetts eyes fairly snapped at this announcement which aroused all his professional ambition to say nothing of that propensity to the root of all evil which had become pretty thoroughly incorporated with his moral being by dint of example theory and association we have frequently had occasion to remark how much more enjoyable for the intellectual and independent is a country on the decline than a country on the advance the one is accumulating that wealth which the other has already possessed and improved and men cease to dwell so much on riches in their inmost souls when the means of obtaining them would seem to have got beyond their reach this is one of the secrets of the universal popularity of italy with the idle and educated though the climate and the monuments and the recollections out of doubt contribute largely to its charms nevertheless man as a rule is far more removed from the moneygetting mania in italy than in almost any other portion of the christian world and this merely because the time of her wealth and power has gone by leaving in its train a thousand fruits that would seem to be the most savoury as the stem on which they grew would appear to be approaching its decay on marthas vineyard however and in no part of the great republic indeed has this waning season yet commenced and the heart of man is still engrossed with those desires that are to produce the means which are to lay the foundations for the enjoyment of generations to come  thats luck indeed for a craft so early in the season returned daggett when his eyes had done snapping are the critturs getting to be wild and skeary  not more so than the day we began upon them i have taken the greatest care to send none but my most experienced hands out to kill and skin and their orders have been rigid to give as little alarm as possible if you wish to fill up i would advise you to take the same precautions for the heel of the season is beginning to show itself  i will winter here but i get a full craft said daggett with a resolute manner if not absolutely serious in what he said trouble enough have i had to find the group and we vineyardmen dont relish the idee of being outdone  you would be done up my fine fellow answered roswell laughing did you attempt to pass a winter here the sea lion of humses hull would not herself keep you in fuel and you would have to raft it off next summer on your casks or remain here for ever  i suppose a body might expect to see you back again another season observed daggett glancing meaningly towards his companion as if he had seriously revolved so desperate a plan in his mind tisnt often that a sealer lets a station like that youve described drop out of his recollection in a single vyge  i may be back or i may notsaid roswell just then remembering mary and wondering if she would continue to keep him any longer in suspense should he return successful from his present adventurethat will depend on others more than on myself i wish however now we are both here and there can no longer be any hide and go seek between us that you would tell me how you came to know anything about this cluster of islands or of the seals then and there to be found  you forget my uncle who died on oyster pond and whose effects i crossed over to claim  i remember him very wellsaw him often while living and helped to bury him when dead  well our information came from him he threw out several hints consarning sealinggrounds aboard the brig in which he came home and you neednt be told garner that a hint of that kind is sartain to find its way through all the ports down east but hearing that there was new sealingground wasnt knowing where to find it i should have been at a loss wasnt it for the spot on my uncles chart that had been rubbed over lately as i concluded to get rid of some of his notes you know as well as i do that the spot was in this very latitude and longitude and so i came here to look for the muchdesired land  and you have undertaken such an outfit and come this long distance into an icy sea on information as slight as this exclaimed roswell astonished at this proof of sagacity and enterprise even in men who are renowned for scenting dollars from pole to pole  on this with a few hints picked up here and there among some of the old gentlemans papers he was fond of scribbling and i have got a sort of a chart that he scratched on a leaf of his bible that was made to represent this very group as i can now see  then you could have had no occasion for the printed chart with the mark of obliteration on it and did not come here on that authority after all  there you re wrong captain garner the chart of the group had no latitude or longitude but just placed each island with its bearings and distances from the other islands it was no help in finding the place which might be in one hemisphere as well as in the other  it was then the mark of the obliteration  marks if you please captain garner interrupted the other significantly my uncle talked a good deal aboard of that brig about other matters besides sealing we think several matters have been obliterated from the old chart and we intend to look em all up its our right you know seeing that the old man was vineyardborn and we are his nearest of kin  certainlyrejoined roswell laughing again but somewhat more faintly than before every man for him self in this world is a good maxim it being pretty certain if we do not take care of ourselves no one will take care of us  yes sir said stimson who was standing near there is one to care for every hair of our heads however forgetful and careless we may be ourselves wasnt it for this captain garner theres many a craft that comes into these seas that would never find its way out of em and many a bold sailor with a heart boiling over with fun and frolic that would be frozen to an icecicle every year  gardiner felt the justice of this remark and easily pardoned its familiarity for its truth in these sealers the discipline is by no means of that distant and military or naval character that is found in even an ordinary merchantman as every seaman has an interest in the result of the voyage some excuse was made for this departure from the more general usage and this familiarity itself never exceeded the bounds that were necessary to the observance of duty  ay ay returned roswell smilingin one sense you are right enough but captain daggett and myself were speaking of human affairs as human affairs are carried onis not this inner field drifting fast away from the outer daggett if so we shall go directly into the bay  it was as gardiner thought by some means that were not apparent the floes were now actually separating and at a rate of movement which much exceeded that of their junction all idea of further danger from the outer field disappeared as a matter of course  its so captain garner said stimson respectfully but with point and who and what brought it about for our safety and the preservation of this crafti just ventur to ask that question sir  it may be the hand of providence my good fellow for i very frankly own i can see no direct physical cause nevertheless i fancy it would be found that the tides or currents have something to do with it if the truth could be come at  well sir and who causes the tides and currents to run thisaway and thataway  there you have me stephen for i never could get hold of the clew to their movements at all answered roswell laughing there is a reason for it all i dare say if one could only find it out captain daggett it is high time to look after the safety of your schooner she ought to be in the cove before night sets in since the ice has found its way into the bay  this appeal produced a general movement by this time the two fields were a hundred fathoms asunder the smaller or that on which the vessel lay drifting quite fast into the bay under the joint influences of wind and current while the larger floe had clearly been arrested by the islands this smaller field was much lessened in surface in consequence of having been broken at the rocks though the fragment that was thus cut off was of more than a league in diameter and of a thickness that exceeded many yards  as for the sea lion of the vineyard she was literally shelfed as has been said so irresistible had been the momentum of the great floe that it lifted her out of the water as two or three hands would run up a bark canoe on a gravelly beach this lifting process had very fortunately for the craft been effected by an application of force from below in a wedgelike manner and by bringing the strongest defences of the vessel to meet the power consequently no essential injury had been done the vessel in thus laying her on her screwdock  if a body could get the craft off as easily as she was got on observed daggett as he and roswell gardiner stood looking at the schooners situation it would be but a light job but as it is she lies on ice at least twenty feet thick and ice that seems as solid as flint  we know it is not quite as hard as that daggett was roswells reply for our saws and axes make great havoc in it when we can fairly get at it  if one could get fairly at it but here you see garner everything is under water and an axe is next to useless nor can the saws be used with much advantage on ice so thick  there is no help for it but hard work and great perseverance i would advise that a saw be set at work at each end of the schooner allowing a little room in case of accidents and that we weaken the foundation by two deep cuts the weight of the vessel will help us and in time she will settle back into her native element as the newspapers have it  there was indeed no other process that promised success and the advice of gardiner was followed in the course of the next two hours deep cuts were made with the saws which were pushed so low as to reach quite to the bottom of the cake this could be done only by what the sailors called juryhandles or spars secured to the plates the water offered the principal obstacle for that lay on the shelf at least five feet deep perseverance and ingenuity however finally achieved their aim a cracking was heard the schooner slowly righted and settled off into the sea again as easily and harmlessly as if scientifically launched the fenders protected her sides and copper though the movement was little more than slowly sinking on the fragment of the cake which by means of the cuts had been gradually so much reduced as to be unable to uphold so great a weight it was merely reversing the process of breaking the camels back by laying the last feather on his load  this happy conclusion to several hours of severe toil occurred just as the field had drifted abreast of the cove and was about the centre of the bay hazard came up also at that point on his return from the volcano altering his course a little to speak the strangers the report of the mate concerning his discoveries was simple and brief there was a volcano and one in activity but it had nothing remarkable about it no seal were seen and there was little to reward one for crossing the bay sterility and a chill grandeur were the characteristics of all that region and these were not wanting to any part of the group just as the sun was setting gardiner piloted his companion into the cove and the two sea lions were moored amicably side by side and that too at a spot where thousands of the real animals were to be found within a league     chapter xvii      the morning air blows fresh on him   the waves dance gladly in his sight   the seabirds call and wheel and skim   o blessed morning light    dana   the very day succeeding the arrival of the sea lion of the vineyard even while his mate was clearing the vessel daggett had a gang on the north shore killing and skinning as roswells rules were rigidly observed no other change was produced by this accession to the force of the sealers than additional slaughter many more seals were killed certainly but all was done so quietly that no great alarm was awakened among the doomed animals themselves one great advantage was obtained by the arrival of the new party that occasioned a good deal of mirth at first but which in the end was found to be of great importance to the progress of the work daggett had taken to pieces and brought with him the running part of a common country wagon which was soon found of vast service in transporting the skins and blubber across the rocks the wheels were separated leaving them in pairs and each axle was loaded with a freight that a dozen men would hardly have carried when two or three hands would drag in the load with an occasional lift from other gangs to get them up a height or over a cleft this portion of the operation was found to work admirably owing in a great measure to the smooth surfaces of the rocks and unquestionably these wheels advanced the business of the season at least a fortnightgardiner thought a month it rendered the crews better natured too much diminishing their toil and sending them to their bunks at night in a far better condition for rest than they otherwise could have been  just one month or four weeks to a day after the second schooner got in it being sunday of course gardiner and daggett met on the platform of a perfectly even rock that lay stretched for two hundred yards directly beneath the house it was in the early morning notwithstanding there was a strong disposition to work night and day on the part of the newcomers roswells rule of keeping the sabbath as a day of rest had prevailed and the business of washing scrubbing and shaving had just commenced as for the two masters they required fewer ablutions than their men had risen earlier and were already dressed for the day  tomorrow will be the first day of february said daggett when the salutations of the morning were passed and i was calculating my chances of getting full this season you will be full this week i conclude garner  we hope to be so by the middle of it was the answer i think the seal are getting to be much shyer than they were and am afraid we shall demonstrate that the more haste is the worse speed  what is that to you returned daggett quickly of course you will sail for home as soon as you can get off  gardiner did not like the of course which was indirectly saying what the other would do himself under similar circumstances still it caused no difference in his own decision which had been made up under the influence of much reflection and of a great deal of good feeling  i shall do no such thing captain daggett was the answer i do not fancy the idea of leaving a fellowcreature a countrymannay i might say a neighbour on this lone spot with the uncertainty of his ever getting out of it if you can come to some understanding with my officers and crew i will keep the schooner here until we are both full and ready to sail in company  in which case you would natrally ask a lay for yourself  naturally perhaps i might returned roswell smiling though positively i shall not not one of us in the cabin will look for any other advantage than your good company i have talked this matter over with my mates and they say that the advantage of having a consort in getting through the ice is sufficient to justify us in holding on two or three weeks longer with the men it will be a little different perhaps and they will require some pay the poor fellows live by their hands and what their hands do they will expect to be compensated for  they shall have good lays depend on it as for yourself captain garner i trust my owners will not forget to do what is right if we ever get home and meet with luck in the market  never fear for me daggett i look for my reward in the bright eyes and pleasant smiles of as excellent a girl as long island can produce mary never fails to reward me in that way whenever i do right it is right to stand by you just nowto do as i would be done by and i ll do it set the thing down as decided but make your bargain with my men and now daggett what say you to climbing yonder mountain today by way of getting a good survey of our territories as well as to take a look at the state of the ice  daggett assented very cheerfully his mind being greatly relieved by this assurance of standing by him on the part of roswell for he had been undecided whether to remain after the departure of the other schooner or not all was now clear to him however and the two masters made their preparations to ascend the mountain as soon as they had breakfasted stimson was summoned to be of the party his officer having got to be accustomed to and desirous of his company  for the first two hours after quitting the house gardiner daggett and the boatsteerer were busily employed in working their way across the broken surface of the island to the base of the conelike pinnacle that formed the apex of all there they rested and took a little refreshment conversing the while on the state of the ice in the offing so far as the last could be seen from their present elevation  we shall have a sharp hill to climb should we succeed in getting up here observed roswell though the rocks appear to be quite clear of snow just now  just now or never this is the antarctic dogdays garner answered daggett laughing and we must make the most of them a man can move about without his peejacket at noonday and that is something gained for i have heard of ice making in the bays even at midsummer  we are not in a high enough latitude for that thank heaven though pretty well south too this is our harvesttime here sure enough and we had better look to it  as gardiner said this the eyes of all three were turned on the sterile scene around them the island was not absolutely destitute of vegetation as is the case a few degrees further south but it might be said to be nearly so a few stunted plants were to be seen in the fissures of the rocks and a little soil had been made seemingly by the crumbling of the stones in which a wiry grass occasionally showed itself as for the mountain however it was mostly bare and when our party began to climb the ascent was not only difficult but in places dangerous roswell had foreseen this and he had made a provision accordingly in addition to his lance used as a leapingstaff and walkingpike each man had a small coil of ratlinstuff thrown over his shoulder in order to help him in difficult places or enable him to help his companions it was in the descent chiefly that these ropes were expected to be of service though their utility was made apparent ere the three reached the summit the ascent of a mountain a thousand feet in height is no great exploit under ordinary circumstances even when there are precipitous cliffs gorges ravines and broken masses youth activity and courage will commonly overcome all the difficulties placing the foot of man on eminences that nature would appear to have intended solely for the dominion of the goat thus did it turn out with the three sealers all of whom stood on the bald cap of that mountain after a vigorous and somewhat hazardous ascent that occupied rather more than an hour they had greatly aided each other in achieving their purpose to be sure and the ratlinstuff was found of use on more than one occasion  an extraordinary and considering the accessories a most brilliant view rewarded the adventurers but after a few minutes passed in pure admiration of what they beheld the minds of all three adverted to the parts which gave such unusual splendour to the panorama icebergs were visible on all sides of them the great bay excepted and the group was surrounded by them in a way that would seem to proclaim a blockade at that season the south winds prevailed though changes were frequent and sudden and the vast frozen fleet was drifting north gardiner saw that the passage by which he had brought in his schooner was now completely closed and that the only means of exit from the bay was by its northern outlet the great depth of the bergs still prevented their coming within the cluster of islands while their number and size completely stopped the floes from passing  to the northward the sea was much more open gardiner and daggett both thought as they gazed in that direction that it would be easy enough to take a vessel through the difficulties of the navigation and that a good run of eightandforty hours would carry her quite beyond the crowded ice this sight awakened some regrets in the two masters that they were not then in a condition to depart  i am almost sorry that we have made a holiday of the sunday said daggett seating himself on a point of rock to get a little rest after so fatiguing an ascent every minute of time is precious to men in our situation  every minute of time is precious to all men captain daggett in another and a still more important sense if they did but know it put in stimson with a zealous freedom and a christians earnestness  i understand you stephen and will not gainsay it but a sealin vyge is no place after all for a man to give himself up to sabbaths and religion  all places are good sir and all hours sabbaths when the heart is in the true state god is on this naked rock as he is on the vineyard and a thought or a syllable in his praise on this mountain are as pleasant to him as them that arise from churches and priests  i believe it is at least a mistake in policy to give the men no day of rest said roswell quietly though not prepared to carry matters as far as my friend stephen here i agree with him entirely in that  and not in believing sir that the spirit of god is on this island  in that too certainly neither captain daggett nor myself will be disposed to dispute either of these two propositions i think when we come to reflect on them a day of rest would seem to be appointed by nature and i make no doubt we have filled up all the sooner for having observed one seamen have so many calls on their time which cannot be neglected that it is unwise in them to increase the number unnecessarily  this is not the spirit captain garner im sorry to say in which we should keep our day of rest though it is well that we keep it at all im no stickler for houses and congregations though they are good enough in their times and seasons for every man has a tabernacle in his own heart if hes disposed to worship  and if any place on earth can particularly incline one to worship god surely it must be some such spot as this exclaimed roswell with a degree of fervour it was not usual for him to exhibit never in my life have my eyes seen a sight as remarkable and as glorious as this  well might our young mariner thus exclaim the day was fine for the region but marked by the caprice and changeful light of high latitudes there was mist in places and flurries of snow were to be seen to the southward while the ocean to the northward of the group was glittering under the brightness of an unclouded sun it was the mixed character of this scene that rendered it so peculiar while its grandeur sublimity and even beauty were found in its vastness its noble though wild accessories its frozen and floating mountains glowing in prismatic light and the play of summer on the features of an antarctic view  tis a remarkable spot as no one can deny answered daggett but i like its abundance of seal the most of all t cannot say i have much taste for sights unless they bring the promise of good profit with them we vineyarders live in a small way and are not rich enough to take delight in landscapes  serve god and reverence his holy name said stimson earnestly and all places will be good to look upon i have been on the vineyard in my time and have never found any difference as to the spot so long as the heart is right  a poor man must work answered daggett dropping his eyes from the more distant and gorgeous views of the drifting icemountains to the rocky shore that was still frequented by thousands of seals some of the largest of which might be seen even from that elevation waddling about ay a poor man must work sundays or no sundays and he who would make his hay must do it while the sun shines i like meetingoin at the right place and sealin when sealin ought to be done this day is lost i fear and i hope we shall not have reason to regret it  stimson did not abandon what he conceived to be his duty but answered this cold worldly spirit in the best manner his uncultivated speech enabled him to do but his words were thrown away on daggett the lust of gold was strong within him and while that has full dominion over the heart it is vain to expect that any purely spiritual fruits will ripen there daggett was an instance of what we fear many thousands resembling him might be found up and down the land of a man energetic by temperament industrious by habit and even moderate in his views but whose whole existence is concentrated in the accumulation of property born poor and in a state of society in which no one other generally recognised mode of distinction is so universally acknowledged as that of the possession of money it is not surprising that a man of his native disposition should early bend all his faculties to this one great object he was not a miser irke deacon pratt for he could spend freely on occasion and perfectly understood the necessity of making liberal outfits to insure ample returns but he lived for little else than for gain what such a man might have become under more favourable auspices and with different desires instilled into his youthful mind it is not easy to say it is only certain that as he was the steeltrap is not quicker to spring at the touch than he was to arouse all his manifold energies at the hopes or promise of profit as his whole life had been passed in one calling it was but natural that his thoughts should most easily revert to the returns that calling had so often given he never dreamed of speculations knew nothing of stocks had no concern with manufactures in cotton or wool nor had any other notion of wealth than the possession of a good farm on the vineyard a reasonable amount of money at use certain interests in coasters whalers and sealers and a sufficiency of household effects and this in a very modest way to make himself and family comfortable notwithstanding this seeming moderation daggett was an intensely covetous man but his wishes were limited by his habits  while one of the masters of the sealing crafts was drawing these pictures in his imagination of wealth after his manner very different were the thoughts of the other roswells fancy carried him far across that blue and sparkling ocean northward to oyster pond and deacon pratts homestead and to mary he saw the last in her single hearted simplicity her maiden modesty her youthful beautynay even in her unyielding piety for singular as it may seem gardiner valued his mistress so much the more for that very faith to which in his own person he laid no claim irreligious he was not himself though skeptical on the one great tenet of christianity but in mary it struck him it was right that she should believe that which she had been so sedulously taught for he did not at all fancy those inquiring minds in the other sex that lead their possessors in quest of novelties and paradoxes in this humour then the reader will not be surprised to hear that he imagined the deacons niece in her most pleasing attributes and bedecked her with all those charms that render maidens pleasant to youthful lovers had mary been less devout less fixed in her belief that jesus was the son of god strange as it may seem the skeptical young man would have loved her less  and what was that rugged uncultivated seaman who stood near the two officers thinking of all this time did he too bend his thoughts on love and profit and the pleasures of this world of love most truly was his heart full to overflowing but it was the love of god with that affection for all his creatures that benevolence and faith which glow as warmly in the hearts of the humblest and least educated as in those of the great and learned his mind was turned towards his creator and it converted the extraordinary view that lay before his sight into a vast magnificent gorgeous though wild temple for his worship and honour it might be well for all of us occasionally to pause in our eager pursuit of worldly objects and look around on the world itself considering it as but a particle in the illimitable fields of creationone among the many thousands of other known worlds that have been set in their places in honour of the hand that made them these brief but vivid glances at the immensity of the moral space which separates man from his deity have very healthful effects in inculcating that humility which is the steppingstone of faith and love  after passing an hour on the bald cap of the mountain sometimes conversing at others ruminating on the scene a change in the weather induced our party to move there had been flurries of snow visible all the morning but it was in the distance and among the glittering bergs once the volcano had thus been shut in from view but now a driving cloud passed over the mountain itself which was quickly as white as the pure element could make it so heavy was the fall of snow that it was soon impossible to see a dozen yards and of course the whole of the plain of the island was concealed at this most inauspicious moment our adventurers undertook their descent  it is always much less dangerous to mount an acclivity than to go down it the upward progress is easily enough arrested while that in the other direction is frequently too rapid to be under perfect command roswell felt the truth of this and would have proposed a delay until the atmosphere became clear again but it struck him that this was not likely to occur very soon he followed daggett therefore though reluctantly and with due caution stimson brought up the rear  for the first ten minutes our adventurers got along without any great difficulty they found the precise point at which they had reached the summit of the mountain and began to descend it was soon apparent that great caution must be used the snow rendering the footing slippery daggett however was a bold and hotblooded man when in motion and he preceded the party some little distance calling out to those behind him to come on without fear this the last did though it was with a good deal more caution than was observed by their leader at length all three reached a spot where it seemed they could not overcome the difficulties beneath them was the smooth face of a rock already covered with snow while they could not see far enough in advance to ascertain in what this inclined plane terminated daggett however insisted that he knew the spot that they had passed up it there was a broad shelf a short distance below them and once on that shelf it would be necessary to make a considerable circuit in order to reach a certain ravine down which the path would be reasonably easy all remembered the shelf and the ravine the question was merely whether the first lay beneath them and as near as daggett supposed a mistaken confidence beset the last and he carried this feeling so far as to decline taking an end of a line which roswell threw to him but seated himself on the snow and slid downward passing almost immediately out of sight  what has become of him demanded roswell endeavouring to pierce the air by straining his eyeballs he is not to be seen  hold on to the line sir and give me the other end of it i will go and see answered stimson  it being obviously the most hazardous to remain to the last and descend without the support of one above him roswell acquiesced in this proposal lowering the boatsteerer down the rock until he too was hid from his sight but though out of sight in that dense snowstorm stimson was not so distant as to be beyond the reach of the voice  go more to the right sir called out the seaman and steady me with the line along with you  this was done the walking being sufficiently secure at the elevation where roswell was presently stimson shook the line and called out again  that will do captain garner he said i am on the shelf now and have pretty good footing lay the line down on the snow sir and slide as slowly as you can mind and keep close at its side ill stand by to fetch you up  gardiner understood all this perfectly and did as he was desired to do by keeping near the line he reached the shelf precisely at the spot where stimson was ready to meet him the latter arresting his downward movement by throwing the weight of his own body forward to meet his officer by such a precaution roswell was stopped in time else would he have gone over the shelf and down a declivity that was so nearly perpendicular as to offer no means of arresting the movement  and what has become of captain daggett demanded gardiner as soon as on his feet again  i fear he has shot off the rock sir was the answer at the place where i reached this shelf it was so narrow i could with great difficulty walkcould not indeed had not the line been there to steady me and judging from the marks in the snow the poor man has gone down helpless  this was appalling intelligence to receive at such a time and in such a place but roswell was not unmanned by it on the contrary he acted coolly and with great judgment making a coil of the ratlinstuff he threw the line down until certain it reached bottom at the distance of about six fathoms then he caused stimson to brace himself firmly holding on to the line aided by a turn round a rise in the rock and he boldly lowered himself down the precipice reaching its base at about the distance he had calculated so to do  it still snowed violently the flakes being large and eddying round the angles of the rocks in flurries so violent as at moments to confound all the senses of the young man he was resolute however and bent on an object of humanity as well as of good fellowship living or dead daggett must be somewhere on his present level and he began to grope his way among the fragments of rock eager and solicitous the roaring of the wind almost prevented his hearing other sounds though once or twice he heard or fancied that he heard the shouts of stimson from above suddenly the wind ceased the snow lessened in quantity soon clearing away altogether and the rays of the sunand this in the dogdays of that region be it rememberedfell bright and genial on the glittering scene at the next instant the eyes of roswell fell on the object of his search  daggett had been carried over the narrow shelf on which stimson landed in consequence of his having no support or any means of arresting his momentum he did thrust forward his lance or leapingstaff but its point met nothing but air the fall however was by no means perpendicular several projections of the rocks helping to lessen it though it is probable that the life of the unfortunate sealer was saved altogether by means of the lance this was beneath him as he made his final descent and he slid along it the whole length canting him into a spot where was the only piece of stinted vegetation that was to be seen for a considerable distance in consequence of coming down on a tolerably thick bunch of furze the fall was essentially broken  when roswell reached his unfortunate companion the latter was perfectly sensible and quite cool  god be thanked that you have found me garner he said at one time i had given it up  thank god also that you are living my friend answered the other i expected only to find your body but you do not seem to be much hurt  more than appears garner more than appears my left leg is broken certainly and one of my shoulders pains me a good deal though it is neither out of joint or broken this is a sad business for a sealing vyge  give yourself no concern about your craft daggetti will look to her and to your voyage  will you stand by the schooner garnerpromise me that and my mind will be at peace  i do promise the two vessels shall stick together at all events until we are clear of the ice  ay but that wont do my sea lion must be filled up as well as your own promise me that  it shall be done god willing but here comes stimson the first thing will be to get you out of this spot  daggett was obviously relieved by roswells pledges for amid the anguish and apprehensions of his unexpected state his thoughts had most keenly adverted to his vessel and her fortunes now that his mind was somewhat relieved on this score the pains of his body became more sensibly felt the situation of our party was sufficiently embarrassing the leg of daggett was certainly broken a little distance above his ancle and various bruises in other places gave notice of the existence of other injuries to do anything with the poor man lying where he was was out of the question however and the first thing was to remove the sufferer to a more eligible position fortunately it was no great distance to the foot of the mountain and a low level piece of rock was accessible by means of care and steady feet daggett was raised between roswell and stimson in a sitting attitude and supporting himself by putting an arm around the neck of each the legs hung down the broken as well as the sound limb to this accidental circumstance the sufferer was indebted to a piece of incidental surgery that proved of infinite service to him while dangling in this manner the bone got into its place and daggett instantly became aware of that important fact which was immediately communicated to roswell of course the future mode of proceeding was regulated by this agreeable piece of information  sailors are often required to act as physicians surgeons and priests it is not often that they excel in either capacity but in consequence of the many things they are called to turn their hands to it does generally happen that they get to possess a certain amount of address that renders them far more dexterous in nearly everything they undertake than the generality of those who are equally strangers to the particular act that is thus to be exercised roswell had set one or two limbs already and had a tolerable notion of the manner of treating the case daggett was now seated on a rock at the base of the mountain with his legs still hanging down and his back supported by another rock no sooner was he thus placed than stimson was despatched posthaste for assistance his instructions were full and the honest fellow set off at a rate that promised as early relief as the circumstances would at all allow  as for our hero he set about his most important office the instant stimson left him daggett aided with his counsel and a little by his personal exertions for a seaman does not lie down passively when anything can be done even in his own case  baring the limb roswell soon satisfied himself that the bone had worked itself into place bandages were instantly applied to keep it there while splints were making it was perhaps a little characteristic that daggett took out his knife and aided in shaving down these splints to the necessary form and thickness they were made out of the staff of the broken lance and were soon completed roswell manifested a good deal of dexterity and judgment in applying the splints the handkerchiefs were used to relieve the pressure in places and ropeyarns from the ratlin stuff furnished the means of securing everything in its place in half an hour roswell had his job completed and that before there was much swelling to interfere with him as soon as the broken limb was thus attended to it was carefully raised and laid upon the rock along with its fellow a horizontal position being deemed better than one that was perpendicular  not less than four painful hours now passed ere the gang of hands from the vessels reached the base of the mountain it came prepared however to transport the sufferer on a handbarrow that had been used in conveying the skins of seal across the rocks on this barrow daggett was now carefully placed when four men lifted him up and walked away with him for a few hundred yards these were then relieved by four more and in this manner was the whole distance to the house passed over the patient was put in his bunk and some attention was bestowed on his bruises and other injuries  glad enough was the sufferer to find himself beneath a roof and in a room that had its comforts or what were deemed comforts on a sealing voyage as the men were in the dormitory very little of the time except at night he was enabled to sleep and roswell had hopes as he now told stimson that a month or six weeks would set the patient on his feet again  he has been a fortunate fellow stephen that it was no worse added roswell on that occasion but for the luck which turned the lancepole beneath him every bone he has would have been broken  what you call luck captain garner i call providence was stephens answer the good book tells us that not a sparrow shall fall without the eye of divine providence being on it     chapter xviii      now far he sweeps where scarce a summer smiles   on bherings rocks or greenlands naked isles   cold on his midnight watch the breezes blow   from wastes that slumber in eternal snow   and waft across the waves tumultuous roar   the wolfs long howl from oonalaskas shore    campbell   roswell gardiner set about his duties the succeeding day with a shade of deep reflection on his brow a crisis had indeed come in his affairs and it behooved him to look well to his proceedings daggetts presence on the island was no longer of any moment to himself or his owner but there remained the secret of the key and of the buried treasure should the two schooners keep together how was he to acquit himself in that part of his duty without admitting of a partnership against which he knew that every fibre in the deacons system whether physical or moral would revolt still his word was pledged and he had no choice but to remain and help fill up the rival sea lion and trust to his own address in getting rid of her again as the two vessels proceeded north  the chief mate of daggetts craft though a good sealer was an impetuous and reckless man and had more than once found fault with the great precautions used by the orders of roswell macy as this officer was called was for making a regular onslaught upon the animals slaying as many as they could at once and then take up the business of curing and tryingout as a regular job he had seen such things done with success and he believed it was the most secure mode of getting along some of these fine mornings as he expressed it captain garner would turn out and find that his herd was offgone to pasture in some other field this was a view of the matter with which roswell did not at all agree his forbearing and cautious policy had produced excellent results so far and he hoped it would continue so to do until both schooners were full on the morning when the men next went forth he as leader of both crews therefore our young master renewed his admonitions pointing out to the newcomers in particular the great necessity there was of using forbearance and not to alarm the seals more than the work indispensably required the usual number of ay ays sir were given in reply and the gangs went along the rocks seemingly in a good humour to obey these injunctions  circumstances however were by no means favourable to giving roswell the same influence over the vineyardmen as he possessed over his own crew he was a young commander and this was his first voyage in that capacity as all well knew then there had been rivalry and competition between the two crafts which was a feeling not so easily removed next macy felt and even intimated that he was the lawful commander of his own schooner in cases in which daggett was disabled and that the latter had no power to transfer him and his people to the authority of any other individual all these points were discussed that day with some freedom particularly among the vineyardmen and especially the last  wisely has it been said that the kings name is a tower of strength they who have the law on their side carry with them a weight of authority that it is not easy to shake by means of pure reasoning on right or wrong men are much inclined to defer to those who are thus armed legal control being ordinarily quite as effective in achieving a victory as having ones quarrel just in a certain sense authority indeed becomes justice and we look to its proper exercise as one of the surest means of asserting what is right between man and man  the commodore says that the critturs are to be treated delicately said macy laughing as he lanced his first seal that morning a young one of the fur species so take up the pet lads and lay it in its cradle while i go look for its mamma  a shout of merriment succeeded this sally and the men were only so much the more disposed to be rebellious and turbulent in consequence of hearing so much freedom of remark in their officer  the childs in its cradle mr macy returned jenkins who was a wag as well as the mate in my judgment the best mode of rocking it to sleep will be by knocking over all these grim chaps that are so plenty in our neighbourhood  let em have it cried macy making an onset on an elephant as he issued the order in an instant the rocks at that point of the island were a scene of excitement and confusion hazard who was near at hand succeeded in restraining his own people but it really seemed as if the vineyardmen were mad a great many seals were killed it is true but twenty were frightened to take refuge in the ocean where one was slain all animals have their alarm cries or if not absolutely cries signals that are understood by themselves occasionally one sees a herd or a flock take to its heels or to its wings without any apparent cause but in obedience to some warning that is familiar to their instincts thus must it have been with the seals for the rocks were soon deserted even at the distance of a league from the scene of slaughter leaving hazard and his gang literally with nothing to do unless indeed they returned to complete some stowage that remained to be done on board their own craft  i suppose you know mr macy all this is contrary to orders said hazard as he was leading his own gang back towards the cove you see i am obliged to go in and report  report and welcome was the answer i have no commander but captain daggettand by the way if you see him hazard just tell him we have made a glorious mornings work of it  ay ay you will have your hands full enough today macy but how will it be tomorrow  why just as it has been today the devils must come up to blow and were sartain of em somewhere along the shore this days work is worth any two that ive seen since i came upon the island  very true but what will tomorrows work be worth i will tell captain daggett what you wish me to say however and we will hear his opinion on the subject in my judgment he means to command his craft till she gets back to the hole legs or no legs  hazard went his way shaking his head ominously as he proceeded nor was he much mistaken in what he expected from daggetts anger that experienced sealer sent for his mate and soon gave him to understand that he was yet his commander loose and neighbourly as is usually the discipline of one of these partnership vessels there is commonly a man on board who is every way competent to assert the authority given him by the laws as well as by his contract macy was sent for rebuked and menaced with degradation from his station should he again presume to violate his orders as commonly happens in cases of this nature regrets were expressed by the offender and future obedience promised  but the mischief was done sealing was no longer the regular systematic pursuit it had been on that island but had become precarious and changeful at times the men met with good success then days would occur in which not a single creature of any of the different species would be taken the vineyard schooner was not more than halffull and the season was fast drawing to a close roswell was quite ready to sail and he began to chafe a little under the extra hazards that were thus imposed on himself and his people  in the mean time or fully three weeks after the occurrence of the accident to daggett the injuries received by the wounded man were fast healing the bones had knit and the leg promised in another month to become tolerably sound if not as strong as it had been before the hurt all the bruises were well and the captain of the vineyard craft was just beginning to move about a little on crutches a prodigious relief to one of his habits after the confinement to the house by dint of great care he could work his way down on the shelf that stretched like a terrace for two hundred yards beneath the dwelling here he met roswell on the morning of the sabbath just three weeks after their unfortunate visit to the mountain each took his seat on a low point of rock and they began to converse on their respective prospects and on the condition of their vessels and crews stephen was near his officer as usual  i believe stimson was right in urging me to give the men their sabbaths observed gardiner glancing round at the different groups in which the men were washing shaving and otherwise getting rid of the impurities created by another week of toil they begin anew after a little rest with a better will and steadier hands  yes the sabbath is a great privilege especially to such as are on shore returned daggett at sea i make no great account of it a craft must jog along high days or holidays  depend on it the same account is kept of the day captain daggett in the great logbook above whether a man is on or off soundings put in stephen who was privileged ever to deliver his sentiments on such subjects the lord is god on the sea as on the land  there was a pause for the solemn manner and undoubted sincerity of the speaker produced an impression on his companions little given as they were to thinking deeply on things of that nature then roswell renewed the discourse turning it on a matter that had been seriously uppermost in his mind for several days  i wish to converse with you captain daggett about our prospects and chances he said my schooner is full as you know we could do no more if we stayed here another season you are about halffull with a greatly diminished chance of filling up this summer mr macys attack on the seals has put you back a month at least and every day we shall find the animals less easy to take the equinox is not very far off and then you know we shall get less and less sunso little as to be of no great use to us we want daylight to get through the ice and we shall have a long hundred leagues of it between us and clear water even were we to get under way tomorrow remember what a serious thing it would be to get caught up here in so high a latitude after the sun has left us  i understand you gardner answered the other quietly though his manner denoted a sort of compelled resignation rather than any cordial acquiescence in that which he believed his brother master intended to propose youre master of your own vessel and i dare say deacon pratt would be much rejoiced to see you coming in between shelter island and oyster pond im but a cripple or i think the vineyard craft wouldnt be many days run astarn  roswell was provoked but his pride was touched also biting his lip he was silent for a moment when he spoke very much to the point but generously and like a man  ill tell you what it is daggett said our hero goodfellowship is goodfellowship and the flag is the flag it is the duty of all us yankee seamen to stand by the stripes and i hope im as ready as another to do what i ought to do in such a matter but my owner is a close calculator and i am much inclined to think that he will care less for this sort of feeling than you and i the deacon was never in blue water  so i supposehe has a charming daughter i believe garner  you mean his niece i suppose answered roswell colouring the deacon never had any child himself i believeat least he has none living mary pratt is his niece  its all the sameniece or daughter shes comely and will be rich i hear well i am poor and what is more a cripple  roswell could have knocked his companion down for he perfectly understood the character of the allusion but he had sufficient selfcommand to forbear saying anything that might betray how much he felt  it is always easier to work upon the sensitiveness of a spirited and generousminded man than to influence him by force or apprehensions roswell had never liked the idea of leaving daggett behind him at that season and in that latitude and he relished it still less now that he saw a false reason might be attributed to his conduct  you certainly do not dream of wintering here captain daggett he said after a pause  not if i can help it but the schooner can never go back to the vineyard without a full hold the very women would make the island too hot for us in such a case do your duty by deacon pratt garner and leave me here to get along as well as i can i shall be able to walk a little in a fortnight and in a month i hope to be well enough to get out among the people and regulate their sealing a little myself mr macy will be more moderate with my eye on him  a month he who stays here another month may almost make up his mind to stay eight more of them if indeed he ever get away from the group at all  a late start is better than a halfempty vessel when you get in to oyster pond garner i hope you will send a line across to the vineyard and tell em all about us  another long and brooding pause succeeded during which roswells mind was made up  i will do this with you daggett he said speaking like one who had fully decided on his course twenty days longer will i remain here and help to make out your cargo after which i sail whether you get another skin or a thousand this will be remaining as long as any prudent man ought to stay in so high a latitude  give me your hand garner i knew you had the clear stuff in you and that it would make itself seen at the proper moment i trust that providence will favour usits really a pity to lose as fine a day as this especially as the critturs are coming up on the rocks to bask something like old times  youll gain no great help from that providence you just spoke of captain daggett by forgetting to keep holy the sabbath said stimson earnestly try forbearance a little and find the good that will come of it  he is right said roswell as i know from having done as he advises well our bargain is made for twenty days longer i stay here helping you to fill up that will bring us close upon the equinox when i shall get to the northward as fast as i can in that time too i think you will be able to return to duty  this then was the settled arrangement roswell felt that he conceded more than he ought to do but the feeling of goodfellowship was active within him and he was strongly averse to doing anything that might wear the appearance of abandoning a companion in his difficulties all this time our hero was fully aware that he was befriending a competitor and he was not without his suspicions that daggett wished to keep him within his view until the visit had been paid to the key nevertheless roswells mind was made up he would remain the twenty days and do all he could in that time to help along the voyage of the vineyarders  the sealing was now continued with more order and method than had been observed under macys control the old caution was respected and the work prospered in proportion each night on his return to the house gardiner had a good report to make and that peculiar snapping of the eye that denoted daggetts interest in his calling was to be again traced in the expression of the vineyarders features a certain proof that he was fast falling into his old train of thought and feeling daggett was never happier than when listening to some account of the manner in which an old elephant or lion had been taken or a number of furseals had been made to pay their tribute to the enterprise and address of his people  as for roswell though he complied with his promise and carried on the duty with industry and success his eye was constantly turned on those signs that denote the advance of the seasons now he scanned the ocean to the northward and noted the diminished number as well as lessened size of the floating bergs proofs that the summer and the waves had been at work on their sides next his look was on the sun which was making his daily course lower and lower each time that he appeared settling rapidly away towards the north as if in haste to quit a hemisphere that was so little congenial to his character the nights always cool in that region began to menace frost and the signs of the decline of the year that come so much later in more temperate climates began to make themselves apparent here it is true that of vegetation there was so little and that little so meagre and of so hardy a nature that in this respect the progress of the seasons was not to be particularly noted but in all others roswell saw with growing uneasiness that the latest hour of his departure was fast drawing near  the sealing went on the while and with reasonable returns though the golden days of the business had been seriously interrupted by macys indiscretion and disobedience the men worked hard for they too foresaw the approach of the long night of the antarctic circle and all the risk of remaining too long as we have had frequent occasion to use the term antarctic it may be well here to say a few words in explanation it is not our wish to be understood that these sealers had penetrated literally within that belt of eternal snows and ice but approximatively few navigators so far as our knowledge extends have absolutely gone as far south as this wilkes did it it is true and others among the late explorers have been equally enterprising and successful the group visited by gardiner on this occasion was quite near to this imaginary line but we do not feel at liberty precisely to give its latitude and longitude to this hour it remains a species of private property and in this age of antirentism and other audacious innovations on longreceived and venerable rules of conduct we do not choose to be parties to any inroads on the rights of individuals when invaded by the cupidity and ruthless power of numbers those who wish to imitate roswell must find the islands by bold adventure as he reached them for we are tonguetied on the subject it is enough therefore that we say the group is near the antarctic circle whether a little north or a little south of it is a matter of no moment as those seas have a general character we shall continue to callthem the antarctic seas with the understanding that included in the term are the nearest waters without as well as within the circle  glad enough was roswell gardiner when his twenty days were up march was now far advanced and the approach of the long nights was near the vineyard craft was not full nor was daggett yet able to walk without a crutch but orders were issued by gardiner on the evening of the last day for his own crew to knock off sealing and to prepare to get under way for home  your mind is made up garner said daggett in a deprecating sort of way as if he still had latent hopes of persuading his brothermaster to remain a little longer another week would almost fill us up  not another day was the answer i have stayed too long already and shall be off in the morning if you will take my advice captain daggett you will do the same thing winter comes in this latitude very much as spring appears in our own or with a hop skip and a jump i have no fancy to be groping about among the ice after the nights get to be longer than the days  all true enough garner all quite truebut it has such a look to take a craft home and she not full  you have a great abundance of provisions stop and whale awhile on the false banks as you go north i would much rather stick by you there a whole month than remain here another day  you make me narvous talking of the group in this way im sartain that this bay must remain clear of ice several weeks longer  perhaps it may it is more likely to be so than to freeze up but this will not lengthen the days and carry us safe through the fields and bergs that we know are drifting about out here to the northward theres a hundred leagues of ocean thereaway daggett that i care for more just now than for all the seal that are left on these islands but talking is useless i go tomorrow if you are wise you will sail in company  this settled the matter daggett well knew it would be useless to remain without the aid of roswells counsel and that of his crews hands for macy was not to be trusted any more as the leader of a gang of sealers the man had got to be provoked and reckless and had called down upon himself latterly more than one rebuke it was necessary therefore that one of the sea lions should accompany the other the necessary orders were issued accordingly and hey for home were the words that now cheerfully passed from mouth to mouth that pleasant idea of home in which is concentrated all that is blessed in this life the pale of the christian duties and charities excepted brings to each mind its particular forms of happiness and good the weatherbeaten seaman the footworn soldier the weary traveller the adventurer in whatever lands interest or pleasure may lead equally feels a throb at his heart as he hears the welcome sounds of hey for home never were craft prepared for sea with greater rapidity than was the case now with our two sea lions it is true that the oysterponders were nearly ready and had been quite so for a fortnight but a good deal remained to be done among the vineyarders the last set themselves to their task with a hearty goodwill however and with corresponding results  we will leave the house standing for them that come after us said roswell when the last article belonging to his schooner was taken out of it the deacon has crammed us so full of wood that i shall be tempted to throw half of it overboard now we have so much cargo let all stand hazard bunks planks and all for really we have no room for the materials even this wood pointing to a pile of several cords that had been landed already to make room for skins and casks that had been brought out in shocks must go to the next comer perhaps it may be one of ourselves for we sailors never know what port will next fetch us up  i hope it will be old sag sir answered hazard cheerfully for though no great matter of a seaport it is near every mans home and may be called a sort of doorway to go in and out of the country through  a sidedoor at the best answered roswell with you i trust it will be the next haven that we enter though i shall take the schooner at once in behind shelter island and tie her up to the deacons wharf  what images of the past and future did these few jocular words awaken in the mind of our young sealer he fancied that he saw mary standing in the porch of her uncles habitation a witness of the approach of the schooner looking wistfully at the still indistinct images of those who were to be seen on her decks mary had often done this in her dreams again and again had she beheld the white sails of the sea lion driving across gardiners bay and entering peconic and often had she thus gazed in the weatherworn countenance of him who occupied so much of her thoughtsso many of her prayerspicturing through the mysterious images of sleep the object she so well loved when waking  and where was mary pratt at that day and hour when roswell was thus issuing his last orders at sealers land and what was her occupation and what her thoughts the difference in longitude between the group and montauk was so trifling that the hour might be almost called identical literally so it was not but mainly so it was there were not the five degrees in difference that make the twenty minutes in time more than this we are not permitted to say on this subject and this is quite enough to give the navigator a pretty near notion of the position of the group as a degree of longitude measures less than twentyeight statute miles at the polar circles this is coming within a days run of the spot so far as longitude is concerned and nearer than that we do not intend to carry the overanxious reader let his curiosity be as lively as it may  and where then was mary pratt safe well and reasonably happy in the house of her uncle where she had passed most of her time since infancy the female friends of mariners have always fruitful sources of uneasiness in the pursuit itself but mary had no other cause for concern of this nature than what was inseparable from so long a voyage and the sea into which roswell had gone she well knew that the time was arrived when he was expected to be on his way home and as hope is an active and beguiling feeling she already fancied him to be much advanced on his return but a dialogue which took place that very daynay that very hourbetween her and the deacon will best explain her views and opinions and expectations  its very extrornary mary commenced the uncle that garner doesnt write if he only knowd how a man feels when his property is ten thousand miles off im sartain he would write and not leave me with so many misgivings in the matter  by whom is he to write uncle answered the more considerate and reasonable niece there are no postoffices in the antarctic seas nor any travellers to bring letters by private hands  but he did write once and plaguy good news was it that he sent us in that letter  he did write from rio for there he had the means by my calculations roswell has left his sealing ground some three or four weeks and must now be as many thou sand miles on his way home  dye think so galdye think so exclaimed the deacon his eyes fairly twinkling with pleasure that would be good news and if he doesnt stop too long by the way we might look for him home in less than ninety days from this moment  mary smiled pensively and a richer colour stole into her cheeks slowly but distinctly  i do not think uncle that roswell gardiner will be very likely to stop on his way to us here on oyster pond was the answer she made  i should be sorry to think that the best part of his vyge may be made in the west ingees and i hope he is not a man to overlook his instructions  will roswell be obliged to stop in the west indies uncle  sartainif he obeys his orders and i think the young man will do that but the business there will not detain him longmarys countenance brightened again at this remarkand should you be right we may still look for him in the next ninety days  mary remained silent for a short time but her charming face was illuminated by an expression of heartfelt happiness which however the next remark of her uncles had an obvious tendency to disturb  should garner come home successful mary inquired the deacon successful in all thingssuccessful in sealing and successful in that other matterthe west ingee business i meanbut successful in all as i daily pray he may bei want to know if you would then have him always supposing that he got back himself unchanged  unchanged i shall never be his wife answered mary tremulously but firmly  the deacon looked at her in surprise for he had never comprehended but one reason why the orphan and penniless mary should refuse so pertinaciously to become the wife of roswell gardiner and that was his own want of means now the deacon loved mary more than he was aware of himself but he had never actually made up his mind to leave her the heiress of his estate the idea of parting with property at all was too painful for him to think of making a will and without such an instrument there were others who would have come in for a part of the assets share and share alike as the legal men express it of all this was the deacon fully aware and it occasionally troubled him more of late than formerly since he felt in his system the unerring signs of decay once had he got so far as to write on a page of foolscap in the name of god amen but the effort proved too great for him and he abandoned the undertaking still deacon pratt loved his niece and was well inclined to see her become the wife of young garner more especially should the last return successful  unchanged repeated the uncle slowly you sartainly would not wish to marry him mary if he was changed  i do not mean changed in the sense you are thinking of uncle but we will not talk of this now why should roswell stop in the west indies at all it is not usual for our vessels to stop there  no it is not if garner stop at all it will be on a very unusual business and one that may make all our fortunesyourn as well as hisn and mine mary  i hope that sealers never meddle with the transportation of slaves uncle the girl exclaimed with a face filled with apprehension i would rather live and die poor than have anything to do with them  i see no such great harm in the trade gal but such is not roswells arnd in the west ingees its a great secret the reason of his call there and i will venture to foretell that should he make it and should it turn out successful you will marry him gal  mary made no reply well was she assured that roswell had an advocate in her own heart that was pleading for him night and day but firm was her determination not to unite herself with one however dear to her who set up his feeble understanding of the nature of the mediation between god and man in opposition to the plainest language of revelation as well as to the prevalent belief of the church since the ages that immediately succeeded the christian era     chapter xix      poor child of danger nursling of the storm   sad are the woes that wreck thy manly form   rocks waves and winds the shatterd bark delay   thy heart is sad thy home is far away    campbell   it was about midday when the two sea lions opened their canvass at the same moment and prepared to quit sealers land all hands were on board every article was shipped for which there was room and nothing remained that denoted the former presence of man on that dreary island but the deserted house and three or four piles of cordwood that had grown on shelter island and marthas vineyard and which was now abandoned on the rocks of the antarctic circle as the topsails were sheeted home and the heavy foreandaft mainsails were hoisted the songs of the men sounded cheerful and animating home was in every tone each movement all the orders daggett was on deck in full command though still careful of his limb while roswell appeared to be everywhere mary pratt was before his minds eye all that morning nor did he even once think how pleasant it would be to meet her uncle with a there deacon is your schooner with a good cargo of elephantoil well chucked off with furseal skins  the oyster pond craft was the first clear of the ground the breeze was little felt in that cove where usually it did not seem to blow at all but there was wind enough to serve to cast the schooner and she went slowly out of the rocky basin under her mainsail foretopsail and jib the wind was at southwestthe norwester of that hemisphereand it was fresh and howling enough on the other side of the island after roswell had made a stretch out into the bay of about a mile he laid his foretopsail flat aback hauled over his jibsheet and put his helm hard down in waiting for the other schooner to come out and join him in a quarter of an hour daggett got within hail  well called out the last you see i was right garner wind enough out here and more still further from the land we have only to push in among them bergs while it is light pick out a clear spot and heaveto during the night it will hardly do for us to travel among so much ice in the dark  i wish we had got out earlier that we might have made a run of it by daylight answered roswell ten hours of such a wind in my judgment would carry us well towards clear water  the delay could not be helped i had so many traps ashore it took time to gather them together come fill away and let us be moving now we are under way im in as great haste as you are yourself  roswell complied and away the two schooners went keeping quite near to each other having smooth water and still something of a moderated gale in consequence of the proximity and weatherly position of the island the course was towards a spot to leeward where the largest opening appeared in the ice and where it was hoped a passage to the northward would be found the further the two vessels got from the land the more they felt the power of the wind and the greater was their rate of running daggett soon found that he could spare his consort a good deal of canvass a consequence of his not being full and he took in his topsail though running nearly before the wind his spar would have stood even a more severe strain  as the oldest mariner it had been agreed between the two masters that daggett should lead the way this he did for an hour when both vessels were fairly out of the great bay clear of the group altogether and running off northeasterly at a rate of nearly ten knots in the hour the sea got up as they receded from the land and everything indicated a gale though one of no great violence night was approaching and an alpinelike range of icebergs was glowing to the northward under the oblique rays of the setting sun for a considerable space around the vessels the water was clear not even a cake of any sort being to be seen and the question arose in daggetts mind whether he ought to stand on or to heaveto and pass the night well to windward of the bergs time was precious the wind was fair the heavens clear and the moon would make its appearance about nine and might be expected to remain above the horizon until the return of day this was one side of the picture the other presented less agreeable points the climate was so fickle that the clearness of the skies was not to be depended on especially with a strong southwest winda little gale in fact and a change in this particular might be produced at any moment then it was certain that floes and fragments of bergs would be found near if not absolutely among the sublime mountainlike piles that were floating about in a species of grand fleet some twenty miles to leeward both of our masters indeed all on board of each schooner very well understood that the magnificent array of icy islands which lay before them was owing to the currents for which it is not always easy to account the clear space was to be attributed to the same cause though there was little doubt that the wind which had now been to the southward fully eightandforty hours had contributed to drive the icy fleet to the northward as a consequence of these facts the fieldice must be in the vicinity of the bergs and the embarrassment from that source was known always to be very great  it required a good deal of nerve for a mariner to run in among dangers of the character just described as the sun was setting nevertheless daggett did it and roswell gardiner followed the movement at the distance of about a cables length to prevent separation each schooner showed a light at the lower yardarm just as the day was giving out its last glimmerings as yet however no difficulty was encountered the alpinelooking range being yet quite two hours run still to leeward those two hours must be passed in darkness and daggett shortened sail in order not to reach the ice before the moon rose he had endeavoured to profit by the light as long as it remained to find a place at which he might venture to enter among the bergs but had met with no great success the opening first seen now appeared to be closed either by means of the drift or by means of the change in the position of the vessels and he no longer thought of that fortune must be trusted to in some measure and on he went roswell always closely following  the early hours of that eventful night were intensely dark nevertheless daggett stood down towards the icy range using no other precautions than shortening sail and keeping a sharp lookout every five minutes the call from the quarterdeck of each schooner to keep a bright lookout was heard unless indeed daggett or roswell was on his own forecastle thus occupied in person no one on board of either vessel thought of sleep the watch had been called as is usual at sea and one half of the crew was at liberty to go below and turn in what was more those small foreandaft rigged craft were readily enough handled by a single watch and this so much the more easily now that their topsails were in still not a man left the deck anxiety was too prevalent for this the least experienced hand in either crew being well aware that the next fourandtwenty hours would in all human probability be decisive of the fate of the voyage  both daggett and gardiner grew more and more uneasy as the time for the moon to rise drew near without the orb of night making its appearance a few clouds were driving athwart the heavens though the stars twinkled as usual in their diminutive but sublime splendour it was not so dark that objects could not be seen at a considerable distance and the people of the schooners had no difficulty in very distinctly tracing and that not very far ahead the broken outlines of the chain of floating mountains no alpine pile in very fact could present a more regular or better defined range and in some respects more fantastic outlines when the bergs first break away from their native moorings their forms are ordinarily somewhat regular the summits commonly resembling tableland this regularity of shape however is soon lost under the rays of the summer sun the wash of the ocean and most of all by the wear of the torrents that gush out of their own frozen bosoms a distinguished navigator of our own time has compared the appearance of these bergs after their regularity of shape is lost and they begin to assume the fantastic outlines that uniformly succeed to that of a deserted town built of the purest alabaster with its edifices crumbling under the seasons and its countless unpeopled streets avenues and alleys all who have seen the sight unite in describing it as one of the most remarkable that comes from the lavish hand of nature  about nine oclock on the memorable night in question there was a good deal of fog driving over the ocean to increase the obscurity this rendered daggett doubly cautious and he actually hauled up close to the wind heading off well to the westward in order to avoid running in among the bergs in greater uncertainty than the circumstances would seem to require of course roswell followed the movement and when the moon first diffused its mild rays on the extraordinary scene the two schooners were pitching into a heavy sea within less than a mile of the weatherline of the range of bergs it was soon apparent that floes or field ice accompanied the floating mountains and extended so far to the southward of them as to be already within an inconvenient if not hazardous proximity to the two vessels these floes however unlike those previously encountered were much broken by the undulations of the waves and seldom exceeded a quarter of a mile in diameter while thousands of them were no larger than the ordinary drift ice of our own principal rivers in the time of a freshet their vicinity to the track of the schooners indeed was first ascertained by the noise they produced in grinding against each other which soon made itself audible even above the roaring of the gale  both of our masters now began to be exceedingly uncomfortable it was soon quite apparent that daggett had been too bold and had led down towards the ice without sufficient caution and foresight as the moon rose higher and higher the difficulties and dangers to leeward became at each minute more and more apparent nothing could have been more magnificent than the scene which lay before the eyes of the mariners or would have produced a deeper feeling of delight had it not been for the lively consciousness of the risk the two schooners and all who were in them unavoidably ran by being so near and to windward of such an icy coast if one may use the expression as relates to floating bodies by that light it was very easy to imagine wilkes picture of a ruined town of alabaster there were arches of all sizes and orders pinnacles without number towers and even statues and columns to these were to be added long lines of perpendicular walls that it was easy enough to liken to fortresses dungeons and temples in a word even the alps with all their peculiar grandeur and certainly on a scale so vastly more enlarged possess no one aspect that is so remarkable for its resemblance to the labours of man composed of a material of the most beautiful transparency and considered as the results of human ingenuity on a scale so gigantic the glaciers have often been likened and not unjustly to a frozen sea but here were congealed mountains seemingly hewed into all the forms of art not by the chisel it is true but by the action of the unerring laws which produced them  perhaps roswell gardiner was the only individual in those two vessels that night who was fully alive to all the extraordinary magnificence of its unusual pictures stephen may in some degree have been an exception to the rule though he saw the hand of god in nearly all things its wonderful to look at captain garner isnt it said this worthy seaman about the time the light of the moon began to tell on the view wonderful truly did we not know who made it all these few and simple words had a cheering influence on roswell and served to increase his confidence in eventual success god did produce all things either directly or indirectly this even his sceptical notions could allow and that which came from divine wisdom must be intended for good he would take courage and for once in his life trust to providence the most resolute man by nature feels his courage augmented by such a resolution  the gales of the antarctic sea are said to be short though violent they seldom last sixandthirty hours and for about a third of that time they blow with their greatest violence as a matter of course the danger amid the ice is much increased by a tempest though a good working breeze or small gale of wind perhaps adds to a vessels security by rendering it easier to handle her and to avoid floes and bergs if the ice is sufficient to make a lee smooth water is sometimes a consequence though it oftener happens that the turbulence produced in clear water is partially communicated over a vast surface causing the fields and mountains to grind against each other under the resistless power of the waves on the present occasion however the schooners were still in open water where the wind had a long and unobstructed rake and a sea had got up that caused both of the little craft to bury nearly to their gunwales what rendered their situation still more unpleasant was the fact that all the water which came aboard of them now soon froze to this however the men were accustomed it frequently happening that the moisture deposited on their rigging and spars by the fogs froze during the nights of the autumn indeed it has been thought by some speculators on the subject that the bergs themselves are formed in part by a similar process though snows undoubtedly are the principal element in their composition this it is which gives the berg its stratified appearance no geological formation being more apparent or regular in this particular than most of these floating mountains  about ten the moon was well above the horizon the fog had been precipitated in dew upon the ice where it congealed and helped to arrest the progress of dissolution while the ocean became luminous for the hour and objects comparatively distinct then it was that the seamen first got a clear insight into the awkwardness of their situation the bold are apt to be reckless in the dark but when danger is visible their movements become more wary and better calculated than those of the timid when daggett got this first good look at the enormous masses of the fieldice that stirred by the unquiet ocean were grinding each other and raising an unceasing rushing sound like that the surf produces on a beach though far louder and with a harshness in it that denoted the collision of substances harder than water he almost instinctively ordered every sheet to be flattened down and the schooners head brought as near the wind as her construction permitted roswell observed the change in his consorts line of sailing slight as it was and imitated the manoeuvre the sea was too heavy to dream of tacking and there was not room to ware so close indeed were some of the cakes those that might be called the stragglers of the grand array that repeatedly each vessel brushed along so near them as actually to receive slight shocks from collisions with projecting portions it was obvious that the vessels were setting down upon the ice and that daggett did not haul his wind a moment too soon  the halfhour that succeeded was one of engrossing interest it settled the point whether the schooners could or could not eat their way into the wind sufficiently to weather the danger fragment after fragment was passed blow after blow was received until suddenly the fieldice appeared directly in front it was in vast quantities extending to the southward far as the eye could reach there remained no alternative but to attempt to ware without waiting longer than to assure himself of the facts daggett ordered his helm put up and the main gaff lowered at that moment both the schooners were under their jibs and foresails each without its bonnet and doublereefed mainsails this was not canvass very favourable for waring there being too much aftersail but the sheets were attended to and both vessels were soon driving dead to leeward amid the foam of a large wave the next instant ice was heard grinding along their sides  it was not possible to haul up on the other tack ere the schooners would be surrounded by the floes and seeing a comparatively open passage a short distance ahead daggett stood in boldly followed closely by roswell in ten minutes they were fully a mile within the field rendering all attempts to get out of it to windward so hopeless as to be almost desperate the manoeuvre of daggett was begun under circumstances that scarcely admitted of any alternative though it might be questioned if it were not the best expedient that offered now that the schooners were so far within the fieldice the water was much less broken though the undulations of the restless ocean were still considerable and the grinding of ice occasioned by them was really terrific so loud was the noise produced by these constant and violent collisions indeed that the roaring of the wind was barely audible and that only at intervals the sound was rushing like that of an incessant avalanche attended by cracking noises that resembled the rending of a glacier  the schooners now took in their foresails for the double purpose of diminishing their velocity and of being in a better condition to change their course in order to avoid dangers ahead these changes of course were necessarily frequent but by dint of boldness perseverance and skill daggett worked his way into the comparatively open passage already mentioned it was a sort of river amid the floes caused doubtless by some of the inexplicable currents and was fully a quarter of a mile in width straight as an airline and of considerable length though how long could not be seen by moonlight it led moreover directly down towards the bergs then distant less than a mile without stopping to ascertain more daggett stood on roswell keeping close on his quarter in ten minutes they drew quite near to that wild and magnificent ruined city of alabaster that was floating about in the antarctic sea  notwithstanding the imminent peril that now most seriously menaced the two schooners it was not possible to approach that scene of natural grandeur without feelings of awe that were allied quite as much to admiration as to dread apprehension certainly weighed on every heart but curiosity wonder even delight were all mingled in the breasts of the crews as the vessels came driving down into the midst of the bergs everything contributed to render the movements imposing in all senses appalling in one there lay the vast maze of floating mountains generally of a spectral white at that hour though many of the masses emitted hues more pleasing while some were black as night the passages between the bergs or what might be termed the streets and lanes of this mysteriouslooking fantastical yet sublime city of the ocean were numerous and of every variety some were broad straight avenues a league in length others winding and narrow while a good many were little more than fissures that might be fancied lanes  the schooners had not run a league within the bergs before they felt much less of the power of the gale and the heaving and setting of the seas were sensibly diminished what was perhaps not to be expected the fieldice had disappeared entirely within the passages of the bergs and the only difficulty in navigating was to keep in such channels as had outlets and which did not appear to be closing the rate of sailing of the two schooners was now greatly lessened the mountains usually intercepting the wind though it was occasionally heard howling and scuffling in the ravines as if in a hurry to escape and pass on to the more open seas the grinding of the ice too came down in the currents of air furnishing fearful evidence of dangers that were not yet distant as the water was now sufficiently smooth and the wind except at the mouths of particular ravines was light there was nothing to prevent the schooners from approaching each other this was done and the two masters held a discourse together on the subject of their present situation  youre a bold fellow daggett and one i should not like to follow in a voyage round the world commenced roswell here we are in the midst of some hundreds of icebergs a glorious sight to behold i must confessbut are we ever to get out again  it is much better to be here garner returned the other than to be among the floes im always afraid of my starn and my rudder when among the fieldice whereas there is no danger hereabouts that cannot be seen before a vessel is on it give me my eyes and i feel that i have a chance  there is some truth in that but i wish these channels were a good deal wider than they are a man may feel a berg as well as see it were two of these fellows to take it into their heads to close upon us our little craft would be crushed like nuts in the crackers  we must keep a good lookout for that here seems to be a long bit of open passage ahead of us and it leads as near north as we can wish to run if we can only get to the other end of it i shall feel as if half our passage back to ameriky was made  the citizen of the united states calls his country america par excellence never using the addition of north as is practised by most european people daggett meant home therefore by his ameriky in which he saw no other than the east end of long island gardiners island and marthas vineyard roswell understood him of course so no breath was lost  in my judgment returned gardiner we shall not get clear of this ice for a thousand miles not that i expect to be in a wilderness of it as we are tonight but after such a summer you may rely on it daggett that the ice will get as far north as 45° if not a few degrees further  it is possible i have seen it in 42° myself and in 40° to the norard of the equator if it get as far as 50° however in this part of the world it will do pretty well that will be play to what we have just herein the name of divine providence what is that garner  not a voice was heard in either vessel scarcely a breath was drawn a heavy groaning sound had been instantly succeeded by such a plunge into the water as might be imagined to succeed the fall of a fragment from another planet then all the bergs near by began to rock as if agitated by an earthquake this part of the picture was both grand and frightful many of those masses rose above the sea more than two hundred feet perpendicularly and showed walllike surfaces of half a league in length at the point where the schooners happened to be just at that moment the iceislands were not so large but quite as high and consequently were more easily agitated while the whole panorama was bowing and rocking pinnacles arches walls and all seeming about to totter from their bases there came a wave sweeping down the passage that lifted them high in the air some fifty feet at least and bore them along like pieces of cork fully a hundred yards other waves succeeded though of less height and force when gradually the water regained its former and more natural movement and subsided  this has been an earthquake exclaimed daggett that volcano has been pent up and the gas is stirring up the rocks beneath the sea  no sir answered stimson from the forecastle of his own schooner its not that captain daggett one of them bergs has turned over like a whale wallowing and it has set all the others arocking  this was the true explanation one that did not occur to the less experienced sealers it is a danger however of no rare occurrence in the ice and one that ever needs to be looked to the bergs when they first break loose from their native moorings which is done by the agency of frosts as well as by the action of the seasons in the warm months are usually tabular and of regular outlines but this shape is soon lost by the action of the waves on ice of very different degrees of consistency some being composed of frozen snow some of the moisture precipitated from the atmosphere in the shape of fogs and some of pure frozen water the first melts soonest and a berg that drifts for any length of time with one particular face exposed to the suns rays soon loses its equilibrium and is canted with an inclination to the horizon finally the centre of gravity gets outside of the base when the still monstrous mass rolls over in the ocean coming literally bottom upwards there are all degrees and varieties of these iceslips if one may so term them and they bring in their train the many different commotions that such accidents would naturally produce that which had just alarmed and astonished our navigators was of the following character a mass of ice that was about a quarter of a mile in length and of fully half that breadth which floated quite two hundred feet above the surface of the water and twice that thickness beneath it was the cause of the disturbance it had preserved its outlines unusually well and stood upright to the last moment though owing to numerous strata of snowice its base had melted much more on one of its sides than on the other when the precise moment arrived that would have carried a perpendicular line from the centre of gravity without this base the monster turned leisurely in its lair producing some such effect as would have been wrought by the falling of a portion of a swiss mountain into a lake a sort of accident of which there have been many and remarkable instances  stimsons explanation while it raised the curtain from all that was mysterious did not serve very much to quiet apprehensions if one berg had performed such an evolution it was reasonable to suppose that others might do the same thing and the commotion made by this which was at a distance gave some insight into what might be expected from a similar change in another nearer by both daggett and gardiner were of opinion that the fall of a berg of equal size within a cables length of the schooners might seriously endanger the vessels by dashing them against some wall of ice if in no other manner it was too late however to retreat and the vessels stood on gallantly  the passage between the bergs now became quite straight reasonably broad and was so situated as regarded the gale as to receive a full current of its force it was computed that the schooners ran quite three marine leagues in the hour that succeeded the overturning of the berg there were moments when the wind blew furiously and taking all the accessories of that remarkable view into the account the scene resembled one that the imagination might present to the mind in its highest flights but which few could ever hope to see with their proper eyes the moonlight the crowd of icebergs of all shapes and dimensions seeming to flit past by the rapid movements of the vessels the variety of hues from spectral white to tints of orange and emerald pale at that hour yet distinct streets and lanes that were scarce opened ere they were passed together with all the fantastic images that such objects conjured to the thoughts contributed to make that hour much the most wonderful that roswell gardiner had ever passed to add to the excitement a couple of whales came blowing up the passage coming within a hundred yards of the schooners they were finbacks which are rarely if ever taken and were suffered to pass unharmed to capture a whale however amid so many bergs would be next to impossible unless the animal were killed by the blow of the harpoon without requiring the keener thrust of the lance  at the end of the hour mentioned the sea lion of the vineyard rapidly changed her course hauling up by a sudden movement to the westward the passage before her was closed and there remained but one visible outlet towards which the schooner slowly made her way having got rather too much to leeward of it in consequence of not earlier seeing the necessity for the change of course in that dim and deceptive light roswell being to windward had less difficulty but notwithstanding he kept his station on his consorts quarter declining to lead the passage into which daggett barely succeeded in carrying his schooner was fearfully narrow and appeared to be fast closing though it was much wider further ahead could the schooners but get through the first dangerous strait roswell remonstrated ere the leading vessel entered and pointed out to daggett the fact that the bergs were evidently closing each instant increasing their movement most probably through the force of attraction it is known that ships are thus brought in contact in calms and it is thought a similar influence is exercised on the icebergs at all events the wind the current or attraction was fast closing the passage through which the schooners had now to go  scarcely was daggett within the channel when an enormous mass fell from the summit of one of the bergs literally closing the passage in his wake while it compelled gardiner to put his helm down and to tack ship standing off from the tottering berg the scene that followed was frightful the cries on board the leading craft denoted her peril but it was not possible for roswell to penetrate to her with his vessel all he could do was to heaveto his own schooner lower a boat and pull back towards the point of danger this he did at once manfully but with an anxious mind and throbbing heart he actually urged his boat into the chasm beneath an arch in the fallen fragment and made his way to the very side of daggetts vessel the last was nipped again and that badly but was not absolutely lost the falling fragment from the berg alone prevented her and all in her from being ground into powder this block of enormous size kept the two bergs asunder and now that they could not absolutely come together they began slowly to turn in the current gradually opening and separating at the very point where they had so lately seemed attracted to a closer union in an hour the way was clear and the boats towed the schooner stern foremost into the broader passage     chapter xx      a voice upon the prairies     a cry of womans woe   that mingleth with the autumn blast     all fitfully and low    mrs sigourney   the accident to the sea lion of the vineyard occurred very near the close of the month of march which in the southern hemisphere corresponds to our month of september this was somewhat late for a vessel to remain in so high a latitude though it was not absolutely dangerous to be found there several weeks longer we have given a glance at mary pratt and her uncle about this time but it has now become expedient to carry the reader forward for a considerable period and take another look at our heroine and her miserly uncle some seven months later in that interval a great change had come over the deacon and his niece and hope had nearly deserted all those who had friends on board the sea lion of oyster pond as the following explanation will show was reasonable and to be expected  when captain gardiner sailed it was understood that his absence would not extend beyond a single season all who had friends and connections on board his schooner had been assured of this and great was the anxiety and deep the disappointment when the first of our own summer months failed to bring back the adventurers as week succeeded week and the vessel did not return the concern increased until hope began to be lost in apprehension deacon pratt groaned in spirit over his loss finding little consolation in the gains secured by means of the oil sent home as is apt to be the case with the avaricious when their hearts are once set on gain as for mary the load on her heart increased in weight as it might be day by day until those smiles which had caused her sweet countenance to be radiant with innocent joy entirely disappeared and she was seen to smile no more still complaints never passed her lips she prayed much and found all her relief in such pursuits as comported with her feelings but she seldom spoke of her grief never except at weak moments when her querulous kinsman introduced the subject in his frequent lamentations over his losses  the month of november is apt to be stormy on the atlantic coasts of the republic it is true that the heaviest gales do not then occur but the weather is generally stern and wintry and the winds are apt to be high and boisterous at a place like oyster pond the gales from the ocean are felt with almost as much power as on board a vessel at sea and mary became keenly sensible of the change from the bland breezes of summer to the sterner blasts of autumn as for the deacon his health was actually giving way before anxiety until the result was getting to be a matter of doubt premature old age appeared to have settled on him and his niece had privately consulted dr sage on his case the excellent girl was grieved to find that the mind of her uncle grew more worldly his desires for wealth more grasping as he was losing his hold on life and was approaching nearer to that hour when time is succeeded by eternity all this while however deacon pratt kept about as he expressed it himself and struggled to look after his interests as had been his practice through life he collected his debts foreclosed his mortgages when necessary drove tight bargains for his wood and other saleable articles and neglected nothing that he thought would tend to increase his gains still his heart was with his schooner for he had expected much from that adventure and the disappointment was in proportion to the former hopes  one day near the close of november the deacon and his niece were alone together in the keepingroomas it was if it be not still the custom among persons of new england origin to call the ordinary sittingapartmenthe bolstered up in an easychair on account of increasing infirmities and she plying the needle in her customary way the chairs of both were so placed that it was easy for either to look out upon that bay now of a wintry aspect where roswell had last anchored previously to sailing  what a pleasant sight it would be uncle mary almost unconsciously to herself remarked as with tearful eyes she sat gazing intently on the water could we only awake and find the sea lion at anchor under the point of gardiners island i often fancy that such may benay must be the case yet but it never comes to pass i would not tell you yesterday for you did not seem to be as well as common but i have got an answer by baiting joe to my letter sent across to the vineyard  the deacon started and halfturned his body towards his niece on whose face his own sunken eyes were now fastened with almost ferocious interest it was the love of mammon stirring within him the lingering remains of covetousness he thought of his property while mary thought of those whose lives had been endangered if not lost by the unhappy adventure the latter understood the look however so far as to answer its inquiry in her usual gentle feminine voice  i am sorry to say sir that no news has been heard from captain daggett or any of his people was the sad reply to this silent interrogatory no one on the island has heard a word from the vineyard vessel since the day before she sailed from rio there is the same uneasiness felt among captain daggetts friends as we feel for poor roswell they think however that the two vessels have kept together and believe that the same fate has befallen both  heaven forbid exclaimed the deacon as sharply as wasting lungs would allowheaven forbid if garner his let that daggett keep in his company an hour longer than was necessary he has deserved to meet with shipwreck though the loss always falls heaviest on the owners  surely uncle it is more cheering to think that the two schooners are together in those dangerous seas than to imagine one alone left to meet the risks without a companion  you talk idly galas women always talk if you knowd all you wouldnt think of such a thing  so you have said often uncle and i fear there is some mystery preying all this time on your spirits why not relieve your mind by telling your troubles to me i am your child in affection if not by birth  youre a good gal mary answered the deacon a good deal softened by the plaintive tones of one of the gentlest voices that ever fell on human ear an excellent creatur at the bottombut of course you know nothing of the sealing business and next to nothing about taking care of property  i hope you do not think me wasteful sir that is a character i should not like to possess  no not wasteful on the contrary curful so the deacon pronounced the word and considerate enough as to keeping but awfully indifferent as to getting had i been as indifferent as you are yourself your futur days would not be so comfortable and happy as they are now likely to be ater my departureif depart i must  my future life happy and comfortable thought mary then she struggled to be satisfied with her lot and contented with the decrees of providence it is but a few hours that we live in this state of trials compared to the endless existence that is to succeed it  i wish i knew all about this voyage of roswells she added aloud for she was perfectly certain that there was something to be told that as yet the deacon had concealed from her it might relieve your mind and lighten your spirits of a burthen to make me a confidant  the deacon mused in silence for more than five minutes seldom had his thoughts gone over so wide a reach of interests and events in so short a space of time but the conclusion was clear and decided  you ought to know all mary and you shall know all he answered in the manner of a man who had made up his mind beyond appeal garner has gone ater seal to some islands that the daggett who died here about a year and a half ago told me of islands of which nobody knowd anything according to his account but himself his shipmates that saw the place when he saw it were all dead afore he let me into the secret  i have long suspected something of the sort sir and have also supposed that the people on marthas vineyard had got some news of this place by the manner in which captain daggett has acted  isnt it wonderful gal islands they tell me where a schooner can fill up with ile and skins in the shortest season in which the sun ever shone upon an antarctic summer wonderful wonderful  very extraordinary perhaps but we should remember uncle at how much risk the young men of the country go on these distant voyages and how dearly their profits are sometimes bought  bought if the schooner would only come back i should think nothing of all that its the cost of the vessel and outfit mary that weighs so much on my spirits well garners first business is with them islands which are at an awful distance for one to trust his property but nothing ventured nothing got they say by my calculations the schooner has had to go a good five hundred miles among the ice to get to the spot not such ice as a body falls in with in going and coming between england and ameriky as we read of in the papers but ice that covers the sea as we sometimes see it piled up in garners bay only a hundred times higher and deeper and broader and colder its desperate cold ice the sealers all tell me that of the antarctic seas some on em think its colder down south than it is the other way up towards greenland and iceland itself its extrornary mary that the weather should grow cold as a body journeys south but so it is by all accounts i never could understand it and it isnt so in ameriky im sartain i suppose it must come of their turning the months round and having their winter in the midst of the dogdays i never could understand it though garner has tried more than once to reason me into it i believe but i dont understand  it is all told in my geography here answered mary mechanically taking down the book for her thoughts were far away in those icy seas that her uncle had been so graphically describing i dare say we can find it all explained in the elementary parts of this book  they do make their geographies useful nowadays said the deacon with rather more animation than he had shown before that morning theyve got em to be now almost as useful as almanacs read what it says about the seasons child  it says sir that the changes in the seasons are owing to the inclination of the earths axis to the plane of its orbit i do not exactly understand what that means uncle  noits not as clear as it might bethe declination  inclination sir is what is printed here  ay inclination i do not see why any one should have much inclination for winter but so it must be i suppose the earths orbit has an inclination towards changes you say  the changes in the seasons sir are owing to the inclination of the earths axis to the plane of its orbit it does not say that the orbit has an inclination in any particular way  thus was it with mary pratt and thus was it with her uncle the deacon one of the plainest problems in natural philosophy was hebrew to both simply because the capacity that providence had so freely bestowed on each had never been turned to the consideration of such useful studies but while the mind of mary pratt was thus obscured on this simple and to such as choose to give it an hour of reflection perfectly intelligible proposition it was radiant as the day on another mystery and one that has confounded thousands of the learned as well as of the unlearned to her intellect nothing was clearer no moral truth more vivid no physical fact more certain than the incarnation of the son of god she had the evidence of things not seen in the fulness of divine grace and was profound on this the greatest concern of human life while unable even to comprehend how the inclination of the earths axis to the plane of its orbit could be the cause of the change of the seasons and was it thus with her unclehe who was a pillar of the meeting whose name was often in mens mouths as a shining light and who had got to be identified with religion in his own neighbourhood to a degree that caused most persons to think of deacon pratt when they should be thinking of the saviour we are afraid he knew as little of one of these propositions as of the other  its very extrornary resumed the deacon after ruminating on the matter for a few moments but i suppose it is so wasnt it for this inclination to cold weather our vessels might go and seal under as pleasant skies as we have here in june but mary i suppose that wasnt to be or it would be  there would have been no seals most likely uncle if there was no ice they tell me that such creatures love the cold and the ice and the frozen oceans too much warm weather would not suit them  but mary it might suit other folks garners whole arnd isnt among the ice or ater them seals  i do not know that i understand you sir surely roswell has gone on a sealing voyage  sartain theres no mistake about that but there may be many stoppingplaces in so long a road  do you mean sir that he is to use any of these stoppingplaces as you call them asked mary eagerly halfbreathless with her anxiety to hear all you said something about the west indies once  harkee maryjust look out into the entry and see if the kitchen door is shut and now come nearer to me child so that there may be no need of bawling what ive got to say all over oyster pond there sit down my dear and dont look so eager as if you wanted to eat me or my mind may misgive me and then i couldnt tell you ater all perhaps it would be best if i was to keep my own secret  not if it has anything to do with roswell dear uncle not if it has anything to do with him you have often advised me to marry him and i ought to know all about the man you wish me to marry  yes garner will make a right good husband for any young woman and i do advise you to have him you are my brothers daghter mary and i give you this advice which i should give you all the same had you been my own child instead of hisn  yes sir i know thatbut what about roswell and his having to stop on his way home  why you must know mary that this vyge came altogether out of that seaman who died among us last year i was kind to him as you may remember and helped him to many little odd comfortsodd enough were they of a verityand he was grateful of all virtues give me gratitude say i it is the noblest as it is the most oncommon of all our good qualities how little have i met with in my day of all the presents i have made and gifts bestowed and good acts done not one in ten has ever met with any gratitude  mary sighed for well did she know how little he had given of his abundance to relieve the wants of his fellowcreatures she sighed too with a sort of mild impatience that the information she sought with so much eagerness was so long and needlessly delayed but the deacon had made up his mind to tell her all  yes garner has got something to do beside sealing he resumed of himself when his regret at the prevalence of ingratitude among men had exhausted itself suthinfor this was the way he pronounced that wordthat is of more importance than the schooners hold full of ile ile is ile i know child but gold is gold what do you think of that  is roswell then to stop at rio again in order to sell his oil and send the receipts home in gold  better than thatmuch better than that if he gets back at all mary felt a chill at her heart yes that is the pintif he gets back at all if garner ever does come home child i shall expect to see him return with a considerable sized kegalmost a barrel by all accountsfilled with gold  the deacon stared about him as he made this announcement like a man who was afraid that he was telling too much nevertheless it was to his own niece his brothers daughter that he had confided thus much of his great secretand reflection reassured him  how is roswell to get all this gold uncle unless he sells his cargo mary asked with obvious solicitude  thats another pint ill tell you all about it gal and youll see the importance of keeping the secret this daggettnot the one who is out in another schooner another sea lion as it might be but his uncle who died down here at the widow whiteswell that daggett told more than the latitude and longitude of the sealing islandshe told me of a buried treasure  buried treasureburied by whom and consisting of what uncle  buried by seamen who make free with the goods of others on the high seas agin the time when they might come back and dig it up and carry it away to be used consisting of what indeed consisting principally accordin to daggetts account of heavy doubloons though there was a lot of old english guineas among em yes i remember that he spoke of them guineasthree thousand and odd and nearly as many doubloons  was daggett then a pirate sirfor they who make free with the goods of others on the high seas are neither more nor less than pirates  no not he himself he got this secret from one who was a pirate however and who was a prisoner in a gaol where he was himself confined for smuggling yes that man told him all about the buried treasure in return for some acts of kindness shown him by daggett its well to be kind sometimes mary  it is well to be kind always sir even when it is misunderstood and the kindness is abused what was the redemption but kindness and love and godlike compassion on those who neither understood it nor felt it but money collected and buried by pirates can never become yours uncle nor can it ever become the property of roswell gardiner  whose is it then gal demanded the deacon sharply garner had some such silly notion in his head when i first told him of this treasure but i soon brought him to hear reason  i think roswell must always have seen that a treasure obtained by robbery can never justly belong to any but its rightful owner  and who is this rightful owner pray or owners i might say for the gold was picked up here and there out of all question from many hands now supposing garner gets this treasure as i still hope he may though he is an awful time about itbut suppose he gets it how is he to find the rightful owners there it is a bag of doubloons sayall looking just alike with the head of a king a don somebody and the date and the latin and greeknow who can say that this is my doubloon i lost it at such a timeit was taken from me by such a pirate in such sea and i was whipped till i told the thieves where i had hid the gold no no mary depend on t no action of plevy would lie agin a single one of all them pieces they are lost one and all to their former owners and will belong to the man that succeeds in getting hold on em agin who will become a rightful owner in his turn all property comes from law and if the law wont plevy money got in this way nobody can maintain a claim to it  i should be very very sorry my dear uncle to have roswell enrich himself in this way  you talk like a silly young woman and one that doesnt know her own rights we had no hand in robbing the folks of their gold they lost it years ago and may be deadprobably are or they would make some stir about itor have forgotten it and couldnt for their lives tell a single one of the coins they once had in their possession and dont know whether what they lost was thrown into the sea or buried in the sand on a keymary child you must never mention anything i tell you on this subject  you need fear nothing sir from me but i do most earnestly hope roswell will have nothing to do with any such illgotten wealth he is too noblehearted and generous to get rich in this way  well well say no more about it child youre romantic and notional just pour out my drops for all this talking makes me breathe thick im not what i was mary and cannot last long but was it the last breath i drew i would stand to it that treasure desarted and found in this way belongs to the last holder i go by the law however let garner only find itwell well ill say no more about it now for it distresses you and that i dont like to see go and hunt up the spectator child and look for the whaling newsperhaps there may be suthin about the sealers too  mary did not require to be told twice to do as her uncle requested the paper was soon found and the column that contained the marine intelligence consulted the niece read a long account of whalers spoken with so many hundred or so many thousand barrels of oil on board but could discover no allusion to any sealer at length she turned her eyes into the body of the journal which being semiweekly or triweekly was crowded with matter and started at seeing a paragraph to the following effect  by the arrival of the twin sisters at stonington we learn that the ice has been found farther north in the southern hemisphere this season than it has been known to be for many years the sealers have had a great deal of difficulty in making their way through it and even vessels bound round the cape of good hope have been much embarrassed by its presence  thats ityes mary thats just it exclaimed the deacon its that awful ice if twasnt for the ice sealin would be as pleasant a calling as preachin the gospel it is possible that this ice has turned garner back when he has been on his way home and that he has been waiting for a better time to come north theres one good pint in this newsthey tell me that when the ice is seen drifting about in low latitudes its a sign theres less of it in the higher  the cape of good hope is certainly in one sense in a low latitude uncle if i remember right it is not as far south as we are north and as you say it is a good sign if the ice has come anywhere near it  i dont say it has child i dont say it has but it may have come to the northward of cape horn and that will be a great matter for all the ice that is drifting about there comes from the polar seas and is so much taken out of gardners track  still he must come through it to get home returned mary in her sweet melancholy tones ah why cannot men be content with the blessings that providence places within our immediate reach that they must make distant voyages to accumulate others  you like your tea i fancy mary prattand the sugar in it and your silks and ribbons that ive seen you wear how are you to get such matters if theres to be no going on vyges tea and sugar and silks and satins dont grow along with the clams on yster pondfor so the deacon uniformly pronounced the word oyster  mary acknowledged the truth of what was said but changed the subject the journal contained no more that related to sealing or sealers and it was soon laid aside  it may be that garner is digging for the buried treasure all this time the deacon at length resumed that may be the reason he is so late if so he has nothing to dread from ice  i understand you sir that this money is supposed to be buried on a keyin the west indies of course  dont speak so loud marytheres no need of letting all yster pond know where the treasure is it may be in the west ingees or it may not theres keys all over the arth i take it  do you not think uncle that roswell would write if detained long among those keys  you wouldnt hear to postoffices in the antarctic ocean and now you want to put them on the sandkeys of the west ingees womans always a sailin agin wind and tide  i do not think so sir in this case at least there must be many vessels passing among the keys of the west indies and nothing seems to me to be easier than to send letters by them i am quite sure roswell would write if in a part of the world where he thought what he wrote would reach us  not henot hegarners not the man i take him for if he let any one know what he is about in them keys until he had done up all his business there no no mary we shall never hear from him in that quarter of the world it may be that garner is a digging about and has difficulty in finding the place for daggetts account had some weak spots in it  mary made no reply though she thought it very little likely that roswell would pass months in the west indies employed in such a pursuit without finding the means of letting her know where he was and what he was about the intercourse between these young people was somewhat peculiar and ever had been in listening to the suit of roswell mary had yielded to her heart in hesitating about accepting him she deferred to her principles usually a mothernot a managing matchmaking interested parent but a prudent feminine wellprincipled motheris of the last importance to the character and wellbeing of a young woman it sometimes happens however that a female who has no parent of her own sex and who is early made to be dependent on herself if the bias of her mind is good becomes as careful and prudent of herself and her conduct as the advice and solicitude of the most tender mother could make her such had been the case with mary pratt perfectly conscious of her own deserted situation high principled and early awake to the defects in her uncles character she had laid down severe rules for the government of her own conduct and from these rules she never departed thus it was that she permitted roswell to write though she never answered his letters she permitted him to write because she had promised not to shut her ears to his suit so long as he practised towards her his native and manly candour concealing none of his opinions and confessing his deficiency on the one great point that formed the only obstacle to their union  a young woman who has no mother if she escape the ills attendant on the privation while her character is forming is very apt to acquire qualities that are of great use in her future life she learns to rely on herself gets accustomed to think and act like an accountable being and is far more likely to become a reasoning and useful head of a family than if brought up in dependence and under the control of even the best maternal government in a word the bias of the mind is sooner obtained in such circumstances than when others do so much of the thinking whether that bias be in a right or in a wrong direction but mary pratt had early taken the true direction in all that relates to opinion and character and had never been wanting to herself in any of the distinctive and discreet deportment of her sex  our heroine hardly knew whether or not to seek for consolation in her uncles suggestion of roswells being detained among the keys in order to look for the hidden treasure the more she reflected on this subject the more did it embarrass her few persons who knew of the existence of such a deposit would hesitate about taking possession of it and once reclaimed in what way were the best intentions to be satisfied with the disposition of the gold to find the owners would probably be impossible and a question in casuistry remained mary pondered much on this subject and came to the conclusion that were she the person to whom such a treasure were committed she would set aside a certain period for advertising and failing to discover those who had the best claim to the money that she would appropriate every dollar to a charity  alas little did mary understand the world the fact that money was thus advertised would probably have brought forward a multitude of dishonest pretenders to having been robbed by pirates and scarce a doubloon would have found its way into the pocket of its right owner even had she yielded all to the statements of such claimants  all this however did not bring back the missing roswell another winter was fast approaching with its chilling storms and gales to awaken apprehensions by keeping the turbulence of the ocean as it might be constantly before the senses not a week now passed that the deacon did not get a letter from some wife or parent or sister or perhaps from one who hesitated to avow her relations to the absent mariner all inquiring after the fate of those who had sailed in the sea lion of oyster pond under the orders of captain roswell gardiner  even those of the vineyard sent across questions and betrayed anxiety and dread in the very manner of putting their interrogatories each day did the deacons apprehensions increase until it was obvious to all around him that this cause united to others that were more purely physical perhaps was seriously undermining his health and menacing his existence it is a sad commentary on the greediness for gain manifested by this person that ere the adventure he had undertaken on the strength of daggetts reluctant communications was brought to any apparent result he himself was nearly in the condition of that diseased seaman with as little prospect of being benefited by his secrets as was the man himself who first communicated their existence mary saw all this clearly and mourned almost as much over the blindness and worldliness of her uncle as she did over the now nearly assured fate of him whom she had so profoundly loved in her hearts core  day by day did time roll on without bringing any tidings of either of the sea lions the deacon grew weak fast until he seldom left his room and still more rarely the house it was now that he was induced to make his will and this by an agency so singular as to deserve being mentioned the rev mr whittle broached the subject one day not with any interested motive of course but simply because the meetinghouse wanted some material repairs and there was a debt on the congregation that it might be a pleasure to one who had long stood in the relation to it that deacon pratt filled to pay off when he no longer had any occasion for the money for himself it is probable the deacon at length felt the justice of this remark for he sent to riverhead for a lawyer and made a will that would have stood even the petulant and envious justice of the present day a justice that inclines to divide a mans estate infinitesimally lest some heir become a little richer than his neighbours after all no small portion of that which struts about under the aspects of right and liberty and benevolence is in truth derived from some of the most sneaking propensities of human nature     chapter xxi      i too have seen thee on thy surging path     when the nighttempest met thee thou didst dash   thy white arms high in heaven as if in wrath     threatening the angry sky thy waves did lash     the labouring vessel and with deadening crash   rush madly forth to scourge its groaning sides     onward thy billows came to meet and clash     in a wild warfare till the lifted tides   mingled their yesty tops where the dark stormcloud rides    percival   the first movement of the mariner when his vessel has been brought in collision with any hard substance is to sound the pumps this very necessary duty was in the act of performance by daggett in person even while the boats of roswell gardiner were towing his strained and roughly treated craft into the open water the result of this examination was waited for by all on board including roswell with the deepest anxiety the last held the lantern by which the height of the water in the well was to be ascertained the light of the moon scarce sufficing for such a purpose daggett stood on the top of the pump himself while gardiner and macy were at its side at length the soundingrod came up and its lower end was held out in order to ascertain how high up it was wet  well what do you make of it garner daggett demanded a little impatiently water there must be for no craft that floats could have stood such a squeeze and not have her sides open  there must be near three feet of water in your hold answered roswell shaking his head if this goes on captain daggett it will be hard work to keep your schooner afloat  afloat she shall be while a pumpbreak can work here rig this larboard pump at once and get it in motion  it is possible that your seams opened under the nip and have closed again as soon as the schooner got free in such a case ten minutes at the pump will let us know it  although there is no duty to which seamen are so averse as pumpingnone perhaps that is actually so exhausting and laboriousit often happens that they have recourse to it with eagerness as the only available means of saving their lives such was now the case the harsh but familiar strokes of the pumpbreak being audible amid the more solemn and grand sounds of the grating of icebergs the rushing of floes and the occasional scuffling and howling of the winds the last appeared to have changed in their direction however a circumstance that was soon noted there being much less of biting cold in the blasts than had been felt in the earlier hours of the night  i do believe that the wind has got round here to the northeast said roswell as he paced the quarterdeck with daggett still holding in his hand the well wiped and dried soundingrod in readiness for another trial that last puff was right in our teeth  not in our teeth garner no not in my teeth answered daggett whatever it maybe in yourn i shall try to get back to the island where i shall endeavour to beach the schooner and get a look at her leaks this is the most i can hope for it would never do to think of carrying a craft after such a nip as far as rio pumping every foot of the way  that will cause a great delay captain daggett said roswell doubtingly we are now well in among the first great body of the ice it may be as easy to work our way to the northward of it as to get back into clear water to the southward  i dare say it would but back i go i do not ask you to accompany us garner by no means ater the handsome manner in which youve waited for us so long i couldnt think of such a thing if the wind has rally got round to notheeast and i begin to think it has i shall get the schooner into the cove in fourandtwenty hours and theres as pretty a spot to beach her just under the shelf where we kept our spare casks as a body can wish in a fortnight well have her leaks all stopped and be jogging along in your wake youll tell the folks on oyster pond that were acoming and theyll be sure to send the news across to the vineyard  this was touching roswell on a point of honour and daggett knew it very well generous and determined the young man was much more easily influenced by a silent and indirect appeal to his liberal qualities than he could possibly have been by any other consideration the idea of deserting a companion in distress in a sea like that in which he was caused him to shrink from what under other circumstances he would regard as an imperative duty the deacon and still more mary called him north but the necessities of the vineyarders would seem to chain him to their fate  let us see what the pump tells us now cried roswell impatiently perhaps the report may make matters better than we have dared to hope for if the pump gains on the leak all may yet be well  its encouraging and hearty to hear you say this but no one who was in that nip as a body might say can ever expect the schooner to make a run of two thousand miles without repairs to my eye garner these bergs are separating leaving us a clearer passage back to the open water  i do believe you are right but it seems a sad loss of time and a great risk to go through these mountains again returned roswell the wind has shifted and the nearest bergs from some cause or other are slowly opening but recollect what a mass of floeice there is outside let us sound again  the process was renewed this time much easier than before the boxes being already removed the result was soon known  well what news garner demanded daggett leaning down in a vain endeavour to perceive the almost imperceptible marks that distinguished the wet part of the rod from that which was dry do we gain on the leak or does the leak gain on us god send it may be the first  god has so sent it sir answered stimson reverently for he was holding the lantern having remained on board the damaged vessel by the order of his officer it is he alone captain daggett who could do this much to seamen in distress  then to god be thanks as is due if we can but keep the leak under the schooner may yet be saved  i think it may be done daggett added roswell that one pump has brought the water down more than two inches and in my judgment the two together would clear her entirely  well pump her till she sucks cried daggett rig the other pump men and go to the work heartily  this was done though not until roswell ordered fully half of his own crew to come to the assistance of his consort by this time the two vessels had filled away made more sail and were running off before the new wind retracing their steps so far as one might judge of the position of the great passage daggetts vessel led and hazard followed roswell still remaining on board the injured craft thus passed the next few hours the pumps soon sucked and it was satisfactorily ascertained that the schooner could be freed from the water by working at them about onefourth of the time this was a bad leak and one that would have caused any crew to become exhausted in the course of a few days as roswell ascertained the facts more clearly he became better satisfied with a decision that in a degree had been forced on him he was passively content to return with daggett convinced that taking the injured vessel to rio was out of the question until some attention had been paid to her damages  fortuneor as stimson would say providencefavoured our mariners greatly in the remainder of their run among the bergs there were several avalanches of snow quite near to them and one more berg performed a revolution at no great distance but no injury was sustained by either vessel as the schooners got once more near to the fieldice roswell went on board his own craft and all the boats which had been towing in the open passage were run up and secured gardiner now led leaving his consort to follow as closely in his wake as she could keep  much greater difficulty and dangers indeed were encountered among the broken and grating floes than had been expected or previously met with notwithstanding fenders were got out on all sides many a rude shock was sustained and the copper suffered in several places once or twice roswell apprehended that the schooners would be crushed by the pressure on their sides the hazards were in some measure increased by the bold manner in which our navigators felt themselves called on to push ahead for time was very precious in every sense not only on account of the waning season but actually on account of the fatigue undergone by men who were compelled to toil at the pumps one minute in every four  at the return of day now getting to be later than it had been during the early months of their visit to these seas our adventurers found themselves in the centre of vast fields of floating ice driving away from the bergs which influenced by undercurrents were still floating north while the floes drove to the southward it was very desirable to get clear of all this cakeice though the grinding among it was by no means as formidable as when the seas were running high and the whole of the frozen expanse was in violent commotion motion however soon became nearly impossible except as the schooners drifted in the midst of the mass which was floating south at the rate of about two knots  thus passed an entire day and night so compact was the ice around them that the mariners passed from one vessel to the other on it with the utmost confidence no apprehension was felt so long as the wind stood in its present quarter the fleet of bergs actually forming as good a lee as if they had been so much land on the morning of the second day all this suddenly changed the ice began to open why was matter of conjecture though it was attributed to a variance between the wind and the currents this in some measure liberated the schooners and they began to move independently of the floes about noon the smoke of the volcano became once more visible and before the sun went down the cap of the highest elevation in the group was seen amid flurries of snow  every one was glad to see these familiar landmarks dreary and remote from the haunts of men as they were known to be for there was a promise in them of a temporary termination of their labours incessant pumping one minute in four being thus employed on board the vineyard craftwas producing its customary effect and the men looked jaded and exhausted no one who has not stood at a pumpbreak on board a vessel can form any notion of the nature of the toil or of the extreme dislike with which seamen regard it the treadmill as we conceivefor our experience extends to the first though not to the last of these occupationsis the nearest approach to the pain of such toil though the convict does not work for his life  on the morning of the fourth day our mariners found themselves in the great bay in clear water about a league from the cove and nearly dead to windward of their port the helms were put up and the schooners were soon within the wellknown shelter as they ran in roswell gazed around him in regret awe and admiration he could not but regret being compelled to lose so much precious time at that particular season short as had been his absence from the group sensible changes in the aspect of things had already occurred every sign of summerand they had ever been few and meagrewas now lost a chill and dreary autumn having succeeded as a matter of course nothing was altered about the dwelling the piles of wood and other objects placed there by the hands of man remaining just as they had been left but even these looked less cheering more unavailable than when last seen to the surprise of all not a seal was visible from some cause unknown to the men all of these animals had disappeared thereby defeating one of daggetts secret calculations this provident master having determined in his own mind to profit by his accident and seize the occasion to fill up some said that the creatures had gone north to winter others asserted that they had been alarmed and had taken refuge on one of the other islands but all agreed in saying that they were gone  it is known that a seal will occasionally wander a great distance from what may be considered his native waters but we are not at all aware that they are to be considered as migratory animals the larger species usually take a wide range of climate to dwell in and even the little furseal sometimes gets astray and is found on coasts that do not usually come within his haunts as respects the animals that so lately abounded on sealers land we shall hazard no theory our business being principally with facts but a conversation that took place between the two chief mates on this occasion may possibly assist some inquiring mind in its speculations  well macy said hazard pointing along the deserted rocks what do you think of that not an animal to be seen where there were lately thousands  what do i think of itwhy i think they are off and ive knowd such things to happen aforethe sealers of 1819 were not very particular about their english even among their officersany man who watches for signs and symptoms may know how to take this  i should like to hear it explained to me it is quite new  the seals are off and that is a sign we should be off too theres my explanation and you may make what you please of it natur gives such hints and no prudent seaman ought to overlook em i say that when the seale go the sealers should go likewise  and you set this down as a hint from natur as you call it  i do and a useful hint it is if we was in sailing trim id hant the old man but id get him off this blessed night now mark my words hazardno good will come of that nip and of this return into port agin and of all this veering and hauling upon cargo  the other mate laughed but a call from his commanding officer put a stop to the dialogue hazard was wanted to help secure the schooner of daggett in the berth in which she was now placed the tides do not appear to rise and fall in very high latitudes by any means as much as it does in about 50° in the antarctic sea they are reported to be but of medium elevation and force this fact our navigators had noted and daggett had at once carried his schooner on the only thing like a beach that was to be found on any part of that wild coast his craft was snug within the cove and quite handy for discharging and taking in beach in a proper sense it was not being with a very trifling exception nothing but a shelf of rock that was a little inclined and which admitted of a vessels being placed upon it as on the floor of a dock  into this berth daggett took his schooner while the other vessel anchored there was nearly a whole day before them and all the men were at once set to work to discharge the cargo of the injured vessel to get rid of the pumps they would cheerfully have worked the twentyfour hours without intermission as fast as the vessel was lightened she was hove further and further on the rock until she was got so high as to be perfectly safe from sinking or from injuring anything on board her when the pumps were abandoned before night came however the schooner was so secured by means of shores and purchases aloft that were carried out to the rocks as to stand perfectly upright on her keel she was thus protected when the tide left her at low water it was found that she wanted eight feet of being high and dry having already been lightened four feet a good deal of cargo was still in on this the first night after her return  the crew of daggetts vessel carried their mattresses ashore took possession of the bunks lighted a fire in the stove and made their preparations to get the camboose ashore next day and do their cooking in the house as had been practised previously to quitting the island roswell and all his people remained on board their own vessel  the succeeding day the injured schooner was cleared of everything even to her spars the lower masts and bowsprit excepted two large sealing crews made quick work with so small a craft empty casks were got under her and at the top of the tide she was floated quite up to the small beach that was composed of the débris of rock already mentioned as the water left her she fell over a little of course and at halftide her keel lay high and dry  the prying eyes of all hands were now busy looking out for the leaks as might have been expected none were found near the garboard streak a fact that was clearly enough proved by a quantity of the water remaining in the vessel after she lay entirely bare nearly on her bilge  her seams have opened a few streaks below the bends said roswell as he and daggett went under the vessels bottom looking out for injuries and you had better set about getting off the copper at once has there been an examination made inside  none had yet been made and our two masters clambered up to the main hatch and got as good a look at the state of things in the hold as could be thus obtained so tremendous had been the pressure that three of the deck beams were broken they would have been driven quite clear of their fastenings had not the wall of ice at each end prevented the possibility of such a thing as it was the toptimbers had slightly given way and the seams must have opened just below the waterline when the tide came in again the schooner righted of course and the opportunity was taken to pump her dry there was then no leak another proof that the defective places must be sought above the present waterline  with the knowledge thus obtained the copper was removed and several of the seams examined the condition of the pitch and oakum pointed out the precise spots that needed attention and the caulkingirons were immediately set at work in about a week the job was completed as was fancied the copper replaced and the schooner was got afloat again great was the anxiety to learn the effect of what had been done and quite as great the disappointment when it was found that there was still a serious leak that admitted too much water to think of going to sea until it was stopped a little headwork however and that on the part of roswell speedily gave a direction to the search that was immediately set on foot  this leak is not as low down as the vessels bilge he said for the water did not run out of her nor into her until we got her afloat it is somewhere then between her lightwater loadline and her bilge now we have had all the copper off and the seams examined in the wake of this section of the vessels bottom from the forechains to the main and in my judgment it will be found that something is wrong about her stem or her sternpost perhaps one of her woodends has started such a thing might very well have happened under so close a squeeze  in which case we shall have to lay the craft ashore again and go to work anew answered daggett i see how it is you do not like the delay and are thinking of deacon pratt and oyster pond i do not blame you garner and shall never whisper a syllable agin you or your people if you sail for home this very afternoon leaving me and mine to look out for ourselves youve stood by us nobly thus far and i am too thankful for what you have done already to ask for more  was daggett sincere in these professions to a certain point he was while he was only artful on others he wished to appear just and magnanimous while in secret it was his aim to work on the better feelings as well as on the pride of gardiner and thus secure his services in getting his own schooner ready as well as keep him in sight until a certain key had been examined in the proceeds of which he conceived he had a share as well as in those of sealers land strange as it may seem even in the strait in which he was now placed with so desperate a prospect of ever getting his vessel home again this man clung like a leech to the remotest chance of obtaining property there is a bulldog tenacity on this subject among a certain portion of the great american familythe godlike anglosaxonthat certainly leads to great results in one respect but which it is often painful to regard and never agreeable to any but themselves to be subject to of this school was daggett whom no dangers no toil no thoughts of a future could divert from a purpose that was coloured by gold we do not mean to say that other nations are not just as mercenary many are more so those in particular that have long been corrupted by vicious governments you may buy half a dozen frenchmen for instance more easily than one yankee but let the last actually get his teeth into a dollar and the muzzle of the ox fares worse in the jaws of the bulldog  roswell was deeply reluctant to protract his stay in the group but professional pride would have prevented him from deserting a consort under such circumstances had not a better feeling inclined him to remain and assist daggett it is true the last had in a manner thrust himself on him and the connection had been strangely continued down to that moment but this he viewed as a dispensation of providence to which he was bound to submit the result was a declaration of a design to stand by his companion as long as there was any hope of getting the injured craft home  this decision pointed at once to the delay of another week no time was lost in vain regrets however but all hands went to work to get the schooner into shallow water again and to look further for the principal leak accurate trimming and pumping showed that a good deal of the water was already stopped out but too much still entered to render it prudent to think of sailing until the injury was repaired this time the schooner was not suffered to lie on her bilge at all she was taken into water just deep enough to permit her to stand upright sustained by shores while the tide left two or three streaks dry forward it being the intention to wind her should the examination forward not be successful  on stripping off the copper it was found that a woodend had indeed started the inner edge of the plank having got as far from its bed as where the outer had been originally placed this opened a crack through which a small stream of water must constantly pour each hour rendering the leak more dangerous by loosening the oakum and raising the plank from its curvature once discovered however nothing was easier than to repair the damage it remained merely to buttbolt anew the woodend drive a few spikes cork and replace the copper roswell who was getting each moment more and more impatient to sail was much vexed at a delay that really seemed unavoidable as it arose from the particular position of the leak placed as it was in a manner between wind and water it was not possible to work at it more than an hour each tide and the staging permitted but two hands to be busy at the same time as a consequence of these embarrassments no less than six tides came in and went out before the stem was pronounced tight again the schooner was then pumped out and the vessel was once more taken into deep water this time it was found that the patience and industry of our sealers were rewarded with success no leak of any account existing  shes as tight as a bottle with a sealed cork garner cried daggett a few hours after his craft was at her anchor meeting his brothermaster at his own gangway and shaking hands with him cordially i owe much of this to you as all on the vineyard shall know if we ever get home agin  i am rejoiced that it turns out so captain daggett was roswells reply for to own the truth to you the fortnight we have lost or shall lose before we get you stowed and ready to sail again has made a great change in our weather the days are shortening with frightful rapidity and the great bay was actually covered with a skim of ice this very morning the wind has sent in a sea that has broke it up but look about you in the cove herea boy might walk on that ice near the rocks  therell be none of it left by night and the two crews will fill me up in twentyfour hours keep a good heart garner ill take you clear of the bergs in the course of the week  i have less fear of the bergs now than of the new ice and the floes the islands must have got pretty well to the northward by this time but each night gets colder and the fields seem to be setting back towards the group instead of away from it  daggett cheered his companion by a good deal of confident talk but roswell was heartily rejoiced when at the end of fourandtwenty hours more the vineyard craft was pronounced entirely ready it was near the close of the day and gardiner was for sailing or moving at once but daggett offered several very reasonable objections in the first place there was no wind and roswells proposition to tow the schooners out into the middle of the bay was met by the objection that the people had been hard at work for several days and that they needed some rest all that could be gained by moving the schooners then was to get them outside of the skim of ice that now regularly formed every still night near the land but which was as regularly broken and dispersed by the waves as soon as the wind returned roswell however did not like the appearances of things and he determined to take his own craft outside let daggett do as he might after discussing the matter in vain therefore and finding that the people of the other schooner had eaten their suppers and turned in he called all hands and made a short address to his own crew leaving it to their discretion whether to man the boats or not as roswell had pointed out the perfect absence of wind the smoothness of the water and the appearances of a severe frost or cold for frost there was now almost at midday the men came reluctantly over to his view of the matter and consented to work instead of sleeping the toil however could be much lessened by dividing the crew into the customary watches all that roswell aimed at was to get his schooner about a league from the cove which would be taking her without a line drawn from cape to cape the greatest danger of new ice being within the curvature of the crescent this he thought might easily be done in the course of a few hours and should there come any wind much sooner on explaining this to the crew the men were satisfied  roswell gardiner felt as if a load were taken off his spirits when his schooner was clear of the ground and his mainsail was hoisted a boat was got ahead and the craft was slowly towed out of the cove the canvass doing neither good nor harm as the vessel passed that of daggett the last was on deck the only person visible in the vineyard craft he wished his brothermaster a good night promising to be out as soon as there was any light next morning  it would not be easy to imagine a more dreary scene than that in which deacon pratts schooner moved out into the waters that separated the different islands of this remote and sterile group roswell could just discern the frowning mass of the rocks that crowned the centre of sealers land and that was soon lost in the increasing obscurity the cold was getting to be severe and the men soon complained that ice was forming on the blades of their oars then it was that a thought occurred to our young mariner which had hitherto escaped him of what use would it be for his vessel to be beyond the ice if that of daggett should be shut in the succeeding day so sensible did he become to the importance of this idea that he called in his boat and pulled back into the cove in order to make one more effort to persuade daggett to follow him out  gardiner found all of the vineyarders turned in even to their officers the fatigue they had lately undergone united to the cold rendered the berths very agreeable and even daggett begged his visiter would excuse him for not rising to receive his guest argument with a man thus circumstanced and so disposed was absolutely useless after remaining a short time with daggett roswell returned to his own schooner as he pulled back he ascertained that ice was fast making and the boat actually cut its way through a thin skim ere it reached the vessel  our hero was now greatly concerned lest he should be frozen in himself ere he could get into the more open water of the bay fortunately a light air sprung up from the northward and trimming his sails gardiner succeeded in carrying his craft to a point where the undulations of the groundswell gave the assurance of her being outside the segment of the crescent then he brailed his foresail hauled the jibsheet over lowered his gaff and put his helm hard down after this all the men were permitted to seek their berths the officers looking out for the craft in turns  it wanted about an hour of day when the second mate gave roswell a call according to orders the young master found no wind but an intensely cold morning on going on deck ice had formed on every part of the rigging and sides of the schooner where water had touched them though the stillness of the night by preventing the spray from flying was much in favour of the navigators in this respect on thrusting a boathook down roswell ascertained that the bay around him had a skim of ice nearly an inch in thickness this caused him great uneasiness and he waited with the greatest anxiety for the return of light in order to observe the condition of daggett  sure enough when the day came out distinctly it was seen that ice of sufficient thickness to bear men on it covered the entire surface within the crescent daggett and his people were already at work on it using the saw they must have taken the alarm before the return of day for the schooner was not only free from the ground but had been brought fully a cables length without the cove gardiner watched the movements of daggett and his crew with a glass for a short time when he ordered all hands called the cook was already in the galley and a warm breakfast was soon prepared after eating this the two whaleboats were lowered and roswell and hazard both rowed as far as the ice would permit them when they walked the rest of the way to the imprisoned craft taking with them most of their hands together with the saw  it was perhaps fortunate for daggett that it soon began to blow fresh from the northward sending into the bay a considerable sea which soon broke up the ice and enabled the vineyard craft to force her way through the fragments and join her consort about noon  glad enough was roswell to regain his own vessel and he made sail on a wind determined to beat out of the narrow waters at every hazard the experience of that night having told him that they had remained in the cove too long daggett followed willingly but not like a man who had escaped by the skin of his teeth from wintering near the antarctic circle     chapter xxii      beside the moldaus rushing stream   with the wan moon overhead   there stood as in an awful dream   the army of the dead    longfellow   most of our readers will understand what was meant by mary pratts inclination of the earths axis to the plane of its orbit but as there may be a few who do not and as the consequences of this great physical fact are materially connected with the succeeding events of the narrative we propose to give such a homely explanation of the phenomenon as we humbly trust will render it clear to the most clouded mind the orbit of the earth is the path which it follows in space in its annual revolution around the sun to a planet there is no up or down except as ascent and descent are estimated from and towards itself in all other respects it floats in vacuum or what is so nearly so as to be thus termed now let the uninstructed reader imagine a large circular table with a light on its surface and near to its centre the light shall represent the sun the outer edge of the circle of the table the earths orbit and its surface the plane of that orbit in nature there is no such thing as a plane at all the space within the orbit being vacant but the surface of the table gives a distinct notion of the general position of the earth as it travels round the sun it is scarcely necessary to say that the axis of the earth is an imaginary line drawn through the planet from one pole to the other the name being derived from the supposition that our daily revolution is made on this axis  now the first thing that the student is to fix in his mind in order to comprehend the phenomenon of the seasons is the leading fact that the earth does not change its attitude in space if we may so express it when it changes its position if the axis were perpendicular to the plane of the orbit this circumstance would not affect the temperature as the simplest experiment will show putting the equator of a globe on the outer edge of the table and holding it perfectly upright causing it to turn on its axis as it passes round the circle it would be found that the light from the centre of the table would illumine just one half of the globe at all times and in all positions cutting the two poles did this movement correspond with that of nature the days and nights would be always of the same length and there would be no changes of the seasons the warmest weather being nearest to the equator and the cold increasing as the poles were approached no where however would the cold be so intense as it now is nor would the heat be as great as at present except at or quite near to the equator the first fact would be owing to the regular return of the sun once in twentyfour hours the last to the oblique manner in which its rays struck this orb in all places but near its centre  but the globe ought not to be made to move around the table with its axis perpendicular to its surface or to the plane of the earths orbit in point of fact the earth is inclined to this plane and the globe should be placed at a corresponding inclination let the globe be brought to the edge of the table at its south side and with its upper or north pole inclining to the sun and then commence the circuit taking care always to keep this north pole of the globe pointing in the same direction or to keep the globe itself in what we have termed a fixed attitude as one half of the globe must always be in light and the other half in darkness this inclination from the perpendicular will bring the circle of light some distance beyond the north pole when the globe is duesouth from the light and will leave an equal space around the opposite pole without any light at all or any light directly received now it is that what we have termed the fixed attitude of the globe begins to tell if the north pole inclined towards the orbit facing the rim of the table the light would still cut the poles the days and nights would still be equal and there would be no changes in the seasons though there would be a rival revolution of the globe by causing it to turn once a year shifting the poles end for end the inclination being to the surface of the table or to the plane of the orbit the phenomena that are known to exist are a consequence thus it is that the change in the seasons is as much owing to the fixed attitude of the earth in space as we have chosen to term its polar directions as to the inclination of its axis neither would produce the phenomena without the assistance of the other as our experiment with the table will show  place then the globe at the south side of the rim of the table with its axis inclining towards its surface and its poles always pointing in the same general direction not following the circuit of the orbit and set it in motion towards the east revolving rapidly on its axis as it moves while directly south of the light it would be found that the north pole would be illuminated while no revolution on the axis would bring the south pole within the circle of the light this is when a line drawn from the axis of the globe would cut the lamp were the inclination brought as low as the surface of the table next set the globe in motion following the rim of the table and proceeding to the east or right hand keeping its axis always looking in the same general direction or in an attitude that would be parallel to a north and south line drawn through the sun were the inclination as low as the surface of the table this movement would be in one sense sideways the circle of light gradually lessening around the north pole and extending towards the south as the globe proceeded east and north diminishing the length of the days in the northern hemisphere and increasing them in the southern when at east the most direct rays of the light would fall on the equator and the light would cut the two poles rendering the days and nights equal as the globe moved north the circle of light would be found to increase around the south pole while none at all touched the north when on the north side of the table the northern pole of the globe would incline so far from the sun as to leave a space around it in shadow that would be of precisely the same size as had been the space of light when it was placed on the opposite side of the table going round the circle west the same phenomena would be seen until coming directly south of the lamp the north pole would again come into light altogether and the south equally into shadow  owing to this very simple but very wonderful provision of divine power and wisdom this earth enjoys the relief of the changes in the seasons as well as the variations in the length of the days for one half of the year or from equinox to equinox from the time when the globe is at a duewest point of the table until it reaches the east the north pole would always receive the light in a circle around it that would gradually increase and diminish and for the other half the same would be true of the other hemisphere of course there is a precise point on the earth where this polar illumination ceases the shape of the illuminated part is circular and placing the point of a pencil on the globe at the extremest spot on the circle holding it there while the globe is turned on its axis the lines made would just include the portions of the earth around the globe that thus receives the rays of the sun at midsummer these lines compose what are termed the arctic and antarctic circles with the last of which our legend has now a most serious connection after all we are by no means certain that we have made our meaning as obvious as we could wish it being very difficult to explain phenomena of this nature clearly without actually experimenting  it is usual to say that there are six months day and six months night in the polar basins this is true literally at the poles only but approximatively it is true as a whole we apprehend that few personsnone perhaps but those who are in habits of studyform correct notions of the extent of what may be termed the icy seas as the polar circles are in 23° 28 a line drawn through the south pole for instance commencing on one side of the earth at the antarctic circle and extending to the other would traverse a distance materially exceeding that between new york and lisbon this would make those frozen regions cover a portion of this globe that is almost as large as the whole of the atlantic ocean as far south as the equator any one can imagine what must be the influence of frost over so vast a surface in reproducing itself since the presence of icebergs is thought to affect our climate when many of them drift far south in summer as power produces power riches wealth so does cold produce cold fill then in a certain degree a space as large as the north atlantic ocean with ice in all its varieties fixed mountain and field berg and floe and one may get a tolerably accurate notion of the severity of its winters when the sun is scarce seen above the horizon at all and then only to shed its rays so obliquely as to be little better than a chilllooking orb of light placed in the heavens simply to divide the day from the night  this then was the region that roswell gardiner was so very anxious to leave the winter he so much dreaded mary pratt was before him to say nothing of his duty to the deacon while behind him was the vast polar ocean just described about to be veiled in the freezing obscurity of its long and gloomy twilight if not of absolute night no wonder therefore that when he trimmed his sails that evening to beat out of the great bay that it was done with the earnestness with which we all perform duties of the highest import when they are known to affect our wellbeing visibly and directly  keep her a good full mr hazard said roswell as he was leaving the deck to take the first sleep in which he had indulged for fourandtwenty hours and let her go through the water we are behind our time and must keep in motion give me a call if anything like ice appears in a serious way  hazard ayayd this order as usual buttoned his peejacket tighter than ever and saw his young superiorthe transcendental delicacy of the day is causing the difference in rank to be termed senior and juniorbut hazard saw his superior go below with a feeling allied to envy so heavy were his eyelids with the want of rest stimson was in the firstmates watch and the latter approached that old seadog with a wish to keep himself awake by conversing  you seem as wide awake king stephen the mate remarked as if you never felt drowsy  this is not a part of the world for hammocks and berths mr hazard was the reply i can get along and must get along with a quarter part of the sleep in these seas as would sarve me in a low latitude  and i feel as if i wanted all i can get them fellows look up well into our wake stephen  they do indeed sir and they ought to do it for we have been longer than is for our good in theirn  well now we have got a fresh start i hope we may make a clear run of it i saw no ice worth speaking of to the norard here before we made sail  because you seed none mr hazard is no proof there is none floeice cant be seen at any great distance though its blink may but it seems to me its all blink in these here seas  there youre quite right stephen for turn which way you will the horizon has a show of that sort  starboardcalled out the lookout forwardkeep her awaykeep her awaythere is ice ahead  ice in here exclaimed hazard springing forwardthat is more than we bargained for where away is your ice smith  off here sir on our weather bowand a mortal big field of itjist sich a chap as nippd the vineyard lion when she first came in to join us sich a fellow as that would take the sap out of our bends as a squeezer takes the juice from a lemon  smith was a carpenter by trade which was probably the reason why he introduced this figure hazard saw the ice with regret for he had hoped to work the schooner fairly out to sea in his watch but the field was getting down through the passage in a way that threatened to cut off the exit of the two schooners from the bay daggett kept close in his wake a proof that this experienced navigator in such waters saw no means to turn farther to windward as the wind was now abeam both vessels drove rapidly ahead and in half an hour the northern point of the land they had so lately left came into view close aboard of them just then the moon rose and objects became more clearly visible  hazard hailed the vineyard lion and demanded what was to be done it was possible by hauling close on a wind to pass the cape a short distance to windward of it and seemingly thus clear the floe unless this were done both vessels would be compelled to ware and run for the southern passage which would carry them many miles to leeward and might place them a long distance on the wrong side of the group  is captain garner on deck asked daggett who had now drawn close up on the leequarter of his consort hazard having brailed his foresail and laid his topsail sharp aback to enable him to do soif he isnt id advise you to give him a call at once  this was done immediately and while it was doing the vineyard lion swept past the oyster pond schooner roswell announced his presence on deck just as the other vessel cleared his bows  theres no time to consult garner answered daggett theres our road before us go through it we must or stay where we are until that fieldice gives us a jam down yonder in the crescent i will lead and you can follow as soon as your eyes are open  one glance let roswell into the secret of his situation he liked it little but he did not hesitate  fill the topsail and haul aft the foresheet were the quiet orders that proclaimed what he intended to do  both vessels stood on by some secret process every man on board the two craft became aware of what was going on and appeared on deck all hands were not called nor was there any particular noise to attract attention but the word had been whispered below that there was a great risk to run a risk it was of a verity it was necessary to stand close along that ironbound coast where the seals had so lately resorted for a distance of several miles the wind would not admit of the schooners steering much more than a cables length from the rocks for quite a league after which the shore trended to the southward and a little searoom would be gained but on those rocks the waves were then beating heavily and their bellowings as they rolled into the cavities were at almost all times terrific there was some relief however in the knowledge obtained of the shore by having frequently passed up and down it in the boats it was known that the water was deep close to the visible rocks and that there was no danger as long as a vessel could keep off them  no one spoke every eye was strained to discern objects ahead or was looking astern to trace the expected collision between the floeice and the low promontory of the cape the ear soon gave notice that this meeting had already taken place for the frightful sound that attended the cracking and rending of the field might have been heard fully a league now it was that each schooner did her best yards were braced up sheets flattened and the helm tended the close proximity of the rocks on the one side and the secret presentiment of there being more fieldice on the other kept every one wide awake the two masters in particular were all eyes and ears it was getting to be very cold and the sort of shelter aloft that goes by the quaint name of crowsnest had been fitted up in each vessel a mate was now sent into each to ascertain what might be discovered to windward almost at the same instant these young seamen hailed their respective decks and gave notice that a wide field was coming in upon them and must eventually crush them unless avoided this startling intelligence reached the two commanders in the very same moment the emergency demanded decision and each man acted for himself roswell ordered his helm put down and his schooner tacked the water was not rough enough to prevent the success of the maneuvre on the other hand daggett kept a rap full and stood on roswell manifested the most judgment and seamanship he was now far enough from the cape to beat to windward and by going nearer to the enemy he might always run along its southern boundary profit by any opening and would be by as much as he could thus gain to windward of the coast daggett had one advantage by standing on in the event of a return becoming necessary he would gain in time in ten minutes the two schooners were a mile asunder we shall first follow that of roswell gardiners in his attempt to escape  the first floe which was ripping and tearing one of its angles into fragments as it came grinding down on the cape soon compelled the vessel to tack making short reaches roswell ere long found himself fully a mile to windward of the rocks and sufficiently near to the new floe to discern its shape drift and general character its eastern end had lodged upon the field that first came in and was adding to the vast momentum with which that enormous floe was pressing down upon the cape large as was that first visiter to the bay this was of at least twice if not of thrice its dimensions what gave roswell the most concern was the great distance that this field extended to the westward he went up into the crowsnest himself and aided by the light of a most brilliant moon and a sky without a cloud he could perceive the blink of ice in that direction as he fancied for fully two leagues what was unusual perhaps at that early season of the year these floes did not consist of a vast collection of numberless cakes of ice but the whole field so far as could then be ascertained was firm and united the nights were now so cold that ice made fast wherever there was water and it occurred to our young master that possibly fragments that had once been separated and broken by the waves might have become reunited by the agency of the frost roswell descended from the crowsnest half chilled by a cutting wind though it blew from a warm quarter summoning his mates he asked their advice  it seems to me captain garner hazard replied theres very little choice here we are so far as i can make it out embayed and we have only to box about until daylight comes when some chance may turn up to help us if so we must turn it to account if not we must make up our minds to winter here  this was coolly and calmly said though it was clear enough that hazard was quite in earnest  you forget there may be an open passage to the westward mr hazard roswell rejoined and that we may yet pass out to sea by it captain daggett is already out of sight in the western board and we may do well to stand on after him  ay ay siri know all that captain garner and it may be as you say but when i was aloft half an hour since if there wasnt the blink of ice in that direction quite round to the back of the island there wasnt the blink of ice nowhere hereabouts im used to the sight of it and cant well be mistaken  there is always ice on that side of the land hazard and you may have seen the blink of the bergs which have hugged the cliffs in that quarter all summer still that is not proving we shall find no outlet this craft can go through a very small passage and we must take care and find one in proper time wintering here is out of the question a hundred reasons tell us not to think of such a thing besides the interests of our owners we are walking along this floe pretty fast though i think the vessel is too much by the head dont it strike you so hazard  lord sir its nothing but the ice that has made and is making forard before we got so near the field as to find a better lee the little lipper that came athwart our bows froze almost as soon as it wet us i do suppose sir there are now several tons of ice on our bows counting from channel to channel forward  on an examination this proved to be true and the knowledge of the circumstance did not at all contribute to gardiners feeling of security he saw there was no time to be lost and he crowded sail with a view of forcing the vessel past the dangers if possible and of getting her into a milder climate but even a fastsailing schooner will scarcely equal our wishes under such circumstances there was no doubt that the sea lions speed was getting to be affected by the manner in which her bows were weighed down by ice in addition to the discomfort produced by cold damp and the presence of a slippery substance on the deck and rigging fortunately there was not much spray flying or matters would have been much worse as it was they were bad enough and very ominous of future evil  while the sea lion of oyster pond was running along the margin of the ice in the manner just described and after the blink to the westward had changed to a visible field making it very uncertain whether any egress was to be found in that quarter or not an opening suddenly appeared trending to the northward and sufficiently wide as roswell thought to enable him to beat through it putting his helm down his schooner came heavily round and was filled on a course that soon carried her half a mile into this passage at first everything seemed propitious the channel rather opening than otherwise while the course was suchnorthnorthwestas enabled the vessel to very long legs on one tack and that the best after going about four or five times however all these flattering symptoms suddenly changed by the passages terminating in a cul de sac almost at the same instant the ice closed rapidly in the schooners wake an effort was made to run back but it failed in consequence of an enormous floes turning on its centre having met resistance from a field closer in that was in its turn stopped by the rocks roswell saw at once that nothing could be done at the moment he took in all his canvass as well as the frozen cloth could be handled got out iceanchors and hauled his vessel into a species of cove where there would be the least danger of a nip should the fields continue to close  all this time daggett was as busy as a bee he rounded the headland and flattered himself that he was about to slip past all the rocks and get out into open water when the vast fields of which the blink had been seen even by those in the other vessel suddenly stretched themselves across his course in a way that set at defiance all attempts to go any further in that direction daggett wore round and endeavoured to return this was by no means as easy as it was to go down before the wind and his bows were also much encumbered with ice more so indeed than those of the other schooner once or twice his craft missed stays in consequence of getting so much by the head and it was deemed necessary to heaveto and take to the axes a great deal of extra and cumbrous weight was gotten rid of but an hour of most precious time was lost  by the time daggett was ready to make sail again he found his return round the headland was entirely cut off by the fields having come in absolute contact with the rocks  it was now midnight and the men on board both vessels required rest a watch was set in each and most of the people were permitted to turn in of course proper lookouts were had but the light of the moon was not sufficiently distinct to render it safe to make any final efforts under its favour no great alarm was felt there being nothing unusual in a vessels being embayed in the ice and so long as she was not nipped or pressed upon by actual contact the position was thought safe rather than the reverse it was desirable moreover for the schooners to communicate with each other for some advantage might be known to one of the masters that was concealed by distance from his companion without concert therefore roswell and daggett came to the same general conclusions and waited patiently  the day came at last cold and dreary though not altogether without the relief of an air that blew from regions far warmer than the ocean over which it was now travelling then the two schooners became visible from each other and roswell saw the jeopardy of daggett and daggett saw the jeopardy of roswell the vessels were little more than a mile apart but the situation of the vineyard lion was much the most critical she had made fast to the floe but her support itself was in a steady and most imposing motion as soon as roswell saw the manner in which his consort was surrounded and the very threatening aspect of the danger that pressed upon him his first impulse was to hasten to him with a party of his own people to offer any assistance he could give after looking at the ice immediately around his own craft where all seemed to be right he called over the names of six of his men ordered them to eat a warm breakfast and to prepare to accompany him  in twenty minutes roswell was leading his little party across the ice each man carrying an axe or some other implement that it was supposed might be of use it was by no means difficult to proceed for the surface of the floe one seemingly more than a league in extent was quite smooth and the snow on it was crusted to a strength that would have borne a team  the water between the ice and the rocks is a much narrower strip than i had thought said roswell to his constant attendant stimson here it does not appear to be a hundred yards in width  nor is it sirwhewthis trotting in so cold a climate makes a man puff like a whale blowingbut captain garner that schooner will be cut in two before we can get to her look sir the floe has reached the rocks already quite near her and it does not stop the drift at all seemingly  roswell made no reply the state of the vineyard lion did appear to be much more critical than he had previously imagined until he came nearer to the land he had formed no notion of the steady power with which the field was setting down on the rocks on which the broken fragments were now creeping like creatures endowed with life occasionally there would be loud disruptions and the movement of the floe would become more rapid then again a sort of pause would succeed and for a moment the approaching party felt a gleam of hope but all expectations of this sort were doomed to be disappointed  look sir exclaimed stimsonshe went down afore it twenty fathoms at that one set she must be awful near the rocks sir  all the men now stopped they knew they were powerless and intense anxiety rendered them averse to move attention appeared to interfere with their walking on the ice and each held his breath in expectation they saw that the schooner then less than a cables length from them was close to the rocks and the next shock if anything like the last must overwhelm her to their astonishment instead of being nipped the schooner rose by a stately movement that was not without grandeur upheld by broken cakes that had got beneath her bottom and fairly reached the shelf of rocks almost unharmed not a man had left her but there she was placed on the shore some twenty feet above the surface of the sea on rocks worn smooth by the action of the waves had the season been propitious and did the injury stop here it might have been possible to get the craft into the water again and still carry her to america  but the floe was not yet arrested cake succeeded cake one riding over another until a wall of ice rose along the shore that roswell and his companions with all their activity and courage had great difficulty in crossing they succeeded in getting over it however but when they reached the unfortunate schooner she was literally buried the masts were broken the sails torn rigging scattered and sides stove the sea lion of marthas vineyard was a worthless wreckworthless as to all purposes but that of being converted into materials for a smaller craft or to be used as fuel  all this had been done in ten minutes then it was that the vast superiority of nature over the resources of man made itself apparent the people of the two vessels stood aghast with this sad picture of their own insignificance before their eyes the crew of the wreck it is true had escaped without difficulty the movement having been as slow and steady as it was irresistible but there they were in the clothes they had on with all their effects buried under piles of ice that were already thirty or forty feet in height  she looks as if she was built there garner daggett coolly observed as he stood regarding the scene with eyes as intently riveted on the wreck as human organs were ever fixed on any object had a man told me this could happen i would not have believed him  had she been a threedecker this ice would have treated her in the same way there is a force in such a field that walls of stone could not withstand  captain garnercaptain garner called out stimson hastily wed better go back sir our own craft is in danger she is drifting fast in towards the cape and may reach it afore we can get to her  sure enough it was so in one of the changes that are so unaccountable among the ice the floe had taken a sudden and powerful direction towards the entrance of the great bay it was probably owing to the circumstance that the inner field had forced its way past the cape and made room for its neighbour to follow a few of daggetts people with daggett himself remained to see what might yet be saved from the wreck but all the rest of the men started for the cape towards which the oyster pond craft was now directly setting the distance was less than a league and as yet there was not much show on the rocks by taking an upper shelf it was possible to make pretty good progress and such was the manner of roswells present march  it was an extraordinary sight to see the coast along which our party was hastening just at that moment as the cakes of ice were broken from the field they were driven upward by the vast pressure from without and the whole line of the shore seemed as if alive with creatures that were issuing from the ocean to clamber on the rocks roswell had often seen that very coast peopled with seals as it now appeared to be in activity with fragments of ice that were writhing and turning and rising one upon another as if possessed of the vital principle  in half an hour roswell and his party reached the house the schooner was then less than half a mile from the spot still setting in along with the outer field but not nipped so far from being in danger of such a calamity the little basin in which she lay had expanded instead of closing and it would have been possible to handle a quickworking craft in it under her canvass an exit however was quite out of the question there being no sign of any passage to or from that icy dock there the craft still lay anchored to the weatherfloe while the portion of her crew which remained on board was as anxiously watching the coast as those who were on the coast watched her at first roswell gave his schooner up but on closer examination found reason to hope that she might pass the rocks and enter the inner rather than the great bay     chapter xxiii      to prayerfor the glorious sun is gone   and the gathering darkness of night comes on   like a curtain from gods kind hand it flows   to shade the couch where his children repose   then kneel while the watching stars are bright   and give your last thoughts to the guardian of night    ware   desolate indeed and nearly devoid of hope had the situation of our sealers now become it was midday and it was freezing everywhere in the shade a bright genial sun was shedding its glorious rays on the icy panorama but it was so obliquely as to be of hardly any use in dispelling the frosts far as the eye could see even from the elevation of the cape there was nothing but ice with the exception of that part of the great bay into which the floe had not yet penetrated to the southward there stood clustering around the passage a line of gigantic bergs placed like sentinels as if purposely to stop all egress in that direction the water had lost its motion in the shift of wind and new ice had formed over the whole bay as was evident by a white sparkling line that preceded the irresistible march of the floe  as roswell gazed on this scene serious doubts darkened his mind as to his escaping from this frozen chain until the return of another summer it is true that a south wind might possibly produce a change and carry away the blockading mass but every moment rendered this so much the less probable winter or what would be deemed winter in most regions was already setting in and should the ice really become stationary in and around the group all hope of its moving must vanish for the next eight months  daggett reached the house about an hour before sunset he had succeeded in cutting a passage through the ice as far as the cabindoor of his unfortunate schooner when there was no difficulty in descending into the interior parts of the vessel the whole party came in staggering under heavy loads pretty much as a matter of course each man brought his own effects clothes tobacco rum smallstores bedding quadrants and similar property was that first attended to at that moment little was thought of the skins and oil the cargo was neglected while the minor articles had been eagerly sought  roswell was on board his own schooner now again in dangerous proximity to the cape she was steadily setting in when daggett rejoined him the crew of the lost vessel remained in the house where they lighted a fire and deposited their goods returning to the wreck for another load taking the double sets of wheels along with them when the two masters met they conferred together earnestly receiving into their councils such of the officers as were on board the security of the remaining vessel was now allimportant and it was not to be concealed that she was in imminent jeopardy the course taken by the floe was directly towards the most rugged part of cape hazard and the rate of the movement such as to threaten a very speedy termination of the matter there was one circumstance however and only that one which offered a single chance of escape the opening around the schooner still existed in part about half of it having been lost in the collision with the outermost point of the rocks it was this species of vacuum that by removing all resistance at that particular spot indeed which had given the field its most dangerous cant turning the movement of the vessel towards the rocks the chance therefore existed in the possibilityand it was little more than a bare possibilityof moving the schooner in that small area of open water and of taking her far enough south to clear the most southern extremity of the wall of stone that protected the cove as yet this open water did not extend far enough to admit of the schooners being taken to the point in question but it was slowly tending in that direction and did not the basin close altogether ere that desirable object was achieved the vessel might yet be saved in order however to do this it would be necessary to cut a sort of dock or slip in the ice of the cove into which the craft might shoot as a place of refuge once within the cove fairly behind the point of the rocks there would be perfect safety if suffered to drift to the southward of that shelter this schooner would probably be lost like her consort and very much in the same manner  gardiner now sent a gang of hands to the desired point armed with saws and the slip was commenced the ice in the cove was still only two or three inches thick and the work went bravely on instead of satisfying himself with cutting a passage merely behind the point of rock hazard opened one quite up into the cove to the precise place where the schooner had been so long at anchor just as the sun was setting the crisis arrived so heavy had been the movement towards the rocks that roswell saw he could delay no longer were he to continue where he was a projection on the cape would prevent his passage to the entrance of the cove he would be shut in and he might be certain that the sea lion would be crushed if the floe pressed home upon the shore the iceanchors were cut out accordingly the jib was hoisted and the schooner wore short round on her heel the space between the floe and the projection in the rocks just named did not now exceed a hundred feet and it was lessening fast much more room existed on each side of this particular excrescence in the rugged coast the space north being still considerable while that to the southward might be a hundred yards in width the former of these areas being owing to the form of the basin and the latter to the shape of the shore  in the first of the basins named the schooner wore short round on her heel her foresail being set to help her a breathless moment passed as she ran down towards the narrow strait it was quickly reached and that none too soon the opening now not exceeding sixty feet the yards of the vessel almost brushed the rocks in passing but she went clear as soon as in the lower basin as one might call it the jib and foresail were taken in and the head of the mainsail was got on the craft this helped her to luff up towards the slip which she reached under sufficient headway fairly to enter it lines were thrown to the people on the ice who soon hauled the schooner up to the head of her frozen dock three cheers broke spontaneously out of the throats of the men as they thus achieved the step which assured them of the safety of the vessel so far as the ice was concerned in this way do we estimate our advantages and disadvantages by comparison in the abstract the situation of the sealers was still sufficiently painful though compared with what it would have been with the other schooner wrecked it was security itself  by this time it was quite dark and a day of excitement and fatigue required a night of rest after supping the men turned in the vineyarders mostly in the house where they occupied their old bunks when the moon rose the party from the wreck arrived with their carts well loaded and themselves half frozen notwithstanding their toil in a short time all were buried in sleep  when roswell gardiner came on deck next morning his first glance told him how little was the chance of his partys returning north that season the strange floe had driven into the great bay completely covering its surface lining the shores far and near with broken and glittering cakes of ice and as it were hermetically sealing the place against all egress new ice an inch or two thick or even six or eight inches thick might have been sawed through and a passage cut even for a league should it be necessary such things were sometimes done and great as would have been the toil our sealers would have attempted it in preference to running the risk of passing a winter in that region but almost desperate as would have been even that source of refuge the party was completely cut off from its possession to think of sawing through ice as thick as that of the floe for any material distance would be like a project to tunnel the alps  melancholy was the meeting between roswell and daggett that morning the former was too manly and generous to indulge in reproaches else might he well have told the last that all this was owing to him there is a singular propensity in us all to throw the burthen of our own blunders on the shoulders of other folk roswell had a little of this weakness overlooking the fact that he was his own master and as he had come to the group by himself he ought to have left it in the same manner as soon as his own particular task was accomplished but roswell did not see this quite as distinctly as he saw the fact that daggetts detentions and indirect appeals to his better feelings had involved him in all these difficulties still while thus he felt he made no complaint  all hope of getting north that season now depended on the fieldices drifting away from the great bay before it got fairly frozen in so jammed and crammed with it did every part of the bay appear to be however that little could be expected from that source of relief this daggett admitted in the conversation he held with roswell as soon as the latter joined him on the rocky terrace beneath the house  the wisest thing we can do then replied our hero will be to make as early preparations as possible to meet the winter if we are to remain here a day gained now will be worth a week a month hence if we should happily escape the labour thus expended will not kill us  quite truevery much as you say certainly answered daggett musing i was thinking as you came ashore garner if a lucky turn might not be made in this wisehave a good many skins in the wreck you see and you have a good deal of ile in your holdnow by starting some of that ile and pumping it out and shooking the casks room might be made aboard of you for all my skins i think we could run all of the last over on them wheels in the course of a week  captain daggett it is by yielding so much to your skins that we have got into all this trouble  skins measure for measure in the way of tonnage will bring a great deal more than ile  roswell smiled and muttered something to himself a little bitterly he was thinking of the grievous disappointment and prolonged anxiety that it pained him to believe mary would feel at his failure to return home at the appointed time though it would probably have pained him more to believe she would not thus be disappointed and anxious here his displeasure or its manifestation ceased and the young man turned his thoughts on the present necessities of his situation  daggett appearing very earnest on the subject of removing his skins before the snows came to impede the path roswell could urge no objection that would be likely to prevail but his acquiescence was obtained by means of a hint from stimson who by this time had gained his officers ear  let him do it captain garner said the boatsteerer in an aside speaking respectfully but earnestly hell never stow em in our hold this season at least but theyll make excellent fillingin for the sides of this hut  you think then stephen that we are likely to pass the winter here  we are in the hands of divine providence sir which will do with us as seems the best in the eyes of neverfailing wisdom at all events captain garner i think twill be safest to act at once as if we had the winter afore us in my judgment this house might be made a good deal more comfortable for us all in such a case than our craft for we should not only have more room but might have as many fires as we want and more than we can find fuel for  ay theres the difficulty stephen where are we to find wood throughout a polar winter for even one fire  we must be saving sir and thoughtful and keep ourselves warm as much as we can by exercise i have had a taste of this once in a small way already and know what ought to be done in many particlars in the first place the men must keep themselves as clean as water will make themdirt is a great helper of coldand the water must be just as frosty as human natur can bear it this will set everything into actyve movement inside and bring out warmth from the heart as it might be thats my principle of keeping warm captain garner  i dare say it may be a pretty good one stephen answered roswell and well bear it in mind as for stoves we are well enough off for there is one in the house and a good large one it is then there is a stove in each cabin and there are the two cambooses if we had fuel for them all i should feel no concern on the score of warmth  theres the wrack sir by cutting her up at once we should get wood enough in my judgment to see it out  roswell made no reply but he looked intently at the boatsteerer for half a minute the idea was new to him and the more he thought on the subject the greater was the confidence it gave him in the result daggett he well knew would not consent to the mutilation of his schooner wreck as it was so long as the most remote hope existed of getting her again into the water the tenacity with which this man clung to property was like that which is imputed to the life of the cat and it was idle to expect any concessions from him on a subject like that nevertheless necessity is a hard master and if the question were narrowed down to one of burning the materials of a vessel that was in the water and in good condition and of burning those of one that was out of the water with holes cut through her bottom in several places and otherwise so situated as to render repairs extremely difficult if not impossible even duggett would be compelled to submit to circumstances  it was accordingly suggested to the people of the vineyard lion that they could do no better than to begin at once to remove everything they could come at and which could be transported from the wreck to the house as there was little to do on board the vessel afloat her crew cheerfully offered to assist in this labour the days were shortening sensibly and fast and no time was to be lost the distance being so great as to make two trips a day a matter of great labour no sooner was the plan adopted therefore than steps were taken to set about its execution  it is unnecessary for us to dwell minutely on everything that occurred during the succeeding week or ten days the wind shifted to southwest the very day that the sea lion got back into her little harbour and this seemed to put a sudden check on the pressure of the vast floe nevertheless there was no countermovement the ice remaining in the great bay seemingly as firmly fastened as if it had originally been made there notwithstanding this shift of the wind to a cold point of the compass the thermometer rose and it thawed freely about the middle of the day in all places to which the rays of the sun had access this enabled the men to work with more comfort than they could have done in the excessively severe weather as it was found that respiration became difficult when it was so very cold  access was now obtained to the wreck by cutting a regular passage to the main hatch through the ice the schooner stood nearly upright sustained by fragments of the floe and there were extensive caverns all around her produced by the random manner in which the cakes had come up out of their proper element like so many living things among these caverns one might have wandered for miles without once coming out into the open air though they were cold and cheerless and had little to attract the adventurer after the novelty was abated in rising from the water the schooner had been roughly treated but once sustained by the ice her transit had been easy and tolerably safe several large cakes lay on or over her sustained more by other cakes that rested on the rocks than by the timbers of the vessel herself these cakes formed a sort of roof and as they did not drip they served to make a shelter against the wind for at the point where the wreck lay the southwest gales came howling round the base of the mountain piercing the marrow itself in the bones at the hut it was very different there the heights made a lee that extended all over the cape and for some distance to the westward while the whole power the sun possessed in that high latitude was cast very obliquely it is true but clearly and without any other drawback than its position in the ecliptic fairly on the terrace the hut above and the rocks around it on the natural terrace indeed it was still pleasant to walk and work and even to sit for a few hours in the middle of the day for winter was not yet come in earnest in that frozen world  one of roswells first objects was to transport most of the eatables from the wreck for he foresaw the need there would be for everything of the sort neither vessel had laid in a stock of provisions for a longer period than about twelve months of which nearly half were now gone this allowance applied to salted meats and bread which are usually regarded as the base of a ships stores there were several barrels of flour a few potatoes a large quantity of onions a few barrels of cornmeal or injin as it is usually termed in american parlance an entire barrel of pickled cucumbers another about half full of cabbage preserved in the same way and an entire barrel of molasses in addition there was a cask of whiskey a little wine and brandy to be used medicinally sugar brown whiteybrown and brownywhite and a pretty fair allowance of tea and coffee the former being a hysonskin and the latter san domingo of no very high quality most of these articles were transported from the wreck to the house in the course of the few days that succeeded though daggett insisted on a certain portion of the supplies being left in his stranded craft not until this was done would roswell listen to any proposal of daggetts to transfer the skins twice during these few days indeed did the vineyard master come to a pause in his proceedings as the weather grew milder and gleams of a hope of being able yet to get away that season crossed his mind on the last of these occasions of misgiving roswell was compelled to lead his brother master up on the plain of the island to an elevation of some three hundred feet above the level of the ocean and more than half that distance higher than the house and point out to him a panorama of fieldice that the eye could not command until that vast plain opened or became riven by the joint action of the agitated ocean and the warmth of a sun from which the rays did not glance away from the frozen surface like light obliquely received and as obliquely reflected from a mirror it was useless to think of releasing even the uninjured vessel much less that which lay riven and crushed on the rocks  were every cake of this ice melted into water daggett roswell continued it would not float off your schooner the best supplied shipyard in america could hardly furnish the materials for ways to launch her and i never knew of a vessels being dropped into the water some twenty feet nearly perpendicular  i dont know that answered daggett stoutly see what theyre doing nowadays and think nothing of it i have seen a whole row of brick houses turned round by the use of jackscrews and one building actually taken down a hill much higher than the distance you name commodore rodgers has just hauled a heavy frigate out of the water and means to put her back again when he has done with her what has been done once can be done twice i do not like giving up till im forced to it  that is plain enough captain daggett returned roswell smiling that you are game no one can deny but it will all come to nothing neither commodore rodgers nor commodore anybody else could put your craft into the water again without something to do it with  you think it would be asking too much to take your schooner and go across to the main next season ater timber to make ways put in daggett inquiringly she stands up like a church and nothing would be easier than to lay down ways under her bottom  or more difficult than to make them of any use after you had put them there no no my good sir you must think no more of this though it may be possible to make a cover for the cargo and return and recover it all by freighting a craft from rio on our way north  daggett gave a quick inquisitive glance at his companion and roswells colour mounted to his cheeks for while he really thought the plan just mentioned quite feasible he was conscious of foreseeing that it might be made the means of throwing off his troublesome companion as he himself drew near to the west indies and their keys  this terminated the discussion for the time both of the masters busied themselves in carrying on the duty which had now fallen into a regular train as much of the interest of what is to be related will depend on what was done in these few days it may be well to be a little more explicit in stating the particulars  the reader will understand that the house of which so much had already been made by our mariners was nothing but a shell it had a close roof one that effectually turned water and its siding though rough was tight and rather thicker than is usual being made of common inch boards roughly planed and originally painted red there were four very tolerable windows and a decent substantial floor of planed plank all this had been well put together rather more attention than is often bestowed on such structures having been paid by the carpenter to the cracks and joints on account of the known sharpness of the climate even in the warm months still all this made a mere shell the marrowfreezing winds which would soon comehad indeed comemight be arrested by such a covering it is true but the little needlelike particles of the frost would penetrate such a shelter as their counterparts of steel pierce cloth it was a matter of life and death therefore to devise means to exclude the cold in order that the vital heat might be kept in circulation during the tremendous season that was known to be approaching  stimson had much to say on the subject of the arrangements taken he was the oldest man in the two crews and the most experienced sealer it happened that he had once passed a winter at orange harbour in the immediate vicinity of cape horn it is true that is an inhabited country if the poor degraded creatures who dwell there can be termed inhabitants and has its trees and vegetation such as they are the difference between orange harbour and sealers land in this respect must be something like that which all the travelling world knows to exist between a winters residence at the hospital of the great st bernard and a winters residence at one of the villages a few leagues lower down the mountain at sealers land if there was literally no vegetation there was so little as scarcely to deserve the name of fuel there was none with the exception of that which had been brought there nevertheless the experience of a winter passed at such a place as orange harbour must count for a great deal cape horn is in nearly 56° and sealers landwe may as well admit this muchis by no means 10° to the southward of that there must be a certain general resemblance in the climates of the two places and he who had gone through a winter at one of them must have had a very tolerable foretaste of what was to be suffered at the other this particular experience therefore added to his general knowledge as well as to his character contributed largely to stephens influence in the consultations that took place between the two masters at which he was usually present  its useless to be playing off in an affair like this captain garner said stephen on one occasion away from this spot all the navies of the arth could not now carry us until gods sun comes back in his course to drive the winter away afore it i have my misgivins gentlemen touching this great floe that has got jammed in among these islands whether it will ever move agin for i dont think its coming in here is a common matter  in which case what would become of us stephen  why sir we should be at gods marcy then jist as we be now or would be was we on the east eend itself i wont say that two resolute and strong arms might not cut a way through for one little craft like ourn if they had summer fully afore em and knowd they was aworkin towards a frind instead of towards an inimy theres a great deal in the last every man is encouraged when he thinks hes nearer to the eend of his journey ater a hard days work than he was when he set out in the mornin but to undertake sich an expedition at this season would be sartain destruction no sir all we can do now is to lay up for the winter and that with great care and prudence we must turn ourselves into so many ants and show their forethought and care  what would you recommend as our first step stimson asked daggett who had been an attentive listener  i would advise sir to begin hardening the men as soon as i could we have too much fire in the stove both for our stock of wood and for the good of the people make the men sleep under fewer clothes and dont let any on ern hang about the galley fire as some on em love to do even now most desperately them ere men will be good for nothin ten weeks hence unless theyre taken off the fires as a body would take off a pot or a kettle and are set out to harden  this is a process that may be easier advised than performed perhaps roswell quietly observed  dont you believe that captain garner ive known the most shiverin smokedried hands in a large crew hardened and brought to an edge ater a little trouble as a body would temper an axe with steel the first thing to be done is to make em scrub one another every mornin in cold water this gives a life to the skin that acts much the same as a suit of clothes yes gentlemen put a fellow in a tub for a minute or two of a mornin and you may do almost anything you please with him all day aterwards one pail of water is as good as a peejacket and above all things keep the stoves clear the cooks should be told not to drive their fires so hard and we can do without the stove in the sleepingroom a great deal better now than most on us think it will help to save much wood if we begin at once to caulk and thicken our siding and make the house warmer was the hut in a good state we might do without any other fire than that in the camboose for two months yet  such was the general character of stephens counsel and very good advice it was not only did roswell adopt the scrubbing process which enabled him to throw aside a great many clothes in the course of a week but he kept aloof from the fires to harden as stimson had called it that which was thus enforced by example was additionally enjoined by precept several large hulking idle fellows who greatly loved the fire were driven away from it by shame and the heat was allowed to diffuse itself more equally through the building  any one who has ever had occasion to be a witness of the effect of the watercure process in enabling even delicate women to resist cold and damp may form some notion of the great improvement that was made among our sealers by adopting and rigidly adhering to stimsons cold water and nofire system those who had shivered at the very thoughts of icewater soon dabbled in it like young ducks and there was scarcely an hour in the day when the halfhogshead that was used as a bath had not its tenant this tub was placed on the ice of the cove with a tent over it and a well was made through which the water was drawn of course the axe was in great request a new hole being required each morning and sometimes two or three times in the course of the day the effect of these ablutions was very soon apparent the men began to throw aside their peejackets and worked in their ordinary clothing which was warm and suited to a high latitude with a spirit and vigour at which they were themselves surprised the fire in the camboose sufficed as yet and at evening the peejacket with the shelter of the building the crowded rooms and the warm meals for a long time enabled them to get on without consuming anything in the largest stove stimsons plans for the protection of the hut moreover soon began to tell the skins sails and much of the rigging were brought over from the wreck by means of the carts so long as there was no snow and by means of sledges when the snow fell and rendered wheeling difficult luckily the position of the road along the rocks caused the upper snow to melt a little at noonday while it froze again firmer and firmer each night the crust soon bore and it was found that the sledges furnished even better means of transportation than the wheels  there was a little controversy about the use of the skins daggett continuing to regard them as cargo necessity and numbers prevailed in the end and the whole building was lined with them four or five deep by placing them inside of beckets made of the smaller rigging by stuffing these skins compactly within ropes so placed as to keep all snug a very material defence against the entrance of cold was interposed but this was not all inside of the skins stimson got up hangings of canvass using the sails of the wreck for that purpose it was not necessary to cut these sailsdaggett would not have suffered itbut they were suspended and crammed into openings and otherwise so arranged as completely to conceal and shelter every side as well as the ceilings of both rooms portions were fitted with such address as to fall before the windows to which they formed very warm if not very ornamental curtains stephen however induced roswell to order outside shutters to be made and hung maintaining that one such shutter would soon count as a dozen cords of wood  much of the wood too was brought over from the wreck and that which had been carelessly abandoned on the rocks was all collected and piled carefully and conveniently near the outer door of the hut which door by the way looked inward or towards the rocks in the rear of the building where it opened on a sort of yard that roswell hoped to be able to keep clear of ice and snow throughout the winter he might as well have expected to melt the glaciers of grindewald by lighting a fire on the meadows at their base  stephen had another project to protect the house and to give facilities for moving outside when the winter should be at the hardest in his experience at orange harbour he had found that great inconvenience was sustained in consequence of the snows melting around the building he inhabited which came from the warmth of the fire within to avoid this a very serious evil he had spare sails of heavy canvass laid across the roof of the warehouse a building of no great height and secured them to the rocks below by means of anchors kedges and various other devices in some instances by lashings to projections in the cliffs spare spars leaning from the roof supported this tentlike covering and props beneath sustained the spars this arrangement was made on only two sides of the building one end and the side which looked to the north materials failing before the whole place was surrounded the necessity for admitting light too admonished the sealers of the inexpediency of thus shrouding all their windows the bottom of this tent was only ten feet from the side of the house which gave it greater security than if it had been more horizontal while it made a species of verandah in which exercise could be taken with greater freedom than in the rooms everything was done to strengthen the building in all its parts that the ingenuity of seamen could suggest and particularly to prevent the tentverandah from caving in  stephen intimated that their situation possessed one great advantage as well as disadvantage in consequence of standing on a shelf with a lower terrace so close as to be within the cast of a shovel the snow might be thrown below and the hut relieved the melted snow too would be apt to take the same direction under the law that governs the course of all fluids the disadvantage was in the barrier of rock behind the hut which while it served admirably to break the piercing south winds would very naturally tend to make high snowbanks in drifting storms     chapter xxiv      my foot on the iceberg has lighted   when hoarse the wild winds veer about   my eye when the bark is benighted   sees the lamp of the lighthouse

the situation and pursuits of the men in that time all was done that the season would allow the house being considered as complete and far from uncomfortable the days had rapidly lessened in length and the nights increased proportionably until the sun was visible only for a few hours at a time and then merely passing low along the northern horizon the cold increased in proportion though the weather varied almost as much in that high latitude as it does in our own it had ceased to thaw much however and the mean of the thermometer was not many degrees above zero notwithstanding this low range of the mercury the men found that they were fast getting acclimated and that they could endure a much greater intensity of cold than they had previously supposed possible as yet there had been nothing to surprise natives of new york and new england there rarely occurring a winter in which weather quite as cold as any they had yet experienced in the antarctic sea does not set in and last for some little time even while writing this very chapter of our legend here in the mountains of otsego one of these siberian visits has been paid to our valley for the last three days the thermometer has ranged at sunrise between 17° and 22° below zero though there is every appearance of a thaw and we may have the mercury up to 40° above in the course of the next twentyfour hours men accustomed to such transitions and such extreme cold are not easily laid up or intimidated  a great deal of snow fell about this particular portion of the year more indeed than at a later period this snow produced the greatest inconvenience for it soon became so deep as to form high banks around the house and to fill all the customary haunts of the men still there were places that were in a great measure exempt from this white mantle the terrace immediately below the hut which has so often been mentioned was one of these bare spots it was so placed as to be swept by both the east and the west winds which generally cleared it of everything like snow as fast as it fell and this more effectually than could be done by a thousand brooms the level of rock usually travelled in going to or from the wreck was another of these clear places it was a sort of shelf too narrow to admit of the snows banking and too much raked by the winds that commonly accompanied snow to suffer the last to lodge to any great depth snow there was with a hard crust as has already been mentioned but it was not snow ten or fifteen feet deep as occurred in many other places there were several points however where banks had formed even on this ledge through which the men were compelled to cut their way by the use of shovels an occupation that gave them exercise and contributed to keep them in health if it was of no other service it was found that the human frame could not endure onehalf the toil in that low state of the mercury that it could bear in one a few degrees higher  daggett had not by any means abandoned his craft as much as he had permitted her to be dismantled every day or two he had some new expedient for getting the schooner off in the spring though all who heard them were perfectly convinced of their impracticableness this feeling induced him to cause his own men to keep open the communication and scarce a day passed in which he did not visit the poor unfortunate craft nor was the place without an interest of a very peculiar sort it has been said that the fragments of ice some of which were more than a hundred feet in diameter and all of which were eight or ten feet in thickness had been left on their edges inclining in a way to form caverns that extended a great distance now it so happened that just around the wreck the cakes were so distributed as to intercept the first snows which filled the outer passages got to be hardened and covered anew by fresh storms thus interposed an effectual barrier to the admission of any more of the frozen element within the ice the effect was to form a vast range of natural galleries amid the cakes that were quite clear of any snow but that which had adhered to their surfaces and which offered little or no impediment to motionnay which rather aided it by rendering the walking less slippery as the deck of the schooner had been cleared leaving an easy access to all its entrances cabin hold and forecastle this put the vineyard lion under cover while it admitted of all her accommodations being used a portion of her wood had been left in her it will be remembered as well as her camboose the last was got into the cabin and daggett attended by two or three of his hands would pass a good deal of his time there one reason given for this distribution of the forces was the greater room it allowed those who remained at the hut for motion the deck of this vessel being quite clear it offered a very favourable spot for exercise better in fact than the terrace beneath the hut being quite sheltered from the winds and much warmer than it had been originally or ever since the heavy fall of snows commenced daggett paced his quarterdeck hour after hour almost deluding himself with the expectation of sailing for home as soon as the return of summer would permit him to depart  around the hut the snow early made vast embankments every one accustomed to the action of this particular condition of one of the great elements will understand that a bend in the rocks outward or a curve inward must necessarily affect the manner in which these banks were formed the wind did not by any means blow from any one point of the compass though the southwestern cliffs might be almost termed the weatherside of the island so much more frequently did the gales come from that quarter than from any other the cape where the cove lay and where the house had been set up being at the northeastern point and much protected by the high tableland in its rear it occupied the warmest situation in the whole region the winds that swept most of the north shore but which owing to a curvature in its formation did not often blow home to the hut even when they whistled along the terrace only a hundred feet beneath and more salient were ordinarily from the southwest outside though they got a more westerly inclination by following the land under the cliffs  a bank of snow may be either a cause of destruction or a source of comfort of course a certain degree of cold must exist wherever snow is to be found but unless in absolute contact with the human body it does not usually affect the system beyond a certain point on the other hand it often breaks the wind and it has been known to form a covering to flocks houses c that has contributed essentially to their warmth we incline to the opinion that if one slept in a cavern formed in the snow provided he could keep himself dry and did not come in absolute contact with the element he would not find his quarters very uncomfortable so long as he had sufficient clothing to confine the animal warmth near his person now our sealers enjoyed some such advantage as this though not literally in the same degree their house was not covered with snow though a vast bank was already formed quite near it and a good deal had begun to pile against the tent singular as it may seem on the east end of the building and on the south front which looked in towards the cliff next the cove there was scarcely any snow at all this was in part owing to the constant use of the shovel and broom but more so to the currents of air which usually carried everything of so light a nature as a flake to more quiet spots before it was suffered to settle on the ground  roswell early found what his experience as an american might have taught him that the melting of the snow in consequence of the warmth of the fires caused much more inconvenience than the snow itself the latter when dry was easily got along with but when melted in the day and converted into icicles at night it became a most unpleasant and not altogether a safe neighbour inasmuch as there was really danger from the sort of damp atmosphere it produced  the greatest ground of roswell gardiners apprehensions however was for the supply of fuel much of that brought from home had been fairly used in the camboose and in the stove originally set up in the hut large as that stock had been a very sensible inroad had been made upon it and according to a calculation he had made the wood regularly laid in would not hold out much more than half the time that it would be indispensable to remain on the island this was a grave circumstance and one that demanded very serious consideration without fuel it would be impossible to survive no hardening process being sufficient to fortify the human frame to a degree that would resist the influence of an antarctic winter  from the moment it was probable the party would be obliged to pass the winter at sealers land therefore roswell had kept a vigilant eye on the wood stimson had more than once spoken to him on the subject and with great prudence  warmth must be kept among us said the old boatsteerer or there will be no hope for the stoutest man in either crew weve a pretty good stock of coffee and that is better any day than all the rum and whiskey that was ever distilled good hot coffee of a morning will put life into us the coldest day that ever come out of either pole and they do say the south is colder than the north though i never could understand why it should be so  you surely understand the reason why it grows warmer as we approach the equator and colder as we go from it whether we go north or south  stimson assented though had the truth been said he would have been obliged to confess that he knew no more than the facts  all sailors know sich things captain garner though they know it with very different degrees of experence but few get as far south as i have been to pass a winter a good pot of hot coffee of a morning will go as far as a second peejacket if a man has to go out into the open air when the weather is at the hardest  luckily our small stores are quite abundant and we are better off for coffee and sugar than for anything else i laid in of both liberally when we were at rio  yes rio is a good place for the articles but coffee must be hot to do a fellow much good in one of these highlatitude winters and to be hot there must be fuel to heat it  i am afraid the wood will not hold out much more than half the time we shall be here fortunately we had a large supply but the other schooner was by no means as well furnished with fuel as she ought to have been for such a voyage  well sir i suppose you know what must be done next in such a case without warm food men can no more live through one of these winters than they can live without food at all if the vineyard craft has no proper fuel aboard her we must make fuel of her  roswell regarded stephen with fixed attention for some time the idea was presented to his mind for the second time and he greatly liked it  that might do he said though it will not be an easy matter to make captain daggett consent to such a thing  let him go two or three mornings without his warm meal and hot coffee answered stimson shaking his head and he will be glad enough to come into the scheme a man soon gets willing to set fire to anything that will burn in such a climate a notion has been floating about in my mind captain garner that ive several times thought i would mention to you dye think sir any benefit could be made of that volcano over the bay should the worst get to the worst with us  i have thought of the same thing stephen though i fear in vain i suppose no useful heat can be given out there until one gets too near the bad air to breathe it what you say about breaking up the other schooner however is worthy of consideration and i will speak to captain daggett about it  roswell was as good as his word and the vineyard mariner met the proposal as one repels an injury never were our two masters so near a serious misunderstanding as when roswell suggested to daggett the expediency of breaking up the wreck now that the weather was endurable and the men could work with reasonable comfort and tolerable advantage  the man who puts an axe or a saw into that unfortunate craft said daggett firmly i shall regard as an enemy it is a hard enough bed that she lies on without having her ribs and sides torn to pieces by hands  this was the strange spirit in which daggett continued to look at the condition of the wreck it was true that the ice prevented his actually seeing the impossibility of his ever getting his schooner into the water again but no man at all acquainted with mechanics and who knew the paucity of means that existed on the island could for a moment entertain the idle expectation that seemed to have got into the vineyardmasters mind unless subject to a species of oneidea infatuation this infatuation however existed not only in daggetts mind but in some degree in those of his men it is said that in a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom and the axiom comes from an authority too venerable to be disputed but it might almost with equal justice be said that ina multitude of counsellors there is folly for men are quite as apt to sustain each other in the wrong as in the right the individual who would hesitate about advancing his fallacies and mistakes with a single voice does not scruple to proclaim them on the hilltops when he finds other tongues to repeat his errors divine wisdom foreseeing this consequence of human weakness has provided a churchcatholic and proceeding directly from its great head on earth as the repository of those principles facts and laws that it has deemed essential to the furtherance of its own scheme of moral government on earth and yet we see audacious imitators starting up on every side presuming in their ignorance longing in their ambition and envious in these longings who do not scruple to shout out upon the housetops crudities over which knowledge wonders as it smiles and humility weeps as it wonders such is man when sustained by his fellows in every interest of life from religion the highest of all down to the most insignificant of his temporal concerns  in this spirit did daggett and his crew now feel and act roswell had early seen with regret that something like a feeling of party was getting up among the vineyarders who had all along regarded the better fortune of their neighbours with an illconcealed jealousy ever since the shipwreck however this rivalry had taken a new and even less pleasant aspect it was slightly hostile and remarks had been occasionally made that sounded equivocally as if the vineyarders had an intention of separating from the other crew and of living by themselves it is probable however that all this was the fruit of disappointment and that at the bottom nothing very serious was in contemplation daggett had permitted his people to aid in transporting most of the stores to the house though a considerable supply had been left in the wreck this last arrangement was made seemingly without any hostile design but rather in furtherance of a plan to pass as much time as circumstances would allow on board the stranded vessel there was in truth a certain convenience in this scheme that commended it to the good sense of all so long as any portion of the vineyarders could be made comfortable in the wreck it was best they should remain there for it saved the labour of transporting all the provisions and made more room to circulate in and about the house the necessity of putting so many casks barrels and boxes within doors had materially circumscribed the limits and space was a great desideratum for several reasons health in particular  roswell was glad therefore when any of the vineyarders expressed a wish to go to the wreck and to pass a few days there with a view to encourage this disposition as well as to ascertain how those fared who chose that abode he paid daggett a visit and passed a night or two himself in the cabin of the craft this experiment told him that it was very possible to exist there when the thermometer stood at zero but how it would do when ranging a great deal lower he had his doubts the cabin was small and a very moderate fire in the camboose served to keep it reasonably warm though daggett at all times a reasonable and reasoning man when the root of all evil did not sorely beset him came fully into his own views as to the necessity of husbanding the fuel and of hardening the men none of that close stewing over stoves which is so common in america and which causes onehalf of the winter diseases of the climate was tolerated in either gang daggett saw the prudence of roswells or rather of stimsons system and fell into it freely and with hearty goodwill it was during gardiners visit to the wreck that our two masters talked over their plans for the winter while taking their exercise on the schooners deck each well muffled up to prevent the frost from taking hold of the more exposed parts every one had a sealskin cap made in a way to protect the ears and most of the face and our two masters were thus provided in common with their men  i suppose that we are to consider this as pleasant winter weather roswell remarked the thermometer being down only at zero stimson tells me that even at orange harbour the season he was there they paid out mercury until it all got into the ball a month or two hence we may look out for the season of frosts as the injins call it you will hardly think of staying out here when the really hard weather sets in  i do not believe we shall feel the cold much more than we do now this daily washing is a capital stove for i find all hands say that when it is once over they feel like new men as for me i shall stick by my craft while there is a timber left in her to float  roswell thought how absurd it was to cling thus to a useless mass of wood and iron and copper but he said nothing on that subject  i am now sorry that we took over to the house so many of our supplies daggett continued after a short pause i am afraid that many of them will have to be brought back again  that would hardly quit cost daggett it would be better to come over and pass the heel of the winter with us when the supplies get to be short here as we eat we make room in the hut you know and you will be so much the more comfortable an empty porkbarrel was broken up for the camboose yesterday morning  we shall seewe shall see gardner my men have got a notion that your people intend to break up this schooner for fuel should they not keep an anchorwatch aboard her  anchorwatch repeated roswell smiling it is well namedif there ever was an anchorwatch you keep it here for no groundtackle will ever hold like this  we still think the schooner may be got off daggett said regarding his companion inquiringly  while the vineyardman had a certain distrust of his brothermaster he had also a high respect for his fairdealing propensities and a strong disposition to put confidence in his good faith the look that he now gave was if possible to read the real opinion of the other in a countenance that seldom deceived  i shall be grateful to god captain daggett returned roswell after a short pause if we get through the long winter of this latitude without burning too much of both craft than will be for our good surely it were better to begin on that which is in the least serviceable condition  i have thought this matter over garner with all my mindhave dreamt of itslept on ithad it before me at all hours and in all weathers and look at it as i will it is full of difficulties will you agree to take in a halfcargo of my skins and iles next season and make in all respect a joint vyge of it from home home agin if well consent to let this craft be burned  it exceeds my power to make any such bargain i have an owner who looks sharply after his property and my crew are upon lays like the people of all sealers you ask too much and you forget that should i assume the same power over my own craft as you still claim in this wreck you might never find the means of getting away from the group at all we are not obliged to receive you on board our schooner  i know you think garner that it will be impossible for us ever to get our craft off but you overlook one thing that we may dowhat is there to prevent our breaking her up and of using the materials to make a smaller vessel one of sixty tons sayin which we might get home besides taking most of our skins  i will not say that will be impossible but i do say it will be very difficult it would be wiser for you in my judgment to leave your cargo in the house under the keeping of a few hands if you see fit and go off with me i will land you at rio where you can almost always find some small american craft to come south in and pick up your leavings if you choose that the men left behind should amuse themselves in your absence by building a small craft i am certain they will meet with no opposition from me there is but one place where a vessel can be launched and that is the spot in the cove where we beached your schooner there it might possibly be done though i think not without a great deal of trouble and possibly not without more means than are to be picked up along shore in this group but there is a very important fact that you overlook daggett which it may be as well to mention here as to delay it your craft or mine must be used as fuel this winter or we shall freeze to death to a man i have made the calculations closely and certain as our existence there is no alternative between such a death and the use of the fuel i have mentioned  not a timber of mine shall be touched i do not believe onehalf of these stories about the antarctic winter which cannot be much worse than what a body meets with up in the bay of fundy  a winter in the bay of fundy without fuel must be bad enough but it is a mere circumstance to one here i should think that a man who has tasted an antarctic summer and autumn must get a pretty lively notion of what is to come after them  the men can keep in their berths much of the time and save wood there are many other ways of getting through a winter than burning a vessel i shall never consent to a stick of this good crafts going into the galleyfire as long as i can see my way clear to prevent it i would burn cargo before i would burn my craft  roswell wondered at this pertinacity but he trusted to the pressure of the coming season and changed the subject certainly the thought of breaking up his own craft did not cross his mind though he could see no sufficient objection to the other side of the proposition as discussion was useless however he continued to converse with daggett on various practical subjects on which his companion was rational and disposed to learn  it had been ascertained by experiment that the water at a considerable depth was essentially warmer beneath the ice than at its surface a plan had been devised by which the lower currents of the water could be pumped up for the purposes of the bath thus rendering the process far more tolerable than it had previously been bathing in extremely cold weather however is not as formidable a thing as is generally supposed the air being at a lower temperature than the water as the greatest importance was attached to these daily ablutions the subject was gone over between the two masters in all its bearings there were no conveniences for the operation at the wreck and this was one reason why roswell suggested that a residence there ought to be abandoned daggett dissented and invited his companion to take a walk in his caverns  a promenade in a succession of caves formed of ice with the thermometer at zero would naturally strike one as a somewhat chilling amusement gardiner did not find it so he was quite protected from the wind which gives so much pungency to bitter cold rendering it insupportable completely protected from this and warmed by the exertion of clambering among the cakes roswells blood was soon in a healthful glow and to own the truth when he left the wreck it was with a much better opinion of it as a place of residence than when he had arrived to pay his visit  as there was now nothing for the men to do in the way of preparation modes of amusement were devised that might unite activity of body with that of the mind the snows ceased to fall as the season advanced and there were but few places on which heavy burthens might not have been transported over their crusts it was indeed easier moving about on the surface of the frozen snow than it had been on the naked rocks the latter offering obstacles that no longer showed themselves sliding down the declivities and even skating were practised few northern americans being ignorant of the latter art various other sources of amusement were resorted to but it was found generally that very little exercise in the open air exhausted the frame and that a great difficulty of breathing occurred still it was thought necessary to health that the men should remain as much as possible out of the crowded house and various projects were adopted to keep up the vital warmth while exposed ere the month of july had passed which corresponds to our january it had been found expedient to make dresses of skins for which fortunately the materials abounded  as the season advanced the idea of preserving more than the lives of his men was gradually abandoned by gardiner though daggett still clung to his wreck and actually had wood transported back to it that he might stay as much as possible near his property there was no longer any thawing though there were very material gradations in the intensity of the frosts occasionally it was quite possible to remain in the open air an hour or two at a time then again there were days in which it exceeded the powers of human endurance to remain more than a few minutes removed to any distance from heat artificially procured on the whole however it was found that the comparatively moderate weather predominated and it was rare indeed that all the people did not pursue their avocations and amusements outside at what was called the middle of the day  and what a meridian it was the shortest day had passed some time when roswell and stimson were walking together on the terrace then as usual as clear from snow as if swept by a broom but otherwise wearing the aspect of interminable winter in common with all around it they were conversing as had been much their wont of late and were watching the passage of the sun as he stole along the northern horizon even at high noon rising but a very few degrees above it  it has a cold look sir but it does give out some heat said stephen as he faced the luminary in one of his turns i can feel a little warmth from it just now sheltered us we are here under the cliffs and with a background of naked rock to throw back what reaches us to me all these changes in the movements of the sun seem very strange captain garner but i know im ignorant and that others may well know all about what i do not understand  here gardiner undertook to explain the phenomena that have been slightly treated on in our own pages there are few americans so ignorant as not to be fully aware that the sun has no sensible motion or any motion that has an apparent influence on our own planet but fewer still clearly comprehend the reasons of those very changes that are occurring constantly before their eyes we cannot say that captain gardiner succeeded very well in his undertaking though he imprinted on the old boatsteerers mind the fact that the sun would not be seen at all were they only a few degrees farther south than they actually were  and now sir i suppose hell get higher and higher every day put in stephen until he comes quite up above our heads  not exactly that at noon though abeam as it might be mornings and evenings  still the coldest of our weather is yet to come or i have no experence in such things why does not the heat come back with the sunor what seems to be the sun coming back though as you tell me captain garner its only the arth sheering thisaway and thataway in her course  one may well ask such a questionbut cold produces cold and it takes time to wear it out february is commonly the coldest month in the year even in america though days any one in february march and even april are months i dread here and that so much the more stephen because our fuel goes a good deal faster than i could wish  what you say is very true sir still the people must have fire i turned out this morning while all hands were still in their berths and looked to the stove and it was as much as human natur could bear to be about without my cap and skincovering though indoors the whole time if the weather goes on as it has begun we shall have to keep a watch at the stove nor do i think one stove will answer us much longer we shall want another in the sleepingroom  heaven knows where the wood is to come from unless captain daggett gives up the wreck we shall certainly be out long before the mild season returns  we must keep ourselves warm sir by reading the bible answered stimson smiling though the glance he cast at his officer was earnest and anxious you must not forget captain garner that youve promised one who is praying for you daily to go through the chapters she has marked and give the matter a patient and attentive thought no sealin sir can be half as important as this reading of the good book in the right spirit  so you believe that jesus was the son of god exclaimed roswell half inquiringly and half in a modified sort of levity  as much as i believe that we are here sir i wish i was half as certain of our ever getting away  what has caused you to believe this stimsonreason or the talk of your mother and of the parson  my mother died afore i could listen to her talk sir and very little have i had to do with parsons for the want of being where they are to be found faith tells me to believe this and faith comes from god  and i could believe it too were faith imparted to me from the same source as it is i fear i shall never believe in what appears to me to be an impossibility  then followed a long discussion in which ingenuity considerable command of language human pride and worldly sentiments contended with that clear intuitive deep conviction which it is the pleasure of the deity often to bestow on those who would otherwise seem to be unfitted to become the repositories of so great a gift as we shall have to deal with this part of our subject more particularly hereafter we shall not enlarge on it here but pursue the narrative as it is connected with the advance of the season and the influence the latter exerted over the whole party of the lost sealers     chapter xxv      beyond the jewish ruler banded close   a company full glorious i saw   the twelve apostles stand o with what looks   of ravishment and joy what rapturous tears   what hearts of ecstacy they gazed again   on their beloved master    hillhouses judgment   it has become necessary to advance the season to the beginning of the month of october which corresponds to our own april in a temperate climate this would mark the opening of spring and the reviving hopes of a new and genial season would find a place in every bosom not so at sealers land so long as the winter was at its height and the clear steady cold continued by falling into a system so prepared as to meet the wants of such a region matters had gone on regularly if not with comfort and as yet the personal disasters were confined to a few frozen cheeks and noses the results of carelessness and wanton exposure rather than of absolute necessity but one who had seen the place in july and who examined it now would find many marks of change not to say of deterioration  in the first place a vast deal of snow had fallen fallen indeed to such a degree as even to cover the terrace block up the path that communicated with the wreck and nearly to smother the house and all around it the winds were high and piercing rendering the cold doubly penetrating the thermometer now varied essentially sometimes rising considerably above zero though oftener falling far below it there had been many storms in september and october was opening with a most blustering and wintry aspect in one sense however the character of the season had changed the dry equal cold that was generally supportable having been succeeded by tempests that were sometimes a little moist but oftener of intense frigidity of course the equinox was past and there were more than twelve hours of sun the great luminary showed himself well above the northern horizon and though his circuit described an arch that did not promise soon to bring him near the zenith at meridian it was a circuit that seemed about to enclose sealers land by carrying the orb of day so far south morning and evening as to give it an air of travelling round the spot  these changes had not occurred without suffering and danger enormous icicles were suspended from the roof of the house reaching to the ground the third and fourth successions of these signs of heat and cold united the earlier formations having been knocked down and thrown away mountains of drifted snow were to be seen in places all along the shore and wreaths that threatened fearful avalanches were suspended from the cliffs waiting only for the increase of the warmth to come down upon the rocks beneath once already had one of these masses fallen on the wreck and the oyster pond men had been busy for a week digging into the pile in order to go to the rescue of the vineyarders there was much generosity and charitable feeling displayed in this act for owing to the obstinate adherence of daggett and his people to what they deemed their rights roswell had finally been compelled to cut to pieces the upper works of his own schooner to obtain fuel that might prevent his own party from freezing to death the position of the sea lion of oyster pond was to be traced only by a high mound of snow which had been arrested by the obstacle she presented to its drift but her bulwarks planks deck toptimbers sternframein short nearly all of the vessel above water had actually been taken to pieces and carried within the covering of the verandah mentioned in readiness for the stoves  to render the obstinacy of the other crew more apparent daggett had been obliged to do the same much of his beloved craft had already disappeared in the camboose and more was likely to follow this compelled destruction however rather increased than lessened his pertinacity he clung to the last chip and no terms of compromise would he now listen to at all the stranded wreck was his and his peoples while the other wreck belonged to the men from oyster pond let each party act for itself and take care of its own such were his expressed opinions and on them he acted  this state of things had not been brought about in a day months had passed roswell had seen his last billet of wood put in the camboose had tried various experiments for producing heat by means of oil which so far succeeded as to enable the ordinary boiling to be done thereby saving wood but when a cold turn set in it was quickly found that the schooner must go or all hands perish when this decree went forth every one understood that the final preservation of the party depended on that of the boats for one entire day the question had been up in general council whether or not the two whaleboats should be burnt with their oars and appurtenances before the attack was made on the schooner itself stimson settled this point as he did so many others roswell listening to all he said with a constantly increasing attention  if we burn the boats first said the boatsteerer and then have to come to the schooner ater all how are we ever to get away from this group them boats wouldnt last us a week even in our best weather but they may answer to take us to some christian land when every rib and splinter of the sea lion is turned into ashes i would begin on the upper works of the schooner first captain garner resarvin the spars though they would burn the freest then i would saw away the toptimbers beams decks transoms and everything down within a foot of the water but i wouldnt touch anything below the copper for this here reason unless captain daggett sets to work on his craft and burns her up altogether we may find materals enough in the spring to deck over agin the poor thing down there in the cove and fit her out ater a fashion and make much better weather of it in her than in our boats thats my opinion sir  it was decided that this line of conduct should be pursued the upper works of the schooner were all taken out of her as soon as the weather permitted and the wood was carried up and stored in the house even with this supply it was soon seen that great economy was to be used and that there might be the necessity of getting at the vessels bottom as for the schooner as the people still affectionately called the hull or what was left of the hull everything had been taken out of her the frozen oil was carried up to the house in chunks and used for fuel and lights a good deal of heat was obtained by making large wicks of canvass and placing them in vessels that contained oil though it was very far from sufficing to keep life in the men during the hardest of the weather the utmost economy in the use of the fuel that had been so dearly obtained was still deemed allessential to eventual preservation happily the season advanced all this time and the month of october was reached the intercourse between the crews had by no means been great during the two solemn and critical months that were just past a few visits had been exchanged at noonday and when the thermometer was a little above zero but the snow was filling the path and as yet there were no thaws to produce a crust on which the men might walk  about a month previously to the precise time to which it is our intention now to advance the more regular action of the legend macy had come over to the house attended by one man with a proposal on the part of daggett for the two crews to occupy his craft as he still persisted in calling the wreck and of using the house as fuel this was previously to beginning to break up either vessel gardiner had thought of this plan in connection with his own schooner a scheme that would have been much more feasible than that now proposed on account of the difference in distance but it had soon been abandoned all the material of the building was of pine and that well seasoned a wood that burns like tinder no doubt there would have been a tolerably comfortable fortnight or three weeks by making these sacrifices then would have come certain destruction  as to the proposal of daggett there were many objections to it a want of room would be one want of provisions another and there would be the necessity of transporting stores bedding and a hundred things that were almost as necessary to the people as warmth and which indeed contributed largely to their warmth in addition was the objection just mentioned of the insufficiency of the materials of the building an objection which was just as applicable to a residence in one vessel as a residence in the other of course the proposition was declined  macy remained a night with the oyster ponders and left the house after breakfast next morning knowing that daggett only waited for his return with a negative to commence breaking up the wreck the mate was attended by the seaman returning as he had arrived two days later there having been a slight yielding of the snow under the warmth of the noonday sun and a consequent hardening of its crust in the succeeding night roswell and stimson undertook to return this visit with a view to make a last effort to persuade daggett to quit the wreck and come over to the house altogether when they had got about halfway between the two places they found the body of the seaman stiff frozen hard and dead a quarter of a mile further on the reckless macy who it was supposed greatly sustained daggett in his obstinacy was found in precisely the same state both had fallen in the path and stiffened under the terrible power of the climate it was not without difficulty that roswell reached the wreck and reported what he had seen even this terrible admonition did not change daggetts purpose he had begun to burn his vessel for there was now no alternative but he was doing it on a system which as he explained it to roswell was not only to leave him materials with which to construct a smaller craft in the spring but which would allow of his inhabiting the steerage and cabin as long as he pleased  in some respects the wreck certainly had its advantages over the house there was more room for exercise the caverns of the ice being extensive while they completely excluded the wind which was now the great danger of the season it was doubtless owing to the wind that macy and his companion had perished as the spring approached these winds increased in violence though there had been slight symptoms of their coming more blandly even at the time when their colder currents were really frightful  a whole month succeeded this visit of roswells during which there was no intercourse it was september the march of the antarctic circle and the weather had been terrific during most of the period it was during these terrible four weeks that roswell completed his examination of the allimportant subject mary had marked out for him and which stimson had so earnestly and so often placed before his mind the sudden fate of macy and his companion the condition of his crew and all the serious circumstances with which he was surrounded conspired to predispose him to inquiry and what was equally important in such an investigation to humility man is a very different being in high prosperity from what he becomes when the blows of an evil fortune or the visitations of divine providence alight upon him the skepticism of roswell was more the result of human pride of confidence in himself than in any precept derived from others or of any deep reasoning process whatever he conceived that the theory of the incarnation of the son of god was opposed to philosophy and experience it is true and thus far he may be said to have reasoned in the matter though it was in his own way and with a very contracted view of the subject but pride had much more to do with even this conclusion than a knowledge of physics or philosophy it did not comport with the respect he entertained for his own powers to lend his faith to an account that conflicted with so many of the opinions he had formed on evidence and practice credulous women might have their convictions on the truth of this history but it was not necessary for men to be as easily duped there was something even amiable and attractive in this weakness of the other sex that would ill comport however with the greater sternness of masculine judgment roswell as he once told stimson hesitated to believe in anything that he could not comprehend his god must be worshipped for the obvious truth of his attributes and existence he wished to speak with respect of things that so many worthy people reverenced but he could not forget that providence had made him a reasoning creature and his reason must be convinced stephen was no great logician as the reader will easily understand but newton possessed no clearer demonstration of any of his problems than this simple nay ignorant man enjoyed in his religious faith through the divine illumination it had received in the visit of the holy spirit  that gloomy month however had not been thrown away all the men were disposed to be serious and the reading of the bible openly and aloud soon became a favourite occupation with every one of them although roswells reading was directed by the marks of mary all of which had reference to those passages that touched on the divinity of the saviour he made no comments that betrayed his incredulity there is a simple earnestness in the narrative portions of the gospel that commends its truth to every mind and it had its effect on that of roswell gardiner though it failed to remove doubts that had so long been cherished and which had their existence in pride of reason or what passes for such with those who merely skim the surface of things as they seem to exist around them  on the evening of that particular day in october to which we desire now to advance the time and after the most pleasant and cheerful afternoon and sunset that any on the island had seen for many months roswell and stimson ventured to continue their exercise on the terrace then again clear of impediments even after the day had closed the night promised to be cold but the weather was not yet so keen as to drive them to a shelter both fancied there was a feeling of spring in the wind which was from the northeast a quarter that brought the blandest currents of air into those seas if any air of that region deserved such a term at all  it is high time we had some communications with the vineyarders said roswell as they turned at that end of the terrace which was nearest to the wreck a full month has passed since we have seen any of them or have heard a syllable of their doings or welfare  its a bad business this separation captain garner returned the boatsteerer and every hour makes it worse think how much good might have been done them young men had they only been with us while weve been reading the book of books night and morning sir  that good book seems to fill most of your thoughts stepheni wish i could have your faith  it will come in time sir if you will only strive for it im sure no heart could have been harder than mine was until within the last five years i was far worse as a christian captain garner than i consider you to be for while you have doubts consarning the divinity of our blessed lord i had no thought of any one of the trinity my only god was the world and sich a world too as a poor sailor knows it was being but little better than the brutes  of all the men with me you seem to be the most contented and happy i cannot say i have seen even a sign of fear about you when things have been at the worst  it would be very ungrateful sir to mistrust a providence that has done so much for me  i devoutly wish i could believe with you that jesus was the son of god  excuse me captain garner its jist because you do not devoutly wish this that you do not believe i think i understand the natur of your feelins sir i had some sich once myself though it was only in a small way i was too ignorant to feel much pride in my own judgment and soon gave up every notion that went agin scriptur i own it is not accordin to natur as we know natur to believe in this doctrine but we know too little of a thousand things to set up our weak judgments in the very face of revelation  i am quite willing to believe all i can understand stephen but i find it difficult to credit accounts that are irreconcilable with all that my experience has taught me to be true  they who are of your way of thinkin sir do not deny that christ was a good man and a prophet and that the apostles were good men and prophets and that they all worked miracles  this much i am willing enough to believe but the other doctrine seems contrary to what is possible  yet you have seen sir that these apostles believed what you refuse one thing has crossed my mind captain garner which i wish to say to you i know im but an ignorant man and my idees may be hardly worth your notice but sich as they be i want to lay em afore you we are told that these apostles were all men from a humble class in life with little larnin chosen as it might be to show men that faith stood in need of no riches or edication or worldly greatness of any sort to me sir there is a wholesome idee in that one thing  it gives us all a useful lesson stephen and has often been mentioned i believe in connection with the doctrines of christianity  yes sirso i should think though i dont remember ever to have heard it named from any pulpit well captain garner it does not agree with our notions to suppose that god himself a part of the ruler and master of the universe should be born of a woman and come among sinners in order to save em from his own just judgments  that is just the difficulty that i have in believing what are called the dogmas of christianity on that one point to me it has ever seemed the most improbable thing in the world  just so siri had some sort of feelin of that natur myself once when god in his goodness put it into my heart to believe however as he was pleased to do in a fit of sickness from which i never expected to rise and in which i was led to pray to him for assistance i began to think over all these matters in my own foolish manner among other things i said to myself is it likely that any mortal man would dream of calling christ the son of god unless it was put into his mind to say so then comes the characters of them men who all admit were upright and religious how can we suppose that they would agree in giving the same account of sich a thing unless what they said had been told to them by some tongue that they believed  roswell smiled at stephens reasoning which was not without a certain point but which an ingenious man might find the means of answering in various ways  there is another thing sir that ive read in a book resumed the boatsteerer which goes a great way with me jesus allowed others to call him the son of god without rebuking them for doing so it does really seem that they who believe he was a good man as i understand is the case with you captain garner must consider this as a strong fact we are to remember what a sin idolatry is how much all raal worshippers abhor it and then set that feelin side by side with the fact that the son did riot think it robbery to be called the equal of the father to me that looks like a proof that our belief has a solid foundation  roswell did not reply he was aware that it would not be just to hold any creed responsible for the manner in which a person like stimson defended it still he was struck with both of this mans facts the last he had often met in books but the first was new to him of the two this novel idea of the improbability of the apostles inventing that which would seem to be opposed to all mens notions and prejudices struck him more forcibly than the argument adduced from the acquiescence of the redeemer in his own divinity the last might be subject to verbal criticism and could possibly be explained away as he imagined but the first appeared to be intimately incorporated with the entire history of christs ministrations on earth these were the declarations of john the baptist the simple and unpretending histories of the gospels the commentaries of st paul and the venerable teachings of the church through so many centuries of varying degrees of faith and contention each and all going to corroborate a doctrine that in his eyes had appeared to be so repugnant to philosophy and reason wishing to be alone roswell gave an order to stimson to execute some duty that fell to his share and continued walking up and down the terrace alone for quite an hour longer  the night was coming in cold and still it was one of those last efforts of winter in which all the terrible force of the season was concentrated and it really appeared as if nature wearied with its struggle to return to a more genial temperature yielded in despair and was literally returning backwards through the coldest of her months the moon was young but the stars gave forth a brightness that is rarely seen except in the clear cold nights of a high latitude each and all of these sublime emblems of the power of god were twinkling like bright torches glowing in space and the mind had only to endow each with its probable or known dimensions its conjectural and reasonable uses to form a picture of the truest sublimity in which man is made to occupy his real position in this world where in a certain sense he is master where all things are apparently under his influence if not absolutely subject to his control where little that is distinctly visible is to be met with that does seem to be created to meet his wants or to be wholly at his disposal one gets a mistaken and frequently a fatal notion of his true place in the scale of the beings who are intended to throng around the footstool of the almighty as the animalculae of the atmospheric air bear a proportion to things visible so would this throng seem to bear a proportion to our vague estimates of the spiritual hosts all this roswell was very capable of feeling and in some measure of appreciating and never before had he been made so conscious of his own insignificance as he became while looking on the firmament that night glowing with its bright worlds and suns doubtless the centres of other systems in which distance swallowed up the lesser orbs  almost every one has heard or read of that collection of stars which goes by the name of the southern cross the resemblance to the tree on which christ suffered is not particularly striking though all who navigate the southern hemisphere know it and recognize it by its imputed appellation it now attracted roswells gaze and coming as it did after so much reading so many conversations with stephen and addressing itself to one whose heart was softened by the fearful circumstances that had so long environed the sealers it is not surprising that it brought our young master to meditate seriously on his true condition in connection with the atonement that he was willing to admit had been made for him in common with all of earth at the very moment he hesitated to believe that the sufferer was in any other than a metaphorical sense the son of god  it is not our intention to describe more of the religious for me where there is the same knowledge there is too much companionship like for worship and reverence  but we are told that man was created after the image of god  in his likeness captain garnerwith some of the divine spirit but not with all that makes him different from the brutes and immortal i have convarsed with a clergyman who thinks that the angels and archangels and other heavenly beings are far before even the saints in heaven such as have been only men on arth  the idea of not having a deity that he could not comprehend had long been one of roswell gardiners favourite rules of faith he did not understand by this pretending dogma that he was in any respect of capacity equal to comprehend with that of the divine being but simply that he was not to be expected or required to believe in any theory which manifestly conflicted with his knowledge and experience as both were controlled by the powers of induction he had derived directly from his creator in a word his exception was one of the most obvious of the suggestions of the pride of reason and just so much in direct opposition to the great law of regeneration which has its very gist in the converse of this feeling faith  as our young master paced the terrace alone that idea of the necessity of the creators being incomprehensible to the created recurred to him the hour that succeeded was probably the most important in roswell gardiners life so intense were his feelings so active the workings of his mind that he was quite insensible to the intensity of the cold and his body keeping equal motion with his thoughts if one may so express it his frame actually set at defiance a temperature that might otherwise have chilled it warmly and carefully as it was clad  truly there were many causes existing at that time and place to bring any man to a just sense of his real position in the scale of created beings the vault above roswell was sparkling with orbs floating in space most of them far more vast than this earth and each of them doubtless having its present or destined use what was that light so brilliant and pervading throughout space that converted each of those masses of dark matter into globes clothed with a glorious brightness roswell had seen chemical experiments that produced wonderful illuminations but faint indeed were the most glowing of those artificial torches to the floods of light that came streaming out of the void on missions of millions and millions of miles who and what was the dread beingdread in his majesty and justice but inexhaustible in love and mercywho used these exceeding means as mere instruments of his pleasure and what was he himself that he should presume to set up his miserable pride of reason in opposition to a revelation supported by miracles that must be admitted to come through men inspired by the deity or rejected altogether  in this frame of mind roswell was made to see that christianity admitted of no halfway belief it was all true or it was wholly false  and why should not christ be the son of god as the fathers of the church had perseveringly but so simply proclaimed and as that church had continued to teach for eighteen centuries roswell believed himself to have been created in the image of god and his muchprized reason told him that he could perpetuate himself in successors and that which the creator had given him the power to achieve could he not in his own person perform for the first time an inference to the contrary seemed to be illogical  then the necessity for the great expiation occurred to his mind this had always been a stumblingblock to roswells faith he could not see it and that which he could not see he was indisposed to believe here was the besetting weakness of his character a weakness which did not suffer him to perceive that could he comprehend so profound a mystery he would be raised far above that very nature in which he took so much pride as he reflected on this branch of the subject a thousand mysteries physical and moral floated before his mind and he became aware of the little probability that he should have been endowed with the faculties to comprehend this the greatest of them all had not science gradually discovered the chemical processes by which gases could be concentrated and disengaged the formation of one of those glittering orbs above his head would have been quite as unintelligible a mystery to him as the incarnation of the saviour the fact was that phenomena that were just as mysterious to the human mind as any that the dogmas of christianity required to be believed exist hourly before our eyes without awakening skepticism or exciting discussion finding their impunity in their familiarity many of these phenomena were strictly incomprehensible to human understandings which could reason up to a fountainhead in each case and there it was obliged to abandon the inductive process purely for the want of power to grapple with the premises which control the whole demonstration  could mary pratt have known what was going on in roswell gardiners soul that night her happiness would have been as boundless as her gratitude to god she would have seen the barrier that had so long interposed itself to her wishes broken down not by any rude hand but by the influence of those whisperings of the divine spirit which open the way to men to fit themselves for the presence of god     chapter xxvi      let winter come let polar spirits sweep   the darkening world and tempesttroubled deep    campbell   while the bosom of roswell was thus warming with the newborn faith of which the germ was just opening in his heart stimson came out upon the terrace to see what had become of his officer it was much past the hour when the men got beneath the coverings of their mattresses and the honest boatsteerer who had performed the duty on which he had been sent was anxious about roswells remaining so long in the open air on this positively the severest night of the whole season  you stand the cold well captain garner said stephen as he joined his officer but it might be prudent now to get under cover  i do not feel it cold stephenreturned roswellon the contrary im in a pleasant glow my mind has been busy while my frame has kept in motion when such are the facts the body seldom suffers but hearkendoes it not seem that some one is calling to us from the direction of the wreck  the great distance to which sounds are conveyed in intensely cold and clear weather is a fact known to most persons conversations in the ordinary tone had been heard by the sealers when the speakers were nearly a mile off and on several occasions attempts had been made to hold communications by means of the voice between the wreck and the hut certain words had been understood but it was found impossible to hold anything that could be termed conversation still the voice had been often heard and a fancy had come over the mind of roswell that he heard a cry like a call for assistance just as stimson joined him  it is so late sir that i should hardly think any of the vineyarders would be up observed the boatsteerer after listening some little time in the desire to catch the sound mentioned then it is so cold that most men would like to get beneath their blankets as soon as they could  i do not find it so very cold stephen have you looked at the thermometer lately  i gave it a look in coming out sir and it tells a terrible story tonight the marcury is all down in the ball which is like givin the matter up i do suppose captain garner  tis strange i do not feel it so very cold the wind seems to be getting round to northeast too give us enough of that and we shall have a thaw hark there is the cry again  this time there could be no mistake a human voice had certainly been raised amid the stillness of that almost polar night clearly appealing to human ears for succour the only word heard or comprehended was that of help one well enough adapted to carry the sound far and distinctly there was a strain of agony in the cry as if he who made it uttered it in despair roswells blood seemed to flow back to his heart never had he before felt so appalling a sense of the dependence of man on a divine providence as at that moment  you heard it he said inquiringly to stephen after an instant of silent attention to make sure that no more was to reach his ears just then  sartain sirno man could mistake that it was the voice of the nigger joe him that captain daggett has for a cook  think you so stephen the fellow has good lungs and they may have set him to call upon us in their distress what can be the nature of the assistance they ask  ive been thinking of that captain gardner and a difficult pint it is to answer food they must have still and was they in want of their rations hands would have been sent across to get em they may have let their fire go out and be without the means to relight it i can think of nothing else that is likely to happen to men so sarcumstanced  the last suggestion struck roswell as possible from the instant he felt certain that he was called on for aid he had determined to proceed to the wreck notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the intense severity of the weather as he had intimated to stephen he was not at all conscious how very cold it was exercise and the active workings of his mind having brought him to an excellent condition to resist the sternness of the season the appeal had been so sudden and unexpected however that he was at first somewhat at a loss how to proceed this matter was now discussed between him and stimson when the following plan was adopted  the mates were to be called and made acquainted with what had occurred and put on their guard as to what might possibly be required of them it was not thought necessary to call any of the rest of the men there was always one hand on the watch in the house whose duty it was to look to the fires for the double purpose of security against a conflagration and to prevent the warmth within from sinking too near to the cold without it had often occurred to roswells mind that a conflagration would prove quick destruction to his party in the first place most of the provisions would be lost and it was certain that without a covering and the means of keeping warm within it the men could not resist the climate eightandforty hours the burning of the hut would be certain death  roswell took no one with him but stimson two were as good as a hundred if all that was asked were merely the means to relight the fire these means were provided and a loaded pistol was taken also to enable a signalshot to be fired should circumstances seem to require further aid one or two modes of communicating leading facts were concerted when our hero and his companion set forth on their momentous journey  taking the hour the weather and the object before him into the account roswell gardiner felt that he was now enlisted in the most important undertaking of his whole life as he and stephen shook hands with the two mates and left the point the drifts rendered a somewhat circuitous path necessary at first but the moon and stars shed so much of their radiance on the frozen covering of the earth that the night was quite as light as many a london day excitement and motion kept the blood of our two adventurers in a brisk circulation and prevented their becoming immediately conscious of the chill intensity of the cold to which they were exposed  it is good to think of almighty god and of his many marcies said stephen when a short distance from the house as a body goes forth on an expedition as serious as this we may not live to reach the wrack for it seems to me to grow colder and colder  i wonder we hear no more of the cries remarked roswell who was thinking of the distress he was bent on relieving one would think that a man who could call so stoutly would give us another cry  a body can never calcilate on a nigger answered stephen who had the popular american prejudice against the caste that has so long been held in servitude in the land they call out easily and shut up oncommon quick if theres nothin gained by yelling black blood wont stand cold like white blood captain garner any more than white blood will stand heat like black blood  i have heard this before stephen and it has surprised me that captain daggetts cook should be the only one of that party who seems to have had any voice tonight  stimson had a good deal to say now as the two picked their way across the field of snow always walking on the crust which in most places would have upheld a loaded vehicle the subject of his remarks being the difference between the two races as respects their ability to endure hardships the worthy boatsteerer had several tales to relate of cases in which he had known negroes freeze when whites have escaped as the fact is one pretty well established roswell listened complacently enough being much too earnest in pressing forward toward his object to debate any of his companions theories just then it was while thus employed that roswell fancied he heard one more cry resembling those which had brought him on this dangerous undertaking on a night so fearful this time however the cry was quite faint and what was not so easily explained it did not appear to come from the precise direction in which the wreck was known to lie but from one that diverged considerably from that particular quarter of course the officer mentioned this circumstance to the boatsteerer and the extraordinary part of the information caused some particular discussion between them  to me that last call seemed to come from up yonder nearer to the cliffs than the place where we are and not at all from down there near to the sea where the wrack is said stimson in the course of his remarks so sartain am i of this that i feel anxious to change our course a little to see if it be not possible that one of the vineyarders has got into some difficulty in trying to come across to us  roswell had the same desire for he had made the same conjecture though he did not believe the black would be the person chosen to be the messenger on such an occasion  i think captain daggett would have come himself or have sent one of his best men he observed in preference to trusting a negro with a duty so important  we do not know sir that it was the nigger we heard misery makes much the same cries whether it comes from the throat of white or black let us work upward nearer to the cliffs sir i see something dark on the snow hereaway as it might be on our larboard bow  roswell caught a glimpse of the same object and thither our adventurers now bent their steps walking on the crust without any difficulty so long as they kept out of the drifts one does not find it as easy to make any physical effort in an intensely cold atmosphere as he does when the weather is more moderate this prevented roswell and his companion from moving as fast as they otherwise might have done but they got along with sufficient rapidity to reach the dark spot on the snow in less than five minutes after they had changed their course  you are right stephen said gardiner as he came up to this speck amid the immensity of the white mantle that covered both sea and land far as the eye could reach it is the cook the poor fellow has given out here about halfway between the two stations  there must be life in him yet sirnigger as he is its not yet twenty minutes since he gave that last cry help me to turn him over captain garner and we will rub him and give him a swallow of brandy a little hot coffee now might bring the life back to his heart  roswell complied first firing his pistol as a signal to those left behind the negro was not dead but so near it that a very few more minutes would have sealed his fate the applications and frictions used by gardiner and the boatsteerer had an effect a swallow of the brandy probably saved the poor fellows life while working on his patient captain gardiner found a piece of frozen pork which on examination he ascertained had never been cooked it at once explained the nature of the calamity that had befallen the crew of the wreck  so intent were the two on their benevolent duty that a party arrived from the house in obedience to the signal in much less time than they could have hoped for it was led by the mate and came provided with a lamp burning beneath a tin vessel filled with sweetened coffee this hot drink answered an excellent purpose with both well and sick after a swallow or two aided by a vigorous friction and closely surrounded by so many human bodies the black began to revive and the sort of drowsy stupor which is known to precede death in those who die by freezing having been in a degree shaken off he was enabled to stand alone and by means of assistance to walk the hot coffee was of the greatest service every swallow that he got down appearing to set the engine of life into new motion the compelled exercise contributed its part and by the time the mate to use his own expression had run the nigger into dock which meant when he had got him safe within the hut his senses and faculties had so far revived as to enable him to think and to speak as gardiner and stimson returned with him everybody was up and listening when the black told his story  it would seem that during the terrible month which had just passed daggett had compelled his crew to use more exercise than had been their practice of late some new apprehension had come over him on the subject of fuel and his orders to be saving in that article were most stringent and very rigidly enforced the consequence was that the camboose was not as well attended to as it had been previously and as circumstances required indeed that it should be at night the men were told to keep themselves warm with bedclothes and by huddling together and the cabin being small so many persons crowded together in it did not fail to produce an impression on its atmosphere  such was the state of things when on going to his camboose in order to cook the breakfast this very black found the fire totally extinguished not a spark could he discover even among the ashes and what was even worse the tinderbox had disappeared as respects the last it may be well to state here that it was afterwards discovered carefully bestowed between two of the timbers of the wreck with a view to a particular safekeeping the person who had made this disposition of it forgetting what he had done the loss of the tinderbox under the circumstances was almost as great a calamity as could have befallen men in the situation of the vineyarders as against the cold by means of bedclothes exercise and other precautions it might have been possible to exist for some time provided warm food could be obtained but the frost penetrated the cabin and every one soon became sensitively alive to the awkwardness not to say danger of their condition a whole day was passed in fruitless attempts to obtain fire by various processes friction did not succeed it probably never does with the thermometer at zero sparks could be obtained but by this time everything was stiff with the frost the food already cooked was soon as hard as bullets and it was found that on the second night brandy that was exposed was converted into a lump of ice not only did the intensity of the cold increase but everything even to the human system seemed to be gradually congealing and preparing to become converted into receptacles for frost several of the men began to suffer in their ears noses feet and other extremities and the bunks were soon the only places in which it was found possible to exist in anything like comfort no less than three men had been sent at intervals of a few hours across to the house with a view to obtain fire or the means of lighting one along with other articles that were considered necessary to the safety of the people the cook had been the third and last of these messengers he had passed his two shipmates each lying dead on the snowor as he supposed lifeless for neither gave the smallest sign of vitality on an examination it was in the agony of alarm produced by these appalling spectacles that the negro had cried aloud for help sending the sounds far enough to reach the ears of roswell still he had persevered until chilled as much with terror as with the cold and the want of warm nourishment the cook had sunk into what would have soon proved to be his last long sleep when the timely succour arrived  it was some two hours after the black had been got into the hut and was strengthened with a good hot supper ere he had communicated all the facts just related roswell succeeded however in getting a little at a time from him and when no more remained to be related the plan was already arranged for future proceedings it was quite clear no unnecessary delay should be permitted to take place the cold continued to increase in intensity notwithstanding it was the opinion of the most experienced among the men that a thaw and a great spring thaw was approaching it often happens in climates of an exaggerated character that these extremes almost touch each other as they are said to meet in man  roswell left the house for the second time that eventful night just at the hour of twelve he now went accompanied by the second mate and a foremasthand as well as by his old companion the boatsteerer each individual drank a bowl of hot coffee before he set out and a good warm supper had also been taken in the interval between the return and this new sortie experience shows that there is no such protector against the effect of cold as a full stomach more especially if the food be warm and nourishing this was understood by roswell and not only did he cause the whole party that set forth with him at that late and menacing hour to receive this sustenance but he ordered the kettle of boiling coffee to be carried with them and kept two lamps burning for the double purpose of maintaining the heat and of having a fire ready on reaching the wreck the oil of the seaelephant together with pieces of canvass prepared for the purpose supplied the necessary materials  so intensely severe was the weather that roswell had serious thoughts of returning when he reached the spot where the black had been found but the picture of daggetts situation that occurred to his mind urged him on and he proceeded every precaution had been taken to exclude the cold as it is usually termed which as it respects the body means little else than keeping the vital heat in and very useful were these provisions found to be skins formed the principal defence though the men had long adopted the very simple but excellent expedient of wearing two shirts owing to this and to the other measures taken neither of the four was struck with a chill and they all continued on  at the place mentioned by the black the body of one of daggetts best men a boatsteerer was found the man was dead of course and the corpse was as rigid as a billet of wood every particle of moisture in it had congealed until the whole of what had been a very fine and manly frame lay little more than a senseless lump of ice a few degrees to the southward of the spot where it was now seen it is probable that this relic of humanity would have retained its form and impression until the trump sounded to summon it to meet its former tenant the spirit in judgment  no time was lost in useless lamentations over the body of this man who was much of a favourite among the oyster ponders twenty minutes later the second corpse was found both the bodies lying in what was the customary track between the house and the wreck it was the last that had died but like that of the unfortunate man just described it was in a state to be preserved ten thousand years without the occurrence of a thaw merely glancing at the rigid features of the face in order to identify the person roswell passed on the chill feelings of every individual of his party now admonishing them all of the necessity of getting as soon as possible to some place where they could feel the influence of a fire in ten minutes more the whole were in the caverns of the ice and presently the cabin of the wreck was entered without turning to the right hand or to the left without looking for one of the inmates of the place every man among the newcomers turned his attention instantly to getting the fire lighted the camboose had been filled with wood and it was evident that many efforts had been made to produce a blaze by those who had put it there splinters of pine had been inserted among the oak of the vessel and nothing was wanting but the means of kindling these most fortunately for themselves the party of roswell had and eagerly did they now have recourse to their use  there was not a man among the oyster ponders who did not just at that moment feel his whole being concentrated in that one desire to obtain warmth the cold had slowly but surely insinuated itself among their garments and slight chills were now felt even by roswell whose frame had been most wonderfully sustained that night through the force of moral feeling stimson was the individual who was put forward at the camboose others holding the lamps canvass saturated with oil and some prepared paper it was found to be perceptibly warmer within the cabin with its doors closed and the external coverings of sails c that had been made to exclude the air than without nevertheless when roswell glanced at a thermometer that was hanging against the bulkhead he saw that all the mercury was still in the ball  the interest with which our party now watched the proceedings of stephen had much of that intensity that is known to attend any exhibition of vital importance life and death were however to be dependent on the issue and the manner in which every eye was turned on the wood and stephens mode of dealing with it denoted how completely the dread of freezing had got possession of the minds of even these robust and generous men roswell alone ventured for a single moment to look around the cabin three of the vineyarders only were visible in it though it struck him that others lay in the berths under piles of clothes of the three who were up one was so near the lamp he held in his hand that its light illumined his face and all that could be seen of a form enveloped in skins this man sat leaning against a transom his eyes were open and glared on the party around the camboose the lips were slightly parted and at first roswell expected to hear him speak the immovable features rigid muscles and wild expression of the eyeballs however soon told him the melancholy truth the man was dead the current of life had actually frozen at his heart shuddering as much with horror as with a sharp chill that just then passed through his own stout frame our young master turned anxiously to note the success of stimson in getting the wood of the camboose in a blaze  every one in the least accustomed to a very severe climate must have had frequent occasions to observe the reluctance with which all sorts of fuel burn in exceedingly cold weather the billet of wood that shall blaze merrily on a mild day moulders and simmers and seems indisposed to give out any heat at all with the thermometer at zero in a word all inanimate substances that contain the elements of caloric appear to sympathize with the prevailing state of the atmosphere and to contribute to render that which is already too cold for comfort even colder so it was now notwithstanding the preparations that had been made baffled twice in his expectations of procuring a blaze stephen stopped and took a drink of the hot coffee as he swallowed the beverage it struck him that it was fast losing its warmth  a considerable collection of canvass saturated with oil was now put beneath the pile in the midst of splinters of pine and one of the lamps was forced into the centre of the combustibles this expedient succeeded the frosts were slowly chased out of the kindling materials a sickly but gradually increasing flame strove through the kindling stuff and soon began to play among the billets of the oak the only fuel that could be relied on for available heat still there was great danger that the lighter wood would all be consumed ere this main dependence could be aroused from its dull inactivity frost appeared to be in possession of the whole pile and it was expelled so slowly clung to its dominion with so much power as really to render the result doubtful for a moment or two fortunately there was found a pair of bellows and by means of a judicious use of this very useful implement the oak wood was got into a bright blaze and warmth began to be given out from the fire then came the shiverings and chills with which intense cold consents even to abandon the human frame and by their number and force roswell was made to understand how near he and his companions had been to death as the young man saw the fire slowly kindle to a cheerful blaze a glow of gratitude flowed towards his heart and mentally he returned thanks to god the cabin was so small had been made so tight by artificial means and the camboose was so large that a sensible influence was produced on the temperature as soon as the wood began to burn a little freely as none of the heat was lost the effect was not only apparent but most grateful roswell had looked into the vessels of the camboose while the fire was gathering head one the largest was filled or nearly so with coffee frozen to a solid mass in the other beef and pork had been set over to boil and there the pieces now were embedded in ice and frozen to blocks it was when these two distinct masses of ice began to melt that it was known the fire was beginning to prevail and hope revived in the bosoms of the oyster ponders on taking another look at the thermometer it was found that the mercury had so far expanded as to be leaving the ball it soon after ascended so high as to denote only forty degrees below zero  every thing even to life depending on maintaining and increasing the power of the fire the men now looked about them for more fuel there was an ample stock in the cabin however the fire having become extinguished not for want of wood but in the usual way it were needless to describe the manner in which those who stood around the stove watched the flames or how profound was their satisfaction when they saw that stimson had finally succeeded  god be praised for this and for all his mercies exclaimed stephen laying aside the bellows at last i can feel warmth from the fire and that will save such of us as have not yet been taken away he then lifted the lids and looked into the different vessels that were on the ice was melting fast and the steams of coffee became apparent to the senses it was at this instant that a feeble voice was heard issuing from beneath the coverings of a berth  garner it said imploringly if you have any feelin for a fellowcreatur in distress warm me up with one swallow of that coffee oh how pleasantly it smells and how good it must be for the stomach for three days have i tasted nothingnot even water  this was daggett the longtried sealer the man of iron nerves and golden longings he who had so lately concentrated within himself all that was necessary to form a pertinacious resolute and grasping seeker after gain how changed now in all this he asked for the means of preserving life and thought no more of skins and oils and treasures on desert keys  roswell was no sooner apprised of the situation of his brothermaster than he bestowed the necessary care on his wants fortunately the coffee brought by the oyster ponders and which retained some of its original warmth had been set before the fire and was now as hot as the human stomach could bear it two or three swallows of this grateful fluid were given to daggett and his voice almost instantaneously showed the effect they produced  im in a bad way garner resumed the vineyardmaster i fear were all in a bad way that are here i held out agin the cold as long as human natur could bear it but was forced to give in at last  how many of your people still remain daggett tell us that we may look for them and attend to their wants  im afraid garner theyll never want anything more in this life the second mate and two of the hands were sitting in the cabin when i got into this berth and i fear t will be found that theyre dead i urged them to turn in too as the berths were the only place where anything like warmth was to be found but drowsiness had come on em and when that is the case freezin soon follows  the three men in the cabin are past our assistance being actually frozen into logs but there must be several more of you i see the signs of two others in the berthsah what do you say to that poor fellow stephen  the spirit is still in the body sir but about to depart if we can get him to swallow a little of the coffee the angel of death may yet loosen his hold on him  the coffee was got down this mans throat and he instantly revived he was a young man named lee and was one of the finest physical specimens of strength and youth in the whole crew on examining his limbs none were found absolutely frozen though the circulation of the blood was so near being checked that another hour of the great cold which had reigned in the cabin and which was slowly increasing in intensity must have destroyed him on applying a similar process to daggett roswell was startled at the discovery he made the feet legs and forearms of the unfortunate vineyarder were all as stiff and rigid as icicles in these particulars there could be no mistake and men were immediately sent for snow in order to extract the frost by the only safe process known to the sealers the dead bodies were carried from the cabin and laid decently on the ice outside the increasing warmth within rendering the removal advisable on glancing again at the thermometer now suspended in a remote part of the cabin the mercury was found risen to two above zero this was a very tolerable degree of cold and the men began to lay aside some of their extra defences against the weather which would otherwise be of no service to them when exposed outside  the crew of the vineyard lion had consisted of fifteen souls one less than that of her consort of these men four had lost their lives between the wreck and the house two on a former and two on the present occasion three bodies were found sitting in the cabin and two more were taken out of the berths dead the captain the cook and lee added to these made a dozen leaving but three of the crew to be accounted for when questioned on the subject lee said that one of those three had frozen to death in the caverns several days before and the other two had set out for the hut in the last snowstorm unable to endure the cold at the wreck any longer as these two men had not arrived at the house when gardiner and his companions left it they had perished out of all doubt thus of the fifteen human beings who had sailed together from marthas vineyard ready to encounter every hazard in order to secure wealth or what in their estimation was wealth but three remained and of these two might be considered in a critical condition lee was the only man of the entire crew who was sound and fit for service     chapter xxvii      bid him bow down to that which is above him   the overruling infinitethe maker   who made him not for worshiplet him kneel   and we will kneel together    byron   when the bodies had been removed from the cabin and the limbs of daggett were covered with snow roswell gardiner took another look at the thermometer it had risen already to twenty degrees above zero this was absolutely warmth compared with the temperature from which the men had just escaped and it was felt to be so in their persons the fire however was not the only cause of this most acceptable change one of the men who had been outside soon came back and reported a decided improvement in the weather the wind which had been coquetting with the northeast point of the compass for several hours now blew steadily from that quarter an hour later it was found on examination that a second thermometer which was outside actually indicated ten above zero this sudden and great change came altogether from the wind which was now in the warm quarter the men stripped themselves of most of their skins and the fire was suffered to go down though care was taken that it should not again be totally extinguished  we have little pleasure in exhibiting pictures of human suffering and shall say but little of the groans and pains that daggett uttered and endured while undergoing that most agonizing process of having the frost taken out of his system by cold applications it was the only safe way of treating his case however and as he knew it he bore his sufferings as well as man could bear them long ere the return of day he was released from his agony and was put back into his berth which had been comfortably arranged for him having the almost unheardof luxury of sheets with an additional mattress  as stephen remarked when the men were told to try and get a little sleep theres plenty of berths empty and each on us can have as many clothes and as warm a bed as he can ask for now that so many have hastened away to their great account as it might be in the pride of their youth and strength  activity the responsibility of command and the great necessity there had been for exertion prevented roswell from reflecting much on what had happened until he lay down to catch a little sleep then indeed the whole of the past came over him in one sombre terrible picture and he had the most lively perception of the dangers from which he had escaped as well as of the mercy of gods providence surrounded by the dead as it might be and still uncertain of the fate of the living his views of the past and future became much lessened in confidence and hope the majesty and judgment of god assumed a higher place than common in his thoughts while his estimate of him self was fast getting to be humble and searching in the midst of all these changes of views and feelings however there was one image unaltered in the young mans imagination mary occupied the background of every picture with her meek gentle but blooming countenance if he thought of god her eyes were elevated in prayer if the voyage home was in his mind and the chances of success were calculated her smiles and anxious watchfulness stimulated him to adventure if arrived and safe her downcast but joyful looks betrayed the modest happiness of her inmost heart it was in the midst of some such pictures that roswell now fell asleep  when the party turned out in the morning a still more decided change had occurred in the weather the wind had increased to a gale bringing with it torrents of rain coming from the warm quarter a thaw had set in with a character quite as decided as the previous frost in that region the weather is usually exaggerated in its features and the change from winter to spring is quite as sudden as that from autumn to winter we use the terms spring and autumn out of complaisance to the usages of men but in fact these two seasons have scarcely any existence at all in the antarctic seas the change commonly is from winter to summer such as summer is and from summer back to winter  notwithstanding the favourable appearances of things when roswell walked out into the open air next morning he well knew that summer had not yet come many weeks must go by ere the ice could quit the bay and even a boat could put to sea there were considerations of prudence therefore that should not be neglected connected with the continuance of the supplies and the means of subsistence in one respect the party now on the island had been gainers by the terrible losses it had sustained in daggetts crew the provisions of the two vessels might now virtually be appropriated to the crew of one and roswell when he came to reflect on the circumstances saw that a providential interference had probably saved the survivors from great privations if not from absolute want  still there was a thaw and one of that decided character which marks a climate of great extremes the snows on the mountain soon began to descend upon the plain in foaming torrents and increased by the tribute received from the last the whole came tumbling over the cliffs in various places in rich waterfalls there was about a mile of rock that was one continuous cataract the sheet being nearly unbroken for the whole distance the effect of this deluge from the plain above was as startling as it was grand all the snow along the rocky shore soon disappeared and the fragments of ice began rapidly to diminish in size and to crumble at first roswell felt much concern on account of the security of the wreck his original apprehension being that it would be washed away this ground of fear was soon succeeded by another of scarcely less serious importthat of its being crushed by the enormous cakes of ice that made the caverns in which it lay and which now began to settle and change their positions as the water washed away their bases at one time roswell thought of setting the storm at defiance and of carrying daggett across to the house by means of the handbarrow but when he came to look at the torrents of water that were crossing the rocks so many raging rivulets the idea was abandoned as impracticable another night was therefore passed in the midst of the tempest  the northeast wind the rain and the thaw were all at work in concert when our adventurers came abroad to look upon the second day of their sojourn in the wreck by this time the caverns were dripping with a thousand little streams and every sign denoted a most rapid melting of the ice on carrying the thermometer into the open air it stood at sixtytwo and the men found it necessary to lay aside their second shirt and all the extraordinary defences of their attire nor was this all the wind that crosses the salt water is known to have more than the usual influence on the snows and ice and such was the effect now produced by it on sealers land the snow indeed had mostly disappeared from all places but the drifts while the ice was much diminished in its size and outlines so grateful was the change from the extreme cold that they had so lately endured that the men thought nothing of the rain at all they went about in it just as if it did not stream down upon them in little torrents some of them clambered up the cliffs and reached a point whence it was known that they could command a view of the house the return of this party which roswell did not accompany was waited for with a good deal of interest when it got back it brought a report that was deemed important in several particulars the snow had gone from the plain and from the mountain with the exception of a few spots where there had been unusual accumulations of it as respected the house it was standing and the snow had entirely disappeared from its vicinity the men could be seen walking about on the bare rocks and every symptom was that of settled spring  this was cheering news and the torrents having much diminished in size some having disappeared altogether roswell set out for the cape leaving the second mate in charge of the wreck lee the young vineyarder who had been rescued from freezing by the timely arrival of our hero accompanied the tatter having joined his fortunes to those of the oyster ponders the two reached the house before dark where they found hazard and his companions in a good deal of concern touching the fate of the party that was out a deep impression was made by the report of what had befallen the other crew and that night roswell read prayers to as attentive a congregation as was ever assembled around a domestic hearth as for fire none was now needed except for culinary purposes though all the preparations to meet cold weather were maintained it being well known that a shift of wind might bring back the fury of the winter  the following morning it was clear though the wind continued warm and balmy from the north no such weather indeed had been felt by the sealers since they reached the group and the effect on them was highly cheering and enlivening before he had breakfasted roswell was down in the cove examining into the condition of his vessel or what remained of her a good deal of frozen snow still lay heaped on the mass and he set the hands at work to shovel it off before noon the craft was clear and most of the snow was melted it requiring little more than exposure to the air in order to get rid of it  as soon as the hulk was clear roswell directed his men to take everything out of it the remains of cargo watercasks and some frozen provisions in order that it might float as light as possible the ice was frozen close to every part of the vessels bottom to a depth of several feet following her mould a circumstance that would necessarily prevent her settling in the water below her timbers but as there was no telling when this ice might begin to recede by melting it was deemed prudent to use this precaution it was found that the experiment succeeded the hulk actually rising when relieved from the weight in it no less than four inches  a consultation was held that night between gardiner his officers and the oldest of the seamen the question presented was whether the party should attempt to quit the group in the boats or whether they should build a little on the hulk deck her over and make use of this altered craft to return to the northward there was a good deal to be said on both sides if the boats were used the party might leave as soon as the weather became settled and the season a little more advanced by dragging the boats on sledges across the ice to the open water which was supposed to be some ten or twenty miles to the northward and a large amount of provisions might thus be saved on the other hand however as it regarded the provisions the boats would hold so little that no great gain would be made by going early in them and leaving a sufficient supply behind to keep all hands two or three months this was a consideration that presented itself and it had its weight in the decision then there was the chance of the winters returning bringing with it the absolute necessity of using a great deal more fuel this was a matter of life and death comparatively pleasant as the weather had become there was no security for its so continuing one entire spring month was before the sealers and a shift of wind might convert the weather into a wintry temperature should such be the case it might become indispensable to burn the very materials that would be required to build up and deck over the hulk there were therefore many things to be taken into the account nor was the question settled without a great deal of debate and reflection  after discussing all these points the decision was as follows it was at least a month too soon to think of trusting themselves in that stormy ocean on the high seas and in the open boats and this so much the more because nature as if expressly to send back a reasonable amount of warm air into the polar regions with a view to preserve the distinction of the seasons caused the wind to blow most of the time from the northward as this month in all prudence must be passed on the island it might as well be occupied with building upon the hulk as in any other occupation should the cold weather return the materials would still be there and might be burned in the last extremity just as well or even with greater facility after being brought over to the cove as if left where they then were or at the wreck should the winter not return the work done on the vessel would be so much gained and they would be ready for an earlier start when the ice should move  on this last plan the duty was commenced very little interrupted by the weather for quite three weeks the wind held from points favourable to the progress of spring veering from east to west but not once getting any southing in it occasionally it blew in gales sending down upon the group a swell that made great havoc with the outer edges of the fieldice every day or two a couple of hands were sent up the mountain to take a lookout and to report the state of matters in the adjacent seas the fleet of bergs had not yet come out of port though it was in motion to the southward like threedeckers dropping down to outer anchorages in roadsteads and bays as roswell intended to be off before these formidable cruisers put to sea their smallest movement or change was watched and noted as for the fieldice it was broken up miles at at a time until there remained very little of it with the exception of the portion that was wedged in and jammed among the islands of the group from some cause that could not be ascertained the waves of the ocean which came tumbling in before the northern gales failed to roll home upon this ice which lost its margin now it was reduced to the limits of the group slowly and with great resistance some of the sealers ascribed this obstinacy in the bayice to its greater thickness believing that the shallowness of the water had favoured a frozen formation below that did not so much prevail off soundings this theory may have been true though there was quite as much against it as in its favour for polar ice usually increases above and not from below the sea is much warmer than the atmosphere in the cold months and the ice is made by deposites of snow moisture and sleet on the surfaces of the fields and bergs  in those three weeks which carried forward the season to within ten days of summer a great deal of useful work was done daggett was brought over to the house on a handbarrow for the second time and made as comfortable as circumstances would allow from the first roswell saw that his state was very precarious the frozen legs in particular being threatened with mortification all the expedients known to a sealers materia medico were resorted to in order to avert consequences so serious but without success the circulation could not be restored as nature required it to be done and failing of the support derived from a healthful condition of the vital current the fatal symptoms slowly supervened this change however was so gradual that it scarce affected the regular course of the duty  it was a work of great labour to transport the remaining timbers and plank of the wreck to the cove without the wheels indeed it may be questioned whether it could have been done at all in a reasonable time the breaking up of the schooner was in itself no trifling job for fully one half of the frame remained to be pulled to pieces in preparing the materials for use again a good deal of embarrassment was experienced in consequence of the portions of the two vessels that were left being respectively their lower bodies all the upper works of each having been burned with the exception of the after part of daggetts craft which had been preserved on account of the cabin this occasioned a good deal of trouble in moulding and fitting the new upper works on the hulk in the cove roswell had no idea of rebuilding his schooner strictly in her old form and proportions he did not indeed possess the materials for such a reconstruction his plan was simply to raise on the hulk as much as was necessary to render her safe and convenient and then to get as good and secure a deck over all as circumstances would allow  fortunately for the progress of the work lee the vineyard man was a shipcarpenter and his skill essentially surpassed that of smith who filled the same station on board the oyster pond craft these two men were now of the greatest service for though neither understood drafting each was skilful in the use of tools and had a certain readiness that enabled him to do a hundred things that he had never found it necessary to attempt on any former occasion if the upper frame that was now got on the sea lion was not of faultless mould it was securely fastened and rendered the craft even stronger than it had been originally some regard was had to resisting the pressure of ice and experience had taught all the sealers where the principal defences against the effects of a nip ought to be placed the lines were not perfect it is true but this was of less moment as the bottom of the craft which alone had any material influence on her sailing was just as it had come from the hands of the artizan who had originally moulded her  by the end of a fortnight the new toptimbers were all in their places and secured while a complete set of bends were brought to them and were well bolted the caulkingirons were put in requisition as soon as a streak was on the whole work advancing as it might be pari passu planks for the decks were much wanted for in the terrible strait for fuel which had caused the original assault on the schooner this portion of the vessel had been the first burned as of the most combustible materials the quarterdeck of the vineyard craft luckily was entire and its planks so far answered an excellent purpose they served to make a new quarterdeck for the repairs but the whole of the maindeck and forecastle remained to be provided for materials were gleaned from different parts of the two vessels until a reasonably convenient and a perfectly safe deck was laid over the whole craft the coamings for the hatches being taken from daggetts schooner which had not been broken up in those parts it is scarcely necessary to say that the ice had early melted from the rocks of the coast the caverns all disappeared within the first week of the thaw the attitudes into which the cakes had been thrown greatly favouring the melting process by exposing so much surface to the joint action of wind rain and sun what was viewed as a favourable augury the seals began to reappear there was a remote portion of the coast from which the ice had been driven by the winds around the northwest cape that was already alive with them alas these animals no longer awakened cupidity in the breasts of the sealers the last no longer thought of gain but simply of saving their lives and of restoring themselves to the humble places they had held in the world previously to having come on this illfated voyage  this reappearance of the seals produced a deep impression on roswell gardiner his mind had been much inclined of late to dwell more and more on religious subjects and his conversations with stephen were still more frequent than formerly not that the boatsteerer could enlighten him on the great subject by any learned lore for in this stimson was quite deficient but his officer found encouragement in the depth and heartiness of his companions faith which seemed to be raised above all doubts and misgivings whatever during the gloomiest moments of that fearful winter stephen had been uniformly confiding and cheerful not once had he been seen to waver though all around him were desponding and anticipating the worst his heart was light exactly in proportion as his faith was strong  we shall neither freeze nor starve he used to say unless it be gods will and when it is his pleasure depend on it friends it will be for our good as for daggett he had finally given up his hold on the wreck and it seemed no longer to fill his thoughts when he was told that the seals had come back his eye brightened and his nature betrayed some of its ardent longings but it was no more than a gleaming of the former spirit of the man now becoming dim under the darkness that was fast encircling all his views of this world  its a pity garner that we have no craft ready for the work he said under the first impulse of the intelligence  at this early time in the season a large ship might be filled  we have other matters on our hands captain daggett was the answer they must be looked to first if we can get off the island at all and return safe to those who i much fear are now mourning us as dead we shall have great reason to thank god  a few skins would do no great harm garner even to a craft cut down and reduced  we have more cargo now than we shall be able to take with us quite one half of all our skins must be left behind us and all of the oil the hold of the schooner is too shallow to carry enough of anything to make out a voyage i shall ballast with water and provisions and fill up all the spare room with the best of our skins the rest of the property must be abandoned  why abandoned leave a hand or two to take care of it and send a craft out to look for it as soon as you get home leave me garner i am willing to stay  roswell thought that the poor man would be left whether he wished to remain or not for the symptoms that are known to be so fatal in cases like that of daggetts were making themselves so apparent as to leave little doubt of the result what rendered this display of the masterpassion somewhat remarkable was the fact that our hero had on several occasions conversed with the invalid concealing no material feature of his case and the latter had expressed his expectation of a fatal termination if not an absolute willingness to die stimson had frequently prayed with daggett and roswell had often read particular chapters of the bible to him at his own request creating an impression that the vineyarder was thinking more of his end than of any interests connected with this life such might have been probably was the case until the seeming return of what had once been deemed good luck awakened old desires and brought out traits of character that were about to be lost in the near views of a future world all this roswell saw and noted and the reflections produced by his own perilous condition the certain loss of so many companions the probable death of daggett and the humble but impressive example and sympathy of stimson were such as would have delighted the tender spirit of mary pratt could she have known of their existence  but the great consideration of the moment the centre of all the hopes and fears of our sealers was the rebuilding of the mutilated sea lion although the long thaw did so much for them the reader is not to regard it as such a spell of warm weather as one enjoys in may within the temperate zone there were no flowers no signs of vegetation and whenever the wind ceased to blow smartly from the northward there was frost at two or three intervals cold snaps set in that looked seriously like a return to winter and at the end of the third week of pleasant weather mentioned it began to blow a gale from the southward to snow and to freeze the storm commenced about ten in the forenoon ere the sun went down the days then being of great length every passage around the dwelling was already blocked up with banks of snow several times had the men asked permission to remove the sails from the house to admit air and light but it was now found that the tentlike verandah they formed was of as much use as it had been at any time during the season without it indeed it would not have been possible for the people to quit their dwelling during three entire days everything like work was of course suspended during this tempest which seriously menaced the unfortunate sealers with the necessity of again breaking up their schooner now nearly completed with a view again to keep themselves from freezing the weather was not so intensely cold as it had been continuously for months during the past winter but coming as it did after so long a spell of what might be considered as a balmy atmosphere in that region it found the people unbraced and little prepared for it at no time was the thermometer lower than twenty degrees below zero this was near morning after a sharp and stinging night nor was it for any succession of hours much below zero but zero was now hard to bear and fires and good fires too were absolutely necessary to keep the men from suffering as well as from despondency perhaps the spectacle of daggett dying from the effects of frost before their eyes served to increase the uneasiness of the people and to cause them to be less sparing of the fuel than persons in their situation ought to have been it is certain that a report was brought to roswell in the height of the tempest and when the thermometer was at the lowest that there was not wood enough left from the plunder of the two vessels exclusively of that which had been worked up in the repairs to keep the fires going eightandforty hours longer it was true a little wood intended to be used in the homeward passage enough to last as far as rio possibly had been used in stowing the hold and that might be got at first if it ever ceased to snow without that addition to the stock in the house it would not be within the limits of probability to suppose the people could hold out against the severity of such weather a great while longer  every expedient that could be devised to save wood and to obtain warmth from other sources was resorted to of course by roswells orders lamps were burned with great freedom not little vessels invented to give light but such torches as one sees at the lighting up of a princely courtyard on the occasion of a fête in which wicks are made by the pound and unctuous matter is used by the gallon old canvass and elephants oil supplied the materials and the spare camboose which had been brought over to the house to be set up there while the other galley was being placed on board very well answered the purpose of a lamp some warmth was obtained by these means but much more of a glaring and unpleasant light  it was during the height of this tempest that the soul of daggett took its flight towards the place of departed spirits in preparation for the hour when it was to be summoned before the judgmentseat of god previously to his death the unfortunate vineyarder held a frank and confidential discourse with roswell as his last hour approached his errors and mistakes became more distinctly apparent as is usual with men while his sins of omission seemed to crowd the vista of bygone days then it was that the whole earth did not contain that which in his dying eyes would prove an equivalent for one hour passed in a sincere devout and humble service of the deity  im afraid that ive loved money most too well he said to roswell not an hour before he drew his last breath but i hope it was not so much for myself as for others a wife and children garner tie a man to arth in a most unaccountable manner sealers companions are used to hearing of misfortunes and the vineyard women know that few on em live to see a husband at their side in old age still it is hard on a mother and wife to larn that her chosen friend has been cut off in the pride of his days and in a distant land poor betsey it would have been better for us both had we been satisfied with the little we had for now the good woman will have to look to all matters for herself  daggett now remained silent for some time though his lips moved most probably in prayer it was a melancholy sight to see a man in the vigour of his manhood whose voice was strong and whose heart was still beating with vigour and vitality standing as it were on the brink of a precipice down which all knew he was to be so speedily hurled but the decree had gone forth and no human skill could arrest it shortly after the confession and lamentation we have recorded the decay reached the vitals and the machine of clay stopped to avoid the unpleasant consequences of keeping the body in so warm a place it was buried in the snow at a short distance from the house within an hour after it had ceased to breathe  when roswell gardiner saw this man who had so long adhered to him like a leech in the pursuit of gold laid a senseless corpse among the frozen flakes of the antarctic seas he felt that a lively admonition of the vanity of the world was administered to himself how little had he been able to foresee all that had happened and how mistaken had been his own calculations and hopes what then was that intellect of which he had been so proud and what reason had he to rely on himself in those matters that lay equally beyond the cradle and the gravethat incomprehensible past and the unforeseen future towards which all those in existence were hastening roswell had received many lessons in humility the most useful of all the lessons that man can receive in connection with the relation that really exists between the deity and himself often had he wondered while reading the bible mary pratt had put into his hand at the stubborn manner in which the chosen people of god had returned to their idols and their groves and their high places but he was now made to understand that others still erred in this great particular and that of all the idols men worship that of self was perhaps the most objectionable     chapter xxviii      long swoln in drenching rains seeds germs and buds   start at the touch of vivifying beams   moved by their secret force the vital lymph   diffusive runs and spreads oer wood and field   a flood of verdure    wilcox   at length it came to be rumoured among the sealers that the fires must be permitted to go out or that the materials used for making the berths and various other fixtures of the house must be taken to supply the stove it was when it got to be known that the party was reduced to this sad dilemma that roswell broke through the bank of snow that almost covered the house and got so far into the open air as to be able to form some estimate of the probable continuance of the present cold weather the thermometer within the bank of snow but outside of the building then stood at twenty below zero but it was much colder in the unobstructed currents of as keen and biting a south wind as ever came howling across the vast fields of ice that covered the polar basin the snow had long ceased but not until an immense quantity had fallen nearly twice as much roswell and hazard thought as they had seen on the rocks at any time that winter  i see no signs of a change mr hazard roswell remarked shivering with the intensity of the cold we had better go back into the house before we get chilled for we have no fire now to go to to warm ourselves it is much warmer within doors than it is in the open air fire or no fire  there are many reasons for that captain garner answered the mate so many bodies in so small a space the shelter from the wind and outer air and the snow banks all help us i think we shall find the thermometer indoors at a pretty comfortable figure this morning  on examining it it was found to stand at only fifteen below zero making a difference of five degrees in favour of the house as compared with the sort of covered gallery under the tent and probably of five more as compared with the open air  on a consultation it was decided that all hands should eat a hearty meal remove most of their clothes and get within the coverings of their berths to see if it would not be possible to wear out the cold spell in some tolerable comfort beneath rugs and blankets on the whole it was thought that the berths might be made more serviceable by this expedient than by putting their materials into the stoves accordingly within an hour after roswell and his mate had returned from their brief outdoor excursion the whole party was snugly bestowed under piles of rugs clothes sails and whatever else might be used to retain the animal heat near the body and exclude cold in this manner sixandthirty hours were passed not a man of them all having the courage to rise from his lair and encounter the severity of the climate now unrelieved by anything like a fire  roswell had slept most of the time during the last ten hours and in this he was much like all around him a general feeling of drowsiness had come over the men and the legs and feet of many among them notwithstanding the quantity of bedclothes that were in particular piled on that part of their person were sensitively alive to the cold no one ever knew how low the thermometer went that fearful night but a sort of common consciousness prevailed that nothing the men had yet seen or felt equalled its chill horrors the cold had got into the house converting every article it contained into a mass of frost the berths ceased to be warm and the smallest exposure of a shoulder hand or ears soon produced pain the heads of very many of the party were affected and breathing became difficult and troubled a numbness began to steal over the lower limbs and this was the last unpleasant sensation remembered by roswell when he fell into another short and disturbed slumber the propensity to sleep was very general now though many struggled against it knowing it was the usual precursor of death by freezing  our hero never knew how long he slept in the last nap he took on that memorable occasion when he awoke he found a bright light blazing in the hut and heard some one moving about the camboose then his thoughts reverted to himself and to the condition of his limbs on trying to rub his feet together he found them so nearly without sensation as to make the consciousness of their touching each other almost out of the question taking the alarm at once he commenced a violent friction until by slow degrees he could feel that the nearly stagnant blood was getting again into motion so great had been roswells alarm and so intent his occupation that he took no heed of the person who was busy at the camboose until the man appeared at the side of his berth holding a tin pot in his hand it was stimson up and dressed without his skins and seemingly in perfect preservation  heres some hot coffee captain garner said the provident boatsteerer and then turn out the wind has shifted by the marcy of god and it has begun to rain now i think we may have summer in arnest as summer comes among these sealin islands  roswell took six or eight swallows of the coffee which was smoking hot and instantly felt the genial influence diffused over his whole frame sending stephen to the other berths with this timely beverage he now sat up in his berth and rubbed his feet and legs with his hands the exercise friction and hot coffee soon brought him round and he sprang out of his berth and was quickly dressed stimson had lighted a fire in the camboose using the very last of the wood and the warmth was beginning to diffuse itself through the building but the change in the wind and the consequent melioration of the temperature probably alone saved the whole of the oyster pond crew from experiencing the dire fate of that of the vineyard craft  stephen got man after man out of his berth by doses of the steaming coffee and the blood being thus stimulated by the aid of friction everybody was soon up and stirring it was found on inquiry that all three of the blacks had toes or ears frozen and with them the usual application of snow became necessary but the temperature of the house soon got to be so high as to render the place quite comfortable warm food being deemed very essential stephen had put a supply of beans and pork into his coppers and the frost having been extracted from a quantity of the bread by soaking it in cold water a hearty meal of good hot and most nourishing food was made by all hands this set our sealers up no more complaints of the frost being heard  it was indeed no longer very cold the thermometer was up to twentysix above zero in the house when roswell turned out and the cooking process together with stephens fires and the shift of wind soon brought the mercury up to forty this was a cheering temperature for those who had been breathing the polar air and the influence of the northeast gale continued to increase the rain and thaw produced another deluge and the cliffs presented for several hours a sight that might have caused niagara to hide her head in mortification these sublime scenes are of frequent occurrence amid the solitudes of the earth the occasional phenomena of nature often surpassing in sublimity and beauty her rarest continued efforts  the succeeding day the rain ceased and summer appeared to have come in reality it is true that at midday the thermometer in the shade stood at only fortyeight but in the sun it actually rose to seventy let those who have ever experienced the extremes of heat and cold imagine the delight with which our sealers moved about under such a sun all excess of clothing was thrown aside and many of the men actually pursued their work in their shirtsleeves  as the snow had vanished quite as suddenly as it came everything and everybody was now in active motion not a man of the crew was disposed to run the risk of encountering any more cold on sealers land roswell himself was of opinion that the late severe weather was the dying effort of the winter and that no more cold was to be expected and stimson agreed with him in this notion the sails were taken down from around the house and those articles it was intended to carry away were transferred to the schooner as fast as the difficulties of the road would allow while his mates were carrying on this duty our young master took an early occasion to examine the state of matters generally on the island with this view he ascended to the plain and went halfway up the mountain desiring to get a good look into the offing  it was soon ascertained that the recent deluge had swept all the ice and every trace of the dead into the sea the body of daggett had disappeared with the snowbank in which it had been buried and all the carcases of the seals had been washed away in a word the rocks were as naked and as clean as if mans foot had never passed over them from the facts that skeletons of seals had been found strewed along the north shore and the present void roswell was led to infer that the late storm had been one of unusual intensity and most probably of a character to occur only at long intervals  but the state of the ice was the point of greatest interest the schooner could now be got ready for sea in a week and that easily but there she lay imbedded in a field of ice that still covered nearly the whole of the waters within the group as roswell stood on the cliffs which overlooked the cove he calculated the distance it would be necessary to take the schooner through the ice by sawing and cutting and that through a field known to be some four feet thick at five good miles at least so herculean did this task appear to be that he even thought of abandoning his vessel altogether and of setting out in the boats as soon as the summer was fairly commenced on reflection however this last plan was reserved as a dernier ressort the danger of encountering the tempests of those seas in a whaleboat without covering or fire being much too great to be thought of so long as any reasonable alternative offered  the bergs to the southward were in motion and a large fleet of them was putting to sea as it might be coming in from those remote and then unknown regions in which they were formed from the mountain our hero counted at least a hundred all regularly shaped with tops like that of tableland and with even regular sides and upright attitudes it was very desirable to get ahead of these new maritime alps for the ocean to the northward was unusually clear of ice of all kinds that lodged between the islands excepted  so long as it was safe to calculate on the regular changes of the seasons roswell knew that patience and vigilance would serve his turn by bringing everything round in its proper time and place but it was by no means certain that it was a usual occurrence for the great bay to be crammed with fieldice as had happened the past winter if the actual state of the surrounding waters were an exception instead of the rule on examining the shores however it was found that the rain and melted snow had created a sort of margin and that the strong winds which had been blowing and which in fact were still blowing had produced a gradually increasing attrition until a space existed between the weatherside of the field and the rocks that was some thirty fathoms wide this was an important discovery and brought up a most grave question for decision  owing to the shape of the surrounding land it would not be possible for the ice to float out in a body for two or three months to come or until so much had melted as to leave room for the field to pass the capes and headlands it never could have entered the bay for the same reason but for the resistless power of a field that extended leagues out into the ocean where acted on jointly by wind and tide it came down with a momentum that was resistless ripping and tearing the edges of the field as if they had been so much freshly turned up mould it was then a question how to get the schooner out of her present bed and into clear water  the reader will probably remember that on her first arrival at the group the sea lion had entered the great bay from the southward while in her subsequent effort to get north she had gone out by the opposite passage now it occurred to roswell that he might escape by the former of these routes more readily than by the latter and for the following reasonsno fieldice had ever blocked up the southern passage which was now quite clear though the approach to it just then was choked by the manner in which the northeast gale that was still blowing pressed home against the rocks the field that so nearly filled the bay a shift of wind however must soon come and when that change occurred it was certain that this field would move in an opposite direction leaving the margin of open water that has already been mentioned all along the rocks the distance was considerable it is truenot less than fifteen milesand the whole of it was to be made quite close to sharp angular rocks that would penetrate the schooners sides almost as readily as an axe in the event of a nip but this danger might be avoided by foresight and a timely attention to the necessities of the case seeing no more available plan to get the vessel out of her present duresse the mates came readily into this scheme and preparations were made to carry it out as the cove was so near the northeast end of sealers land it may be well to explain that the reason this same mode of proceeding could not be carried out in a northern direction was the breadth of the field seaward and the danger of following the north shore when the solid ice did leave it on account of the quantities of broken fragments that were tossing and churning in its front far as the eye could reach from the cliffs themselves  the third day after the commencement of the thaw the wind came round again from the southwest blowing heavily as was expected this soon began to set the field in motion driving it over towards the volcano and at the same time northerly about six in the morning hazard brought a report to roswell that a margin of open water was beginning to form all along under the cliffs while there was great danger that the channel which had been cut from the schooner to the nearest point beneath the rocks in readiness for this very contingency might be closed by the pressure of the ice without on that within the cove no time was to be lost therefore if it was intended to move the craft on this shift of wind the distance that had been sawed through to make the channel just named did not exceed a hundred yards the passage was not much wider than the schooners breadth and it will be easily understood that it was to the last degree important to carry her through this strait as soon as possible although many useful articles were scattered about on the ice and several remained to be brought over the rocks from the house the order was given to get out lines and to move the vessel at once the men set to work with hearty goodwill another glimpse of home rising before their imaginations and in five minutes after hazard had made his communication the sea lion had gone six or eight times her length towards the cliffs then came the pinch had not the ice been solid between the cape and the berth just before occupied by the schooner she would have been hopelessly nipped by the closing of the artificial channel as it was she was caught and her progress was arrested but the field took a cant in consequence of the resistance of the solid ice that filled the whole cove to the eastward of the channel and before any damage was done the latter began to open even faster than it had come together the instant the craft was released the sealers manned their hauling lines again and ran her up lo the rocks with a hurrah the margin of water was just opening but so prompt had been the movement of the men that it was not yet wide enough to permit the vessel to go any further and it was found necessary to wait until the passage was sufficiently wide to enable her to move ahead the intervening time was occupied in bringing to the craft the articles left behind  by nine oclock everything was on board the winding channel that followed the sinuosities of the coast could be traced far as the eye could see the lines were manned and the word was again given to move roswell now felt that he was engaged in much the most delicate of all his duties the desperate run through the fleet of bergs and the second attempt to get to sea were not in certain particulars as hazardous as this the field had been setting back and forth now for several weeks the margin of cleat water increasing by the attrition at each return to the rocks and it was known by observation that these changes often occurred at very short notices should the wind haul round with the sun or one of the unaccountable currents of those seas intervene before the southeast cape was reached the schooner would probably be broken into splinters or ground into powder in the course of some two or three hours it was allimportant therefore to lose not a moment  several times in the course of the first hour the movement of the schooner was arrested by the want of sufficient room to pass between projecting points in the cliffs and the edge of the ice on two of these occasions passages were cut with the saw the movement of the field not answering to the impatience of the sealers at the end of that most momentous hour however the craft had been hauled ahead a mile and a half and had reached a curvature in the coast where the margin of open water was more than fifty fathoms wide and the tracking of the vessel became easy and rapid by two oclock the sea lion was at what might be called the bottom of the great bay some three or four leagues from the cove and at the place where the long low cape began to run out in a southeasterly direction as the wind could now be felt over the rocks the foretopsail was set as well as the lower sails the latter being mainly becalmed however by the land when the people were all taken on board the craft moving faster under her canvass than by means of the hauling lines the wind was very fresh and in half an hour more the southeast cape came in sight close as were the navigators to the rocks ten minutes later the sea lion was under reefed sails stretching off to the southward and eastward in perfectly clear water  at first roswell gardiner was disposed to rejoice under the impression that his greatest labour had been achieved a better look at the state of things around him however taught the disheartening lesson of humility by demonstrating that they had in truth but just commenced  although there was scarcely any fieldice to the southward of the group and in its immediate neighbourhood there was a countless number of bergs it is true these floating mountains did not come very near the passage for the depth of water just there usually brought them up ere they could get into it nevertheless a large fleet of them was blockading the entire group far as the eye could reach looking east west and south or along the whole line of the southern coast it was at first questionable whether and soon after it became certain that the schooner could never beat through such dangers had the wind been fair the difficulty would have been insurmountable but ahead and blowing a little gale the matter was out of the question some other course must be adopted  there was a choice of alternatives one was to go entirely round the whole group passing to the eastward of the volcano where no one of the party had ever been and the other was to follow the eastern margin of the bay keeping inside of it and trusting to finding some opening by which the schooner could force her way into clear water to the northward after a very brief consultation with his mates roswell decided on attempting the last  as the course now to be steered was almost dead before the wind the little craft lightened of so much of her upper works almost flew through the water the great source of apprehension felt by our young men in attempting this new expedient was in the probability that the field would drift home to the rocks in the northeast quarter of the bay which with a southwest wind was necessarily a quarter to leeward should this prove to be the case it might be found impossible to pass ahead and the schooner would be caught in a cul de sac since it would not be in the power of her people to track her back again in the teeth of so strong a wind notwithstanding these probabilities on roswell went for he saw plain enough that at such a moment almost anything was better than indecision  the rate at which the little craft was flying before a fresh gale in perfectly smooth water soon put our sealers in a better condition to form closer estimates of their chances the lookouts aloft one of whom was hazard the first officer sent down on deck constant reports of what they could see  how does it look ahead now mr hazard demanded roswell about five in the afternoon just as his schooner was coming close under the smoking sides of the volcano which had always been an object of interest to him though he had never found time to visit it before is there no danger of our touching the ground close in as we are to this island  i think not sir when i landed here we kept the lead going the whole time and we got two fathoms quite up to the shore in my judgment captain garner we may run down along this land as bold as lions  and how does it look ahead ive no wish to get jammed here close aboard of a volcano which may be choking us all with its smoke before we know where we are  not much danger of that sir with this wind these volcanoes are nothin but playthings ater all the vapour is driving off towards the northeastthat was a crack with a vengeance  just as hazard was boasting of the innocuous character of a volcano that near them fired a gun as the men afterwards called it casting into the air a large flight of cinders and stones accompanied by a sharp flash of flame all the lighter materials drove away to leeward but the heavier followed the law of projectiles and scattered in all directions several stones of some size fell quite close to the schooner and a few smaller actually came down on her decks  it will never do to stop here to boil our pot cried roswell to the mate we must get away from this mr hazard as fast as the good craft can travel  get away it is sir there is nothing very near ahead to stop us though it does look more toward the east cape as if the field was jammed in that quarter  keep all your eyes about you sir and look out especially for any opening among the smaller islands ahead i am not without hope that the currents which run among them may give us a clear passage in that quarter  these words explain precisely that which did actually occur on went the schooner almost brushing the base of the volcano causing roswell many a bound of the heart when he fancied she must strike but she went clear all this time it was crack crack crack from the crater rumbling sounds and heavy explosions the last attended by flames and smoke of a pitchy darkness a dozen times the sea lion had very narrow escapes when nearest to the danger stones of a weight to pass through her decks and bottom falling even on the ice outside of her but that hand which had so benevolently stayed various other evils was stretched forth to save and nothing touched the schooner of a size to do any injury these escapes made a deep impression on roswell until the past winter he had been accustomed to look upon things and events as matters of course this vacant indifference so common to men in prosperity was extended even to the sublimest exhibition of the almighty power our hero seeing nothing in the firmament of heaven of a clear night but the twinkling rights that seemed to him to be placed there merely to garnish and illumine the darkness of this globe now how differently did he look upon natural objects and their origin if it were only an insect his mind presented its wonderful mechanism its beauty its uses no star seemed less than what science has taught us that it is and the power of the dread being who had created all who governed all and who was judge of all became an inseparable subject of contemplation as he looked upon the least of his works feelings thus softened and tempered by humility easily led their subject to the reception of those leading articles of the christian faith which have been consecrated by the belief of the church catholic since the ages of miraculous guidance and which are now venerable by time bold and presuming is he who fancies that his intellect can rectify errors of this magnitude and antiquity and that the church of god has been permitted to wallow on in a most fatal idolatry for centuries to be extricated by the pretending syllogisms of his onesided and narrow philosophy  the people of the sea lion were less affected by what they saw than their young commander their hearts were light with the prospect of a speedy release from the hardships and dangers they had undergone and at each explosion of the volcano as soon as out of reach of the falling stones they laughed and asserted that the mountain was firing a salute in honour of their departure such is the difference between men whose hearts and spirits have submitted to the law of faith and those who live on in the recklessness of the passing events of life  the schooner was racing past a rocky islet beginning to haul more on a wind as she made the circuit of the bay just as hazard came to the conclusion that the field had drifted home on the outer island of the group and that it would be impossible to pass into clear water by going on turning his head in quest of some bay or other secure place in which the craft might wait for a favourable change he saw a narrow opening to leeward of the islet he had passed but a minute before and so far as he could perceive one that led directly out to sea  it was too late to keep away for the entrance of the passage the ice being too close at hand to leeward but most fortunately there was room to tack a call to roswell soon caused the schooner to be close on a wind down went her helm and round she came like a top sail was shortened in stays and by the time the little craft was ready to fall off for the passage she had nothing on her but a foretopsail jib and a closereefed mainsail under this canvass she glided along almost brushing the rocks of the islet but without touching in twenty minutes more she was clear of the group altogether and in open water  that night some embarrassment was encountered from broken fieldice of which the ocean was pretty full but by exercising great vigilance no serious thump occurred fortunately the period of darkness was quite short the twilight being of great length both mornings and evenings and the reappearance of the sun cast a cheerful glow on the face of the troubled waters  the wind held at southwest for three days blowing heavily the whole time by the second nightfall the sea was clear of ice and everything was carried on the schooner that she could bear about nine oclock on the morning of the fourth day out a speck was seen rising above the ragged outline of the rolling waves and each minute it became higher and more distinct an hour or two later the sea lion was staggering along before a westerly gale with the hermit of cape horn on her larboard beam distant three leagues how many trying scenes and bitter moments crowded on the mind of young roswell gardiner as he recalled all that had passed in the ten months which intervened since he had come out from behind the shelter of those wild rocks stormy as was that sea and terrible as was its name among mariners coming as he did from one still more stormy and terrible he now regarded it as a sort of place of refuge a winter there he well knew would be no trifling undertaking but he had just passed a winter in a region where even fuel was not to be found unless carried there twenty days later the sea lion sailed again from rio having sold all the seaelephant oil that remained and bought stores of which by this time the vessel was much in want most of the portions of the provisions that were left had been damaged by the thawing process and food was getting to be absolutely necessary to her people when the schooner went again into the noble harbour of the capital of brazil then succeeded the lassitude and calms that reign about the imaginary line that marks the circuit of the earth at that point which is ever central as regards the sun and where the days and nights are always equal no inclination of the earths axis to the plane of its orbit affected the climate there which knew not the distinctions of summer and winter or which if they did exist at all were so faintly marked as to be nearly imperceptible  twenty days later the schooner was standing among some low sandy keys under short canvass and in the southeast trades by her movements an anchorage was sought and one was found at last where the craft was brought up boats were hoisted out and roswell gardiner landed     chapter xxix      if every ducat in six thousand ducats   were in six parts and every part a ducat   i would not draw them i would have my bond    shakspeare   the earth had not stopped in its swift face round the sun at oyster pond while all these events were in the course of occurrence in the antarctic seas the summer had passed that summer which was to have brought back the sealers and autumn had come to chill the hopes as as the body winter did not bring any change nothing was heard of roswell and his companions nor could anything have been heard of them short of the intervention of a miracle  mary pratt no longer mentioned roswell in her prayers she fully believed him to be dead and her puritanical creed taught her that this the sweetest and most endearing of all the rites of christianity was allied to a belief that it was sacrilege to entertain we pretend not to any distinct impressions on this subject ourselves beyond a sturdy protestant disinclination to put any faith in the abuses of purgatory at least but most devoutly do we wish that such petitions could have the efficacy that so large a portion of the christian world impute to them but mary pratt so much better than we can lay any claim to be in all essentials was less liberal than ourselves on this great point of doctrine roswell gardiners name now never passed her lips in prayer therefore though scarce a minute went by without his manly person being present to her imagination he still lived in her heart a shrine from which she made no effort to expel him  as for the deacon age disease and distress of mind had brought him to his last hours the passions which had so engrossed him when in health now turned upon his nature and preyed upon his vitals like an illomened bird it is more than probable that he would have lived some months possibly some years longer had not the evil spirit of covetousness conspired to heighten the malady that wasted his physical frame as it was the sands of life were running low and the skilful dr sage himself had admitted to mary the improbability that her uncle and protector could long survive  it is wonderful how the interest in a rich man suddenly revives among his relatives and possible heirs as his last hour draws near deacon pratt was known to be wealthy in a small way was thought to possess his thirty or forty thousand dollars which was regarded as wealth among the eastenders thirty years since and every human being in old suffolk whether of its overwhelming majority or of its more select and wiser minority who could by legal possibility claim any right to be remembered by the dying man crowded around his bedside at that moment mary pratt who had so long nursed his diseases and mitigated his sufferings was compelled to appear as a very insignificant and secondary person others who stood in the same degree of consanguinity to the dying man and two a brother and sister who were even one degree closer had their claims and were by no means disposed to suffer them to be forgotten gladly would poor mary have prayed by her uncles bedside but parson whittle had assumed this solemn duty it being deemed proper that one who had so long tilled the office of deacon should depart with a proper attention to the usages of his meeting some of the relatives who had lately appeared and who were not so conversant with the state of things between the deacon and his divine complained among themselves that the latter made too many illtimed allusions to the pecuniary wants of the congregation and that he had in particular almost as much as asked the deacon to make a legacy that would enable those who were to stay behind to paint the meetinghouse erect a new horseshed purchase some improved stoves and reseat the body of the building these modest requests it was whisperedfor all passed in whispers thenwould consume not less than a thousand dollars of the deacons hard earnings and the thing was mentioned as a wrong done him who was about to descend into the grave where nought of earth could avail him in any way  close was the siege that was laid to deacon pratt during the last week of his life many were the hints given of the necessity of his making a will though the brother and sister estimating their rights as the law established them said but little on the subject and that little was rather against the propriety of annoying a man in their brothers condition with business of so perplexing a nature the fact that these important personages set their faces against the scheme had due weight and most of the relatives began to calculate the probable amount of their respective shares under the law of distribution as it stood in that day this excellent and surpassingly wise community of new york had not then reached the pass of exceeding liberality towards which it is now so rapidly tending in that day the debtor was not yet thought of as the creditors next heir and that plausible and impracticable desire of a false philanthropy which is termed the homestead exemption law impracticable as to anything like a just and equitable exemption of equal amount in all cases of indebtednesswas not yet dreamed of new york was then a sound and healthful community making its mistakes doubtless as men ever will err but the control of things had not yet passed into the hands of sheer political empirics whose ignorance and quackery were stimulated by the lowest passion for majorities among other things that were then respected were wills but it was not known to a single individual among all those who thronged the dwelling of deacon pratt that the dying man had ever mustered the selfcommand necessary to make such an instrument he was free to act but did not choose to avail himself of his freedom had he survived a few years he would have found himself in the enjoyment of a liberty so sublimated that he could not lease or rent a farm or collect a common debt without coming under the harrow of the tiller of the political soil  the season had advanced to the early part of april and that is usually a soft and balmy month on the seashore though liable to considerable and sudden changes of temperature on the day to which we now desire to transfer the scene the windows of the deacons bedroom were open and the soft south wind fanned his hollow and pallid cheek death was near though the principle of life struggled hard with the king of terrors it was now that that bewildered and pharasaical faith which had so long held this professor of religion in a bondage even more oppressive than open and announced sins most felt the insufficiency of the creed in which he had rather been speculating than trusting all his life to render the passing hour composed and secure there had always been too much of self in deacon pratts moral temperament to render his belief as humble and devout as it should be it availed him not a hair now that he was a deacon or that he had made long prayers in the marketplaces where men could see him or that he had done so much as he was wont to proclaim for examples sake all had not sufficed to cleanse his heart of worldlymindedness and he now groped about him in the darkness of a faith obscured for the true light that was to illumine his path to another world  the doctor had ordered the room cleared of all but two or three of the dying mans nearest relatives among these last however was the gentle and tenderhearted mary who loved to be near her uncle in this his greatest need she no longer thought of his covetousness of his griping usury of his living so much for self and so little for god while hovering about the bed a message reached her that baiting joe wished to see her in the passage that led to the bedroom she went to this old fisherman and found him standing near a window that looked towards the east and which consequently faced the waters of gardiners bay  there she is miss mary said joe pointing out of the window his whole face in a glow between joy and whiskey it should be told to the deacon at once that his last hours might be happier than some that he has passed lately thats shethough at first i did not know her  mary saw a vessel standing in towards oyster pond and her familiarity with objects of that nature was such as to tell her at once that it was a schooner but so completely had she given up the sea lion that it did not occur to her that this could be the longmissing craft  at what are you pointing joe the wondering girl asked with perfect innocence  at that craftat the sea lion of sterling which has been so long set down as missing but which has turned up just as her owner is about to cast off from this arth altogether  joe might have talked for an hour he did chatter away for two or three minutes with his head and half his body out of the window uninterrupted by mary who sank into a chair to prevent falling on the floor at length the dear girl commanded herself and spoke  you cannot possibly be certain joe she said that schooner does not look to me like the sea lion  nor to me in some things while in other some she does her upper works seem strangely out of shape and theres precious little on em but no other foretawsail schooner ever comes in thisaway and i know of none likely to do it ay by jupiter there goes the very blue peter i helped to make with my own hands and it was agreed to set it as the deacons signal theres no mistake now  joe might have talked half an hour longer without any fear of interruption for mary had vanished to her own room leaving him with his head and body still out of the window making his strictures and conjectures for some time longer while the person to whom he fancied he was speaking was in truth on her knees rendering thanks to god an hour later all doubt was removed the schooner coming in between oyster pond and shelter island and making the best of her way to the wellknown wharf  isnt it wonderful mary exclaimed the deacon in a hollow voice it is true but with an animation and force that did not appear to have any immediate connection with deathisnt it wonderful that garner should come back after all if he has only done his duty by me this will be the greatest ventur of my whole life it will make the evening of my days comfortable i hope ive always been grateful for blessings and im sure im grateful from the bottom of my heart for this give me prosperity and im not apt to forget it theyve been asking me to make a will but i told em i was too poor to think of any such thing and now my schooner has got back i spose i shall get more hints of the same sort should anything happen to me mary you can bring out the sealed paper i gave you to keep and that must satisfy em all youll remember it is addressed to garner there isnt much in it and it wont be much thought of i fancy but such as it is tis the last instrument i sign unless i get better to think of garners coming back after all it has put new life in me and i shall be about agin in a week if he has only not forgotten the key and the hidden treasure  mary pratts heart had not been so light for many a weary day but it grieved her to be a witness of this lingering longing after the things of the world she knew that not only her uncles days but that his very hours were numbered and that notwithstanding this momentary flickering of the lamp in consequence of fresh oil being poured into it the wick was nearly consumed and that it must shortly go out let roswells success be what it might the news of the sudden and unlookedfor return of a vessel so long believed to be lost spread like wildfire over the whole point and greatly did it increase the interest of the relatives in the condition of the dying man if he was a subject of great concern before doubly did he become so now a vessel freighted with furs would have caused much excitement of itself but by some means or other the deacons great secret of the buried treasure had leaked out most probably by means of some of his lamentations during his illness and though but imperfectly known it added largely to the expectations connected with the unlookedfor return of the schooner in short it would not have been easy to devise a circumstance that should serve to increase the liveliness of feeling that just then prevailed on the subject of deacon pratt and his assets than the arrival of the sea lion at that precise moment  and arrive she did that tempesttossed crippled icebound and halfburned little craft after roaming over an extent of ocean that would have made up half a dozen ordinary sea voyages it was in truth the schooner so well known to the reader that was now settling away her mainsail and jib as she kept off under her foretopsail alone towards the wharf on which every human being who could with any show of propriety be there at such a moment was now collected in a curious and excited crowd altogether including boys and females there must have been not less than a hundred persons on that wharf and among them were most of the anxious relatives who were in attendance on the vessels owner in his last hours by a transition that was natural enough perhaps under the circumstances they had transferred their interest in the deacon to this schooner which they looked upon as an inanimate portion of an investment that would soon have little that was animate about it  baiting joe was a sort of oracle in such circumstances he had passed his youth at sea having often doubled the horn and was known to possess a very respectable amount of knowledge on the subject of vessels of all sorts and sizes rig and qualities he was now consulted by all who could get near him as a matter of course and his opinions were received as res adjudicata as the lawyers have it  thats the boat said joe affecting to call the sea lion by a diminutive as a proof of regard yes thats the craft herself but she is wonderfully deep in the water i never seed a schooner of her tonnage come in from a vyge with her scuppers so near awash dont you think jim there must be suthin heavier than skins in her hold to bring her down so low in the water  jim was another loafer who lived by taking clams oysters fish and the other treasures of the surrounding bays he was by no means as bigh authority as baiting joe still he was always authority on a wharf  i never seed the like ont answered jim that schooner must ha made most of her passage under water shes as deep as one of our coasters comin in with a load o brick  shes deep but not as deep as a craft i once made a cruise in i was aboard of the first of uncle sams gunboats that crossed the pond to gibraltar when we got in it made the mediterranean stare i can tell you we had furrin officers aboard us the whull time lookin about and wonderin as they called it if we wasnt amphibbies  whats that demanded jim rather hastily theres no sich rope in the ship  i know that well enough but an amphibby as i understand it is a new sort of whale that comes up to breathe like all of that family as old dr mitchell of cow neck calls the critturs so the furrin officers thought we must be of the amphibby family to live so much under water as it seemed to them it was wet work i can tell you boys i dont think i got a good breath more than once an hour the whull of the first day we was out one of the furrin officers asked our captain how the gunboat steered he wasnt a captain at allonly a master you see and we all called him jumpin billy so jumpin billy says dont know sir what crossed the atlantic in her and dont know how your craft steers says the furrin officer says heand well he might jim since nothin that ever lived could go from norfolk to gibraltar without some attention to the helmbut jumpin billy had another story to tell no sir dont know he answered you see sir a norwester took us right aft as we cleared the capes and down she dove with her nose under and her starn out and she come across without having a chance to try the rudder  this story which joe had told at least a hundred times before and which by the way is said to be true produced the usual admiration especially among the crowd of legateesexpectant to most of whom it was quite new when the laugh went out which it soon did of itself joe pursued a subject that was of more interest to most of his auditors or rather to the principal personages among them  skins never brought a craft so low that you may be sartain of he resumed ive seed all sorts of vessels stowed but a hundred pressscrews couldnt cram in furs enough to bring a craft so low to my eye jim theres suthin unnatral about that schooner ater all  the study is scarce worthy of a diploma but we will take this occasion to say for the benefit of certain foreign writers principally of the female sex who fancy they represent americanisms that the vulgar of the great republic and it is admitted there are enough of the class never say summat or somethink which are low english but not low american dialect the inandin yankee says suthin in a hundred other words have these ambitious ladies done injustice to our vulgar who are not vulgar according to the laws of cockayne in the smallest degree the broadway for instance is no more used by an american than the congress or the united states of north america  perhaps answered jim tisnt the sea lion ater all theres a family look about all the craft some men build and this may be a sort of relation of our missin schooner  ill not answer for the craft though thats her blue peter and thems her mastheads and i turned in that tawsail halyardblock with my own handsill tell you what jim theres been a wrack or a nip up yonder among the ice and this schooner has been built anew out of that there schooner you see if it dont turn out as i tell you ay and theres captain garner himself alive and well just comin forrard  a little girl started with this news and was soon pour ing it into the willing ears and open heart of the weeping and grateful mary an hour later roswell held the latter in his arms for at such a moment it was not possible for the most scrupulous of the sex to affect coldness and reserve where there was so much real tenderness and love while folding mary to his heart roswell whispered in her ears the blessed words that announced his own humble submission to the faith which accepted christ as the son of god too well did the gentle and ingenuous girl understand the sincerity and frankness of her lovers nature to doubt what he said or in any manner to distrust the motive that moment was the happiest of her short and innocent life  but the welcome tidings had reached the deacon and ere roswell had an opportunity of making any other explanations but those which assured mary that he had come back all that she wished him to be both of them were summoned to the bedside of the dying man the effect of the excitement on the deacon was so very great as almost to persuade the expectant legatees that their visit was premature and that they might return home to renew it at some future day it is painful to find it our duty to draw sketches that shall contain such pictures of human nature but with what justice could we represent the loathsome likeness of covetousness hovering over a grave and omit the resemblances of those who surrounded it mary pratt alone of all that extensive family connection felt and thought as christianity and womanly affection and reason dictated all the rest saw nothing but the possessor of a considerable property who was about to depart for that unknown world into which nothing could be taken from this but the divine and abused spirit which had been fashioned in the likeness of god  welcome garnerwelcome home agin exclaimed the deacon so heartily as quite to deceive the young man as to the real condition of his owner a mistake that was perhaps a little unfortunate as it induced him to be more frank than might otherwise have been the case i couldnt find it in my heart to give you up and have all along believed that we should yet have good news from you the garners are a reliable family and that was one reason why i chose you to command my schooner them daggetts are a torment but we never should have known anything about the islands or the key hadnt it been for one on em  as the deacon stopped to breathe mary turned away from the bed grieved at heart to see the longings of the world thus clinging to the spirit of one who probably had not another hour to live the glazed but animated eye a cheek which resembled a faded leaf of the maple laid on a cold and whitish stone and lips that had already begun to recede from the teeth made a sad sad picture truly to look upon at such a moment yet of all present mary pratt alone felt the fullness of the incongruity and alone bethought her of the unreasonableness of encouraging feelings like those which were now uppermost in the deacons breast even minister whittle had a curiosity to know how much was added to the sumtotal of deacon pratts assets by the return of a craft that had so long been set down among the missing when all eyes therefore were turned in curiosity on the handsome face of the fine manly youth who now stood at the bedside of the deacon including those of brother and sister of nephews and nieces of cousins and friends those of this servant of the most high god was of the number and not the least expressive of solicitude and expectation as soon as the deacon had caught a little breath and had swallowed a restorative that the hired nurse had handed to him his eager thoughts reverted to the one engrossing theme of his whole life  these are all friends garner he said come to visit me in a little sickness that ive been somewhat subject to of late and who will all be glad to hear of our good fortune so youve brought the schooner back ater all garner and will disappint the sag harbour shipowners who have been all along foretelling that we should never see her aginbrought her backha garner  only in part deacon pratt we have had good luck and bad luck since we left you and have only brought home the best part of the craft  the best part said the deacon gulping his words in a way that compelled him to pause the best part what in the name of property has become of the rest  the rest was burned sir to keep us from freezing to death roswell then gave a brief but very clear and intelligible account of what had happened and of the manner in which he had caused the hulk of the deacons sea lion to be raised upon by the materials furnished by the sea lion of the vineyard the narrative brought mary pratt back to the side of the bed and caused her calm eyes to become riveted intently on the speakers face as for the deacon he might have said with shakspeares wolsey  had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies  his fall was not that of a loss of power it is true but it was that of a still more ignoble passion covetousness as roswell proceeded his mind represented one source of wealth after another released from his clutch until it was with a tremulous voice and a countenance from which all traces of animation had fled that he ventured again to speak  then i may look upon my ventur as worse than nothing he said the insurers will raise a question about paying for a craft that has been rebuilt in this way and the vineyard folks will be sartain to put in a claim of salvage both on account of two of their hands helping you with the work and on account of the materialsand we with no cargo as an offset to it all  no deacon it is not quite as bad as that resumed roswell we have brought home a good lot of skins enough to pay the people full wages and to return you every cent of outfit with a handsome advance on the venture a sealer usually makes a good business of it if she falls in with seals our cargo in skins cant be worth less than 20000 besides half a freight left on the island for which another craft may be sent  that is suthin the lord be praised ejaculated the deacon though the schooner is as bad as gone and the outlays have been awfully heavy im almost afraid to go any further gardnerdid youi grow weak very fastdid you stopmary i wish you would put the question  i am afraid that my uncle means to ask if you stopped at the key in the west indies according to your instructions roswell the niece said and most reluctantly for she plainly saw it was fully time her uncle ceased to think of the things of this life and to begin to turn all his thoughts on the blessed mediation and another state of being  i forgot no part of your orders sir rejoined roswell it was my duty to obey them and i believe i have done so to the letter  stop garner interrupted the dying manone question while i think of it will the vineyard men have any claim of salvage on account of them skins  certainly not sir these skins are all our ownwere taken cured stowed and brought home altogether by ourselves there is a lot of skins belonging to the vineyarders stowed away in the house which is yours deacon and which it would well pay any small craft to go and bring away if anybody is to claim salvage it will be ourselves no salvage was demanded for the loss off cape henlopen i trust  no nonedaggett behaved what i call liberal in that affairhalf the critics of the day would use the adjective instead of the adverb here and why should deacon prates english be any better than his neighboursand so ive admitted to his friends over on the vineyard but garner our great affair still remains to be accounted for do you wish to have the room cleared before you speak of thatshall we turn the key on all these folks and then settle accountshe he he  the deacons facetiousness sounded strangely out of place to roswell still he did not exactly know how to gainsay his wishes there might be an indiscretion in pursuing his narrative before so many witnesses and the young man paused until the room was cleared leaving no one in it but the sick man mary himself and the nurse the last could not well be gotten rid of on oyster pond where her office gave her an assumed right to know all family secrets or what was the same thing to her to fancy that she knew them among all the sayings which the experience of mankind has reduced to axioms there is not one more just than that which says there are secrets in all families these secrets the world commonly affects to know all about but we think few will have reached the age of threescore without becoming convinced of how much pretending ignorance there is in this assumption of the world tot ou tard tout se scait is a significant saying of our old friends the french who know as much of things in practice as any other people on the face of the earth but tot ou tard tout ne se scait pas  is the door shut asked the deacon tremulously for eagerness united to debility was sadly shaking his whole frame see that the door is shut tight mary this is our own secret and nurse must remember that  mary assured him that they were alone and turned away in sorrow from the bed  now garner resumed the deacon open your whole heart and let us know all about it  roswell hesitated to reply for he too was shocked at witnessing this instance of a souls clinging to mammon when on the very eve of departing for the unknown world there was a look in the glazed and sunken eyes of the old man that reminded him unpleasantly of that snapping of the eyes which he had so often seen in daggett  you didnt forget the key surely garner asked the deacon anxiously  no sir we did our whole duty by that part of the voyage  did you find itwas the place accurately described  no chart could have made it better we lost a month in looking for the principal landmark which had been altered by the weather but that once found the rest was easy the difficulty we met with in starting has brought us home so late in the spring  never mind the spring garner the part that is past is sartain to come round agin in due time and so you found the very key that was described by daggett  we did sir and just where he described it to be  and how about the tree and the little hillock of sand at its foot  both were there deacon the hillock must have grown a good deal by reason of the shifting sand but all things considered the place was well enough described  wellwellwellyou opened the hillock of course  we did sir and found the box mentioned by the pirate  a good large box ill warrant ye them pirates seldom do things by halveshe he he  i cant say much for the size of the box deaconit looked to me as if it had once held windowglass and that of rather small dimensions  but the contentsyou do not mention the contents  they are here sir taking a small bag from his pocket and laying it on the bed by the deacons side the pieces are all of gold and there are just one hundred and fortythree of themheavy doubloons it is true and i dare say well worth their 16 dollars each  the deacon gave a gulp as if gasping for breath at the same time that he clutched the bag the next instant he was dead and there is much reason to believe that the demons who had watched him and encouraged him in his besetting sin laughed at this consummation of their malignant arts if angels in heaven did not mourn at this characteristic departure of a frail spirit from its earthly tenement one who had many of their qualities did heavy had been the load on mary pratts heart at the previous display of her uncles weakness and profound was now her grief at his having made such an end     chapter xxx      4 cit we ll hear the will read it mark antony   cit the will the will we will hear caesars will   ant have patience gentle friends i must not read it   it is not meet you know how caesar loved you    julius caesar   there is usually great haste in this country in getting rid of the dead in no other part of the world with which we are acquainted are funerals so simple or so touching placing the judgment and sins which lead to it in a far more conspicuous light than rank or riches or personal merits scarfs and gloves are given in town and gloves in the country though scarfs are rare but beyond these and the pall and the hearse and the weeping friends an american funeral is a very unpretending procession of persons in their best attire on foot when the distance is short in carriages in wagons and on horseback when the grave is far from the dwelling there is however one feature connected with a death in this country that we could gladly see altered it is the almost indecent haste which so generally prevails to get rid of the dead doubtless the climate has had an effect in establishing this custom but the climate by no means exacts the precipitancy that is usually practised  as there were so many friends from a distance present some of whom took the control of affairs mary shrinking back into herself with a timidity natural to her sex and years the moment her care could no longer serve her uncle the funeral of the deacon took place the day after that of his death it was the solemn and simple ceremony of the country the rev mr whittle conceived that he ought to preach a sermon on the occasion of the extinguishment of this bright and shining light and the body was carried to the meetinghouse where the whole congregation assembled it being the sabbath we cannot say much for the discourse which had already served as eulogiums on two or three other deacons with a simple subsittution of names in few things are the credulous more imposed on than in this article of sermons a clergyman shall preach the workings of other mens brains for years and not one of his hearers detect the imposition purely on account of the confiding credit it is customary to yield to the pulpit in this respect preaching is very much like reviewingthe listener or the reader being too complaisant to see through the great standing mystifications of either yet preaching is a work of high importance to men and one that doubtless accomplishes great good more especially when the life of the preacher corresponds with his doctrine and even reviewing though infinitely of less moment might be made a very useful art in the hands of upright independent intelligent and learned men but nothing in this world is as it should be and centuries will probably roll over it ere the good time shall really come  the day of the funeral being the sabbath nothing that touched on business was referred to on the following morning however the friends assembled early in the parlour and an excuse for being a little pressing was made on the ground that so many present had so far to go the deacon had probably made a remove much more distant than any that awaited his relatives  it is right to look a little into the deacons matters before we separate said mr job pratt who if he had the name had not the patience of him of old in order to save trouble and hard feelings among relatives and friends there should be nothing but confidence and affection and i am sure i have no other sentiments toward any here i supposeall mr job pratt knew was ever on a suppositioni suppose i am the proper person to administer to the deacons property though i dont wish to do it if theres the least objection  every one assented that he was the most proper person for all knew he was the individual the surrogate would be the most likely to appoint  i have never set down the deacons property as anything like what common report makes it resumed mr job pratt though i do suppose it will fully reach ten thousand dollars  la exclaimed a female cousin and a widow who had expectations of her own id always thought deacon pratt worth forty or fifty thousand dollars ten thousand dollars wont make much for each of us divided up among so many folks  the division will not be so very great mrs martin returned mr job as it will be confined to the next of kin and their representatives unless a will should be foundand by all i can learn there is noneemphasizing the last word with pointunless a will be found the whole estate real and personal must be divided into just five shares which accordin to my calculation would make about two thousand dollars a share no great fortin to be sure though a comfortable addition to small means the deacon was cluss anglice close yes he was clussall the pratts are a little given to be cluss but i dont know that they are any the worse for it it is well to be curful careful of ones means which are a trust given to us by divine providence  in this manner did mr job pratt often quiet his conscience for being as curful of his own as of other persons assets divine providence according to his morality made it as much a duty to transfer the dollar that was in his neighbours pocket to his own as to watch it vigilantly after the transposition has been effected  a body should be curful as you say sir returned the widow martin and for that reason i should like to know if there isnt a will i know the deacon set store by me and i can hardly think he has departed for another world without bethinking him of his cousin jenny and of her widowhood  im afraid he has mrs martinreally afraid he has i can hear of no will the doctor says he doubts if the deacon could ever muster courage to write anything about his own death and that he has never heard of any will i understand mary that she has no knowledge of any will and i do not know where else to turn in order to inquire rev mr whittle thinks there is a will i ought to say  there must be a will returned the parson who was on the ground again early and on this very errand i feel certain of that from the many conversations i have held with the deceased it is not a month since i spoke to him of divers repairs that were necessary to each and all of the parish buildings including the parsonage he agreed to every word i saidadmitted that we could not get on another winter without a new horseshed and that the east end of the parsonage ought to be shingled this coming summer  all of which may be very true parson without the deacons making a will quietly and we may now add patiently observed mr job  i dont think so returned the minister with a warmth that might have been deemed indiscreet did it not relate to the horseshed the parsonage and the meetinghouse all of which were public property rather than to anything in which he had a more direct legal interest a pious member of the church would hardly hold out the hopes that deacon pratt has held out to me for more than two years without meaning to make his words good in the end i think all will agree with me in that opinion  did the deacon then go so far as to promise to do any thing asked mr job a little timidly for he was by no means sure the answer might not be in the affirmative in which case he anticipated the worst  perhaps not answered minister whittle too conscientious to tell a downright lie though sorely tempted so to do but a man may promise indirectly as well as directly when i have a thing much at heart and converse often about it with a person who can grant all i wish and that person listens as attentively as i could wish him to do i regard that as a promise and in church matters one of a very solemn nature  all the jesuits in the world do not get their educations at rome or acknowledge ignatius loyola as the great founder of their order some are to be found who have never made a public profession of their faith and zeal have naver assumed the tonsure or taken the vows  thats as folks think quietly returned mr job pratt though he smiled in a manner so significant as to cause mrs martin a new qualm as she grew more and more apprehensive that the property was after all to go by the distribution law some folks think a promise ought to be expressed while others think it may be understood the law i believe commonly looks for the direct expression of any binding promise and in matters of this sort one made in writing too and that under a seal and before three responsible witnesses  i wish a full inquiry might be made to ascertain if there be no will put in the minister anxiously  im quite willing so to do returned mr job whose confidence and moral courage increased each instant quite willing and am rather anxious for it if i could only see where to go to inquire  does no one present know of any will made by the deceased demanded minister whittle authoritatively  a dead silence succeeded to the question eye met eye and there was great disappointment among the numerous collaterals present including all those who did not come in as next of kin or as their direct representatives but the rev mr whittle had been too long and too keenly on the scent of a legacy to be thrown out of the hunt just as he believed the game was coming in sight  it might be well to question each near relative directly he added mr job pratt do you know nothing of any will  nothing whatever at one time i did think the deacon meant to make his testament but i conclude that he must have changed his mind  and you mrs thomas turning to the sisteras next of kin i make the same inquiry of you  i once talked with brother about it answered this relative who was working away in a rockingchair as if she thought the earth might stop in its orbit if she herself ceased to keep in motion but he gave me no satisfactory answerthat is nothin that i call satisfactory had he told me he had made a will and given me a full shear share i should have been content or had he told me that he had not made a will and that the law would give me a full shear i should have been content i look upon myself as a person easily satisfied  this was being explicit and left little more to be obtained from the deacons beloved and only surviving sister  and you mary do you know anything of a will made by your uncle  mary shook her head but there was no smile on her features for the scene was unpleasant to her  then no one present knows of any paper that the deacon left specially to be opened after his death demanded rev mr whittle putting the general question pretty much at random  a paper cried mary hastily yes i know something of a paperi thought you spoke of a will  a will is commonly written on paper nowadays miss marybut you have a paper  uncle gave me a paper and told me to keep till roswell gardiner came back and if he himself should not then be living to give it to himthe colour now mounted to the very temples of the pretty girl and she seemed to speak with greater deliberation and care as i was to give the paper to roswell i have always thought it related to him my uncle spoke of it to me as lately as the day of his death  thats the will beyond a doubt cried rev mr whittle with more exultation than became his profession and professionsdo you not think this may be deacon pratts will miss mary  now mary had never thought any such thing she knew that her uncle much wished her to marry roswell and had all along fancied that the paper she held which indeed was contained in an envelop addressed to her lover contained some expression of his wishes on this to her the most interesting of all subjects and nothing else mary pratt thought very little of her uncles property and still less of its future disposition while she thought a great deal of roswell gardiner and of his suit it was consequently the most natural thing in the world that she should have fallen into some such error as this but now that the subject was brought to her mind in this new light she arose went to her own room and soon reappeared with the paper in her hand both mr job pratt and rev mr whittle offered to relieve her of the burthen and the former by a pretty decided movement did actually succeed in getting possession of the documents the papers were done up in the form of a large business letter was duly sealed with wax and was addressed to mr roswell gardiner master of the schooner sea lion now absent on a voyage the superscription was read aloud a little under the influence of surprise notwithstanding which mr job pratt was very coolly proceeding to open the packet precisely as if it had been addressed to himself in this decided step mrs martin and mrs thomas and rev mr whittle might be set down as accessories before the act for each approached and so eager were the two women that they actually assisted in breaking the seal  if that letter is addressed to me said roswell gardiner with firmness and authority i claim the right to open it myself it is unusual for those to whom a letter is not addressed to assume this office  but it comes from deacon pratt cried the widow martin and may contain his will  in which case a body would think i have some rights concerned said mr job pratt a little more coolly but with manifest doubts  sartain put in mrs thomas brothers and sisters and even cousins come before strangers any day here we are a brother and sister of the deacon and we ought to have a right to read his letters  all this time roswell had stood with an extended arm and an eye that caused mr job pratt to control his impatience mary advanced close to his side as if to sustain him but she said nothing  there is a law with severe penalties against knowingly opening a letter addressed to another resumed roswell steadily and it shall be enforced against any one who shall presume to open one of mine if that letter has my address sir i demand it and i will have it at every hazard  roswell advanced a step nearer mr job pratt and the letter was reluctantly yielded though not until the widow martin had made a nervous but abortive snatch at it  at any rate it ought to be opened in our presence put in this woman that we may see what is in it  and by what right maam have i not the privilege of others to read my own letters when and where i please if the contents of this however do really relate to the late deacon pratts property i am quite willing they should be made known there is nothing on this superscription to tell me to open the packet in the presence of witnesses but under all the circumstances i prefer it should be done  hereupon roswell proceeded deliberately to look into the package the seal was already broken and he exhibited it in that state to all in the room with a meaning smile after which he brought to light and opened some written instrument that was engrossed on a single sheet of foolscap and had the names of several witnesses at its bottom  ay ay thats it said baiting joe for the room was crowded with all sorts of people thats the dockerment i knowd it as soon as i laid eyes on it  and what do you know about it josy demanded the widow eagerly cousin job this man may turn out a most important and considerable witness  what do i know mrs martin why i seed the deacon sign for the seals and exercute as soon as i heard squire craft who was down here from riverhead on that ere very business talk so much about seals i knowd captain garner must have suthin to do with the matter the deacons very heart was in the schooner and her vyge and i think it was the craft that finished him in the end  wont that set aside a codicil cousin job if so be the deacon has rally codicilled off captain garner and mary  we shall see we shall see so you was present josy at the making of a will  sartainand was a witness to the insterment as the squire called it i spose he sent for me to be a witness as i am some acquainted with the sealin business having made two vyges out of stunnintun many years since ay ay thats the insterment and pretty well frightened was the deacon when he put his name to it i can tell you  frightened echoed the brotherthats agin law at any rate the instrument that a man signs because hes frightened is no instrument at all in law as respects a will it is what we justices of the peace call dies non or dont die that is in law  can that be so squire job asked the sister who had said but little hitherto but had thought all the more  yes thats latin i spose and good latin too they tell me a man may be dead in the flesh but living in law  la how curous law is a wonderful thing to them that understands it  the worthy mrs thomas expressed a much more profound sentiment than that of which she was probably aware herself law is a wonderful thing and most wonderful is he who can tell what it is today or is likely to be tomorrow the law of testamentary devises in particular has more than the usual uncertainty the great interest that is taken by the community in the large estates of certain individuals who are placed without the ordinary social categories by the magnitude of their fortunes preventing anything from becoming absolutely settled as respects them in turkey and in america the possession of great wealth is very apt to ruin their possessors proscription in some form or other being pretty certain to be the consequences in turkey such has long and openly been the fact the bowstring usually lying at the side of the strong box but in this country the system is in its infancy though advancing towards maturity with giant strides twenty years more resembling the twenty that are just past in which the seed recently sown broadcast shall have time to reach maturity and in our poor opinion the great work of demoralization in this important particular will be achieved we are much afraid that the boasted progress of which we hear so much will resemble the act of the man who fancied he could teach his horse to live without foodjust as he believed the poor beast was perfect it died of inanition  roswell read baiting joes insterment twice and then he placed it with manly tenderness in the hands of mary the girl read the document too tears starting to her eyes but a bright blush suffused her face as she returned the will to her lover  ah do not read it now roswell she said in an under tone but the stillness and expectation were so profound that every syllable she uttered was heard by all in the room  and why not read it now miss mary cried the widow martin methinks now is the proper time to read it if im to be codicilled out of that will i want to know it  it is better in every respect that the company present should know all that is to be known at once observed mr job pratt before the will is read if that be the will captain garner  it is the will of the late deacon pratt duly signed sealed and witnessed i believe sir  one word more then before it is read i think you said josy that the deceased was frightened when he signed that will i do not express any opinion until i hear the will perhaps ater it is read i shall think or say nothin about this fright though the instrument that a man signs because he is frightened if the fright be what i call a legal fright is no instrument at all  but such was not the deacons case squire job put in baiting joe at once he did not sign the insterment because he was frightened but was frightened because he signed the insterment let the boat go right eend foremost squire  read the will captain garner if you have it said mr job pratt with decision it is proper that we should know who is executor friends will you be silent for a moment  amid a deathlike stillness roswell gardiner now read as follows  in the name of god amen i ichabod pratt of the town of southold and county of suffolk and state of new york being of failing bodily health but of sound mind do make and declare this to be my last will and testament  i bequeath to my niece mary pratt only child of my late brother israel pratt all my real estate whatsoever it may be and wheresoever situate to be held by her her heirs and assigns for ever in fee  i bequeath to my brother job pratt any horse of which i shall die possessed to be chosen by himself as a compensation for the injury inflicted on a horse of his while in my use  i bequeath to my sister jane thomas the large lookingglass that is hanging up in the east bedroom of my house and which was once the property of our beloved mother  i bequeath to the widow catherine martin my cousin the big pincushion in the said east chamber which she used so much to praise and admire  i bequeath to my said niece mary pratt the only child of my late brother israel pratt aforesaid all of my personal estate whether in possession or existing in equity including money at use vessels stock on farm all other sorts of stock furniture wearing apparel bookdebts money in hand and all sorts of personal property whatever  i nominate and appoint roswell gardiner now absent on a sealing voyage in my employment as the sole executor of this my last will provided he return home within six months of my decease and should he not return home within the said six months then i appoint my abovementioned niece and heiress mary pratt the sole executrix of this my will  i earnestly advise my said niece mary pratt to marry the said roswell gardiner but i annex no conditions whatever to this advice wishing to leave my adopted daughter free to do as she may think best  the instrument was in all respects duly executed and there could not be a doubt of its entire validity mary felt a little bewildered as well as greatly embarrassed so perfectly disinterested had been all her care of her uncle and so humble her wishes that she did not for some time regard herself as the owner of a property that she had all her life been accustomed to consider as a part of her late uncle the heirs expectant ater reading the insterment as baiting joe told his cronies when he related the circumstances over a mug of cider that evening fore and aft and overhauling it from truck to keelson give the matter up as a bad job they couldnt make nawthin out of oppersition continued joe and so they tuck the horse and the lookingglass and the pincushion and cleared out with their cargo you couldnt get one of that breed to leave as much as a pin behind to which he thought the law would give him a right squire job went off very unwillingly for so strong was his belief in his claim that he had made up his mind as he told me himself to break up the north meadow and put it in corn this coming season  they say that minister whittle took it very hard that nawthin was said about him or about meetin in the deacons will observed jake davis one of baiting joes cronies  that he did and he tuck it so hard that everybody allows the two sermons he preached the next sabba day to be the very two worst he ever did preach  they must have been pretty bad then quaintly observed davis ive long set down minister whittles discourses as being a leetle the worst going when you give him a chance  it is unnecessary to relate any more of this dialogue nor should we have given the little we have did it not virtually explain what actually occurred on the publication of the contents of the will roswell met with no opposition in proving the instrument and the day after he was admitted to act as executor he was married to mary pratt and became tenant by the courtesy to all her real estate such being the law then though it is so no longer now a man and his wife may have a very pretty family quarrel about the ownership of a dozen teaspoons and the last so far as we can see may order the first out of one of her rocking chairs if she see fit surely domestic peace is not so trifling a matter that the law should seek to add new subjects of strife to the many that seem to be nearly inseparable from the married state  let this be as it may no such law existed when roswell gardiner and mary pratt became man and wife one of the first acts of the happy young couple after they were united was to make a suitable disposition of the money found buried at the foot of the tree on the somuchtalked of key its amount was a little more than 2000 dollars the pirate who made the revelation to daggett having in all probability been ignorant himself of the real sum that had been thus secreted by a specific bargain with the crew all this money belonged to the deacon and consequently it had descended to his niece and through her was now legally the property of roswell the young man was not altogether free from scruples about using money that had been originally taken as booty by pirates and his conscientious wife had still greater objections after conferring together on the subject however and seeing the impossibility of restoring the gold to those from whom it had been forced in the first place the doubloons were distributed among the families of those who had lost their lives at sealers land the shares did not amount to much it is true but they did good and cheered the hearts of two or three widows and dependent sisters  nor did roswell gardiners care for their welfare stop here he had the sea lion put in good order removed her decks raised upon her and put her in her original condition and sent her to sealers land again under the orders of hazard who was instructed to take in all the oil and skins that had been left behind and to fill up if he could without risking too much by delay all this was successfully done the schooner coming back after a very short voyage and quite full the money made by this highly successful adventure had the effect to console several of those who had great cause to regret their previous losses  as to roswell and mary they had much reason to be content with their lot the deacons means were found to be much more considerable than had been supposed when all was brought into a snug state roswell found that his wife was worth more than thirty thousand dollars a sum which constituted wealth on oyster pond in that day we have however already hinted that the simplicity and we fear with it the happiness of the place has departed a railroad terminates within a short distance of the deacons old residence bringing with it the clatter ambition and rivalry of such a mode of travelling what is even worse the venerable and expressive name of oyster pond one that conveys in its very sound the idea of savoury dishes and an abundance of a certain and a very agreeable sort has been changed to orient heaven save the mark long island has hitherto been famous in the history of new york for the homely piquancy of its names which usually conveyed a graphic idea of the place indicated it is true jerusalem cannot boast of its solomons temple nor babylon of its hanging gardens but by common consent it is understood that these two names and some halfadozen more of the same quality are to be taken by their opposites  roswell gardiner did not let stimson pass out of his sight as is customary with seamen when they quit a vessel he made him master of a sloop that plied between new york and southold in which employment the good old man fulfilled his time leaving to a widowed sister who dwelt with him the means of a comfortable livelihood for life  the only bit of management of which mary could be accused was practised by her shortly after stimsons death and some six or eight years after her own marriage one of her school friends and a relative had married a person who dwelt west of the bridge as it is the custom to say of all the counties that lie west of cayuga lake this person whose name was hight had mills and made large quantities of that excellent flour that is getting to enjoy its merited reputation even in the old world he was disposed to form a partnership with roswell who sold his property and migrated to the great west as the country west of the bridge was then termed though it is now necessary to go a thousand miles farther in order to reach what is termed the western country mary had an important agency in bringing about this migration she had seen certain longings after the ocean and seals and whales in her husband and did not consider him safe as long as he could scent the odours of a salt marsh there is a delight in this fragrance that none can appreciate as thoroughly as those who have enjoyed it in youth it remains as long as human senses retain their faculties an increasing family however and el dorado of the west which in that day produced wheat were inducements for a removal there and aided by marys gentle management produced the desired effect and for more than twenty years roswell gardiner has been a very successful miller on a large scale in one of the western counties of what is called the empire state we do not think the sobriquets of this country very happy in general but shall quarrel less with this than with the phrase of commercial emporium which is much as if one should say a townish town  roswell gardiner has never wavered in his faith from the time when his feelings were awakened by the just view of his own insignificance as compared to the power of god he then learned the first great lesson in religious belief that of humility without which no man can be truly penitent or truly a christian he no longer thought of measuring the deity with his narrow faculties or of setting up his blind conclusions in the face of positive revelations he saw that all must be accepted or none and there was too much evidence too much inherent truth a morality too divine to allow a mind like his to reject the gospel altogether with mary at his side he has continued to worship the trinity accepting its mysteries in an humble reliance on the words of inspired men    the end
