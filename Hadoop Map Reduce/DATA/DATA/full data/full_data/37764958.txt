cooling down toward evening at sebastian where an unpicturesque collection of wooden houses stand upon a branch line on the canadian prairie the place is not attractive during the earlier portion of the short northern summer when for the greater part of every week it lies sweltering in heat in spite of the strong west winds that drive dustclouds through its rutted streets as a rule during the remaining day or two the temperature sharply falls thunder crashes between downpours of heavy rain and the wet plank sidewalks provide a badlyneeded refuge from the cementlike gumbo mire  the day however had been cloudless and unusually hot prescott had driven in from his wheat farm at some distance from the settlement and he now walked toward the hotel he was twentyeight years old of average height and rather spare figure his face which had been deeply bronzed by frost and sun was what is called open his gray eyes were clear and steady the set of his lips and mould of chin firm he looked honest and goodnatured but one who could when necessary sturdily hold his own his attire was simple a wide gray hat a saffroncolored shirt with flannel collar and a light tweed suit something the worse for wear  as he passed along the sidewalk he looked about the small frame houses were destitute of paint and any pretense of beauty a number of them had raised square fronts which hid the shingled roofs but beyond the end of the street there was the prairie stretching back to the horizon in the foreground it was a sweep of fading green and pale ocher farther off it was tinged with gray and purple and where it cut the glow of green and pink on the skyline a long birch bluff ran in a cold blue smear to the left of the opening rose three grain elevators huge wooden towers with their tops narrowed in and devices of stars and flourbags painted on them at their feet ran the railroad track encumbered with a string of freightcars a tall watertank a grimy stage for unloading coal and a small office shack marked the station  prescott however did not notice much of this he was more interested in the signs of conflict on the persons of the men he met some looked as if they had been violently rolled in the dust others wore torn jackets and the faces of several were disfigured by bruises empty bottles which make handy clubs were suggestively scattered about the road all this was unusual but prescott supposed some allowance must be made for the fact that it was the anniversary of the famous victory of the boyne moreover there was a community of foreign immigrants mixed with some irishmen and french canadians but all professing the romish faith engaged in some railroad work not far away  in front of the hotel ran a veranda supported on wooden pillars and a row of chairs was set out on the matchstrewn sidewalk beneath it most of them were occupied by aftersupper loungers and several of the men bore scars prescott stopped and lighted his pipe  things seem to have been pretty lively here he remarked i came in to see the implement man and found he couldnt talk straight with half his teeth knocked out its lucky the northwest troopers have stopped your carrying pistols  one of the men laughed  weve had a great day sure quite a few of the dagos had knives and jernyngham had a sword guess hed be in trouble now only it wasnt one you could cut with  how did he get the sword  it was king billys explained another man fellow who was acting him got knocked out with a bottle in his eye jernyngham got up on the horse instead and led the last charge when we whipped them across the track  wheres the protestant old guard now  some of its in claytons surgery rests gone home when it looked as if the stores would be wrecked reeve marvin butted in telephoned the railroad boss to send up gravel cars for his boys told the other crowd hed bring the troopers in if they didnt quit ordered all strangers off on the westbound and now were simmering down  wheres jernyngham  the man jerked his hand toward the hotel  in his room a bit the worse for wear mrs jernynghams nursing him  pushing open the wiremesh mosquito door prescott entered the building its interior was shadowy and filled with cigar smoke flies buzzed everywhere and the smell of warm resinous boards pervaded the rank atmosphere the place was destitute of floor covering or drapery and the passage prescott walked down was sloppy with soap and water from a row of washbasins near which hung one small wet towel ascending the stairs he entered a little and very scantily furnished room with walls of uncovered pine it contained a bed with a ragged quilt and a couple of plain wooden chairs in one of which a man leaned back he was about thirty years old and he roughly resembled prescott only that his face which was a rather handsome one bore the stamp of indulgence his forehead was covered by a dirty bandage there was dust on his clothes and prescott thought he was not quite sober in the other chair sat a young woman with fine dark eyes and glossy black hair whose appearance would have been prepossessing had it not been spoiled by her slatternliness and cheap finery she smiled at the visitor as he walked in  if youd come sooner we might have kep him out o trouble she said he got away from me when things begun to hum  her slight accent suggested the french canadian strain though prescott imagined that there was a trace of indian blood in her her manners were unfinished her character was primitive but prescott thought she was as good a consort as jernyngham deserved the latter had a small wheat farm lying back on the prairie but his erratic temperament prevented his successfully working it prescott was not a censorious person and he had a liking and some pity for the man  well he said in answer to the womans remark that was certainly foolish of him but what had he to do with the row anyway  have a drink and ill try to explain said jernyngham a big cool drink might clear my head and i feel it needs it  you kin have soda but nothin else the woman broke in ill send it up and now that i kin leave you im goin to the store she turned to prescott nothin but soda and see he dont git out  she left them and jernyngham laughed  ellices a good sort i sometimes wonder how she puts up with me anyhow im glad you came because im in what might be called a dilemma  as this was not a novelty to his companion prescott made no comment and by and by two tumblers containing iced liquid were brought in jernyngham drained his thirstily and looked up with a grin  it isnt exhilarating but its cool he said now however youre curious about my honorable scarsi got them from a bottle it broke you see but theres some satisfaction in remembering that i knocked out the other fellow with the flat of the immortal williams sword  youll get worse hurt some day prescott rebuked him severely  its possible but youre wandering from the point im trying to remember what led me into the fray in the incongruous company of certain hardshell baptists ontario methodists and belfast presbyterians as a young man my sympathies were with the advanced anglicans perhaps because my people were sternly evangelical then the whole things unreasonablewhat have i to do for instance with the protestant succession  it isnt very plain said prescott still everybody knows what kind of fool you are  i live declared jernyngham you steady industrious fellows grow the row began at the ballgamedisputed base i thinkand our lot had got badly whipped at the first round when i stood on the veranda and sang them no surrender that was enough for the ulster boys and three or four of them go a long way in this kind of scrimmage  prescott had no sympathy with jernynghams vagaries but one could not be angry with him the man was irresponsible in a few moments however jernynghams face grew graver  jack he resumed im in a hole never troubled to ask for my letters until late in the afternoon and now i dont know what to do unless you can help me  you had better tell me what the trouble is  to make you understand ill have to go back some time everybody round this place knows what i am now but i believe i was rather a promising youngster before i left the old country a bit of a rebel though and inclined to kick against the ultraconventional in fact i think honesty was my ruin jack i kicked openly  is there any other way i cant see that theres much use in kicking unless the opposition feels it  dont interrupt scowled jernyngham this is rather deep for you but ill try to explain if you want to get on in the old country you must conform to the standard though you can do what you like at times and places where people of your proper circle arent supposed to see you i didnt recognize the benefits of the system thenand i suffered for it  he paused with a curious halftender look in his face  there was a girl jack good as theyre made i still believe though not in our station well i meant to marry herthought i was strong enough to defy the systemand she not knowing what manner of life i was meant for was fond of me  what manner of life were you meant for  jernyngham laughed harshly  the bar for a beginning id got my degree the house laterthere was strong family influenceto assist in propagating the imperial idea strikes one as amusing jack  prescott thought his companion would not have spoken so freely had he been wholly sober but he had long noticed the purity of the mans intonation and the refinement that occasionally showed in his manners  youre making quite a tale of it he said  well resumed jernyngham i didnt know what i was up against the system broke me when the stress came i hadnt nerve enough to hold out and for that ive been punished my sistershe meant wellgot hold of the girl persuaded her to give me upfor my sake jack wouldnt see me sent back my letters and i came to canada beaten  he paused  theres a reason why you must try to realize my father and sister hes unflinchingly upright conventional to a degree gertrudes a feebler copy as just but perhaps not quite so hard well ive never written to either but ive heard from friends and the conclusion seems to be that as ive never asked for money i must have reformed theres a desire for a reconciliation my fathers getting old and i believe in their reserved way they were fond of me dont be impatient im coming to the point at last id a letter today from colstonthough the mans a relative i havent seen him since i left school he and his wife are passing through on their way to british columbia and the idea seems to be that he should see me and report  prescott made a sign of understanding jernyngham stamped with dissipation and injured in a brawl and his small homestead where everything was in disorder and out of repair were hardly likely to create a favorable impression on his english relatives besides there was mrs jernyngham the effect of her appearance and conversation might be disastrous  now continued jernyngham you see how im fixed i havent much to thank my people for but i want to spare them a shock if it would make things easier for them i dont mind their thinking better of me than i deserve  his companion pondered this it was crudely put but it showed a rather fine consideration prescott thought for the people who were in part responsible for the mans downfall perhaps too a certain sense of shame and contrition jernynghams desire could not be found fault with  what are you going to do about it he asked  nothing said jernyngham with a reckless laugh youll do all thats needed i mean to leave my friends to you strikes me as a brilliant idea though not exactly novel made a number of excellent comedies did you ever see charleys aunt  prescott frowned  i dont deal  think youre not unlike me and were about the same age colston hasnt seen me for fourteen years his wife never  no objected prescott it cant be done  its hardly good form to remind you of it jack but there was a time when we took a grading contract on the line and you got into trouble close in front of the ballast train  prescotts determined expression changed  yes he conceded it gives you a pull on mei cant go back on that he spread out his hands well if you insist  for the old mans sake said jernyngham i want you to take the colstons out to your place and entertain them for a day or two they wont stay long theyre coming in by the westbound this evening  then exclaimed prescott theyll be here in half an hour if the trains on time if there are any points you can give me about your family history you had better be quick  in the first place i was rather a wild youngster with an original turn of mind and was supposed to be a bit of a rake though that wasnt correctmy eccentricities were harmless then your word maverick describes me pretty well i didnt belong to the herd i wouldnt be rounded up with the others and let them put the brand on thats no doubt why they credited me with vices i didnt possess jernyngham laughed still you mustnt overdo the thing you want delicately to convey the idea that youre now reformed the part requires some skill its a pity youre not smarter jack but let me think  he went into a few details about his family and then prescott left him and after giving an order to have his team ready proceeded to the station it was getting dark but the western sky was still a sheet of wonderful pale green against which the tall elevators stood out black and sharp the headlamp of a freight locomotive flooded track and station with a dazzling electric glare the rails that ran straight and level across the waste gleaming far back in the silvery radiance this helped prescott to overcome his repugnance to his task as he remembered another summer night when he had attempted to hurry his team across the track before a ballast train came up startled by the blaze of the headlamp and the scream of the whistle one of the horses plunged and kicked a wheel of the wagon sinking in the loose ballast skidded against a tie and prescott stood between the rails struggling to extricate the beasts while the great locomotive rushed down on them there was a vein of stubborn tenacity in him and it looked as if he and the horses would perish together when jernyngham came running to the rescue how they escaped neither of them could afterward remember but a moment later they stood beside the track while the train went banging by covering them with dust and fragments of gravel prescott admitted that he owed jernyngham something for that  nevertheless there was no doubt that the part he had undertaken to play would be difficult he could see its humorous side but he had not been a prodigal indeed he was by temperament and habit steadygoing and industrious the son of a small business man in montreal he had after an excellent education abandoned city life and gone west where he had prospered by frugality and hard work he was by no means rich but he was content and inclined to be optimistic about the future  when he reached the station he found that the usual crowd of loungers had gathered to watch the train come in lighting his pipe he walked up and down the low platform wondering uneasily how he would get through the next few days jernyngham he felt had placed him in a singularly embarrassing position     chapter ii  muriel sees the west   the sunlight was fading off the prairie when a party of three sat in a firstclass car as the local train went jolting westward henry colston leaned back in his seat with a winnipeg paper on his knee and his appearance stamped him as a wellbred englishman traveling for pleasure he was thirtyfour his dress though dusty was fastidiously neat his expression was pleasant but there was an air of formality about him one would not have expected him to do anything startling or extravagant even under stress of emotion mrs colston resembled him in this respect she was a handsome woman a little reserved in manner and was tastefully dressed in traveling tweed which she had found too hot for the canadian summer muriel her sister was twentyfour and though the two were alike the girls face was fresher more ingenuous and perhaps more intelligent it was an attractive face crowned with redgold hair broad brows straight nose and firm mouth hinted at some force of character but her eyes of deep violet were unusually merry and her warm coloring suggested a sanguine temperament  so far muriel hurst had taken life lightly and had foiled mrs colstons attempts to make a suitable match for her the daughter of a man of taste who had died in difficulties she had not a penny beyond the allowance provided by her sisters generosity nevertheless she was happy and had a strong liking and respect for her prosperous brotherinlaw though his restricted views sometimes irritated her  she was now trying to arrange her impressions of canada which were mixed she had looked down on montreal with its great bridge and broad river from the wooded mountain and from there it had struck her as a beautiful city then she had seen the handsome stone houses with their lawns at the foot of the hill and afterward the magnificent commercial buildings round the postoffice these could scarcely be equaled in london but the rest of the town had not impressed her it was strewn with sand and cementdust they seemed to be pulling down and putting up buildings and tearing open the streets all over it  afterward the western express had swept her through a thousand miles of wilderness a vast tract of forest filled with rocks and lakes and rivers and then she had spent two days in winnipeg on the verge of the prairie this city she found perplexing the station hall was palatial part of wide main street and portage avenue with their stately banks and offices could hardly be too much admired and there were pretty wooden houses running back to the river among groves of trees but apart from this the place was somehow primitive there were numerous hardfaced men hanging about the streets and it jarred on her to see the rows of welldressed loungers in the hotels lolling in wooden chairs close against the great windows a foot or two from the street it gave her a hint of western characteristics the people were abrupt goodnaturedly so perhaps but devoid of delicacy  last had come the prairiethe land of promisewhich seemed to run on forever flooded with brilliant sunshine under a sky of dazzling blue banded with miles of wheat flecked with crimson flowers it stretched back brightly green until it grew gray and blue on the far horizon it was relieved by the neutral purple of poplar bluffs and little gleaming lakes its vastness and openness filled the girl with a sense of liberty narrow restraints cramping prejudices must vanish in this wide country ones nature could expand and become optimistic here  then colston began to talk  we should arrive in the next halfhour and ill confess to a keen curiosity about cyril jernyngham he was an amusing and eccentric scapegrace when i last saw him though that is a very long time ago  you object to eccentricity dont you laughed muriel  oh no call it originality and ill admit that a certain amount is useful but it should be kept in check indulged in freely its apt to rouse suspicion  which is rather unfair  i dont know mrs colston broke in considered all round its an excellent rule that if you wont do what everybody in your station does you must take the consequences  colston nodded  i agree one must think of the results to society as a whole  cyril jernyngham seems to have taken the consequences muriel pointed out isnt there something to be said for the person who does so uncomplainingly i understand he never recanted or asked for help  mrs colston shot a quick glance at her she did not wish her sisters sympathy to be enlisted on the black sheeps behalf  i believe thats true she replied perhaps its hardly to his credit his father is an old man who had expected great things of him if he had come home he would have been forgiven and reinstated  yes said colston though jernyngham seldom shows his feelings i know he has grieved over his son there can be no question that cyril should have returned ive told him so in my letters  i suppose theyd have insisted on a full and abject surrender  not an abject one answered colston he would have been expected to fall in with the family ideas and plans  and he wouldnt suggested muriel with a mischievous smile i think he was right reading disapproval in her sisters expression she continued you dear virtuous people are a little narrow in your ideas you cant understand that theres room for the greatest difference of opinion even in a harmonious family and that its very silly to drive the nonconformer into rebellion varietys a law of nature and tends to life  colston glanced meaningly at his wife he was not a hypercritical person but it did not please him that his sisterinlaw of whom he was fond should champion jernyngham  i dont wish to be severe on cyril he rejoined as a matter of fact i know nothing good or bad about his canadian life but he must be regarded as so to speak on probation until he has proved that he deserves our confidence  muriel made no answer she was looking out of the window toward the west and the glow on the vast plains rim seized her attention the sunset flush had faded but the sky shone a transcendent green the air was very clear every wavy line of bluff was picked out in a wonderful deep blue muriel thought she had never seen such strength and vividness of color then she glanced round the long car it was comfortable except for the jolting the silvery gray of its canebacked seats contrasted with the paneling of deep brown the big lamps and metal fittings gleamed with nickel all the girl saw connected her with luxurious civilization and she wondered with a stirring of curiosity what awaited her in the wilds where man still grappled with nature in primitive fashion  sebastian in three or four minutes announced the conductor and while muriel and mrs colston gathered together a few odds and ends a scream of the whistle broke out  prescott heard it on the station platform and with strong misgivings braced himself for his task a bright light was speeding down the track blending with that flung out by a freight locomotive crossing the switches then amid the clangor of the bell the long cars rolled in and he saw a man standing on the platform of one there was no doubt that he was an englishman and prescott hurried toward the car  mr henry colston he asked  the man held out his hand  i think harry is sufficient come and speak to florence she has been looking forward to meeting you with interest he turned my dear this is cyril  prescott shook hands with the lady on the car platform and then looked past her in confused surprise a girl stood in the vestibule clad in garments of pale lilac tint which fell about her figure in long sweeping lines emphasizing its fine contour against the dark brown paneling she had a large hat of the same color and it enhanced the attractiveness of her face which wore a friendly smile she was obviously one of the party though jernyngham had not mentioned her and prescott pulled himself together when colston presented him  my sisterinlaw muriel hurst he added  when they had alighted prescott asked for the checks and moved toward the baggage car while he waited watching the trunks being flung out ellice passed him talking to a smartly dressed man this struck prescott as curious but he knew the man as a traveling salesman for an american creamseparator and as he must have called at jernynghams homestead on his round and was no doubt leaving by the train there was no reason why ellice should not speak to him he thought no more of the matter and proceeded to carry several trunks and valises across the platform to his wagon while his new friends watched him with some surprise it was a novel experience in their walk of life to see their host carrying their baggage and when prescott lifted the heaviest trunk colston hurried forward to protest  stand aside please said the rancher walking firmly across the boards with the big trunk on his shoulders when he had placed it in the wagon he turned to the ladies with a smile  i had thought of putting you up for the night at the hotel but theyre full and with good luck we ought to make my place in about three hours i dare say this isnt the kind of rig you have been accustomed to driving in and somebody will have to sit on a trunk theres only room for three on the drivingseat  mrs colston surveyed the vehicle with misgivings it was a long shallow box set on four tall and very light wheels and crossed by a seat raised on springs two roughcoated horses were harnessed to it with a pole between them she saw this by the glare of the freight locomotives headlamp when the train moved out and noticed that her husband was looking at their host in surprise  ill take the trunk said colston we had dinner down the line not long ago  prescott helped the ladies up and seating himself next to the younger started his horses they set off at a rapid trot and the wagon jolted unpleasantly as it crossed the track then the horses broke into a gallop raising a dustcloud in the rutted street while the light vehicle rocked in an alarming fashion and prescott had some trouble in restraining them when they ran out on to the dim waste of prairie then the wonderful keen air faintly scented with wild peppermint reacted upon the girl with a curious exhilarating effect she felt stirred and excited expectant of new experiences perhaps adventures the wild barley brushed about the wheels with a silky rustle the beat of hoofs rang in a sharp staccato through the deep silence and the touch of the faint night wind brought warmth into muriels face  theyre pretty fresh been in the stable of a farm near here most of the day prescott explained not long off the range anyhow and theyre bad to hold  there was a shrill scream from a dusky shape flitting through the air as they skirted a marshy pool and the team again broke into a furious gallop the trail was grown with short scrub which smashed beneath the hoofs and the vehicle lurched sharply when the wheels left the ruts and ran through tall tangled grass prescott with some diffidence slipped his arm round muriels waist while colston jolted up and down with his trunk  you have still the same taste in horses cyril he remarked i suppose you remember wildfire  wildfire queried prescott and then having the impression that young english lads were sometimes given a pony ventured quite a cute little beast  little exclaimed colston how many hands make a big horse in this country im speaking of the hunter you cajoled the second groom into saddling when your father was away cant you remember how you insisted on putting her at the newby brook  i dont seem to place it somehow said prescott in alarm seeing that if he were called upon to share any more reminiscences it might lead him into difficulties you know ive been out here a while  long enough to forget it seems  prescott made a bold venture  thats so perhaps its better this is a brand new country one starts afresh here looking forward instead of back  muriel considered this the idea was she thought appropriate but the mans tone and air were not what one would have expected of a reformed rake there was no hint of contrition he spoke with optimistic cheerfulness  of course colston agreed i wonder if i might say that you have grown more canadian than i expected to find you  more canadian prescott checked himself in time and laughed is it surprising you drive and starve out many a good man who dares to be originalive met a number of them can you wonder that when theyre welcomed here theyre willing to forget you and become one with the people who took them in  in a way thats a pity said mrs colston we like to think we havent lost you altogether  disregarding his horses prescott turned toward her with a bow  face the truth maam if youre ever in a tight place well send you what help we can hard men such as cant be raised in your cities to keep the flag flying but we stop there dont think we belong to youwe stand firm on our own feet a new free nation ihe paused in an impressive manneram a canadian  muriel felt a responsive thrill his ideas were certainly not english nor was his mode of expressing them but his boldness appealed to her her companions were frankly astonished and rather hurt which he seemed to realize for he resumed with a laugh  but we wont talk politics things ive heard english people say out here make one tired  then he turned toward the girl adding softly  was that a very bad break i made  i think it could be forgiven she told him  the years you have spent in canada seem to have had their full effect on you colston remarked dryly  prescott turned his attention to his team slightly checking their pace  what did you mean when you said we should reach your ranch in three hours if we had good luck muriel asked  oh he said there are badger burrows about and a little beast called a gopher makes almost as bad a hole theyre fond of digging up the trail if a horse steps into one of those holes its apt to bring him down besides we trust a good deal to our luck in this countryone has to run risks that cant be estimated harvest frost rust dry seasons winds that blow destroying sand about ive lost two crops in the eight years ive been here  can it be eight colston broke in if i remember right you spent three years in manitoba  its the same kind of country and the same climate prescott rejoined conscious that he had nearly betrayed himself again he felt angry with jernyngham for giving him such a difficult part to play  after this he carefully avoided any personal topic and talked about canadian farming sitting silent when he could while muriel gazed about with pleasurable curiosity it is never quite dark on those wide levels in summertime and for there was no moon the prairie stretched away before them shadowy silent and mysterious now they passed a sheet of water gleaming wanly among thin willows then they plunged into the deep gloom of a poplar bluff and later lurching down a steep declivity swept through a shallow creek the air was filled with the smell of dewdamped soil and unknown aromatic scents the loneliness was impressive the halfobscurity emphasized the strangeness of everything muriel felt as if she had left all that was stereotyped and matteroffact far behind it was the unexpected and romantic that ought to happen in this virgin land  then worn by several days journey in the jolting cars she grew drowsy the steady drumming of hoofs the slapping of the traces and the rattle of wheels were strangely soothing she fancied that once or twice when they sped furiously down an incline the driver held her fast but she did not resent the support of his arm it was a steady reassuring grasp at last as they swung round a poplar bluff she roused herself for dim black buildings loomed up ahead and one which had lighted windows took the shape of a small house the team stopped there were voices speaking with a curious accent which reminded her of norway and the rancher helped her down  afterward she followed her sister into a simply furnished pineboarded room with a big stove at one end of it where a middleaged woman set food and coffee before them she spoke english haltingly but her lined face lighted up when muriel thanked her in norse then there followed a flow of eager words a few of which the girl caught until the woman broke off when their host came in he was silent for the most part during the meal and shortly afterward muriel was shown into a small room where she went to sleep in a few minutes     chapter iii  jernyngham makes a decision   prescotts guests had spent a week at his homestead with content when colston and his wife sat talking one morning  im frankly puzzled said colston opening his cigar case i cant make cyril out hes frugal remarkably industriousi think the descriptions warrantedand from all that one can gather as steady as a rock this of course is gratifying but its by no means what i expected  he certainly doesnt fit in with the picture his sister gertrude drew me though she conveyed the impression that she was softening things down there can be no doubt that he was wild that might perhaps be forgiven but one or two of the stories ive heard about him filled me with disgust  her husband looked thoughtful he had not noticed that muriel was sitting just outside the open window though mrs colston being in a different position had done so she thought their voices would reach the girl and if anything strongly in cyrils disfavor cropped up during the conversation it might be as well that she should hear it mrs colston was willing that he should be reconciled to his relatives but a reformed rake was not the kind of man to whom she wished her sister to be attracted one could not tell whether the reformation would prove permanent  after all i never heard any really serious offense proved against him colston rejoined its sometimes easy to acquire a reputation without doing anything in particular to deserve it people are apt to jump at conclusions  when theres a general concurrence of opinion its wiser to fall in with it but what did he say about his fathers suggestion that he should go home  asked for a day or two to think it over i fancied that he wished to consult somebody then he promised to give me an answer  on the whole i think they need have no hesitation about taking him back now mrs colston responded and muriel agreed with her theres another point she added how long shall we stay here  i dont know ive a growing liking for cyril the place is pleasant and though things are rather rudimentary the airs wonderfully bracing he urged me to stay some little time and i felt that he wished it  mrs colston considered she was enjoying her visit everything was delightfully novel and she felt more cheerful and more vigorous than she had done for some time but muriel seemed to find the prairie pleasant and there was a possibility of danger there  we might perhaps remain another week she suggested  as it happened colstons suspicion that his host wished to consult somebody was correct for prescott was then driving in to the settlement to lay his visitors message before the man it most concerned he found him lounging in the hotel bar and drawing him into the generalroom he sat down opposite him in a hard wooden chair the apartment had no floor covering and was cheerless and dirty there was not even a table in it and only a railroad timetable and advertisements of land sales hung on its rough pine walls jernyngham however looked in keeping with his surroundings the dirty bandage still covered his forehead his clothes were stained and untidy and he had an unkempt dissipated air  well he asked with a grin how are you getting on with your new friends  i dont know im curious about what they think of me anyway i found the thing harder than i expected why didnt you tell me mrs colston was bringing her sister  if i ever heard she had one i forgot it suppose i couldnt have read the letter properly whats she like  herself said prescott i cant think of anybody we know i could compare her with  he had endeavored to speak carelessly but something in his voice betrayed him and jernyngham laughed  thats not surprising if you want to play your part properly you had better make love to her its what would be expected of me and it couldnt do any harm because these people would very soon head you off harry colstons sisterinlaw would look for an assured position and at least five thousand dollars a year when are they going  ive asked them to stay a little longer and i think theyll agree but that is not what i came to see you about colston laid a proposition before meyoure formally invited to return home  on what terms  prescott detailed them watching his companion the latter sat silent for a minute or two and then he said slowly  its a handsome offer but it was made under a mistake theres no doubt that colston was trusted with powers of discretion he must be satisfied with youdont you feel complimented jack  what i feel is outside the question  well continued jernyngham thoughtfully i suppose if i indulged in a spell of hard work in the open and practised strict abstinence it might improve my appearance and i could perhaps keep out of colstons way or if needful own up to the trick the old man would hold to his bargain hes that kind its a strong temptationyou see what id stand to gaina liberal allowance a life thats wildly luxurious by comparison with the one im leading the society of people of the stamp ive been brought up among jack i feel driven to the point of yielding but its a pity this offer has come too late  is it too late  think would it be fair to go for a month or two i might keep straight thenive tried to describe my peopleyou can imagine their feelings at the inevitable outbreak besides theres a more serious difficulty jernynghams tense face relaxed into a grim smile can you imagine ellice an inmate of an english country house patronizing local charities presiding over prim garden parties the ideas preposterous and thats not all  prescott knew little about england but he could imagine her making an undesirable sensation in montreal or toronto  you force me to ask something is she mrs jernyngham he said hesitatingly  i used to think so theres a doubt about the matter now  one would have imagined that was a point you would have been sure about  i understood her husband was dead when we were married in manitoba she was a waitress in a secondrate hotel the brute had illused and deserted her but theres now some reason to believe hes farming in alberta i havent made inquiries i didnt think it would improve matters  prescott said nothing in face of such a situation any remarks that he could make would be superfluous there was a long silence and then jernyngham spoke again slowly but resolutely  you see how it is jackwhere my interest lies against that theres the feelings of my father and sister to consider then my reinstatement would have to be bought by casting off the woman who has borne with my failings and stuck to me pluckily i havent sunk quite so far as that youll have to tell colston that im staying here  he got up and prescott laid a hand on his arm  its hard but youre doing the square thing cyril  jernyngham shook off his hand  dont let us talk in that strain come and see ellice and try to amuse her dont know whats wrong with the woman she has been moody of late  i must get back as soon as i can and ive some business to do  oh well acquiesced jernyngham walking with him to the bar which was the quickest way of leaving  on reaching it he turned and glanced about sardonically the room was dark filled with flies and evil smelling as well as thick with smoke half a dozen untidy men leaned against the counter  what a set of loafing swine you are he coolly remarked its not to the point that im no better but if any of you feel insulted ill be happy to make what ive said good  cut it out cyril cant have a circus here exclaimed the bartender  you neednt be afraid they look pretty tame jernyngham rejoined and going on to the door shook hands with prescott  tell colston he has my last word he said  turning away he proceeded to the untidy parlor where he found ellice dawdling over a paper her white summer dress was stained in places and open at the neck where a button had come off the short skirt displayed a hole in one stocking and a shoe from which a strap had been torn jernyngham leaned on the table regarding her with a curious smile  whats jack come about she asked  to say my fastidious relatives want me to go home which would mean leaving you behind  she looked at him searchingly and then laughed  and you wont go  thats the message i sent  ellices face softened though there was a hint of indecision in it  youre all right cyril only a bit of a fool  a bit he said dryly im the whole blamed hog but enough of that well pull out for the homestead tomorrow i expect wandle is robbing me  hes been robbin you ever since you bought the ranch i dont know why you stopped me from gettin after him  he saves me trouble explained jernyngham and they discussed the arrangements for their return  prescott arriving home had a brief private interview with colston who realized with some disappointment that his errand had failed then the rancher harnessed a fresh team and proceeded to a sloo where his scandinavian hired man was cutting prairie hay an hour or two later muriel went out on the prairie and walked toward a poplar bluff in the shadow of which she gathered ripe red saskatoons and then sat down to look about  the dazzling blue of the sky was broken by rounded masses of silveredged clouds that drove along before a fresh northwest breeze streaked by their speeding shadows the great plain stretched away checkered by ranks of marigolds and tall crimson flowers of the lily kind that swayed as the rippling grasses changed color in the wind a mile or two distant stood the trim wooden homestead with a tall windmill frame near by girt by broad sweeps of darkgreen wheat and oats these were interspersed with stretches of uncovered soil glowing a deep chocolatebrown which muriel knew was the summer fallow resting after a cereal crop beyond the last strip of rich color there spread shining delicately blue a great field of flax and then the dusky green of alfalfa and alsike for the hereford cattle standing kneedeep in a flashing lake the prairie she thought was beautiful in summer its wideness was bracing one was stirred into cheerfulness and bodily vigor by the rush of its fresh winds she felt that she could remain contentedly at the homestead for a long time and then her thoughts centered on its owner  this was perhaps why she rose and strolled on toward the sloo though she would not acknowledge that she actually wished to meet him the man was something of an enigma and therefore roused in her an interest which was stronger because of some of the things she had heard to his discredit following the rows of wheelmarks she brushed through the wild barley whose spiky heads whipped her dress passed a chain of glistening ponds a bluff wrapped in blue shadow and finally descended a long slope to the basin at its foot where the melting snow had run in spring now it had dried and was covered with tall grass which held many flowers and fragrant wild peppermint  a team of horses and a tinkling mower moved through its midst and at one edge prescott was loading the grass into a wagon engrossed as he was in his task he did not notice her and she stood a while watching him he wore no jacket the thin yellow shirt flung open at the neck and tightly belted at the waist and the brown duck trousers showed the lithe grace of his athletic figure his poise and swing were admirable and he was working with determined energy his face and uncovered arms the warm color of the soil  muriel drew a little closer and he stopped on seeing her his brown skin was singularly clean his eyes were clear and steady though they often gave a humorous twinkle if this man had ever been a rake his reformation must have been drastic and complete because although she had a very limited acquaintance with people of that sort it was reasonable to conclude that they must bear some sign of indulgence or sensuality the rancher had no stamp of either  he showed his pleasure at her appearance  you have had quite a walk he said if you will wait while i put up the load ill take you back  muriel sat down and watched him fling the grass in heavy forkfuls on to the growing pile until at last he clambered up upon the frame supporting it and pulling some out and ramming the rest back proceeded to excavate a hollow  what are you doing she asked  making a nest for you he told her with a laugh now if youll get up  while she mounted by the wheel he stood on the edge of the wagon leaning down toward her there did not seem to be much foothold the grass looked slippery and the hollow he had made was beyond her reach but she seized the hand he held out and he swung her up for a moment his fingers pressed tightly upon her waist and then she was safe in the hollow smiling at him as he found a precarious seat on the rack  you couldnt see how you were going to get up but you didnt hesitate he said with a soft laugh when he had started his team  no she smiled back at him somehow you inspire one with confidence i didnt think you would let me fall  curious isnt it  she reclined in the recess among the grass which yielded to her limbs in a way that gave her a sense of voluptuous ease her pose although scarcely a conventional one showed to advantage the fine contour of her form and the lilactinted dress that flowed in classic lines about her made a patch of cool restful color on the warm ocher of her surroundings it was easy to read the mans admiration in his glance and she became suddenly filled with mischievous daring  cyril she said you are either an excellent actor or else  i have been maligned is that what you meant  i think i did mean something of the kind  then im a very poor actor that should settle the question  ive wondered how you became so very canadian she said thoughtfully  whats the matter with the canadians  nothing i havent met very many yet but on the whole im favorably impressed by them theyre direct blunt perhaps less complex than we are  no trimmings he suggested they dont muss up good material so that it can hardly be recognized you can tell what a man is when you see him or hear him talk  i dont know muriel argued ive an idea that it might be difficult even in canada  he let this pass  what do you think of the country he asked  she glanced round it was late in the afternoon and somewhat cooler than it had been half the plain lay in shadow but the light was curiously sharp a clump of ragged jackpines stood on a sandhill miles away and a lake twinkled in the remote distance the powerful clydesdale horses plodded through short crackling scrub a fine scent of wild peppermint floated about  oh she responded its delightful and everybodys so energetic you move with a spring and verve and i dont hear any grumbling though there seems to be so much to do  and to bear now and then crops wiped outive lost two of them the work never slackens except in winter when you sit shivering beside the stove if youre not hauling in building logs or cordwood through the arctic frost at night its deadly silent unless theres a blizzard howling the plains are very lonely when the snow lies deep dont you think youre better off in england taking it all round  he laid respectful fingers on the hem of her skirt touching the fine material as if appraising its worth  our wheatgrowers wives and daughters are lucky if theyve a couple of moderately smart dresses but i suppose you have several trunks full of things like this that and the kind of life it implies must count for something  i believe i have said muriel with candor answering his steady inquiring glance still ive felt that we drift along from amusement to amusement in a purposeless way doing nothing thats worth while there might come a time when one would grow very tired of it  it must come and bring trouble then here one goes on from task to task each one bigger and more venturesome than the last acre added to acre a gasoline tractor to the horseplow another quartersection broken mind and body taxed all day and often half the night one cant sit down and mope  this was she thought a curious speech for a man who had been described as careless extravagant and dissolute but he was getting too serious and she laughed  you were energetic enough in england if reports are true ive often thought of your rightofway adventure it must have been very dramatic when you appeared at the garden party covered with fresh tar  sounds like that doesnt it he cautiously agreed how do they tell the tale  something like thisyou were at the hall with geoffrey when the townspeople were clamoring about sir gilberts closing the path through the wood and for some reason you assisted them in attacking the barricade it had been well tarred as a defensive measure hadnt it then you returned triumphant black from head to foot when you thought the guests had gone and plunged into the middle of the last of themmaud always laughs when she talks about it sir gilbert was somewhere out of sight when you related the rabbles brilliant victory but he dashed out red in face when he understood and never stopped until he jumped into his motor i dont think geoffreys wife has forgiven you  prescott smiled  well he said i must have grown very staid since then  muriel changed the subject but they talked with much goodhumor until they reached the homestead where the man alighted and held out his arms to her she hesitated a moment and then was seized by him and swung gently to the ground but she left him with a trace of heightened color in her face and went quietly into the house     chapter iv  muriel feels regret   it was pleasantly cool in the shadow of jernynghams wooden barn where prescott sat talking to its owner outside the strip of shade the sun fell hot upon the parched grass and the tall wheat that ran close up to the homestead swayed in waves of changing color before the rush of breeze the whitened weatherworn boards of the house which faced the men seemed steeped in glowing light and sounds of confused activity issued from the doorway that was guarded by mosquitonetting a clatter of domestic utensils indicated that ellice was baking and she made more noise than she usually did when she was out of temper jernyngham listened with faint amusement as he filled his pipe  sorry i cant ask you in jack he said the kitchen is a pretty large one but when ellice starts breadmaking there isnt a spot one can sit down in of course weve another livingroomi furnished it rather nicelybut for some reason we seldom use it  the mosquito door swung back with a crash and ellice appeared in the entrance with a hot angry face and hands smeared with dough her hair hanging partly loose in disorder about her neck her skirt ungracefully kilted up  aint you goin to bring that water have i got to wait another hour she cried ignoring prescott  jernyngham rose and moved away returning he disappeared into the kitchen with a dripping pail and ellices voice was raised in harsh upbraiding then the man came out looking a trifle weary though he sat down by prescott with a smile  these things should be a warning jack he said still one has to make allowances this hot weathers trying and ellice got a letter that disturbed her by the last mail i didnt hear what was in it but i suspect it was a bill  prescott nodded because he did not know what to say mrs jernyngham had he gathered been unusually fractious for the last week or two and cyril was invariably forbearing indeed prescott sometimes wondered at his patience for he imagined that his comrade had outgrown what love he had borne her the man had his virtues he was rash but he seldom failed to face the consequences with whimsical goodhumor  your friends are going tomorrow prescott told him they understand that you will write home and explain your reasons for remaining  i suppose ill have to do so though it will be difficult you see to give the reasons that count most would be cruel if its any comfort to my folks to think favorably of me id rather let them ive made a horrible mess of things but thats no reason why others should suffer  prescott glanced round at the dilapidated house the untidy stable the door of which was falling to pieces and the wagon standing with a broken wheel there was no doubt that jernyngham was right in one respect  jack cyril resumed your manner gives me the impression that youll be sorry to lose your visitors  i shall be sorry i pressed them to stay and i think theyd have done so only that mrs colston was against it  ah that strikes me as significant you see i can make a good guess at her motives ive suffered from that kind of thing she evidently considers you dangerous dont you feel flattered  mrs colston has no cause for uneasiness i could wish she had  then im glad my friends are going it will save you trouble jack a match between miss hurst and you is out of the question  ive felt that so far as my merits go which is the best way i can put it said prescott gravely you speak as if there were stronger reasons  there are im a little surprised you dont see them your meritsi suppose you mean your character and appearanceshould go a long way well admit that youre a man who might have some attraction for even such a girl as miss hurst seems to be if she didnt pause to think unfortunately for you however its her duty to her relatives to make a brilliant match and ive no doubt she recognizes it girls of her stationyou had better face the truth jacknever marry beneath them  but a man may  a fair shot laughed jernyngham i cant resent it but the man generally suffers and the price is a heavier one when the girl has to pay theres a penalty for breaking caste  you seem to tolerate worse things in the old country  not often after allyou hear of the flagrant offenders and though i dare say there are others who are not found out the bulk against whom theres no reproach excite no attention but well let that go i want you to understand youre right jack its your position thats all wrong girls of the kind were considering are brought up in luxury taught every accomplishment thats economically useless led to believe that every comfort they need will somehow be supplied theyre charming in their proper environment but its a cruelty to take them out of it theyd be helpless in this grim country where you must work for all you want and do without many things even then can you imagine miss hurst standing over a hot stove all day and spending her evenings mending your wornout shirts  prescott looked up his face set hard  you have said enough  there was silence after this until a big man dressed in old brown overalls stopped his horse nearby  ive fixed up with farrer to send over his gasoline tractor to do the fall breaking he said saw the telephone construction people yesterday and told them id let them have two teams to haul in their poles its going to pay us better than keeping them for plowing  quite right wandle replied jernyngham and the fellow nodded to prescott and rode away  he lived on the next halfsection and assisted jernyngham in the management of his ranch besides sharing the cost of labor implements and horses with him though prescott had cause for believing that the arrangement was not to his friends benefit  youd be better off if you didnt work with that man he said  its possible jernyngham agreed i know he robs me but he saves me bother besides if we decided to separate and came to a settlement i dare say he would claim that i was in his debt and he might be right im no good at business ranching i dont mind but i could never learn how to buy and sell  its a very useful ability prescott rejoined with some dryness but as i want to be home for supper i must get on  he unhitched his horse and mounted and jernyngham walked with him to the gate in the wire fence  youll remember what i told you jack he said meaningly  yes prescott answered with a stern face i suppose i ought to thank you im not likely to forget  he rode home and arriving in time for supper took his place at the table with mixed feelings foremost among which was keen regret except for the company of his scandinavian hired man and the latters hardfeatured wife he had lived alone in spartan simplicity thinking of nothing but his farm and his guests arrival had revealed to him the narrowness of his life they had brought him new desires and thoughts besides recalling ideas he had long forgotten and among other things had made the evening meal a pleasant function to be looked forward to instead of an opportunity for hurriedly consuming needed food  the spotless cloth and the flowers on the table were novelties but they pleased his eye colston with his cheerful wellbred air and fastidiousness in dress talked interestingly mrs colston with her gracious dignity and muriel who was wholly alluring seemed to fill the room with charm it was perhaps all the more enjoyable because prescott had been accustomed to pleasant society in montreal before he abandoned it with other amenities and went out to a life of stern toil and frugality in the grim northwest  he said little though it was the last time they would gather tranquilly round his boardthey were to leave for the railroad early on the morrow a heavy melancholy oppressed him though bright sunlight streamed into the room and an invigorating breeze swept in through the open window outside which tall wheat and blue flax rolled away he could not force himself to talk though he laughed at colstons anecdotes and it was a relief when the meal was over half an hour later he overtook muriel strolling along the edge of the wheat  have you recovered yet she asked you looked very downcast  thats how i feel it strikes me as perfectly natural ill be alone tomorrow  but you were alone before we came  very true i didnt seem to mind it then i was happy thinking how i could put in a bigger crop or raise another bunch of stock my mind was fixed on the plow but you have lifted me out of the furrow i guess its weak but somehow i hate the thought of going back to the clods  remembering jernynghams remarks it struck him that this was not the line he should have taken and for a moment or two muriel turned her head then she looked at him smiling  i shall be very sorry to leave and i believe florence and harry feel the same  but you are going to british columbia and down the pacific coast you will revel in new experiences and interesting sights  i suppose so she answered rather listlessly we shall get a glimpse of a new country but that will be all on the steamers well meet much the kind of people we are accustomed to and no doubt well stay at hotels built especially for luxurious tourists you see we take our usual environment along with us  but isnt that what you like  i dont know perhaps it ought to be muriel paused and looked up at him with candid eyes you hinted that we had given you a new and wider outlookor brought back the one you used to have which is what you must have meant you dont seem to realize that you have done much the same thing to me  im not sure i understand  it shouldnt be difficult you know the kind of people i have hitherto met and how we spend our time in a round of amusements that lead to nothing with all that could jar on one carefully kept away this is the first time ive come into touch with strenuous normal life  and it doesnt seem to have frightened you  no she said with a smile im not in the least afraidwhy should i be i must have more courage than you think but does one need a great deal of it to live here  he looked at her in grave admiration there was a hint of pride in her pose and her eyes were calm  i believe if ever a time of stress came you wouldnt shrink but this is a pretty hard and lonely country especially in winter  muriel changed the subject  for all that i feel you are right in staying cyril have you written to your people  prescott felt embarrassed and guilty as he generally did when in confidential moments she called him by jernynghams name somehow he could not imagine her saying jack  no he rejoined slowly of course they must be written to  muriel did not answer the turn their conversation had taken had filled her with a vague unrest as she looked back at the life she had led three or four years ago it had seemed filled with glamour and excitement and she had entered on its pleasures with eager zest but of late she had begun to find them wearisome they no longer satisfied her if this were the result of a few years experience what would she feel when she had grown jaded with time and everything was stale then her glimpse of the simple healthful western life had come as a revelation it was real a bracing struggle in which no effort was wasted but produced tangible results broad stretches of splendid wheat sweeps of azure flax  but this was not all she felt drawn to her brownfaced companion who had obviously redeemed whatever errors he had been guilty of in the past she had known him for only about a fortnight but she had seen his admiration for her with a satisfaction that was slightly tempered by misgivings she could not tell exactly what she expected from him but she had at least looked for some expression of a wish that their acquaintance should not end abruptly on the morrow she did not think she would have resented a carefully modified display of the gallantry cyril jernyngham must be capable of if reports were true considering what his past was supposed to have been the grave man who watched her with troubled eyes was hard to understand  cyril she asked has harry given you our address at glacier and banff  he supposed that this implied permission to write to her but he could not do so as jack prescott and he already bitterly regretted that he had allowed her to think of him as jernyngham  yes he said with a carelessness which cost him an effort but im afraid im not a good correspondent im too busy for one thing  too busy she mocked with a stronger color in her face cant you spare half an hour from your plowing to write to your friends  well he answered with forced coolness its difficult except of course in the winter and youll be back in england then with so many festivities on hand that you wont be anxious to hear about canada  she looked at him for a moment puzzled and a little angry and he guessed her thoughts he was behaving like a boor but it was better that she should think him one  how very unenglish you have become she said  you mean im very canadian anyway i try to be sensibleive done some wretchedly foolish things and ive got to pay for them of course this visits only an episode to you something thats soon over and forgotten  there was trouble in his voice though he strove to speak with indifference and after a swift glance at him she answered coldly  i suppose it is one impression rubs out another and no doubt we shall see something novel and interesting farther on however we wont stay in canada very long and we shall see your father and sister as soon as we get home its curious that you have scarcely mentioned them  oh well he evaded awkwardly harry has told me a good deal  he turned his head dreading her curious eyes his last evening in her company was proving more trying than he had expected though usually tolerant and goodhumored the strain made him bitter tomorrow he must put this girl out of his mind after all it was to cyril jernyngham rake and wastrel but a man of her own station that she had been gracious and charming had she known he was jack prescott she would no doubt have treated him very differently but in this supposition he did her wrong  puzzled by his lack of responsiveness and with wounded pride she stopped and looked out toward the northwest across the prairie steeped in strong coloring it seemed to run back into immeasurable distance though a wonderful blaze of crimson marked its rim the faint cool air that flowed across it was charged with a curious exhilarating quality there was a subtle fragrance of herbs in the grass  its getting late she said i must go in this is the last sunset i shall watch on the prairie and in several ways im sorry you have made our stay here very pleasant     chapter v  the mystery of the muskeg   colston and his party had been gone a fortnight when prescott called at the jernyngham homestead one afternoon and found its owner sitting moodily in the kitchen which presented a chaotic appearance unwashed plates and dishes were scattered about the woodbox was overturned and poplar billets strewed the floor there was no fire in the rusty stove and the fragments of a heavy crock lay against the wall the strong sunlight that streamed in emphasized the disorder of the room  i was passing and thought id come in prescott explained wheres mrs jernyngham the look of the place gives one the idea that shes not at home  its never remarkably tidy jernyngham broke into a rueful smile i believe she started for the settlement when i was at work in the summer fallow this morning the fact that the horse and buggy are missing points to it  but dont you know whether she has gone or not  i dont said jernyngham she didnt acquaint me with her intentions as i see she has taken some things along it looks as if she meant to visit mrs harvey at the store theyre friends now and then  his manner was suggestive though he looked more resigned than disturbed and prescott glancing at the shattered crock ventured a question which he feared was not quite judicious  how did you break that thing  it ought to be a warning i didnt break it it was meant to break on me ellice flung it at my head a day or two ago and fortunately missed though as a rule shes a pretty good shot i suppose its significant that neither of us troubled to pick up the pieces  prescott looked sympathetic and hesitated with his halffilled pipe in his hand  shall i go cyril i want to make sebastian before its dark  sit still jernyngham told him im in an expansive mood and ive a notion that im not far off a crisis in my affairs ellice has been fractious lately i seem to have been getting on her nerves which perhaps is not surprising  prescott made no comment and after sitting silent a few moments jernyngham resumed  i was rather rash when i ventured to remonstrate about a bill ellice pointed out with justice that so long as i slouched round and let wandle rob me id no right to grumble at her for buying a few things most unwisely i maintained my point andhe indicated the broken crock and littered tableyou see the consequences  wandle is a bit of a rogue said prescott choosing the safest topic ive told you so  you have for all that hes useful and i dont mind being robbed in moderation im a man whos accustomed to losing things his halfmocking tone grew serious i wrote to my people as soon as colston left telling them id determined to remain in canada but if it wasnt for ellice i think id quit farming  prescott smoked in silence for a while jernyngham had made a costly sacrifice chiefly on the womans account and prescott felt sorry for him  perhaps id better get on he said after a while  for a few moments jernyngham looked irresolute and then he got up  ill come with you to sebastian i think id have gone earlier only ellice had the horse and rig and wandles using the wagon team its no doubt my duty to sue for peace  they set out shortly afterward and reaching sebastian late in the evening drove to the liverystable where jernyngham called the man who took prescotts team  i suppose you have my horse he asked  sure said the fellow looking at him curiously mrs jernyngham said wed better keep him until you came in she left a note for you with the boss hes in the hotel  jernyngham crossed the street followed by his companion and prescott noticed that the loungers in the bar seemed interested when they came in two of them put down their glasses and turned to fix their eyes on jernyngham a third paused in the act of lighting his pipe and dropped the match then the owner of the liverystable looked up in a hesitating manner as jernyngham approached him  i believe you have a message for me jernyngham said abruptly  thats so the man rejoined gravely ill give it to you outside  they left the bar and when they stood under the veranda jernyngham tore open the envelope handed him a moment later he firmly crumpled up the note it had held  when did she leave he asked in a harsh voice  the liveryman regarded him sympathetically  by the afternoon eastbound im mighty sorry cyrilguess you know it isnt a secret in the town  jernynghams face grew darkly flushed  then you can tell me whom she went with  the drummer who was selling the separators bought tickets through to st paul told perkins he wasnt coming back here nothing doing on this round  the man tactfully moved away and jernyngham turned to prescott speaking rather hoarsely  shes gonethats the end of it  he dropped into one of the chairs scattered about and a few moments later broke into a bitter laugh  it would have been more flattering if she had chosen you or wandle instead of that blasted weedy drummer still there the thing is and it has to be faced then he surprised his companion for his voice and expression became suddenly normal go in and get me a cigar  he lighted it carefully when it was brought to him and leaned back in his chair  jack he said ive got to hold myself in handif i start off on the jag now it will be a dangerous one have you noticed that ive been practising strict abstinence since colston left  prescott not knowing how to regard his ironic calmness said nothing and jernyngham continued  its a bitter pill i was very fond of her once and theres not much consolation in reflecting that shell probably scare the fellow out of his wits the first time she breaks out in one of her rages then his voice grew regretful ellices far from perfect but shes much too good for him  remembering that it was on the womans account his friend had remained on the prairie prescott made a venture  since she has gone its a pity she didnt go a few weeks earlier  that doesnt count declared jernyngham she has cause to blame me as much for marrying herone must try to be just i thought of her when i determined to stay but my own weaknesses played as big a part in deciding me  he sat silent a while and then indicated his surroundings with a contemptuous sweep of his handthe dirty sidewalk strewn with cigar ends and banana peelings the straggling houses with their cracked board walls and ugly square fronts the rutted street down which drifted clouds of dust  jack he said im very sick of all this and i cant face the lonely homestead now ellices gone i must have a change and something to brace me something that has a keener bite than drink think ill take a haulage job on the new railroad where there ought to be rough and risky work and ill leave this place tonight come across with me to morants and ill see what i can borrow on the land  the sudden unreasoning decision was characteristic of him but prescott expostulated  you cant clear out in this eccentric fashion there are a number of things to be settled first  i think i can jernyngham retorted dryly its certain that i cant stay here  he took his companion with him to call on a landagent and mortgagebroker and when they left the office jernyngham had a bulky roll of bills in his pocket  jack he requested youll run my place and pay morant off after harvest if wandle gets his hands on it therell be very little left when i come back you may have trouble with him but you must hold out charge me with all expenses and pay as much of the surplus as you think im entitled to into my bank when you have sold the crop now if youll come into the hotel ill give you a written authority and get perkins to witness it  prescott demurred at first but eventually yielded because he believed his friends interest would need looking after in his absence after some discussion they agreed on a workable scheme which was put down in writing and witnessed by the hotelkeeper then jernyngham borrowed a saddle and sent for his horse  ill pull out for the railroad now its cooler riding at night and theres a good moon he said as ill pass close to your place you may as well drive so far with me  they set off prescott seated on the front of his jolting wagon jernyngham riding as near it as the roughness of the trail permitted with a blanket and a package of provisions strapped to his saddle he was wearing a hat of extrathick felt and uncommon shape which had been given him by a man who had broken his journey for the purpose of seeing the country when returning from hong kong by the canadian pacific route soon after they left sebastian a young trooper of the northwest police dressed in khaki uniform came trotting up in the moonlight and joined them  where are you off to jernyngham he asked glancing at the rolled up blanket looks as if you meant to camp on the trail  ill have to most likely said jernyngham im leaving the farm to prescott for a while and heading for nelsons butte on the new road  what are you going to do there  thought id pick up a horse or two at one of the ranches ill pass and apply for a teaming job contractor was asking for haulage tenders hes having trouble among the sandhills and muskegs  then youll be taking a wad of money along  jernyngham assented and the trooper looked thoughtful  now he cautioned theres a pretty tough crowd at nelson and though we stopped any licenses being issued weve had trouble over the runningin of liquor then you have a long ride before you through a thinlysettled country you want to be careful about that money  the settlers are to be trusted  thats so but we have reason to believe the rustlers are at work in the district seem to have been going into the liquor business and ive heard of horses missing now that the boys have stopped their branding other peoples calves in alberta and corralled their leaders it looks as if the fellows were beginning the game in this part of the country  thanks said jernyngham i may as well take precautions how would you recommend my carrying the money  the trooper made one or two ingenious suggestions as to the safest way of secreting the bills and jernyngham dismounting carried them out soon afterward the trooper struck off across the plain and the others riding on met a farmer who spoke to them as he passed at length prescott pulled up his team at the spot where his companion must leave the trail  ill do what i can with the land cyril and keep an account he said you might write and let me know how you are getting on  they shook hands and jernyngham trotted away while prescott sat watching him for a minute or two man and horse were sharply outlined against the moonlit grass jernyngham looked very lonely as he rode out into the wilderness he could hardly have been happy prescott thought in his untidy and comfortless house at the farm but after all it had been a home and now he was rudely flung adrift it was true that the man was largely responsible for the troubles that had fallen upon him but this was no reason for refusing him pity and cyril had his strong points he had staunchly declined to profit by a felicitous change of fortune out of consideration for the relatives who had once disowned and the woman who had deserted him jernyngham had been a careless fool and prescott suspected that he was not likely to alter much in this respect but he did not expect others to pay for his recklessness when the reckoning came then prescott started his team  two days later he was busy in front of his homestead putting together a new binder which had just arrived from the settlement it was the latest type of harvesting implement and designed to cut an unusually broad swath while he was engaged the trooper he had met when accompanying jernyngham rode up with a corporal following he stopped his horse and glanced at the binder with admiration  shes a daisy jack i guess she cost a pile he said where did you get the money to buy a machine of that kind  it wasnt easy to raise it prescott replied but ill save something in laborharvest wages are highand ive long wanted this binder when trant came round from the implement store yesterday morning i thought id risk the deal will you wait for dinner  no thanks the corporal broke in were making a patrol north just called to look at your guards several big grass fires have been reported in the last few days  prescott pointed to the rows of plowed furrows which cut off his holding from the prairie the strip of brown clods which was two or three yards in width seemed an adequate defense and after a glance at it the corporal nodded his satisfaction  good enough he said well take the trail  he trotted away with his companion and it was evening when they rode along the edge of a ravine which pierced a high tract of rolling country the crest of the slope they followed commanded a vast circle of grass that was changing in the foreground from green to ocher and silvery white farther back it ran on toward the sunset a sweep of blue and neutral gray flecked with dusky lines of bluffs interspersed with gleaming strips of water but nowhere in the wide landscape was there a sign of human habitation small birches and poplars with an undergrowth of nut bushes clothed the sides of the ravine but some distance ahead it broadened out and the stream that flowed through it turned the hollow into a muskeg there harsh grass and reeds grew three or four feet high hiding the stretch of mire  the police were young men with deeply bronzed faces dressed in smart khaki uniform with broad stetson hats of the same color  whats that exclaimed corporal curtis pointing to an indistinct object lying among a patch of scrub some distance off  looks like a hat replied private stanton some settler prospecting for a homestead location must have lost it  you jump at things said the corporal howd the man lose it guess it wouldnt drop off without his knowing it and with the sun weve been having hed want it pretty bad he wouldnt throw it away when he knew he couldnt get another well go along and see  they dismounted a minute or two later and made a startling discovery the hat was a good one but in one place the soft gray felt had been crushed and partly cut as though by a heavy blow on turning it over they saw that the inside was stained a dull red  blood said curtis significantly and swept a searching glance about more of it he added see hereon the brush  moving forward they found a succession of crimson spots and splashes on the leaves of the willow scrub and withering grass  picket the horses stanton weve got to look into this the corporal said  id better lead them back a piece responded his companion we dont want to muss up things by making fresh tracks  when he had done so they set about the examination systematically they were men who lived for the most part in the open and made long journeys through the wilds sleeping where they could find shelter in ravine or bluff such things as a broken twig a bruised tuft of grass or a mark in loose soil had a meaning to them and here they had plentiful material to work upon counting footprints and hoofmarks measuring distances they constructed bit by bit the drama that had taken place but half an hour had passed before they sat down to talk it over and took out their pipes the afterglow shone about them their hands and thoughtful faces showed the same warm color as the brown grass in the ruddy light in the hat lay a fivedollar bill and a coat button  there were two men here curtis remarked both were mounted and came up the trail from the settlement but it looks as if the first one had picketed his horse and started to make camp when the other joined him  thats so private stanton agreed  then there was trouble but the men didnt clinch one fellow hit the other with something heavy enough to drop him in his tracks then got into the saddle and rode off leading the other horse  the evidence on which he arrived at this conclusion was slender but stanton signified assent  well he said wheres the hurt man  ive a notion hes in yonder muskeg the other fellow could have packed him there on the led horsethe blood spots point to itthough he might have hid him farther on in a bluff its getting too dark to search now well try tomorrow but i guess we know who he is  sure said stanton ill swear to the hat chaffed jernyngham about it one day and he put it in my hands and said there wasnt another of the kind in the country a man from hong kong gave it to him  curtis took up the bill  five dollars merchants bank and quite clean not been issued long well find out if theyve a branch at regina or saskatoon and trace up the fellow they paid it to the button doesnt countquite a common pattern now if youll fill the kettle at the creek ill start a fire well camp near the birch scrub yonder     chapter vi  a deal in land   on the morning after the corporals discovery gustave wandle was leading his team to a drinking pool on the creek that crossed his farm he was a big reserved fairhaired man with a fleshy face that was redeemed from heaviness by his eyes which were restless and keen though supposed to be an austrian little was known about him or his antecedents except that he owned the next halfsection of land to jernynghams and farmed it successfully it was however believed that he was of an unusually grasping nature and his neighbors took precautions when they made a deal with him he had reached the shadow of a poplar bluff when he heard hurried footsteps and a man with a hot face came into sight  im going across your place to save time i want my horse he explained hastily curtis the policeman has ridden in to the settlement and told me to go up and search a muskeg near the north trail with stanton somebodys killed jernyngham and hidden him there  so exclaimed wandle jernyngham murdered you tell me that  sure thing the other replied the police have figured out how it all happened and im going to look for the body while curtis reports to his bosses a blamed pity i liked jernyngham well i must get to the muskeg soon as i can  he ran on and wandle led his horses to the pool and stood thinking hard while they drank he was well versed in jernynghams affairs and knew that he had once bought a cheap quartersection of land in an arid belt some distance off a railroad had since entered the district irrigation work had been begun and the holding must have risen in value now it seemed jernyngham was dead which was unfortunate because wandle had found their joint operations profitable and it was very probable that ellice and himself were the only persons who knew about the land wandle mounted one of the horses and set out for jernynghams homestead at its fastest pace  on reaching it he soon found an iron cashbox in a cupboard and succeeded in forcing it with a screwdriver it contained a few papers among which were one or two relating to the purchase of the quartersection and wandle put these in his pocket the others he threw into the cupboardjernynghams carelessness was well knownand then hastily studied a railroad timetable by starting promptly he could catch a train at the station next after sebastian which he thought would be wiser and reach a new wooden town of some importance in the evening having ascertained this he hurried out and rode home taking the cashbox with him on arriving he smashed it flat with an ax and flung it into his stove in which a fire was burning then he made a hasty meal changed his clothes and saddling a horse rode hard across the prairie there was he realized some risk in what he meant to do but it was not a very serious one and he was thankful that the sale of land is attended by few formalities in western canada  when he reached his destination business premises were closed for the night but after making inquiries he found a land agent who was recommended as respectable and trustworthy at a smart hotel wandle led him to the far end of the lobby where they would not be disturbed and sitting down at a table took out the papers  whats that quartersection worth he asked  the agent told him and wandle lighted his pipe and affected to consider he thought jernyngham had not suspected its value  dont you think you could get another three dollars an acre he suggested  its possible if you will leave the sale in my hands but i may have to wait for a suitable opportunity theres a good demand for land in the district now that theyre getting on with the irrigation scheme but to insist on the top price will mean delay  could you sell it for me promptly at the figure you mentioned  why yes said the agent ive a number of inquiries for farming land on my books i shouldnt wonder if i fixed the thing up in a week  i cant wait a week theres a pretty good haulage contract i could get but it will take some financing which is what brought me along because i ought to see about it in the next few days now ill tell you what ill doill sell you that land tonight at the lower figure  the agent pondered  no sir he said irresolutely id only make a few dollars an acre on the deal and i can get ten per cent on my money right in this hotel  youd have to wait a year for it wouldnt you what price will give you ten per cent profit on this quartersection you want to remember that you may get it in a few weeks and youd have firstclass security  after making a rough calculation in his notebook the agent looked up  as a rule i prefer to buy for other people but i cant go back on what i said about land being in strong demand and ill make you a bid this is the most i can do  wandle after trying to raise the price made a sign of acquiescence  well let it go at that ill get things fixed up as soon as the landoffice is open in the morning  he left the hotel satisfied on the whole though he had sacrificed a dollar or two an acre and there was an element of danger in what he had done the sale of the land must be registered and the date would be two or three days after the one on which jernyngham was killed the latters homestead was however a long distance off there was only one small weekly newspaper published in the district and it was very probable that the agent would not hear of the affair until some time had elapsed and then might not attach any importance to the fact that the victims name was that of his customer even if he did so the small discrepancy in the dates would no doubt escape his attention wandle did not think he had much cause for uneasiness  reaching home the next day he raked out his stove and found the cashbox it had not fallen to pieces as he had expected and he doubled it up again with the ax before he flung it into the ash pail then he lighted the stove and set about getting supper for it was late in the evening after finishing the meal he threw some fragments of potatoes and a rind of pork into the pail and took it up to carry it to the refuse heap but stopped with a start when he left the house it was getting dark but two shadowy figures were riding up the trail and by the way they sat their horses he recognized them as police troopers putting down the pail he waited until they dismounted nearby  youre too late for supper curtis he said coolly ive just cleaned it up  the corporal glanced at the pail and in the dim light noticed only the domestic refuse  ive had some he answered i want a few minutes talk then he motioned to his companion hitch the horses stanton and come in when youre ready  they entered the house followed presently by the trooper and wandle lighted his pipe he felt more at ease with it in his hand and he suspected that he would need all his collectedness  well he said whats the trouble  i suppose you know that jernynghams missing  i heard that he was killed  looks like it said curtis you know the muskeg where the creek spreads out about fourteen miles north  i dont never been up so far  curtis noticed the prompt disclaimer  anyway jernyngham rode there and was knocked out with something heavy that must have left him stunned if it didnt make an end of him he didnt ride away after it though his horse went on the point is that it was led  how do you know that wandle asked  its my business to know these things think we cant tell the difference between the tracks of a led horse and a ridden one the only times two horses trot close together at an even distance is when ones rider has both bridles or when theyre yoked to a wagon pole however ive come to ask if you can throw any light on the matter you and jernyngham were partners in a way werent you  thats so now and then we bought implements and horses or hired a tractor plow between us as a matter of fact jernyngham owed me about five hundred dollars anyhow im as puzzled about the thing as you must be  then you think were puzzled curtis said in a significant tone  wandle laughed  it struck me as likely you know theres not a rancher in the district who would hurt the man he was easy to get on with  did you know that he borrowed money on his holding and took it with him the night he disappeared  i didnt said wandle starting im not pleased to hear it now ive a claim on the place and there are some pretty big storekeepers bills to come in  curtis asked a few more questions before he took his leave he passed near the ash pail as he went out and stanton touched it with his foot but they had mounted and reached the trail before either of them spoke  well said curtis  stanton smiled  nothing much to be learned from him the fellows about as sly and hard to get at as a coyote  a sure thing curtis agreed well keep an eye on him ive a suspicion he knows something  then they trotted away in the moonlight for it was a long ride to their camp beside the muskeg which with the assistance of several men they were engaged in searching  on the next afternoon prescott was at work in the summer fallow sitting in the iron saddle of a gangplow which four powerful horses hauled through the crackling stubble it was fiercely hot and he was lightly clad in thin yellow shirt and overalls a cloud of dust rose about him from the parched soil and the broad expanse of wheat which the fallow divided glowed with varied colors as it rippled before the rush of breeze the strong greens changing to a silvery luster as the lush blades bent and caught the light farther on there were faint streaks of yellow among the oats the great stretch of grass was white and delicate gray the rows of clods behind the plow rich chocolatebrown  prescott however paid little attention to his surroundings he was perhaps the only man in the district who had known jernyngham intimately he felt troubled about his disappearance and he had had a disturbing interview with wandle during the morning the austrian had contested his right to manage the farm declaring that jernyngham owed him money and had made certain plans for the joint working of their land which must be carried out this did not so much matter in a sense if one could take jernynghams death for granted but prescott could not do so and had moreover no intention of letting his property fall into the hands of a cunning grasping fellow who he was fully persuaded had no real right to it if jernyngham did not turn up prescott meant to discharge all his debts after harvest and as the crop promised well to send the balance to england as a proof that his friend had not been a failure in canada this might be some comfort to jernynghams people  he was considering the matter when he heard the stubble crackle behind him and looking around saw curtis riding up stopping his team he waited until the corporal drew bridle  have you found him yet he asked  we have not said curtis its a big muskeg and quite deep you know the place  oh yes i know it pretty well  curtis looked at him sharply but prescott seemed to be musing  its a sad thing when you think of it he said after a few moments from the little he told me the man had hard luck all through and that mrs jernyngham should leave him just after hed sacrificed his future for her must have been a knockout blow yet ive an idea that instead of crushing it braced him it pulled him up he showed signs of turning into a different man  you knew him better than i did curtis replied i heard at the hotel hed asked you to look after his place given you a share in the crop  he did id some words with wandle about the matter this morning jernyngham warned me he might pretend he had a claim however thats not to the purpose somehow i feel convinced hell turn up again what motive could any one have for killing him the only man we might have suspectedthe fellow who went off with ellicemust have been on the train bound for st paul  he was we wired the conductor but the things quite simplethe motive was robbery you remember that wad of bills the corporal paused before he added where did you last see jernyngham  at the trailforks near my place he rode right on i took the turning  did you see your man svendsen or his wife when you got home  i didnt they live at the back of the house i put up the horses slipped in quietly and went to bed  then you cant fix the time you got back  prescott moved sharply lifting his head while an angry color suffused his face  curtis you cant thinkjernyngham was my best friend then he laughed indignantly you always struck me as a sensible man  the corporal regarded him with scrutinizing eyes his manner stamped with official austerity  im forming no opinionsyet its my duty to find out all i can about the matter and report if theres anything youre open to tell me ill make a note of it  prescotts face grew stern and his glance very steady  i can add nothing to what ive said and im busy  curtis rode away but when he was out of the ranchers sight he broke into a dry smile he was an astute young man and knew his business which was merely to investigate and follow the instruction of his chiefs at regina unembroidered facts were what they required in the first instance but later he might be permitted to theorize  when the corporal had gone prescott went on with his plowing but the crackle of the stubble and the thud of the heavy clydesdales hoofs fell unheeded on his ears and it was halfconsciously that he turned his team at the headland he had a good deal to think about and his thoughts were far from pleasant to begin with the memory of muriel hurst had haunted him since she left he recalled her with a regretful longing that seemed to grow steadily stronger instead of diminishing he thought she had left an indelible mark on his life then there was his impersonation of jernyngham which he had rashly agreed to but did not now regret if colston had met cyril on the night of the riot and had gone to his untidy dwelling he would have been forced to send home an adverse report prescott was glad to think he had saved his friend from a farther fall in his english relatives esteem though knowing a little of the mans story he held them largely responsible for his reckless career their censoriousness and suspicion had no doubt driven him into wilder rashness  besides all this the corporals manner rankled in his mind he knew curtis well and had a good opinion of his ability it seemed preposterous that such a man could imagine that he had had any hand in jernynghams death yet the corporals tone had been significant and the facts had an ugly look he had seen jernyngham secrete his money and had afterward ridden on with him unaccompanied by anybody else he could not prove when he returned to his farm and it might be said that he stood to benefit by securing the management of jernynghams property  when he reached the end of the furrows his face was grim but he steadily continued his plowing     chapter vii  the search   prescott dismounted and turned loose his horse shorthobbled near the muskeg about two oclock one hot afternoon he had begun work at four that morning and with harvest drawing near time was precious to him but he was filled with a keen curiosity to see what progress curtis had made in his search he had a strong personal interest in the matter because it seemed that some suspicion might rest on him though he was far from sharing the corporals conviction that jernyngham was dead stopping at the edge of the ravine he looked about taking in the details of the scene  though the prairie had lost its greenness and the flowers had died it stretched away flooded with dazzling light a great expanse of silvery gray flecked with faint lemon and brown in the swampy hollow however the grass grew tall and green among the shining pools and prescott noticed to his astonishment a dozen men working assiduously lower down they had discarded most of their clothing their brown arms were bare and the stiff darkcolored soil they flung up with their shovels cumbered the bank of the ravine which had narrowed in again prescott saw that they were cutting a deeper channel for the creek with the object of draining the swamp  moving farther along the bank he came upon the two policemen who looked very hot and somewhat muddy which as they were usually fastidiously neat was noticeable he felt some hesitation in accosting them as he recalled the corporals attitude when they last met but he was curious  i suppose you have found nothing he said and when curtis made a sign of negation continued how did you get so many of the boys here  putting his hand in his pocket the policeman gave him a printed circular which announced that a reward of one thousand dollars would be paid for the discovery of cyril jernynghams remains  his people in the old country cabled it over he explained  well prescott said thoughtfully i dont believe hes here but he was a friend of mine and im as anxious to have the question answered as you are  private stanton who was sitting in the grass looked up with a rather significant smile indeed there was a certain reserve in the manner of both men which exasperated the rancher  its quite likely youll have to wait curtis rejoined even when weve run the water out it may take a long while to search the mushy stuff it will leave and if were beaten here well have to try the bluffs he looked hard at prescott we dont let up until we find him  tell me where i can get a shovel and ill help the boys  stanton brought him one and for the next two hours he worked savagely standing kneedeep in water in a trench hacking out clods of the gumbo soil which covers much of the prairie and grows the finest wheat when dry it sets like stone when wet it assumes a glutinous stickiness which makes it exceptionally difficult to deal with fierce sunshine poured down on prescotts bent head and shoulders his hands grew sore and mire and water splashed upon him but he was hard and leanly muscular and driven as he was by a keen desire to test the corporals theory he would have toiled on until the next morning had it been needful at length however there was a warning cry from one of the men nearer the swamp  watch out let her go  prescott leaped from the trench there was a roar higher up the ravine and a turgid flood streaked with frothy lines came pouring down the new channel bearing with it small nut bushes and great clumps of matted grass by degrees it subsided and the men gathering about the edge of the muskeg hot and splashed with mire lay down to smoke and wait while the pools that still remained grew smaller they had been working hard since early morning and they did not talk much but prescott sitting a little away from them was conscious of an unpleasant tension it was possible that the search might prove curtis right the corporal stood higher up the bank scanning each clump of grass and reeds with keenly scrutinizing eyes at length however he approached the others  i guess youve made a job boys he told them the soft spots ought to dry out in about a week but we cant wait till then you want to remember theres a thousand dollars for the man who finds him  they glanced at the morass hesitatingly it did not look inviting in places the reeds grew as high as their heads and one could not tell what depths they hid in other spots there were tracks of slimy ooze in which one might sink a long way none of them however was fastidious and they waded out into the mire shouting warnings to one another disappearing now and then among the grass the search was partially rewarded for while prescott and a companion were skirting a clump of reeds they saw part of a soaked garment protruding from the slime for a few moments they stood looking at it irresolutely and then prescott mustering his courage advanced and seized the stained material it came away more readily than he had expected and he turned to his companion conscious of keen relief with a brown overall jacket in his hand a further examination shrinkingly made revealed nothing else and after marking the place they waded to the bank the garment was carefully washed in the creek and the men gathered in a ring round curtis when he inspected it  have any of you seen this thing before he asked holding it up  none of them would identify it thin duck overalls are commonly worn by ranchers and working people in place of heavier clothing during the hot weather then curtis turned to prescott  whats your idea  it isnt jernynghams the rancher said decidedly its too old for one thing looks as if it had been in the water quite a while  hard to tell commented curtis but go on  prescott took the jacket and held it so that the others could see the inside of the collar  no makers tag he continued now cyril always bought the kind they give you a doll with  one of the others laughed and supplied the name of the manufacturer which was attached to every garment  ive seen three or four of those dolls and golliwog things in his house the man added used to guy him about keeping them as he had no kids  we can fix the thing by inquiring at the dry goods store curtis rejoined  cant see whose it was if it wasnt jernynghams another broke in theres no homestead anywhere near the creek and mighty few people come up here  the policeman took from his pocket a wet envelope upon which the blurred writing was still legible  well he said coolly theres no doubt about whose this is he handed it to prescott ever see it in jernynghams possession  yes answered prescott with some hesitation i recognize the address though the english stamp has gone it was lying near when he was talking to me on the night of the trouble in sebastian  he was filled with uneasiness the police would certainly attempt to read the letter which was the one colston had written announcing his arrival if they succeeded they would no doubt wonder why the englishman had not stayed with jernyngham and investigation might lead to a discovery of the part prescott had played  weve begun quite satisfactorily said the corporal and theres nothing more to be done tonight i guess you can quit and have supper boys  in a little while trails of gray smoke floated across the ravine and after a meal with one of his neighbors prescott rode back to his homestead feeling much disturbed for all that and in spite of the letter he did not think jernyngham would be found in the swamp  on the following evening a commissioned officer of the police who had made the journey from headquarters at regina and spent an hour or two examining the scene of the supposititious tragedy sat with curtis in a very hot private room of the hotel at sebastian its raw board walls gave out a resinous smell the opening in the window was filled with mosquitonetting so that little air crept in on the table lay a carefully made diagram a boot and one or two paper patterns representing footprints were on the floor the officers hair was turning gray and he had a quiet brown face with a look of command in it  taking it for granted that your theorys right suspicion seems to fall on the men you mentioned he said whom do you suspect  curtis considered he was reluctant to express a decided opinion in the presence of his superior who was famous for his acumen  so far as we have any evidence i think it points to prescott he responded he saw jernyngham hide his money he went on alone with him and cant prove when he got home then several of the footprints marked on the plan might have been made by him  the officer took up the boot and one of the paper patterns  theres a doubt i suppose he knows you have his boot  the corporals eyes twinkled faintly  i guess hell miss it sometime  its possible but what else have you against him  prescott stands to profit by jernynghams death he has control of the holding until the years up and its a pretty good crop he declares the jacket isnt jernynghams he wont allow the man can be in the muskeg a day or two after jernyngham disappeared he bought one of the new wideswath binders paid the money down in new bills which was what jernyngham had though the implement agent didnt note the numbers  pretty strong points whats your private opinion out with it  the mans tone was commanding and curtis complied  on the whole im inclined to blame the other fellow wandle  against the evidence asked his superior in quiet surprise you of course remember your instructions and know what your duty is  yes sir said curtis still i think he paused and continued diffidently you would have an answer  the other leaned back in his chair with a meditative expression  well let it go at that he said perhaps you had better follow the waiting course you seem to have decided on but if suspicion gathers round prescott it wont be a drawback and you neednt discountenance it for one thing it may divert attention and after all he may be the right man  a look of comprehension shone in the corporals eyes he believed that his superior who never expressed a strong opinion prematurely agreed with him  suppose either of the men lights out he suggested  youll have to guard against it if it happens apply for a warrant and follow him  the officer returned to regina the next day and a week or two during which curtis and his assistants laboriously searched the drying swamp passed uneventfully then one morning prescott sat somewhat moodily in the saddle of his binder which a powerful team hauled along the edge of the wheat the great stretch of grain blazed with color as it swayed with a harsh rustle of warmtinted ears before the breeze but now and then broad cool shadows sped across it as the whiteedged clouds drove by behind him followed two more teams and machines half covered by falling sheets of yellow grain while their whirling wooden arms flashed in the dazzling sunlight as they flung out the sheaves barearmed and very scantily attired men came after them piling the stocks together disturbed as he was prescott felt cheered by the prospect of harvesting a record crop  he had turned a corner and was proceeding along another side of the great oblong when he noticed a wagon approaching carrying two strangers and several large trunks as their dress differed from that usually worn on the prairie he wondered who they were and why they were driving toward his ranch the liveryman who held the reins presently pulled up his team and prescott stopping his binder waited to be addressed an old soft hat fell shapelessly forward over his deeply bronzed face his neck and most of his arms were uncovered before him the four powerful horses stood fidgeting in the heat a black cloud of flies about their heads though not a man of striking appearance he was in harmony with his surroundings and formed a fine central figure in the great harvest field a worthy type of the new nation that is rising in the west  for a moment or two the strangers studied him carefully from the wagon the one nearest him was a woman of thirty he thought of tall and chastely lined figure with a colorless and rather expressionless face though her features were excellent she wore a tightfitting dark dress which seemed to have been made all in one piece and gave an impression of prim coldness and careful restraint the man in the soft hat was obviously her father he had gray hair his face which was finely chiseled suggested a formal decided and perhaps domineering character his gray tweed traveling suit was immaculately neat there was no doubt that they were english and prescott wondered whom they reminded him of until the truth flashed upon him with a disconcerting shockthey were jernynghams father and sister  mr prescott inquired the man  prescott bowed and the teamster jumping down handed him two cards  i understand that you knew my unfortunate son the newcomer continued  i did prescott replied guardedly  then can i have a word or two with you in private  getting down from the binder prescott helped the other to alight from the high wagon the man was not agile though he carried himself well they walked back some distance along the edge of the wheat then the rancher stopped and from force of habit felt for his pipe  i must be to some extent confidential began jernyngham you must guess why i came  the strong light fell searchingly on his face revealing lines on it which prescott thought had lately been deepened by pain but his eyes were very keen and hard  i suppose the recent calamity brought you the rancher ventured  yes i have come to see justice done but we will not discuss that yet we arrived yesterday evening and found it was impossible that my daughter should be comfortable at the hotel besides which it is rather too far away i accordingly determined to look for quarters at one of the ranches but succeeded in getting shelter for only the one night  prescott felt amused jernyngham and his daughter were not the kind of people the somewhat primitive prairie ranchers would welcome their request for accommodation was more likely to cause astonishment and alarm  people are very busy now that harvests coming on and theyve extra hands to cook for he explained  i understand continued jernyngham that my sons homestead is in this neighborhood and domestics might be hired but after what has happened i fear my daughter would find living there a painful strain that was why i thought of applying to you  the announcement filled prescott with dismay the presence of the jernynghams might involve him in further complications  im sorry but we live very simply he said hastily my place is only half furnished we have no time to make it comfortableand im sure youd find our cooking barbarous im afraid miss jernyngham couldnt put up with the accommodation we could offer her  we only want quietness fresh air and a little privacy none of which seems to be obtainable at sebastian while the question of terms is no consideration i recognize that i must make my appeal to your generosity  prescott did not answer and jernyngham resumed in a more urgent tone  i must beg you not to make difficulties im told there is nobody else in the neighborhood who could take us in we will require very little attention and will promise to give you no trouble  prescott wavered the man was keenly anxious it was hard to resist his appeal and there was after all only a small risk that he might hear of colstons visit svendsen and his wife who attended to the housekeeping were scandinavians and could scarcely converse in english when they addressed him by any distinguishing epithet it was always as boss  well he said doubtfully i cant refuse you shelter you can stay for a while anyway until we see how we get on ill go up to the homestead with you  he had an interview with his housekeeper who protested in broken english that harvest was a singularly inconvenient time to entertain strangers but eventually gave away the extra hands lately hired could be put up in the barn and there were two rooms that could be spared prescott showed his visitors in and afterward watched with some amusement their surprise when they sat down to the midday meal with the lightly clad toilers from the field during the afternoon and until late in the evening he worked hard among the grain but when the light was failing and he leaned on a wire fence hot and tired after the long day of effort jernyngham came toward him  we have had very little talk so far he said my daughter however desires me to convey her thanks to you she believes she will be perfectly comfortable  he was irritatingly formal his tone was precise but it changed as he added  so you knew cyril  yes prescott said gravely i was fond of him  jernyngham seemed to be struggling with some stirring of his deeper nature beneath the crust of mannerisms  mr prescott he said i may tell you that i now fear i treated the lad injudiciously and perhaps with needless harshness i looked upon extravagance and eccentricity as signs of depravity it was a vast relief when i heard from colston whom you may have met that cyril had prospered and was leading an exemplary life in canada  the blood crept into prescotts face and jernyngham glanced at him curiously before he proceeded  we were somewhat hurt that he would not come home but after past mistakes i could not urge him and it seemed possible that he might change his mind later then the dreadful blow fellcrushing and filling me with all the bitterness of useless regret i had spoken too late the opportunity i would not use in time had gone  he broke off and his face had grown white and stern when he went on again  there is only one thing i can do but if needful i will devote the rest of my life to itthat is to track down the man who killed my son  he was silent for the next few minutes and then after a few words on indifferent subjects intended prescott thought to cover his display of feeling he turned away leaving the rancher smoking thoughtfully     chapter viii  a day on the prairie   a week after jernynghams arrival at the homestead he sat among the sheaves in the harvest field late one afternoon studying a letter which the mailcarrier had just brought him his daughter sheltered from the strong sunlight by the tall stocked sheaves was reading an elegantly bound book of philosophy gertrude jernyngham had strict rules of life and spent an hour or two of every day in improving her mind without so far as her friends had discovered any enlargement of her outlook among her numerous virtues was an affectionate solicitude about her fathers health which was variable though still muscularly vigorous jernyngham was getting an old man and he had been out of sorts of late  im glad you are looking much better than you did this morning she said glancing at him after a while  thank you jernyngham rejoined punctiliously i suppose it was the strain of the past few weeks that tried me and perhaps i have been doing too much traveling backward and forward between here and the muskeg then with an effort he banished his painful thoughts and smiled i wonder how many years it is since i spent an afternoon in a harvest field ill confess that i find much to interest me  gertrude laid down her book and glanced about she was of a practical disposition and almost devoid of artistic susceptibilities but the richness and color of the scene impressed her far away in front ran the long ranks of sheaves gleaming in the sunshine amid the golden stubble which was flecked by their deepblue shadows the air was cooling but the light was brilliant and the standing wheat was picked out with tints of burnished copper by comparison with it the oat stocks shone pale and silvery round the edge of the grain moved the binders clashing and tinkling musically while their whirling arms flashed in the sunlight  prescott lightly clad drove the foremost machine the fine modeling of his lean muscular figure was effectively displayed his uncovered arms and face were the color of the soil seated behind the big horses he looked wonderfully virile the man seemed filled with primitive vigor he was a type that was new to gertrude jernyngham  our host remarked her father strikes one as tireless though im inclined to think that during harvest everybody here works at a higher tension than would be borne at home their methods are rather wastefulthis tall stubble for instance continuous cereal crops except for the short summer fallowbut theyre no doubt adapted to the needs of the country having some experience in these matters i should say this farm was excellently managed  in place of answering gertrude watched the rancher the physical perfection of the man had an effect on her though she was essentially prudish  i ought to drive in to the settlement and send off a cablegram though i expect it will be difficult to get a team jernyngham resumed returning to his letter cranford wants instructions about a matter of importance that has cropped up since we left  it wouldnt be wise for you to drive so far gertrude said firmly i might go instead well speak to mr prescott about it this evening  shortly afterward there was a harsh clanking sound and prescott pulling up his team sprang down from the binder he became busy with hammer and spanner and in a few minutes the stubble was strewn with pinion wheels little shafts and drivingchains then while his guests watched him with growing interest he put the machine together started his team and stopped it and again dismembered the complicated gear this as gertrude realized was work that needed a certain amount of skill finally when the overtaking binders had stopped nearby he took out a small shaft and held it up so that the harvesters could see it  journals bent ill have to go get a new piece he said go ahead with your teams  after that he unhitched his horses and was leading them past the place where the jernynghams sat when gertrude spoke to him  im sorry you had an accident and i suppose you will have to send the broken part to sebastian may i go with the team  why of course he said ill drive you in tomorrow as its a pretty long way ill try to borrow a comfortable rig  he went on with the horses and she saw no more of him that day but early the next morning he brought up a light fourwheeled vehicle which would carry two people and had a hood that could be drawn up gertrude thought it a great improvement on the prairie wagon and she admired the restive team which he had some trouble in holding when she got in he sprang to the seat beside her the horses bounded forward and they sped out through a gap in the fence the vehicle lurching wildly among the ruts  for a while gertrude was occupied to the exclusion of everything else in trying to keep her place but when prescott turned the team on to a stretch of smooth short grass she began to look about it was a clear cool morning the sky was a wonderful blue and bluffs miles away showed up with sharp distinctness in the foreground the gray grass was bathed in a soft light which was restful to the eyes then gertrude examined the rig as the man had called it which struck her as remarkably light and fragile and the same thing was noticeable about the harness the horses moved as if they were drawing no load swinging along at a fast and springy trot while the vehicle ran lightly up and down the slight undulations the wheels jarring now and then into a hollow or smashing through dwarf scrub the pace was exhilarating the fine air invigorated the girl and her usual prim reserve melted away  i am fortunate in getting in to sebastian she said theres a cablegram its necessary that my father should send  glad to take you prescott rejoined is mr jernyngham in business  oh no not as you would understand it we spend most of our time in the country where he manages the estate its small but there are two quarries which need looking after then hes director of a company he doesnt believe that a man should be idle  prescott smiled he had read a good deal about england and he could imagine jernynghams firm control of his property his rule would no doubt be just but it would be enforced on autocratic and highly conventional lines his daughter the rancher thought resembled him in some respects she was handsome and dignified in a colorless way she might have been charming if she were only a trifle less correct in manner and there were more life in her  well he said in answer to her last remark thats a notion youll find lived up to here the man who wont work mighty hard very soon goes broke its a truth you in the old country ought to impress on the men youre sending out to us  she liked his easy phraseology which she supposed was western and there was nothing harsh in his intonation it was that of a welleducated man and the jernynghams were exacting in such matters  i think there must be something in the air which makes toil less arduous she said the people ive met have a cheerful optimistic look she hesitated and added in a confidential tone i like to imagine that my brother wore the same expression though he was always carelessly gay he seems to have made a capable rancher it was a great relief to us when we were told of it  prescott grew hot and embarrassed but he thought he could understand how cyril jernyngham had entered on a course of recklessness it was a reaction against the overwhelming propriety of his father and sister  i dont think you need grieve for your brother yet he said gravely although nobody here seems to agree with me i find it impossible to believe that he is dead  gertrude gave him a grateful look  im glad to hear you say sothere is at least a doubt and that is comforting though im afraid my father cant be made to realize it  cant you persuade him not to take too much for granted  i wish i could gertrudes tone was sad he has been brooding over the dreadful news ever since it reached us it has possessed him absolutely he can think of nothing else and there will be no relief for him until he finds the guilty person or it is proved beyond all doubt that the police are mistaken she paused before she went on if theyre right i think i should feel as merciless as he does cyril was my only brother i was very fond of him  her voice trembled a little though her eyes were hard and prescott felt sorry for her she was not of emotional nature he could imagine her shrinking from any display of tenderness nevertheless it was obvious that she was a prey to fear and grief  so was i he said i wonder if i may point out that he struck me as being different from you and your father  i think i know what you mean cyril was like my mothershe died a long while ago but i remember her as gentle sympathetic and perhaps more variable than i am cyril was swayed by feeling rather than by judgment  prescott knew this was correct but he found his companion an interesting study she was wrapped up in cold propriety she must have led an uneventful life looked up to and obeyed by the small community that owned her fathers rule romance could not have touched her she was not imaginative but he thought there were warmth and passion lying dormant somewhere in her nature she could not have wholly escaped the consequences of being cyril jernynghams sister  nothing further was said for a while and presently the team toiled through a belt of sandy ridges furrowed by the wind where the summits were crested here and there by small jackpines looking up as they crossed one elevation gertrude noticed a wedge of small dark bodies outlined against the soft blue sky  what are those she asked  wild geese the forerunners of the host that will soon come down from the marshes by the polar sea  but do they go so far  he laughed  they cross this continent twice a year up from the steaming lagoons on the gulf to the frozen muskegs of the north and back again theyre filled with a grand unrest and wholly free travelers of the high air always going somewhere  ah responded gertrude to be always doing something is good but the otherthe ceaseless wandering  going on and on beating a passage through the icy winds rejoicing in the sun seeking for adventure is there no charm in that  she looked at him uneasily as if his words had awakened some halfunderstood response  i think cyril must have felt something of the kind so far it has never stirred me isnt it wise to hold fast by what is safe and familiar  oh i dont know prescott answered with a smile i follow the course you mention because i have to its my business to drive the plow and the hazard of having a crop hailed out is adventure enough but i dont think it should make one hard on the people who prefer the other thing after all they may be right the life they take pleasure in may be the best for them though it wouldnt appeal to you or me  im not sure that toleration should be encouraged it often means indifference perhaps a lack of principle  she grasped tightly the rail around the seat for the horses plunged down a sandy slope at a wild gallop passing at the bottom a horse and buggy in which sat a man dressed in a dark gray suit to whom prescott waved his hand  is he a clergyman asked gertrude  well prescott smiled hes a presbyterian minister i suppose you think theres a difference  his companion with unusual forbearance let this pass  then you have churches at sebastian  four i cant say theyre crowded but while were liberalminded on many points the flocks wont mix strikes me as a pity  it is a pity there should be only one strong and united church in every place  and that the right one prescotts eyes twinkled mischievously youre thinking of the one we call episcopalian  yes said gertrude severely the church  ill admit that im on pretty good terms with the lot but father dillons my favorite for one thing hes a practical farmer as well as a fine classical scholar his crowd for the most part are hardup foreigners and he shows them how to build decent homes and put their crops in all the same ive quite a high opinion of the methodist and the presbyterian who are at the opposite end of the scale  gertrude showed signs of disapproval  in these matters broadmindedness may be dangerous one cant compromise  well he said even the roman curia tried it before the council of trent and your people made an attempt to conciliate the english calvinists about elizabeths time you were inclined to genevan protestantism once or twice afterward  his companions surprise was evident and he laughed as he read her thoughts  oh he explained i used to take some interest in these matters once upon a time you see i was at mcgill  mcgill i seem to have heard the name but what does it stand for  prescott looked amused  i dont know that it quite means what oxford does to you but its something of the kind you might have seen the fine buildings at the foot of the mountain if you had stayed in montreal then we have toronto with deference to the toronto men ill compare that to cambridge still so far as i understand your english ideas theres a differenceour boys go to mcgill or toronto with the intention of learning something that will open up a career they certainly play football and one or two other games pretty well but thats a very secondary object sos the acquiring of a polished style in fact its not altogether unusual on this side of the atlantic to find university men spending a vacation as waiters in the summer hotels  but why do they do that gertrude asked with a shocked expression  for money prescott answered dryly one gathers that the st andrew boys did something of the same kind in scotland in your grandfathers time and no logical objection could be made to it anyway isnt it a pretty good test of a mans determination its hard to see why he should make a worse doctor engineer or preacher because he has the grit to earn his training by carrying plates or chopping trees which some of our boys take to  this was difficult to answer and gertrude did not attempt it her prejudices were stronger than her powers of reasoning looking southward she saw the turreted tops of the sebastian elevators rising from the sea of grass like cathedral towers their smallness emphasized the vastness of the plain which was beginning to have a stimulating effect on her mind she thought it might explain the broadness of her companions views which while erroneous were becoming comprehensible he lived in the open beyond the bounds of walls and fences breathing this wonderful invigorating air nevertheless he was obviously a man of varied and extensive information which struck her as somewhat curious in face of his severely practical abilities he could mend harness plow a straight furrow break horses and strip a complicated machine as a new type he deserved attention  after a while they struck into a wellbeaten track which had been graded where it crossed a muskeg the rude work however had suffered from frost and rain the ruts in the hard black soil were deep and there were dangerous holes to make matters worse a big gasoline tractor intended to assist in some harvesting operations had got into difficulties near the middle of the graded track it was making an alarming noise and diffusing a pungent odor while two men thrust bits of board beneath the wheels for it to climb out of the hole on prescotts team slackened their pace jerking their heads and pricking their ears they were young range horses that had roamed over wide spaces and were badly broken  getting a tight grip on the reins he turned to his companion  we cant get aroundthe muskegs too soft id put you down only that i may not be able to hold the team after we get past that machine he raised his voice cant you stop her boys  no sir cried a grimy man soon as we cut out the engine shed run back into the hole weve been here two hours already  hold tight prescott cautioned gertrude and urged the horses forward  as they approached the tractor the noise suddenly increased and its wheels spun faster grinding on the skids one of the horses reared swinging up the pole which nearly threw its fellow then there was a frantic thud of hoofs against the frame of the vehicle and the team swinging half around threatened to overturn it into the swamp prescott plied the whip the beasts plunged one pair of wheels left the road and the rig slanted alarmingly a violent crash and jolt followed gertrude came near to being flung out of her seat and they passed the tractor and sped across the graded stretch at a furious pace prescott was braced backward his feet pressed hard against a bar his lips tightly set while gertrude shrinking from the disaster that seemed imminent wondered how he swung the panicstricken beasts clear of the worst holes she gasped with relief when they had passed the muskeg but the trail was still in a dangerous state and prescott turned the team upon the grass where they galloped on while the wheels smashed through short scrub until at last the speed began to slacken the horses coats were foul and flecked with spume when gertrude looked backward and saw the tractor far away in the distance  theyve had enough prescott remarked we made the last mile at a pretty good clip i kept them at it guess they wont start another circus if we meet a freight locomotive on the switches  the settlement was reached without further misadventure and prescott as a special favor secured a separate table at the hotel where gertrude was served with an excellent meal afterward he showed her how to despatch her fathers message and as she turned away the telegraph operator grinned at prescott  where are all these hightoned english girls coming from jack he said you have brought another one this time  leaving the man without an answer prescott rejoined his companion  are there any english people staying near the settlement she asked  the fellow was alluding to miss hurst  muriel hurst gertrude exclaimed sharply was she here with you  yes prescott regretted that she had asked for an explanation of the operators remarks i once drove her in cyrils team was doing something else but you said you wanted to visit the drygoods store didnt you  gertrude accompanied him there and when he left her in the hands of a lady clerk she fancied that she was favored with somewhat unusual attention on his account the man seemed to be a favorite in the settlement she spent a tedious afternoon in the hotel parlor while he went about the business that had brought him in and the team rested it was a relief when he reappeared in time for supper and after that they set out again the sun set before they reached the homestead the air grew bracingly cool and the prairie rolled away before them dim and mysterious streaked with shadowy blurs of bluffs until a full moon rose and flooded it with silvery light there was strange deep silence except for the thud of hoofs which rose and fell in sharp staccato rhythm  gertrude was tired when prescott helped her down at the homestead but all her senses were unusually alert she had enjoyed what she felt had been an invigorating day and she admitted that although she by no means agreed with all the rancher said his breezy talk had added to its zest     chapter ix  prescott makes a promise   the fortnight that followed gertrudes drive to sebastian passed uneventfully though the minds of three of the occupants of the homestead were filled with disturbing thoughts prescott spent the time working hard at his harvest but he wished that something might relieve him of his guests whose presence he found embarrassing since it forced him to be continually on his guard in spite of this he was conscious of strong sympathy for them and did what he could to ensure their comfort he was getting uneasy for he saw that cyril jernyngham had involved him in a maze of complications from which there seemed to be no escape it was obvious that appearances were against him the evidence that curtis had obtained pointed to his being implicated in the death of his friend and the painstaking corporal might discover something more damaging prescott fancied that one or two of his acquaintances who now and then rode across his farm on different errands returned his greeting with a new and significant coldness  jernyngham spent much of his time at the muskeg encouraging the men who searched it and often assisting in the work the whole morass was being systematically turned over with the spade but no further discoveries had been made in addition to this jernyngham rode to and fro about the prairie talking to the farmers whom he met on the trail or found at work in the fields they were all sorry for him but there was something deterrent in his sternness and his formal english manner and they were less communicative than they might have been this was why he failed to learn that the colstons had stayed at prescotts homestead though for that matter the fact was not generally known the man could not rest tormented by regrets for his past harshness he was bent on making the only amend he could by hunting down the slayer of his son his whole mind was fixed on the task and he brooded over it in a manner that aroused his daughters concern she dreaded the effect a continuance of the strain might have  gertrude however was relieved of a more pressing anxiety though her father steadfastly refused to entertain it she shared prescotts belief that her brother was not dead for one thing cyril was not the man to come badly to grief he had done many reckless things and somehow escaped the worst results illogical as the idea was she felt that his luck was good it was a comforting reflection and she was sensible of a growing confidence in the farmer who encouraged her to cling to it  one afternoon she left the house and strolled across the harvest fields which had greatly changed in appearance since she had first seen them the oats were all stooked and stood in silvery sheaves ready for the thrasher the great stretch of wheat had melted down to a narrow oblong round which the binders were working gertrude stopped to watch them the plodding horses the bent figures of the men the play of light on falling grain and the revolving arms of the machines fixed her eyes the rustle of sheaves the crackle of stubble and the musical tinkle of metal fell pleasantly on her ears the mornings and evenings were cold now but the days were hot and bright and the scene was steeped in vivid hues ocher lemon and coppery red below dazzling blue above  prescott drove the leading binder and when it drew nearer she followed his movements with careful scrutiny she admitted that the man aroused her interest he was wonderfully virile sanguine and hopeful with a trace of what she thought of as the primitive strain which tended toward physical perfection his vigor and muscular symmetry had their effect on her though her father was a man of means and influence her circle of acquaintances had been restricted by the narrowness of his views and the men with whom she had been brought into contact were for the most part distinguished rather by unexceptional morals and sound opinions than by bodily grace and original thought  by disposition as well as training gertrude was a formalist and a prude but she was human and she unconsciously obeyed a law of nature which ordains the union of the dissimilar this was why having met only men of her own kind hitherto she had escaped the touch of passion and now felt drawn toward one who greatly differed from her  after a while prescott stopped his binder and opened a box attached to it he closed it sharply as if annoyed called to one of the men gathering up the sheaves and then walked toward the house  run out of twine ill have to get some he explained to gertrude  you look tired she said stopping him you have been working very hard  i dont feel quite as bright as usual he confessed its the heat i think but ive turned out at four oclock every morning since harvest began  then why not take a few minutes rest ill make you a cup of tea i was going in to get some ready its an english custom  he indicated his attire  id be glad but i havent time to make myself presentable  ill excuse that gertrude smiled and added with unusual boldness you dont seem to know that your dress is really most artistic it suits you  he bowed to her  im flattered this costume was adopted with a view to economy and comfort the worst of a mans wearing smart clothes is that whenever he wants to do anything useful he has to take them off  is that a great trouble  it takes a lot of valuable time he answered with a smile  they turned toward the house and after getting the twine he joined her in a cool shadowy room gertrude was watching a silver spiritlamp near which two dainty cups and plates were laid out  thats a very pretty outfit he remarked is it english  no i bought it at a big store in winnipegon portage avenue i think  i know the place so theyre selling this kind of thing there its significant a few years ago theyd have got nobody to buy such truck he picked up a cup and held it to the light after examining the chaste color design and stamp anyway its english the genuine article i believe the biscuit cant be imitated  gertrude had not expected him to understand artistic china  ive read about these things he explained with a goodhumored laugh and ive a way of remembering we have time in winter and one is glad to study anything that comes along still ill allow that i found fivecent cans quite good enough when i first came out  this was not a point of much importance but it fixed gertrudes attention she was in the habit of roughly sorting people into different groups there were for example those who appreciated beautiful things and had been endowed with them as a reward of merit and those of coarser nature on whom they would be wasted which was no doubt why they had none yet here was a man with artistic taste who was nevertheless engaged in hard manual labor and had drunk contentedly out of common cans it did not fit in with her theories  i suppose this country has its influence on one she said searching for an explanation  thats so the influence is strong and good on the whole  she considered this quietly studying him it was the first time she had entertained at table a man in outdoor working attire prescott out of deference to his guests had made some preparation for the meals they shared still the simple dress became him he was as she vaguely thought of it admirable in a way his hands and wrists were wellshaped though scarred and roughened by the rasp of the hot straw the warmth of the sun seemed to cling to his brown face a joyous vitality emanated from him and he had mental gifts she felt lightly thrilled by his propinquity  but everything out here is still very crude she said  thats where our strength lies were a new people raised on virgin soil out in the rushing winds we havent simmered down yet were charged with unexhausted energies which show themselves in novel ways in our cities youll find semibarbarous rawness side by side with splendor and art and complicated machines run by men who havent much regard for the fastidious niceties of civilization though theyre unexcelled in their engineering skill we undertake big works in an unconsidered manner that would scare your cautious english minds make wild blunders and go ahead without counting the damage we come down pretty hard often but it never brings us to a stop  he saw that she did not grasp all he meant to convey and he leaned back in his chair with a laugh  this is the kind of fool talk you would expect from a boastful westerner isnt it  no she replied somewhat formally that isnt what i thought i find everything i see and hear interesting but theres much i cant understand one has to feel for its meaning  its a very proper attitude he rejoined with amusement so long as you dont bring over a readymade standard to measure our shortcomings by well explain all we can in fact its a thing were fond of doing then his tone grew grave but i havent seen your father since this morning is he at the muskeg  yes im getting anxious about him the trouble is preying on his mind grief of course is a natural feeling but he thinks of nothing except revenge hes growing haggard and losing his judgment im almost afraid to think what may happen if he finds anything that looks like a clue the shock has shaken him terribly  and you  i feel half guilty because ive been so calm since i came here but i cant believe the worst you have reassured me she paused and added softly and im very grateful  im glad prescotts tone was sympathetic but i can imagine what your father feels from a few things he has told me he seems to have led a smooth wellordered life no doubt he made too much of the trouble your brother caused him  yes i think so now  perhaps he halfconsciously formed an idea that things would always go tranquilly with him and when it came without warning the shock of cyrils disappearance was too strong and yet i firmly believe hes mistaken in his fears  gertrude made a sign of agreement  nothing i can say calms him one can only wait  and thats always hard prescott said gently  she roused him to strong compassion she had he thought no great depth of character but her development had been checked by many restraints her father had curbed each natural impulse until the little originality in her withered and died she had grown up cold and colorless with narrow views and petty if quite blameless aims prescott however was wrong in crediting jernyngham with too great a success gertrudes nature had not been utterly repressed and stunted and now in time of stress it was expanding  romance had come late to her but she was dimly conscious of it at last her senses were stirring and she felt a halfguilty pleasure at seeing the bronzed ranchers eyes bent on her tenderly to think of him except as her host for a few weeks was of course folly but there was a fascination in the gentleness he showed her she was beginning to understand and sympathize with cyrils rash daring and contempt for restraints she felt tempted to follow her impulses her frigid reserve was melting  will you have more tea she asked shrinking back to safe ground  thank you he said holding out the dainty cup  hot water its rather strong  before i had a housekeeper we made it black and drank it by the kettleful  but the effect on your nerves  nerves he laughed we dont cultivate them in this country mine make no trouble  youre to be envied she said and looked up sharply at a sound of footsteps as her father came in  his clothes were dusty and creased the neatness which had characterized him on his arrival had gone his face had grown brown but it was haggard hotly flushed and beaded with perspiration his lips were tightly set his eyes had an ominous glitter throwing down a riding quirt he carried he sat down resting his arms on the table in an attitude of blank dejection  nothing yet he said listlessly its hard to bear  theres a suggestion i want to make prescott spoke quietly the offer of a reward here has led to nothing send another round to the alberta and british columbia papers with a description of your son saying youll pay a hundred dollars for trustworthy information about him i believe it will bring you good news  jernyngham turned to him in keen impatience  it would be uselessmy son is dead the police have proved that beyond a doubt and i cannot understand why you should persist in denying it his eyes grew hard with sudden suspicion it looks as if you had some motive  im afraid youre hardly just gertrude broke in mr prescott only wishes to lessen your anxiety but hes convinced of what he says  it was a rare thing for her to oppose him but jernyngham was too preoccupied to be surprised at her boldness and he made a gesture of deprecation  you must forgive me mr prescottmy daughters right but to offer me assurances that must prove false is rank cruelty i have faced the worst im not strong enough to bear a second blow which is what must follow if i listen to you as it is the strain is merciless  his voice and bearing showed it indeed one could have imagined that it would have been better had he yielded a little more but his eyes expressed a grim vengeful determination he was not the man to weaken he would hold out until he broke down but his daughter and prescott were filled with fears for him  im sorry said the rancher has curtis thought of anything new  no jernyngham answered harshly the police can entertain only one idea at a time they can read the meaning of footprints and there their ability ends they have no power of organization i cant force them to make investigations on a proper scale and im helpless until harvests over then when men can be hired ill have every bluff and ravine in the country searched if i spend the rest of my life here ill find the guilty man  he said nothing further and there was a strained silence while he sat leaning forward limply with bent head and a thin hand clenched hard upon the table rousing himself by and by he took the cup of tea gertrude passed to him and set it down without drinking it made a sharp clatter but he left it setting near him as if he had forgotten it unable to bear the sight of his distress prescott went quietly out and when he was leaving the house gertrude joined him  perhaps i should have stayed with him but i was afraid to speak she said besides there was nothing to be said  this cant go on prescott declared its too much for him i cant leave here until the harvests over and then the grain ought to be hauled in but ive thought of making a tour of inquiry along the new railroad and round the alberta ranches and the mines in british columbia  gertrude looked grateful  it would be a great relief to feel that something was being done but she added hesitatingly your time is valuable and there would be expense i have some means mr prescott and though i dare not speak to my father about it you must draw on me  well talk about it later i wish i could go now but thats impossible and theres no use in suggesting that mr jernyngham should send somebody else besides i believe id have the best chance of picking up the right trail you wont mind my saying that im very sorry for you  her eyes grew soft and her whole expression gentle it was an attractive face prescott looked into  i value your sympathy she said softly indeed i cant tell you what a comfort you have been but you will undertake this search as soon as possible wont you  yes prescott replied firmly you can count on that if ive made things easier for you im very glad  then he turned away and hurried back to the binder     chapter x  a new clue   it was a clear cool morning and prescott was busily engaged throwing sheaves into his wagon he had finished his harvest and in accordance with western custom had immediately begun the thrashing part of the great field was already stripped to a belt of tall stubble though long ranks of stooks still stretched across the rest and dusty men were hard at work among them wagons rolled through the crackling strawgoing slowly piled high with rustling loads returning light jolting wildly as fast as the teams could trot for the thrashers were paid by the bushel and would brook no delay in the background stood their big machine pouring out a cloud of smoke that stretched in a gray trail across the prairie and filling the air with its harsh clatter  it was a scene of strenuous activity filled with hurriedly moving figures but its coloring had lost something of its former vividness the blue of the sky was softer the light less strong the varying hues of lemon and copper and ocher had become subdued the shadows were no longer darkly blue but a cool restful gray the rushing winds that had swept the wide plain all summer had come to rest the air was sharp and still  the last week or two however had brought no change to the inmates of the homestead jernyngham still brooded over his loss and worried the police his daughter looked to her host for comfort and prescott did what he could to cheer her gertrude indeed was sensible of a rapidly growing confidence in him and of the abandonment of many longheld ideas the man was not of her station he was a working farmer his views at first had jarred on her and yet the attraction he had for her was steadily increasing she made a feeble fight against it in england she had stood on safe ground hedged in by conventions ruled by the opinions of a narrow circle of friends now all was different she had lost these supports and restraints and she was helpless without them passion was beginning to touch her and she mistook the ranchers gentleness and sympathy  when prescott had loaded his wagon she joined him as he led his team between the ranks of stooks but while she walked by his side he thought of another englishwoman whom he had once brought home with the prairie hay he remembered how muriel hurst had nestled among the yielding grass with something delightful in every line of her figure he recalled her bright goodhumor the music of her laugh the soft tones of her voice the hint of courage he had seen in her eyes and there was pain in the recollection gertrude jernyngham was powerless to move him as muriel had done but he was sorry for cyrils sister and very considerate of her  well have the crop off the ground before long he said then ill start for alberta as i promised  you will be away some time  im afraid so its a big province though there are not a great many settlements in it yet and i may have to cross over into british columbia  gertrude looked down  it is very generous of you to go but i shall miss you i shall feel as if i had lost my chief support  so far ive done nothing but talk and talk is cheap he laughed  you have given me courage she said with shy hesitation and sympathy is worth a good deal  he did not respond as she thought he might have done and she continued  if my father had been less obstinate you need not have gone he could have hired a professional inquiry agent but you had better not say anything about your object to himit must be a secret between us  yes assented prescott thoughtfully i guess that would be wiser you want to keep his mind at rest as far as you can of course theres a big chance that i may fail  gertrude turned to him with a smile  oh no you are not one to fail  prescott was slightly embarrassed he had a feeling that he was being gently led on toward a closer acquaintance with his companion she was dropping the reserve she had at first displayed and seemed to invite him tacitly into her confidence he admitted that this idea might be incorrect but it had troubled him once or twice before  i expect youll be comfortable enough while im away he said mrs svendsens trustworthy and everything will be quiet after the harvesters have gone  gertrude did not answer and they went on in silence to the noisy separator perspiring men stripped of their heavier garments were tossing the sheaves amid a cloud of dust cleaned grain poured out into open bags and as each was filled two panting toilers flung it into a wagon nearby stood a great and growing pile of bags over which the short straw would be spread a number of feet thick to form a granary gertrude joined her father who was standing near the machine moodily looking on and before prescott had unloaded his wagon curtis rode up with private stanton  nothing new at the muskeg sir he reported to jernyngham rather curtly and walked his horse toward prescott  we were passing he told him and indicated the pile of grain youre not selling right away  no im not ready to haul the crop in to the elevators yet ive one or two more pressing things to do  maynt you miss a chance prices are pretty good  prescott was on his guard he felt that curtis suspected him  i dont know he answered i guess they wont fall much  your neighbors mean to sell though its quite likely thats to meet their bills and you always tried to get in on the first of the market until this year it must have cost you a pile to put in that big crop  it did  then how have you got so prosperous since last fall  it was a pointed question because everybody in the district knew that prescott had sold only a few head of cattle and a horse or two while he would shortly have his accounts to meet  its a matter of management he replied ive been working on a different system this spring and i find it pays then he looked steadily at the corporal besides running jernynghams place along with mine made it easier to cut expenses  its a great crop but we must be getting on  he rode off and when they had left the stubble private stanton looked at him  his being able to hold his wheat which he couldnt do last year is a pretty strong count against the man you gave him his chance for explaining and he made a mighty bad show looks as if hed got some money he couldnt account for since last fall  not proved returned curtis theres something in what he said anyway he isnt afraid of us since hes putting up his grain  i dont quite catch on  curtis smiled  youre young a guilty man would have rushed his crop into the elevators and had his money ready to light out with if prescott pulls out suddenly hell have to leave his property behind  the things between him and wandle stanton persisted  looks like that anyway as the austrians at the settlement well have a good look round his homestead its possible that well find something  what made you think of searching the place again anything in the last instructions you got from regina you didnt show them to me  thats so it isnt a part of my duty to consult you and youre a bit of a hustler however this is what i hearda land agent in navarino sent for the district sergeant told him hed run across a man from sebastian at the hotel and the fellow got talking about jernyngham it was the first the land agent had heard of the matter but he was struck by the date on which jernyngham disappeared because hed had a deal with him three days later  thats mighty strange if hes right jernyngham couldnt have been killed  dont hustle said curtis the fellow showed the sergeant the sale record but he described jernyngham as a big rather stout man with light hair  wandle exclaimed stanton are you going to arrest him  not yet we might get him sent up for fraud and forgery but if he had anything to do with knocking jernyngham out hell be more likely to give us a clue of some kind while hes at large  they rode on and reaching wandles farm searched the house carefully replacing everything exactly as they found it they discovered nothing of importance but as they went out curtis glanced at the ash and refuse heap  we might have thought of that earlier he said ive heard of people trying to burn up things it might be dangerous to leave about  setting to work with a fork and shovel they presently unearthed a rusty iron object which stanton picked up  looks like a big meat can he remarked kind of curious that wandle should double it over this way and flatten it down  curtis took it from him and examined it carefully  it isnt a meat can top edges are turned over a wireheres a bit sticking outand its had a handle theres a hinge in another place the thing has been a boxa cashbox i guessone of the rubbishy kind they sell for about a dollar  but what would make a man smash up his cashbox  i dont know guess it doesnt apply i could understand his wanting to get rid of one that belonged to somebody else after hed cleaned it out arent you beginning to understand  sure said stanton eagerly the box was jernynghamswell find out when he bought it at the hardware store then well get after wandle  you hustle too much curtis rebuked him and then sat down with knitted brows now see herein a general way its convictions were out for you want to count on your verdict before you arrest a man it comes to this hes tried first by us and if hes to be let off it saves trouble if we decide the thing instead of leaving it to the jury they wont tell you that at regina but in practise youll find that a police trooper is expected to use some judgment still there are exceptions to what ive said about holding back in the interests of justice one might have to corral an innocent man  hows that going to serve the interests of justice  the corporals eyes twinkled with dry amusement  for one thing it might lead the fellow we were really after to think we hadnt struck his trail but thats not the point how much ash would you figure wandle takes out of his stove each time he lights it  about a bucketful burning wood  not quite but theres a bucket yonder see how many times you can fill it with the stuff we shoveled off while i take a smoke build up the pile to look as if we hadnt disturbed it  stanton did as he was bidden counting each bucketful he replaced and then curtis sent him to clean out the stove and estimate the quantity of ash before he put it back then he made a calculation  allowing for some of the ash slipping down the pile and for our having moved a little that was there before wandle threw the cashbox in it fixes the time he did so pretty close to jernynghams disappearance he remarked looks bad against the austrian doesnt it  you have quite as much against prescott  yes curtis admitted regretfully thats the trouble it isnt quite so easy being a policeman as folks seem to think now well ride along and call on the hardware man  they mounted and soon afterward saw a buggy emerge from the short pines on the crest of a distant rise whereupon curtis rode hard for a poplar bluff which he kept between himself and the vehicle  looks like wandle coming back he said to stanton who had followed him i cant see any reason he should know weve been prospecting round his place  reaching the settlement they visited the hardware dealer who remembered having sold jernyngham a small cheap cashbox about twelve months earlier on being shown the bentup iron he expressed his belief that it was the article in question  a day or two after the corporals discovery the mailcarrier left some letters at the prescott homestead and when it was getting dusk gertrude strolled out on the prairie thinking of one she had received after a while prescott joined her and she greeted him with a smile  my team was looking a bit played out and the boys will be able to keep the separator gang going as long as they can see he said  do you feel that you have to make excuses for stopping work after twelve hours of it gertrude asked  yes he laughed i do feel something of the kind theres so much to do and the days are getting shorter fast  he glanced at her with appreciation she wore a thin black dress made after the latest london mode which showed to advantage the graceful lines of her tall figure the jernynghams who seldom departed from an established custom changed their attire every evening gertrude had on no hat and the fading light shone into her face it was finely cut but cold the features unusually good she was a handsome woman but she lacked warmth and softness  im in a difficulty she told him perhaps you can helpyoure a man of many resources  ill be glad to do what i can  we are expecting a visit from three old friends of ours who heard in america of the trouble we are in and want to see us what can we do with them  i havent room prescott answered but let me thinkleslie has quite a big house and its only three miles from here now that he will have got rid of the harvesters he might be willing to take your friends in he and his wife are pleasant people but i think you met her  yes i knew you wouldnt fail us gertrude said gratefully but after all i feel inclined to wish they were not coming  there was an elusive something in her tone which did not escape prescotts notice  why do you wish that he asked  oh she said its difficult to explain but we have got used to the mode of life here the few people we meet seem to understand our feelings and we have learned to trust them strangers would rather spoil it all in a sense their visit would be an intrusion  prescott realized that this was complimentary to him she had made it clear that he was not a stranger but one of the people she trusted the effect was to render him somewhat embarrassed but gertrude resumed  i think we owe you a good deal i dont know what we should have done had we fallen into less considerate hands  im yours to command he replied and they walked on in silence for a while gertrude glancing at him unobtrusively now and then  she did not believe her brother deadprescott had reassured her and now she felt strongly attracted by the rancher she had thrown off the restraints in which she had long acquiesced she was driven by a passion which was rapidly overpowering her  you dont suggest that the leslies should take us all she said  no prescott answered gravely id rather keep you and your father here  then youre no longer anxious to get rid of us  he colored  thats true i begin to feel im one of the party then you see leslies pretty talkative and agrees with curtis he might have a bad effect on your father he might even shake your confidence  oh she begged dont labor the explanation you are one of the party and our friend  prescott bowed  ill try to make that good im going off to look for your brother in a few more days but it will cost me something to leave the homestead now  he had spoken the truth until lately the man had been bereft of all the amenities of life but he had now grown to appreciate the society of cultured people the task of cheering and encouraging his guests had become familiar he might even have been drawn to the beautiful woman he had comforted had not his heart been filled with the image of muriel  but after the summers hard monotonous work a change must be nice she suggested  yes in a way the trouble is that i must leave my guests  gertrudes eyes grew soft as they rested on him  we shall miss you she murmured but you must go and find out all you can im afraid the mystery and suspense are breaking my father down  they walked on in silence for a while and then svendsen appeared near the homestead waving his arm  looks as if i were wanted prescott remarked i believe theres a wagon to be fixed will you excuse me ill ride over and have a talk with leslie in the morning     chapter xi  a revelation   the sun had just dipped leaving a rim of flaring color on the edge of the vast plain when prescott sat smoking on the stoop of the leslie homestead a week after his evening walk with gertrude leslie and his wife were simple people from ontario who had prospered in the last few years their crops had escaped rust and hail and autumn frost and as a result of this the rancher had replaced his rude frame dwelling with a commodious house built with lower walls of brick and wood above in a somewhat ornate style copied from the small villas which are springing up on the outskirts of the western towns  leslie an elderly brownfaced man sat near prescott the jernynghams who had driven over to welcome his friends were inside talking to mrs leslie  guess you dont know much about the english people were expecting leslie asked  no said prescott only that theyre friends of the jernynghams i dont think ive even heard their names yet  mrs leslie knows rejoined the farmer i forget it i feel kind of sorry now that she agreed to take them in but you made a point of it and if the mans not so blamed standoffish ill have somebody to talk to  i wouldnt talk too much about cyril jernyngham  leslie looked hard at him  theres one point jack where i cant agree with youyoure the only man in this district who doesnt believe jernynghams dead it strikes me that you know more about the thing than you have told anybody yet  let it go at that said prescott awkwardly all i could say would only bring more trouble on his people and theyve had quite enough  sure agreed leslie raising his hand in warning shh theyre coming out  the next moment gertrude and her father joined the men and after a few words with them stood still listening a long bluff through which the trail from the settlement led ran close up to the homestead cutting against the pale green glow of the sky for a few minutes there was a deep silence intensified by the musical clash of cowbells in the distance and then a measured drumming sound rose softly from behind the trees  guess thats your friends leslie said to jernyngham jims made pretty good time  the beat of hoofs grew nearer until the listeners could hear the rattle of wheels then a light fourwheeled vehicle came lurching out of the bluff and jernyngham hurried down the steps prescott had entered the house to tell mrs leslie and he came out as the driver pulled up his team the occupants of the wagon which had run a little past the door had their backs to him but seeing a girl about to alight he sprang forward her head was turned away from him at first but she glanced round when he offered to assist her and he forgot what the consequences of the meeting must be as he looked into the eyes of muriel hurst he was conscious of an overwhelming delight which showed itself in his shining eyes and the warm color that suddenly flushed his face gertrude jernyngham standing beside him read what was in his heart  the effect on muriel was as marked he had seized her hand and as she was standing precariously poised ready to descend he swung her down then she recoiled from him startled but with strong relief in her expression  cyril she cried in a strained voice why didnt you write and tell us that it was all a mistake we heard that you were dead  then prescott remembered and his heart sank but he strove to gather his courage for there was a crisis to be faced he stood silent with one hand clenched tight while gertrude watched him with hard unwavering eyes jernyngham however had heard muriels startled exclamation and hurried toward her  whats this he asked harshly you called my sons name  the girl looked at prescott troubled and surprised by the confused emotions his face betrayed there was obviously something wrong but she could not imagine what it was  yes she said i called him cyril why shouldnt i  colston and his wife joined the group while the driver looked on from the wagon and the leslies from the stoop prescott and the girl stood a little distance apart and muriel was sensible of a nervous shiver when prescott had first held up his hand to her she had seen his keen pleasure and her heart had responded to it now however she was filled with dismay  jernyngham answered her in curt stern tones  theres one very good reasonthis is not my son  not cyril colston broke in but he made us believe he was hes the man we stayed with he made a puzzled gesture i cant understand the thing  nor i replied jernyngham is this the man you wrote to us about  of course said colston stupidly i thought he was cyril so did we all we had no cause to doubt it  jernyngham turned in fury to the leslies  who is the fellow he demanded  prescott braced himself  ill answer thatjack prescott mr colston stayed at my homestead  and you personated my son i suppose you had some motive for doing so and must see that we are entitled to an explanation  yes prescott returned quietly this isnt the place to make it hadnt you better take your friends in  they entered the house which was getting dark and while the hired man carried in the baggage leslie lighted a lamp in his sittingroom it was spacious roughly paneled in cedar with an uncovered floor there were a few chairs scattered about and a plain pine table jernyngham sat by the table and the others found seats here and there except prescott who stood quietly opposite the old man at a curt sign from jernyngham leslie and his wife left the room  mr prescott jernyngham began you have deceived my friends here and i think they should remain to hear what you have to say but i will dismiss them if you prefer it you are responsible to me and i must ask for a full account of your conduct  prescott glanced round the room which reminded him of a court gertrude jernynghams eyes were fixed on him and there was a hardness that hinted at cruelty in them she looked very dignified and cold mrs colston he could not see but her husband seemed disturbed and uneasy muriel leaned forward in her chair with wonder apprehension and pity curiously mingled in her expression all of them were very still the silence was disconcerting but prescott roused himself to make what defense he could  i passed for cyril jernyngham at his request he said  an extraordinary statement jernyngham remarked with ironical incredulity may one ask if he gave any reasons for wishing you to do so  prescott hesitated which counted against him  well he said cyril had got hurt in a row at the settlement a few hours before mr colstons arrival his head was badly cut he thought it might make a bad impression  that doesnt sound very convincing had he no better reason  the rancher paused to think he would not explain that his friends mode of life would not have borne a critical examination but he had a duty to himself and something must be urged  i think he meant to hide the fact that he was married he did not wish your friends to meet his wife  colston started and it was obvious that the others were keenly interested but jernynghams face grew darker and marked by signs of pain for he had learned a little about ellice he was struggling with an overwhelming humiliation  well let that pass he said its a matter that cannot be discussed was mr colstons visit the only time you personated my son  certainly nothing would induce me to play the part again  then you will be surprised to hear that shortly after cyrils disappearance a man sold some land of his at a town farther along the line  i am surprised but i believe it must have been cyril  then his handwriting must have totally changed which i believe is a very unusual thing jernyngham rejoined sarcastically i have been shown some documents which he is supposed to have filled in  prescott began to realize that appearances were very strongly against him he had admitted having once impersonated his friend and it would be difficult to convince those who had heard his confession that he had not done so again when there was a strong motive for it in the price of the land  well he said firmly if the handwriting wasnt cyrils i cant tell whose it was it certainly wasnt mine theres one thing im convinced ofyour son is not dead  jernyngham looked at him with the veins on his forehead swollen and his face tense with anger but he held himself in hand  you have said so often i did not believe you i do not believe you now but your object in making the statement is easy to understand ive no doubt you realize that you lie open to a very ugly suspicion  no a strained voice broke in that is not just  looking up prescott saw that it was muriel who had spoken her eyes were bright with indignation and her face was hot but none of the others showed him any sympathy colstons face was grave and troubled his wifes expressionless gertrude jernyngham looked more determined and more merciless than her father she sat very still coldly watching him  thank you he said to muriel its comforting to find one person who does not think the worst of me  silence sir jernyngham exclaimed with the air of a judge rebuking a prisoner of whose guilt he is convinced you cannot be permitted to speak to this lady  i think that is a point for mrs colston to decide but well let it drop out of consideration for you ive answered your questions but you have gone too far and this must end prescotts expression grew as stern as the old mans and he looked about with pride i tell you it must stop what right have you to fling these infamous hints at me  jernyngham broke into a harsh laugh  the part of an innocent man is too much for you to play we wont force you into it it will be a favor if you will have our baggage sent across here needless to say neither my daughter nor i can reenter your house then his selfcontrol deserted him and he broke out in hot fury i firmly believe you are the man who killed my son and you shall not escape  i think said colston quietly that is going too far  making no answer prescott left them and he was harnessing his horse outside when somewhat to his astonishment muriel came toward him a halfmoon hung low above the bluff and the silvery light shone into her face showing her warmth of color and the sparkle in her eyes he thought she looked wonderfully attractive and his heart throbbed faster but he knew he must hold himself in hand  hadnt you better go back he asked you have heard what your friends think of me  what does that matter she exclaimed with feeling im very angry with them i cant let you go without saying that i know you could not have done what you have been wickedly accused of  im glad thank you its a big relief to feel that you believe in me so long as i have that assurance nothing else counts  harry colstons not convinced i believe hes trying to keep an open mind  is that so said prescott i dont expect much from him hes the kind of man whos guided by appearances and seldom does anything out of the common  muriel disregarded this  but you were very foolish in deceiving us i cant understand yet why you did so  i can only tell you that it was for cyrils sake  oh she cried it could not have been because of any benefit that you would get that would never have tempted you  he read unshaken confidence in her eyes and it cost him a stern effort to refrain from reckless speech muriel was beautiful but that was not all she was generous and fearless a loyal friend and a staunch partizan  well prescott confessed when i explained i was more afraid of you than of jernyngham i wanted to keep your good opinion and i wondered whether you had only given it to me because you thought i was cyril jernyngham from your friends point of view jack prescott is a very different kind of person  muriel blushed  is it unpardonable that i was angry when i first found out the mistake try to imagine with what ideas i have been brought up but the feeling left me when i saw how merciless jernyngham was his hard words turned it into sympathy  that is something to be thankful for though it doesnt content me i think you would be sorry for any one even an enemy who was in trouble and getting hurt  she grasped his meaning and looked at him steadily with an air of pride  then must i tell you that i have as much faith in jack prescott as i had in the man whom i supposed to be cyril jernyngham but you must justify my confidence you have been wrongly and cruelly accused dont you see the duty that lies on you  yes prescott answered gravely i have to clear myself if there were no other reason than the one you have given it would have to be done its going to be a tough proposition but ill get about it very soon  you know that i wish you all success she told him softly  then she held out her hand and turned away when she had gone prescott went on with his work and after buckling the last strap he found that he had forgotten a parcel mrs leslie had asked him to deliver hurrying back to the house for it he met gertrude jernyngham in the hall and she stopped where the light fell on her instead of avoiding him as he had expected there was suspicion in her eyes  i see you agree with your father he said boldly  yes she replied in a scornful tone you can pose rather cleverlyyou tricked me into trusting you but your ability is limited after all when the strain comes you break down could anything have been feebler than the defense you made  it was pretty lame but every word was true  oh she cried with disgust and impatience one wouldnt expect you to say it was false you dont seem to have anything more convincing to add  im going to add nothing it isnt very long since you were willing to take my word  im afraid i was easily deceived gertrude said bitterly i didnt know you had twice passed yourself off as my brother and you cant complain if we see an obvious motive for your doing so the second time  you mean that i stole the price of cyrils land prescott asked sternly  yes she said watching him with cruel eyes that however is not the worst she struggled with rising passion before she resumed i believe  prescott raised his hand commandingly  stop im going away to find your brother  one can understand your going away she flung back at him as she passed on down the hall  prescott drove home at a reckless pace facing the situation boldly he recognized that the outlook was very dark     chapter xii  prescotts flight   two days after the arrival of the colstons gertrude jernyngham walked down the trail from the leslie homestead in a very bitter mood during the last few weeks her cold nature had kindled into sudden warmth love had most unexpectedly crept into her heart at first she had struggled against and been ashamed of it for its object was a man beneath her in rank and of widely different mode of thought but by degrees the judgment she had hitherto exercised had given place to passion after the narrow conventional life she had led there was a strange exhilaration and excitement in yielding to her impulses the virility of prescotts character and his physical perfection stirred her she desired him and had boldly used such charms as she possessed in his subjugation misled by his gentleness she imagined him responsive and then muriel had appeared on the scene and the truth was plain to her when she saw his face light up at sight of the girl she had read warm love in his eager glance  now gertrude was crushed and humbled she had cheapened herself as she thought of it to this rancher only to find that he preferred another her punishment was severe but she felt that it was deserved and her ripening passion had turned to something very much like hate whether he had really had any hand in her brothers death was a point she would not calmly reason out though she had a halfconscious feeling that he could not be charged with this she wanted to think him base to believe in his guilt would be an excuse for making him suffer  while she walked she cast quick glances across the waste of grass looking for a mounted figure that did not appear until at last she turned with a start at the sound of footsteps as muriel came up  i saw you alone and thought i would join you muriel said  its a relief to be by oneself now and then gertrude answered with curt ungraciousness  one can understand that i tried to give harry a hint that our visit might be an intrusion when he talked of joining your father but he thought it would be some comfort for you to have your friends about you  he was some time in putting his idea into practise  we started as soon as we heard of your trouble said muriel we were in mexico then and as we had moved about a good deal there was some delay in our letters has your father decided to stay with the leslies  yes for a while it was of course impossible for us to remain with mr prescott  why could you not muriel asked with sparkling eyes  isnt it obvious after what you heard the man admit  muriel stopped the color creeping into her face which was filled with anger  its impossible that mr prescott could have had any connection with cyrils disappearance its wicked and cruel to suspect him  you seem strangely convinced of his innocence gertrude retorted with a somber glance at her we shall see by and by whether you or my father is right  they walked on slowly and shortly afterward two mounted figures appeared on the plain gertrude watched them draw near and then turned to her companion  the police we have been expecting them she said my father sent a message to the corporal after prescott had gone  then he will be deeply ashamed of his harshness before long muriel declared as she abruptly moved away  gertrude let her go with a cruel smile she thought she knew how matters stood and if the girl were suffering she had no pity for her then she waited until the police trotted by and afterward walked slowly toward the house on reaching it she met curtis coming out and he asked for a word with her  i understand you were the last person to see prescott when he left this place the other night he said  gertrude admitted it watching the man he looked disturbed as if he did not know what to think private stanton was sitting in his saddle with an expressionless face a few yards away but she imagined it was intended that he should hear her answers  well curtis resumed i have to ask what he said to you anyway so far as it bears on the business we have in hand you know why i was sent for  gertrude hesitated she was very angry with prescott and there was a statement he had made which would prove damaging to him if she repeated part of it without the rest she shrank from this course but her rancor against the man suddenly grew too strong for her  i suppose i must answer that  its your duty  then she said in a strained voice mr prescott told me he was going away  going away curtis looked astonished i guess you realize that this is a serious matter did he mention when  i understood it would be very soon gertrude looked at the man haughtily that is all i have to tell  she went into the house feeling that she had said enough and curtis motioned to his companion and rode away they had gone some distance when stanton turned to his superior  pretty significant what are you going to do about it he asked  ill have to apply for a warrant  you certainly will  well curtis went on this thing isnt quite so simple as it seems to begin with its my idea that miss jernyngham hasnt told us all she knows you want to remember that prescotts a goodlooking fellow with a taking manner i can see complications though i cant get the right drift of them  guess the matter will be worse mussed up if prescott lights out now that bardsleys gone down the line you cant get your warrant for a day or two  thats so curtis agreed ill make for the settlement and wire bardsley and our bosses at regina youll ride on and keep prescott in sightthough it would be better if you didnt let him know you were watching him when he clears take the trail behind him and send back word to sebastian soon as i get the warrant or instructions ill come after you  they separated and some time later stanton took up his station in a bluff which commanded a view of the prescott homestead lying hidden with his horse he saw the rancher drive up and disappear within the house prescott had been very busy during the past two days and had found strenuous application something of a relief he recognized that suspicion was centering on him and that he might expect a visit from the police but the only way of proving his innocence that he could see was to produce his supposed victim he foresaw that it might take a long while to find the man and he must make preparations for a lengthy absence the risk he ran in remaining until he had completed them was grave but there was a vein of dogged persistency in him and he would not go before he was ready  he had however other matters to think of miss jernyngham had turned against him after the confidence she had expressed he could not understand why she had done so muriel hurst however still believed in him which was a comforting thought though he would not permit himself to dwell on it he loved the girl but it seemed impossible that she should marry him there was so much against this the mode of life to which she had been accustomed his obscure position the prejudices of her relations he blamed himself for not struggling more determinedly against the charm she had exerted on him but it was too late to regret this now he must bear his trouble and try to think of her as seldom as possible which would be the easier inasmuch as the work that waited him would demand his close attention as soon as it grew dark that evening he must set off on his search for cyril jernyngham  dusk was falling when he rode away from the homestead with a couple of blankets and provisions for a few days strapped to his saddle though he could trust svendsen to look after things in his absence he was anxious and dejected and it was with keen regret that he cast a last glance across the sweep of shadowy stubble toward the lighted windows of the house all he saw belonged to him he had by patient labor in frost and scorching sun built up the farm and he was conscious of a strong love for it it was hard to go away an outcast branded with black suspicion leaving the place in anothers charge but there was no remedy  the sky was faintly clouded the moon which was near its setting obscured the prairie ran back dim and blurred the air was keen and still prescott thought he heard a soft beat of hoofs behind him he could however see nobody and he rode on faster heading for the house of a neighbor with whom he had some business near the trail to the settlement after a while he pulled up and listening carefully heard the sound again it looked as if he were being followed and he thought that if the police were on his trail they would expect him to make for the american frontier and to do that he must pass through or near sebastian if they believed this was his object it might save him trouble for he meant to ride north in search of jernyngham after calling at the farm  checking his horse he rode on without haste until it became obvious that the man behind was drawing up then he set off at a gallop behind the farm he meant to visit lay a belt of broken ground marked by scrub and scattered bluffs where it should not be difficult to evade his pursuer the staccato thud of the gallop would ring far through the still night air but this was of no consequence he was some distance ahead and his horse was fresh and powerful in a few minutes he believed that he was gaining and when he rode into sight of the little wooden house which showed up black against the sky with one dim light in it he was seized by a new idea a horse stood outside the door and he supposed the rancher had just returned the man was a friend of prescotts and believed in his innocence  larry he cried as he rode up and added when a shadowy figure came out you can send along your teams and do that breaking we were speaking of svendsen will pay you when youre through with it im off to the north  ah exclaimed the other sharply i guess i know what youre after it strikes me you should have gone before  he paused with a lifted hand as he heard the drumming of hoofs and prescott laughed  thats so i believe youll have a police trooper here in the next few minutes your horse is still saddled  yes ive just come back from gilloms  then get up and ride for the settlement mail an order for some harness or anything useful to regina by the night train when you get there you can let svendsen have the bill you had better go pretty fast and keep ahead of the trooper as long as you can i guess you understand  sure grinned the other and getting into the saddle rode away at a smart trot while prescott dismounted and led his horse quietly toward the nearest bluff  on reaching it he stopped and listening carefully heard the rancher riding down the trail to sebastian and another beat of hoofs that grew rapidly louder by and by he made out a dim mounted figure that pressed on fast across the shadowy waste and for a few anxious moments wondered whether the policeman would call at the house and discover its owners absence he passed on however and was presently lost in the darkness when the drumming of his horses hoofs gradually died away prescott mounted and rode hard toward the north it would he thought be an hour or two before the trooper found out his mistake the rancher would not betray him and there was a prospect of his getting clear away     chapter xiii  the construction camp   the light was fading when prescott walked into sight of the construction camp it was situated on the edge of a belt of a muskeg sprinkled with birches and small pines where the new railroad leaving the open country to the south ran up toward the great coniferous forest that fringes the northern portion of the prairie prescott had sold his horse at a lonely farm and he was now tired and hungry but he felt satisfied that he was on the right track and had succeeded in eluding the police curtis and private stanton were men of fixed ideas believing jernyngham to be dead they had no doubt merely made a few perfunctory inquiries at the nearest railroad camps moreover as they had reason for concluding that prescott would seek refuge across the american boundary they would concentrate their efforts on looking for him there accordingly he felt safe from pursuit  by and by he stopped to look about to the eastward all was gray a dim waste of grass dotted with shadowy trees but a vivid band of green still glowed on the western horizon in front lay a broad shallow basin streaked with filmy trails of mist between which came the wan gleam of little pools a causeway stretched out into the morass sprinkled with the indistinct figures of toiling men at its inner end where it left the higher ground a row of cars stood on a sidetrack and nearby there were ranged straggling lines of tents and wooden shacks wisps of blue smoke drifted across the swamp and a beam of strong white light streamed out from the electric headlamp of a locomotive the still air was filled with the clink of shovels the clang of flungdown rails and the sharp rattle of falling gravel  going on until he reached the camp prescott stopped beside a group of men sitting about a fire and loosed the heavy pack that galled his shoulders  if you can give me a place to lie down and a bit of supper boys id be obliged he said  two or three of them turned and looked at him without much curiosity they were strong brownfaced fellows dressed in old duck overalls and slatecolored shirts with shapeless hats and dilapidated kneeboots  why certainly responded one in a clean english intonation however as were paying for our board well have to invite you as the guest of the construction contractor but theres no reason you should be shy about accepting his hospitality sit down until shan li brings the grub along  heres a place said another want a job  i dont know yet prescott answered im looking for a friend of mine man of middle height with paleblue eyes and a curious twinkling smile he was wearing a green shirt of finer stuff than they generally sell at the settlements when i last saw him and i expect hed have a fresh scar on his head  there was signs of interest and amusement which suggested that prescott was on the right track  did he call himself kermode one of the men asked  prescott hesitated it was possible that some of them had heard of the jernyngham affair and he had no wish that they should connect him with it while he considered his answer the man with the english accent broke in  we neednt trouble about the point one names as good as another as our friend kermode who seems to have been a bit of philosopher remarked when they put him on the payroll  when i was back at nelson a smart policeman rode into the camp said another of the group wanted to know if we had seen the man youre asking for gave us quite a good description of him anyway i hadnt seen him then and when i struck him afterward i didnt send word to the police ive no use for those fellows theyre best left alone  then you know him prescott exclaimed eagerly  the man looked at his comrades and there was a laugh  oh yes said one of them we know him all right glad to meet a man whos a friend of his but if you expect a job here you dont want to mention it if another fellow of that kind comes along the boss will get after him with a gun  kermode the englishman explained is a man of happy and original thoughts i believe i might say he is unique  the conversation was interrupted by a steadily increasing rattle and a great light that moved swiftly blazed on the camp it faded as a ballasttrain rolled out upon the bank which traversed the swamp with a swarm of indistinct figures clinging to the low cars when it stopped the sides of the cars fell outward a big plow moved forward from one to another and broken rock and gravel pouring off went crashing and rattling down the slope the noise it made rang harshly through the stillness of the evening and when it ceased a whistle screamed and the clangor of the wheels began again as the engine backed the train away the blaze of the headlamp fell on an object lying half buried in the muskeg about sixty feet below the line and one of the men pointing to it touched prescotts arm  see what that is he said  prescott saw that it was what the railroad builders call a steel dump a metal wagon capable of carrying thirty or forty tons of ballast with an automatic arrangement for throwing out its load  how did it get there he asked  tell you after supper said the fellow theyre bringing it along  a whistle blew and prescott followed his companions into a shed built of railroad ties and galvanized iron it was lighted by kerosene lamps which diffused an unpleasant odor and fitted with rude tables and benches but the meal laid out in it was bountiful and varied pork hard steak fish from the lakes potatoes desiccated fruits and tea the shovelgang paid six dollars a week for their board and got good value as usual most of them were satisfied in fifteen minutes for in the west the rank and file eat with determined haste and when they trooped out prescott went back with his new friends to the fire taking out his pipe he made himself as comfortable as possible on a pile of gravel and tired with a long days march looked lazily about the strong light still blazed along the bank where hurrying men passed through the stream of radiance vanished into the shadows and appeared again there was a continuous rattling and clinking and roar of falling stones rails rang as they were moved and now and then hoarse orders came out of the darkness  after prescott had asked a few leading questions the men began to talk of kermode who had already left the camp and the rancher was able to put together the story of his doings there                                                    the muskeg was an unusually bad one it swallowed the rock the men dumped in logs brush and branches afforded no foundation and a long time elapsed before the engineers were satisfied about the base of the embankment the weather remained unusually hot until late in the fall and the contractor already behind time and anxious to make progress before the frost interfered with his work developed a virulent temper his construction foreman drove the men mercilessly spurring on the laggards with scathing words and occasionally using a heavy fist when they showed resentment the laborers nerves were worn raw their strength was exhausted but the muskeg must be filled and while carload after carload of rock and gravel was hurled down the line crept on  things were in this state when kermode reached the camp and on applying for work was given a shovel and made to use it in a strenuous fashion it appeared that he was not expert with the tool and the foremans most pointed remarks were generally addressed to him but he had a humorous manner which gained him friends once or twice to his comrades admiration he engaged his persecutor in a wordy contest and badly routed him which did not improve matters indeed his last victory proved a costly one because afterward when there was anything particularly unpleasant or dangerous to be done kermode was selected as it happened the risks that must be faced were numerous  kermode stood it for some weeks though he grew thin and his hands were often bleeding in spite of this his eyes still twinkled mischievously and when occasion demanded his retort was swift and edged with wit now and then he made reprisals for when as happened once or twice a load of gravel nearly swept the foreman down the bank kermode was engaged in the vicinity another time the bullying martinet was forced to jump into the muskeg where he sank to the waist in order to avoid a mass of ballast sent down before its descent was looked for  there was a difference of opinion about the cause of kermodes holding out some of his comrades said he must have meant to wait for the arrival of the pay car so as to draw his wages before he left others declared that this did not count with him and he stayed because he would not be driven out the englishman took the latter view for as he told prescott kermode once said to him i want the opposition to remember me when i quit  by degrees the foremans gibes grew less frequent kermode was more than a match for him and his barbed replies were repeated with laughter about the camp but his oppressor now relied on galling commands which could not be disobeyed kermodes companions sympathized with him and waited for the inevitable rupture which they thought would take a dramatic shape at length two big steel dump cars were sent up from the east and run backward and forward between the muskeg and a distant cutting where they were filled with broken rock this was deposited in places where the embankment needed the most reinforcing but after a while the foreman decided that the locomotive of the gravel train need not be detained to move the cars they could he said be pushed by hand and nobody was surprised when kermode was among the men chosen for the task  though the nights were getting cold the days were still very hot and those engaged in it found the work of propelling a steel car carrying about thirty tons of stone over rails laid roughly on a slight upward grade remarkably arduous this however did not content the foreman he took two men away and when those whom he left had been worked to exhaustion he changed them with the exception of kermode who was kept steadily at the task as a result he came to be looked on as leader of the gang and his companions took their instructions from him which the foreman concurred in because it enabled him to hold kermode responsible for everything that went wrong  then the pay car arrived and when wages were drawn the men awaited developments with interest but nothing unusual occurred until a week had passed kermode had had his hand crushed by a heavy stone and meant to rest it for a day or two but his persecutor drove him out to work he obeyed with suspicious meekness and toiled in the scorching sun all day but a few minutes before the signal to stop in the evening for which they were eagerly waiting the gang was ordered to run a loaded dump car to the end of the line the men were worn out short in temper and dripping with perspiration kermodes hand pained him and in trying to save it he had strained his shoulder but he encouraged the others and they slowly pushed the load along moving it a yard or two and stopping for breath the men on the bank were dawdling through the last few minutes waiting to lay down their tools and they offered the gang their sympathy as they passed then there was a change in their attitude as the foreman strode up the track  shove he ordered get a move on you have to dump that rock before you quit  they were ready to turn on him and kermodes eyes flashed but he spoke quietly to his men  push  a few more yards were covered the foreman walking beside the gang until they stopped for breath  get on he cried send her along you slobs  were pretty near the top of the grade kermode answered him quietly we want to go easy so as to stop her at the dumpingplace  the line when finished would cross the muskeg with a slight ascent but the bank sank as they worked at it and the track now led downhill toward its end the foreman failed to remember this in his vicious mood  are you going to call me down he roared mean to teach me my job if this crowds a sample of white men give me chinamen or niggers get on before you make me sick you slouching hogs  he became more insulting using terms unbearable even in a construction camp but kermode did not answer him  keep her going boys he said  they made another few yards gasping panting with dripping faces and then the work grew easier as they crossed the top of the ascent  push said kermode send her along  they looked at him in surprise it was getting dark but they could still see his face which was quietly resolute he evidently meant what he said and they obeyed him the big car began to move more freely and they waited for an order to slacken the pace but their leader seemed to be increasing his exertions and his eyes gleamed  he told us to push boys he reminded them rush her ahead  then comprehension dawned on them the foreman had dropped behind satisfied perhaps with bullying them but every man taxed his tired muscles for a last effort the wheels turned faster the men broke into a run and none of them was astonished when a warning cry rose behind them  go on shouted kermode hell hold me responsible you know what to do  men along the line called to them as they passed and they answered with a breathless yell the car was gathering speed and they kept it going there were further warnings but they held on until kermode raised his voice harshly  a good shove boys and let her go  they stopped exhausted but the dump rolled on with its heavy load of rock struck the guardbeams at the end of the track and smashed through them then with a crash and a roar the big steel car plunged down the slope plowing up the gravel hurling out massive stones a cloud of dust leaped about it there was a shrill ringing sound as an axle broke a last downward leap and with a mighty splash the dump came to rest half buried in the muskeg  kermode turned with a cheerful smile as the foreman ran up and the spectators knew that the time for words had passed nobody could remember who struck the first blow but kermodes left hand was injured and he clinched as soon as he could for a few minutes the men reeled about the track and then with a tense effort kermode pushed the foreman off the bank and went down with him the gravel was small and slippery lying at a steep slope and they rolled down still grappling with each other until there was a splash below a few moments later kermode painfully climbed the bank alone  i guess you had better go down and pull your boss out he said its pretty soft in the muskeg i believe he got his head in and by the way hes floundering it looks as if he couldnt see he paused and waved his hand in genial farewell goodnight boys im sorry i have to leave you but considering everything i think ill take the trail  then he turned and moved down the track vanishing into the growing darkness                                                    when the tale was finished prescott sat a while smoking thoughtfully he imagined that he had struck jernynghams trail all that he had heard was characteristic of the man  do you know where kermode went he asked  no guess he might have headed for a camp farther west ive heard theyre short of men  prescott thought this probable and determined to resume his search in the morning presently the gravel train came back and the stream of light from the headlamp blazing along the embankment rested on the halfburied dump then there was a roar as the plow flung the load off the cars and in the silence that followed one of the men got up  morning will come soon enough i guess its time for sleep he said     chapter xiv  on the trail   when prescott got up the next morning dawn was breaking across the muskeg there was frost in the air the freightcars on the sidetrack and the roofs of the shacks were white and a nipping breeze swept through the camp it was already filled with sounds of activityhoarse voices heavy footsteps the tolling of a locomotive bell and the rattle of wheelsand prescotts new friends were eating in a neighboring shed going in he was supplied with breakfast and when he left the table the englishman joined him  have you made up your mind whether you want a job or not he asked  prescott said he thought he would push on and the man looked at him deprecatingly  well he said we dont want to appear inhospitable but as things are run here youre the guest of the boss and since he didnt give the invitation there might be trouble if he noticed you  as it happens i want to get hold of kermode as soon as i can prescott answered  you shouldnt have much difficulty in finding him its hardly possible for a man of his gifts to go through the country without leaving a plain trail behind  prescott agreed with this he had not much doubt of kermodes identity and he thought his missing friend would give any acquaintances he made on his travels cause to remember him  theres a construction train starting west in about half an hour resumed the railroad hand if you get on board with the boys it will look as if you belonged to the gang  daylight had come when prescott clambered up on one of the long flat cars loaded with rails and ties and in a few minutes the train started it followed what was called a cutout line which worked round the muskeg and back to the main track through a country too difficult for the latter to traverse and for a while prescotts interest was occupied by its progress groups of men in brown overalls were seated on the rails which clanged musically in rude harmony with the clatter of the wheels a sooty cloud streamed back above them now and then blotting out the clusters of figures the cars swayed and shook and in view of the roughness of the line prescott admired the nerve of the engineer  the wind that whipped his face was cold and pierced the blanket he had flung over his shoulders but the sunshine was growing brighter and the mist in the hollows was rapidly vanishing as a rule the depressions were swampy and as they sped across them prescott could see the huge locomotive rocking while the rails which were spiked to ties thrown down on brush sank beneath the weight and sprang up again as the cars jolted by as they rushed down tortuous declivities the cars banged and canted round the curves while prescott held on tight his feet braced against a rail it was better when they joined the graded track and toward noon he was given a meal with the others at a camp where a bridge was being strengthened when they started again he lay down in his blanket where the sunshine fell upon him and the end of the car kept off the wind and lighting his pipe became lost in reflection  it was obvious that he must use every effort to find jernyngham and he thought he might succeed in this but what then to prove his innocence in which she already believed would not bridge the gulf between him and muriel hurst it seemed impossible that she should be willing to marry a working rancher yet he knew that he could not overcome his love for her there was pleasure as well as pain in remembering her frankness and gaiety and confidence in him and the charm of her beauty was strong he recalled the crimson of her lips the glow of warm color in her hair the brightness of her smile and the softness he had once or twice seen in her violet eyes then he drove these thoughts away to indulge in them would only make the selfdenial he must practise the harder  he next tried to occupy his mind with gertrude jernyngham for he was still without a clue to her disconcerting change of mood she had no great attraction for him but he had pitied her and found a certain pleasure in her society it was strange that after taking his view of her brothers fate against the one her father held she should suddenly turn upon him in bitter anger he was hurt at this particularly as he did not think the revelation that he had personated cyril accounted for everything however as it was unavoidable he thought he could bear miss jernynghams suspicion  he was disturbed in his reflections by a sudden jolt of the train as it stopped at a watertank getting down with the others he saw a man standing in the entrance of a halffinished wooden building the fellow looked like a mechanic and his short blueserge jacket and other details of his dress suggested that he was an englishman on speaking to him prescott learned that the train would be detained a while because a locomotive and some empty cars were coming down the line the man further mentioned that a number of railroad hands had been engaged in putting up the building until lately when they had been sent on somewhere else and prescott inquired if there had been a man among them who answered to his friends description  there was said the other dryly and called to somebody inside heres a fellow asking for kermode  bring him in replied a voice and prescott entered the building  it contained a pump and two large steel tanks near one of them a man was doing something with a drill but he took out his pipe and pointed to a piece of sacking laid on a beam  sit down and have a smoke he said you have plenty of time was kermode a friend of yours  prescott looked about the place he saw that it was a filtering station for the treatment of water unfit for locomotive use  thanks he responded i knew kermode pretty well but i neednt stop you  oh dont mind that grinned the other were not paid by the piece on this job besides theyve some chisels for us on your train and we havent got them yet  youre english arent you prescott asked are you stopping out here  not much exclaimed the other with scorn what dyou take me for theres more in life than whacking rivets and holding the caulker when a man has finished his work in this wilderness what has he to do theres no music halls no nothing only the dismal prairie that makes your eyes sore to look at  prescott had heard other englishmen express themselves in a similar fashion and he laughed  if thats what you think of the country why did you come here  big wages replied the first man entering the building funny isnt it that when you want good work done you have to send for us every machineshop in your countrys full of laborsaving and ingenious tools but when you build bridges with them they fall down and ive seen tanks that wouldnt hold water  oh well said prescott divided between amusement and impatience this isnt to the point i understand kermode was here with you  he was came in on a construction train looking for a job and when we saw he was from the old country we put him on  you put him on dont these things rest with the division boss  the man grinned  you dont understand were specialists and get what we ask for sent the boss word we wanted an assistant and as wed picked one up all he had to do was to put him on the payroll  and did kermode get through his work satisfactorily  for a while he was a handy man might have made a boilermaker if hed took to it young when we had nothing else to keep him busy hed cut tobacco for us and set us laughing with his funny talk  this was much in keeping with jernynghams character but the man went on  when wed made him a pretty good hand with the file and drill he got bill to teach him how to caulk he shaped firstrate so one day we thought wed leave him to it while we went off for a jaunt bill had bought an old shotgun from a farmer and wed seen a lot of wild hens about  it would be close timeyou can only shoot them in october but i suppose that wouldnt count  not a bit said the boilermaker all we were afraid of was that a train might come in with the boss on board but we chanced it we told kermode he might go round the tankplate landingsthe laps you knowwith the caulker and give them a rough tuck in ready for us to finish and then we went off well we didnt shoot any wild hens though bill got some pellets in his leg and when we came back we both felt pretty bad when we saw what kermode had done bill couldnt think of names enough to call him and hes good at it  what had he done  hammered the inside of the landings down with a gullet you could put your finger in too much energys your mates complaint nobody could tell what that man would do when he gets steam up understand were boilermaking specialists sent out on awkward jobs and hed put in work that would disgrace a farmer for all that it was bills fault for speaking his mind too freehe got thrown behind the tank  i wasnt contradicted the other he jumped at me unexpected when the spanner hit him and i fell  prescott laughed remembering how jernyngham had driven a truculent rabble out of sebastian he could imagine the scene in the shed but it was evident that the boilermakers bore him no malice  after all said the first one when we cooled off and got talking quiet he said hed better go and we parted friendly  do you know where he went  i dont we didnt care wed had enough of him first thing was to put that caulking right and we spent three or four days driving the landings downyou can do a lot with good soft steel anyhow when we filled up the timesheet showing how far wed got on with the job there was a nasty letter from the engineer wanted to know what wed been playing at and said hed have us sent home if we couldnt do better  while prescott thanked them for the information a bell began to toll and there was a rattle of wheels hurrying out he saw a locomotive approaching the tank and men clambering on to the cars in which he had traveled soon after he joined them the train rolled out of the sidetrack and sped west clattering and jolting toward the lurid sunset that burned upon the edge of the plain jackpines and scattered birches stood out hard and black against the glare the rails blazed with crimson fire and faded as the ruddy light changed to cold green and there was a sting of frost in the breeze  they dropped a few men at places where work was going on stopped for water and crawled at slow speed over halffinished bridges and lengths of roughly graded line after nightfall it grew bitterly cold and prescott lying on the boards with his blanket over him shivered half asleep for the most part darkness shut them in but every now and then lights blazed beside the line and voices hailed the engineer as the pace decreased then while the whistle shrieked ballast cars on a sidetrack and tall iron frameworks slipped by and they ran out again into the silent waste prescott was conscious of a continuous jolting which shook him to and fro he thought he heard a confused altercation among his companions at the end of the car and the clang of wheels and the shaking rails rang in measured cadence in his ears then the sounds died away and he fell into a heavy sleep  it was noon the next day when he alighted aching all over where the line ran into a deep hollow between firclad hills a stream came flashing through the gorge and at the mouth of it shacks and tents and small frame houses straggled up a rise with a wooden church behind them farther up the hollow was filled with somber conifers and the hills above it ran back ridge beyond ridge into the distance then looking very high and far away a vast chain of snowy summits was etched against a sky of softest blue those that caught the light gleamed with silvery brightness but part of the great range lay in shadow steeped in varying hues of ethereal gray from north to south as far as the eye could follow the serrated line of crag and peak swept on majestically  tired as he was prescott felt the impressiveness of the spectacle but he had other things to think about and slipping away from the railroad hands he turned toward a rude frame hotel which stood among the firs beside the river rows of tall stumps spread about it farther back lay rows of logs diffusing a sweet resinous fragrance through a gap between the towering trunks one looked up the wild forestshrouded gorge and the litter of old provision cans general refuse and discarded boots could not spoil the beauty of the scene prescott asked for a room and sitting outside after dinner he gathered from some men who were not working the story of kermodes next exploit their accounts of it were terse and somewhat disconnected but prescott was afterward able to amplify them from the narrative of a more cultured person                                                    kermode had been unloading rails all day and he was standing on the veranda one evening when a supply train from the east was due it appeared that he had renewed his wardrobe at the local store and invariably changed his clothes when his work was finished this was looked upon as a very unusual thing and his companions thought it even more curious that he had not been known to enter the bar of the hotel its proprietor was emphatic on the point a number of railroad hands lounged about attired as usual in their working clothes  at length the tolling of a bell broke through the silence of the woods and the train ran in the rutted street became crowded with unkempt thirsty men and in a few minutes the hotel was filled with their harsh voices last of all appeared a girl with a very untidy man carrying a bag beside her she walked with a limp and looked jaded and rather frightened her light cloak was thick with dust and locomotive cinders which clung to the woolly material her face was hot and anxious but attractive  thank you she said to her companion opening her purse when they reached the veranda  shucks you can put that back returned the man with an awkward gesture and then lifting the bag carefully replaced the end of a garment that projected through the bottom ill carry the grip in for you but you want to be careful with the thing seems to have got busted when the rails fell on it  the girl passed through a wirenet door that he opened and kermode following waited for several minutes after her companion had rung a bell then a man in a white shirt and smart clothes appeared  can i send a telegram from here to drummond she asked him  no the wires wont run into that district until next year  how can i get there  i guess youll have to hire a team at the liverystable take you about three days to get through  the girl looked dismayed  then can you give me a room tonight she asked  sorry said the man were full up with the railroad boys the waitresses have to camp in the kitchen dont know if anybody can take you in the track bosses have got all the rooms in town  he disappeared and the girl sat down looking very forlorn and disconsolate her voice was english and she had obviously traveled a long distance in an open car on the supply train kermode felt sorry for her he took off his hat as he approached  if you dont mind waiting a few minutes ill see if i can find you quarters he said  she glanced at him suspiciously with a heightened color which he thought a favorable sign but her eyes grew more confident and when she agreed he withdrew as a man of experience who had been a favorite with women he was however guilty of an error of judgment during his search a smart young woman with whom he was on friendly terms managed a cigar store and it is possible that she would have taken some trouble to oblige him but his request that she should offer shelter to another girl whose acquaintance he seemed to have made in a most casual manner was received with marked coldness kermode indeed felt sorry he had suggested it when he left the store and set out for a shack belonging to the widow of a man killed on the line she was elderly and grim a strict methodist from the east who earned a pittance by mending the workmens clothes after catechizing kermode severely she gave a very qualified assent and returning to the hotel he found the girl anxiously waiting for him she looked relieved when he reported his success  i had better go at once she said you think mrs jasper will take me in  kermode picked up the bag  to tell the truth she only promised to have a look at you then he smiled reassuringly ive no doubt therell be no difficulty when she has done so  the girl followed him and as they went slowly up the street while all the loungers watched them she gave kermode a confused explanation her name was helen foster and she had come from england to join a brother who had taken up a farm near drummond which prescott had heard was a remote settlement her brother had told her to notify him on her arrival at winnipeg and await instructions but on board the steamer she had met the wife of a railroad man engaged on the new line who had offered her company to a point in the west from which helen could reach her destination on arriving at the railroad mans station he had sent her on by the supply train  a little distance up the street kermode stopped outside a shed in which a fellow of unprepossessing appearance was rubbing down a horse his character as kermode knew was no better than his looks  i must see the liveryman he told the girl and when he had sent the hostler for him the proprietor came out  the roundtrip to drummond will take six days and youd want a team he said id have to charge you thirty dollars  kermode looked dubious his companion dismayed she had three dollars and a few cents  can you drive this lady there kermode asked  i cant jim would have to go  i think not said kermode firmly ill see you about a saddlehorse in the morning he turned to the girl well go along again  a few minutes later they reached the widows shack and kermode waited some time after his companion was admitted as she did not come out he concluded that mrs jasper was satisfied and returned to the hotel where he was freely bantered by the loungers  that will do boys he said at length if theres any more of this kind of talk the man who keeps it up will get badly hurt  they saw that he meant it and as he was popular they left him in peace     chapter xv  miss fosters escort   on the morning after he met helen foster kermode sought a foreman with whom he was on good terms  i want to quit work for a week he said abruptly  sorry i cant give you leave and the boss went down the line yesterday if you let up before you see him its quite likely he wont take you back  if he doesnt i wont be very grieved throwing fortyfoot rails about all day palls on one but what about my wages up to date  thats a matter for the payclerk when he comes along if you quit without notice hell make trouble  kermode considered this but he had about ten dollars in his pocket and he was not of provident nature he decided that something must be left to chance though the thought that he might have handled heavy rails for the contractors exclusive benefit was strongly distasteful walking across the town he paid a visit to miss foster  can you ride he asked her  i havent ridden for years  perhaps you could manage a steady horse which wouldnt go faster than a walk he suggested  yes then she hesitated but horses are expensive and i have very little money left somehow it seems to disappear rapidly in canada  thats an annoying trick it has kermode laughed however you had better start for drummond this morning and ill go with you  the girl looked dubious she knew nothing about him but his manner and appearance were in his favor and her position was far from pleasant mrs jasper who had already presented what appeared to be an extortionate bill seemed by no means anxious to keep her and it might be a long time before she could communicate with her brother how she was to hold out until he came to her assistance she could not tell  thank you she said gathering her courage and after promising that he would be back in an hour kermode went away  he was a man who acted on impulse and as a rule the more unusual a course was the better it pleased him in spite of her lameness miss foster was attractive which perhaps had its effect though he was mainly actuated by compassion and the monotony of his tracklaying task he did not think the settlement in which there were very few women was the kind of place in which she could comfortably remain particularly if her means were exhausted presently he met the liverystable keeper driving in his buggy and motioned to him to pull up  how much will you charge for the hire of the roan to go to drummond he asked and the man named his charge  ill give you eight dollars now and the balance when i come back  no sir replied the other firmly you might fix up to stay there  will an order on the railroad payclerk satisfy you  it wont if you want the horse you must put the money down  then i cant make the deal  the man drove on but kermode was not to be daunted by such a difficulty besides he had noticed jim the hired man dawdling about the outside of the stable when the buggy was out of sight he accosted him  i want the roan in half an hour he said i see you have mrs leavers saddle here and as shes away you had better put it on im going to take the lady you saw with me to drummond  spose you have seen the boss about it  you must have noticed me talking to him kermode replied curtly bring the horse along to mrs jaspers as soon as youre ready  then he returned to the hotel and wrote a note which he gave the bartender instructing him to let the proprietor of the liverystable have it when he came in for dinner after this he succeeded in borrowing a small tent and when he had supplied himself with provisions he hurried toward the widows shack the horse was already there and when he had strapped on the folded tent and miss fosters bag he helped her to mount and set off carrying his blankets and stores in a pack on his back he showed no sign of haste and chatted gaily though he was anxious to get out of the town as soon as possible because he did not know when the stablekeeper would return  it was a clear morning the girl looked brighter after her nights rest and the fresh air brought a fine color into her face kermode kept her laughing with his light chatter but he was nevertheless glad when they reached the shadow of the pines where they could travel faster without attracting attention after half an hours rapid walking he left the trail which ran on toward drummond for a days journey before it stopped at a ranch and turned down into the valley he thought it might be wiser to keep to the south of the line he would be expected to take though this would entail the crossing of rougher country reaching the edge of a stream he stopped and regarded it with some concern it ran fast between great boulders and looked deep but as there was no sign of a better crossing he warned the girl to hold on and led the horse in  after a few paces he sank above his knees and found it hard to keep his footing and the horses head upstream the roan was slipping badly among the stones and the hem of his companions skirt was getting wet he was pleased to notice that she did not look unduly alarmed  well be across in another minute or two he said as cheerfully as he could  she smiled at him rather dubiously and at the next step he sank deeper and dragged the horse round as he clung to the bridle the roan plunged savagely and the water rippled about kermodes waist as he struggled for a foothold on the slippery stones with a desperate effort he managed to find firmer bottom and soon came out on a strip of shingle stopping there for a few moments he gathered breath while the girl looked about they were in the bottom of a deep gorge filled with the sound of running water and sweet resinous scents here the torrent flashed in bright sunshine there it flowed streaked with foam through dim shadow while somber pines towered above it there was no sound or sign of human life they had entered the gates of the wilderness  where do we go next the girl asked  up this slope said kermode then among the pines across the hills and high plains into a lonely land i dont suppose well see a house until we get to drummond  do you know the way  i dont kermode said cheerfully ive never been here before but im accustomed to traveling about the prairie where trails are scarce you dont look daunted  there was a hint of pleasurable excitement in his companions laugh  oh she replied adventures appeal to me and ive never met with any for three years since my brother left ive led a life of drudgery and before that half the pleasures i might have had were denied me by an accident  recognizing a kindred nature kermode looked sympathetic she was evidently alluding to her lameness which must prove a heavy handicap to a girl of the active sanguine temperament he thought she possessed  in a way it was a great adventure for you to come out here alone over the new road he said  i thought so last night she confessed with a smile when i reached the settlement and found i could get no farther i was really scared now however all my fears have gone i suppose its the sunshine and this glorious air  well we had better get on im afraid youll have to walk a while  she let him lift her down with no sign of prudishness or coquetry and he led the horse uphill while she followed her attitude pleased him because he had no desire for philandering although he was content to act as protector and guide still while he adapted his pace to the girls he thought about her her rather shabby attire and scanty baggage hinted that she had not been used to affluence but she showed signs of possessing a vigorous welltrained mind and he decided that she must have been a teacher  when they reached the top of the ascent she mounted and they went on among scattered clumps of pines and across a tableland as fast as he could travel because it seemed prudent to place as long a distance as possible between them and the settlement he had left the place with a valuable horse and saddle which he had not paid for and he was very dubious whether the liverystable keeper would be satisfied with the promises he had left accordingly he only stopped for half an hour at noon and evening was near when he helped the girl down and picketed the horse beside a small birch bluff and set up the tent  there are provisions in my pack and you might lay out supper but i dont think well make a fire tonight he said ill be back in about half an hour i want to see what lies beyond the top of yonder ridge  she let him go and he climbed between slender birches to the summit of a long rise where he lay down and lighted his pipe from his lofty position he commanded a wide sweep of countryhills whose higher slopes were still bathed in warm light valleys filled with cool blue shadow straggling ranks of somber pines the air was sharp and wonderfully bracing the wilderness across which he could wander where he would lured him on irresponsible and impatient of restraint as he was he delighted in the openness and solitude for all that he concentrated his gaze on one particular strip of bare hillside at its foot ran the gorge they had crossed but it had now grown narrow and precipitous a deep chasm wrapped in shadow he did not think a horse could be led down into it which was consoling because if any pursuit had been attempted it would follow the opposite side near which a trail ran  after a while his vigilance was rewarded and he smiled when three very small figures of mounted men appeared on the hillslope they were going back disappointed and he did not think he had much to fear from them wages were high about the settlement where everybody was busy and the liveryman would no doubt find the search too costly to persist in when the horsemen had vanished he returned to the camp and miss foster glanced at him keenly  suppers quite ready you have been some time she said what did you see from the top  mountains woods and valleys they were well worth looking at in the sunset light  and what else as you live in this country you didnt go up for the view  kermode saw that she was suspicious and thought her too intelligent to be put off with an excuse  ill admit that i wasnt greatly surprised to see three men a long way off they were riding back to the settlement and i dare say they were angry as well as tired  ah she said you wouldnt light a fire though you have a package of tea here and theres a spring nearby you thought it wouldnt be prudent  i did think something of the kind but wont you begin your supper what shall i hand you  wait a little you havent told me very much yet then her eyes sparkled with amusement mr kermode id better say that my brother will be responsible for the expenses of this journey i suppose you havent paid for the horse  its unfortunately true the trouble was that your brother lives a long way off and you led me to believe that your money was running out  i have she said calmly fifty cents left  kermode began on a sandwich she handed him  and ive three or four dollars you see our difficulty needed a drastic remedy  but you were at work on the railroad i understand wages are high  thats so but its some time since the pay car came along  but you will get what is due you when you go back  have another sandwich said kermode you have made them very well then seeing that she meant to have an answer he added im not going back  a little color crept into her face as she looked at him kermode had for a time led a dissipated life but there had been a change during the last few months he had practised abstinence and in new surroundings found it easier than he had expected severe labor had healed and hardened him his brown skin was clear his paleblue eyes were bright and steady his figure was spare and finely lined  so she said you sacrificed your wages to assist a stranger  he made her a whimsical bow  id like to think well be better acquainted before we part  but what will you do now  oh he responded lightly thats hardly worth talking about ill strike something so long as youre pretty active theres generally work to be had and when it grows monotonous you pull out and go on again  miss foster mused  after all she said life must have a good deal to offer a strong man with the ability to make the most of things he can set off when he likes in search of new and interesting experiences  it has its drawbacks now and then declared kermode smiling anyway you neednt imagine youre shut off from everything of the kind you took a big risk and faced a startling change when you came out here  so i felt though i had misgivings the thought of it drew me  i understand you have courage the greatest gift and you felt circumscribed at home no doubt the love of adventure isnt confined to one sex its a longing many of us cant overcome but it doesnt seem to meet with general sympathy and its apt to get one into difficulties  yes miss foster assented with some bitterness particularly a woman  after that she went on with her meal while dusk crept up about the lonely camp the sky was pale green in the west and the hills stood out against it black and calm not a breath of wind was stirring and it was very still except that out of the distance came the murmur of falling water when the air grew damper kermode brought her a blanket which she wrapped about her shoulders and they talked on for an hour in a casual manner then he got up  you will be quite safe in the tent he said ive found a comfortable berth in the wood well get off as soon as its light tomorrow  he disappeared into the shadows and she noticed that he had left her the two blankets he had brought from the settlement she hesitated about taking them both but decided not to call him back a little later she entered the tent while kermode scraped out a hollow in a bank of fallen leaves and went to sleep  the grass was white with frost when miss foster left the tent in the morning but a fire of branches crackled cheerfully nearby and kermode was busy with a fryingpan a light cloud of smoke rose into the still cold air and day was breaking on the eastern horizon  this looks pretty good he said taking out a greasy cake and several strips of pork if you will make the tea ill water the horse  he was back in a few minutes his companion enjoyed the simple meal and when it was finished they resumed the march during most of the day their pathway led over high treeless ridges which lay in bright sunshine though a delicate haze dimmed the encircling hills then they dipped to a valley where they had trouble among the timber and the girl was forced to dismount the winter gales had swept the forest and great pines lay piled in belts of tangled ruin through which kermode found it difficult to lead the horse while as they floundered over branches and through crackling brush his companions limp grew more pronounced afterward there were several rapid creeks to be forded and kermode was wet and miss foster very tired when they camped at sunset in a grove of spruce little was said during the evening meal and soon after it was over the girl sought her tent while kermode found a restingplace among the withered sprays at the foot of a tree  they spent the next morning toiling up a long ascent and from its summit a prospect of majestic beauty burst upon them the great peaks had grown nearer the air was clear and the girl sat rapt in the saddle gazing at the vast snowfields that glittered with ethereal brilliance very high up against a cloudless sky then the wonderful blue coloring of the shadows streaking the white slopes caught her glance and she found it unutterably lovely kermode however had an eye for other things and carefully searched the wide valley that stretched away beneath them  what are you looking for the girl asked at length  smoke i thought i saw a faint streak but it has gone i suppose you didnt notice it  oh no she told him with a smile im afraid i shouldnt have noticed such a commonplace thing even if it had been very plain  he made a sign of comprehension  then what have you seen he asked  unapproachable stainless whiteness touched with an unearthly glory that daunts the mind then her expression changed but the sight is too overpowering to talk about i would have been more useful had i looked for smoke as that would mean a house  kermode nodded  we have stores enough for another meal or two and had better get on i believe ive kept pretty near the line i was told to take but id be glad to see the first ranch in the drummond district by supper time  they went down into the valley struggling through belts of timber and clumps of brush until they reached a broad expanse of grass broken by small bluffs after camping for a meal they pushed on steadily while the girl grappled with a growing fatigue until the white peaks faded into dusky blue and the waste grew shadowy kermode had seen no sign of life and he was getting anxious when as they approached a bluff he pulled up the horse  listen he exclaimed i think i heard something  there was silence for a moment or two and then he caught a soft drumming and a rattle that might have been made by wheels  yes he said its a team and wagon  the sound grew plainer and when kermode shouted an answer came out of the gathering darkness then a moving shape appeared from behind the bluff and a minute or two later the newcomer pulled up his team  well he said what do you want  tom cried the girl excitedly  the man sprang down and kermode needed no explanation after his companion had dismounted and run forward he stood quietly holding the horse until she beckoned him  this is mr kermode who brought me here she said my brother tom foster  indebted to you responded the man i was driving home when you shouted my place is about six miles off if youll follow ill take my sister in the wagon  kermode thought it better that she should explain the reason for their journey and he got into the saddle and contented himself with keeping the vehicle in sight until it stopped at a wooden house that stood near a sod stable and rude log barn when he entered the dwelling after putting up the horse the lamp was lighted and the stove burning he saw that foster was a young man with a goodhumored brown face  i understand that i owe you more than i thought at first he said helen seems to have been pretty awkwardly situated when you appeared on the scene sit down and smoke while i get supper  they talked gaily during the meal  is there any means of sending back the horse i brought kermode asked after a while  ive been thinking about that foster replied  i have a neighbor who is going east on business hell strike the new line where you left it and hell be glad to have the horse  then they talked about other matters but when the men sat smoking some time later foster said cordially  youll stay here a while  kermode said that he would remain a few days  where will you make for then his host asked theres nothing doing round here except a little cattleraising  for the mountains i think i hear the railroad people are busy in the passes but ill try to strike something softer than handling rails  i can fix that foster declared theyve been advertising for haulage tendersthere are a lot of piles and building logs they want brought in now ive two good horses ive not much use for and id be glad to let you have them you could bring them back when the frost stops work  thanks said kermode whats your idea of shares  the rancher declared that he did not expect a share but when kermode insisted they arrived at a satisfactory understanding and soon after helen appeared the party broke up  kermode spent three or four pleasant days with his new friends and when he left the ranch one morning leading two strong horses helen foster walked with him some distance up the valley she had not known him long enough to recognize his failings which were plentiful but his virtues were obvious and she knew that she would miss him  so you are going out on the trail again she said where will it lead you  that he answered with a gay laugh is more than i can tell no doubt to fresh adventures and strange experiences  but you know your first stoppingplace the railroad camp when you have finished your work there you could come here again and rest a while  no he said more gravely ill send your brother his horses but i dont think ill come back its nice to feel that we have been pretty good friends but it might spoil any pleasant impression im leaving if you saw too much of me besides im a wanderer the long trail beckons  it runs through swamps and many rough places into the lonely wilds arent you afraid of weariness  kermode smiled falling into her mood  you may remember that there are compensations he said glimpses of glory on the untrodden heights its true that one never gets there but they lead one on  but you can see them from the valley  no the farmers eyes are fixed on the furrow he must follow the plow his crop and his stock are nearer him he cannot see past them the wanderers mind is free  when you had that glimpse of glory you turned away and looked for household smoke  there you have me he laughed inconsistent wasnt it but were only human one needs rest and food  helen changed the subject  well she declared im grateful and if its any comfort you wont be forgotten  he stopped the restive horses  thats good to hear he told her but the ground is rough ahead and you have come some way  goodby she said and gave him her hand  he held it for a moment and then getting into the saddle turned and swung off his hat after that he rode on into the waste leading one horse and helen foster watched him for a while before she went back slowly and thoughtfully to the ranch     chapter xvi  the missionarys ally   on reaching the railroad camp kermode was engaged by the contractor to haul in logs cut in a neighboring forest for constructional purposes the line ran into a wild valley clinging to the rocks that formed one side of it with a torrent brawling hoarsely among the stones beneath above rose vast slopes streaked in some places with small firs in others ground to a smooth scarp by sliding snow farther back were glaciers and a chain of glittering peaks  the mouth of the valley had been laid out as the site of a future town but so far it was occupied by rows of tents and rude wooden shacks inhabited by the construction gangs a large proportion of them were orderly wellconducted men industrious immigrants who had seized the first opportunity for getting work small farmers attracted by high wages skilled artisans there were however some of a rougher type and the undesirable element was as usual well represented on the whole the camp was sober largely because no licenses had been issued though this did not prevent men who came up from other points from bringing liquor in and the authorities suspected another source of supply  kermode had little trouble with his work which he found profitable and he rapidly made friends among them was a young presbyterian missionary whom he met for the first time on the hillside engaged on a squared log with a big jackplane he wore kneeboots and a threadbare suit of gray while his hat had suffered from exposure to the weather kermode stopped his team nearby and the clergyman looked around  if you have a good eye you might tell me whether this chamfers running true he said  you want a bit off here kermode laid his finger on the spot except for that its good  the clergyman sat down and pulled out a tobacco pouch  ill attend to it presently but i feel im entitled to a rest take a smoke youre not paid on time  im not sure it would matter if i were kermodes eyes twinkled as he filled his pipe an idea of the kind you suggested doesnt go far in a construction camp unless of course a foreman happens to be about however you made one rash statement didnt you  im afraid i make a good many replied the clergyman goodhumoredly but you are right it would be very rash to claim all that one was entitled to in other words ones deserts youre mr kermode i believe you must know my name is ferguson  kermode bowed  what are you going to do with this log he asked  its to be a doorpost in the new church i wonder if you would be willing to haul it in  kermode said that he would be glad to do so  you encourage me to go a little farther ferguson continued building a church is a costly proposition  so i should imagine i cant speak from experience kermode was generally liberal and he took out some money i think you ought to let me off with this as i dont belong to your flock  its a generous contribution better than the excuse there are i may remind you many kinds of sheep and the outward difference is often marked since youre from the old country you can take the little cheviot and the ponderous shropshire as examples you see the drift of this  that theyre all sheep ive noticed however that they wear a good many different brands  ah the pity of it after all a shepherd has his human weaknesses perhaps hes too fond of using his private mark or the stamp of his guild  that kermode smiled is a handsome admission anyway you have no rival in shepherding the boys here and taking us all round we need it but can you raise building funds on the spot  oh no i went to ontario this summer and spent a month begging from people who have very little to spare the response was generousive a carload of shiplap lumber coming out but you may understand how that adds to ones responsibility  its obvious i suppose you know youre up against a strong opposition  thats true unfortunately the clergyman looked thoughtful theres one group the mitcham crowd who would like to run me out the fellows piling up money by smuggling in liquor he and his friends are depraving the camp they must be stopped  its a big thing for one man to undertake it may wreck your mission  fergusons eyes sparkled  the risk mustnt count one cant shut ones eyes to what those fellows are doing but i want backers will you give me your support  thats more than i can consistently promise however ill look on and see you get fair play if the opposition hit below the belt i may take a hand in  thanks responded ferguson and kermode went on with his team  he was favorably impressed by the young missionary and kept the promise he had made though it now and then involved him in difficulties with his comrades the carload of lumber duly arrived and with the help of men who gave their labor after their hard days work was done the church was raised by the light of flaring blastlamps which the contractor allowed by day ferguson worked at it alone and the building steadily grew into shape but as the weather got colder trouble broke out in camp men engaged on the higher portions of the line were laid off by snow and frost and when the cost of their board ran on their tempers got short there were dismissals and as working hours diminished the gangs were driven harder friends began to quarrel over games of chance and the violence they displayed was often accounted for by indulgence in smuggled liquor  ferguson however was making progress gaining staunch adherents here tacit sympathizers there though the opposition saw to it that several had reason to regret their joining him kermode took no open part in the struggle but watched it interestedly  at length one nipping morning he left his tent with a shiver before it was light and busied himself about his horses with a lantern in their rude branch and bark shelter winter was beginning in earnest and a bitter wind had raged all night covering gorge and hillside deep with snow but this would make his hauling easier when he had broken out a trail he plowed through the snow in the darkness and the threatening dawn had broken when he came down the hillside with the ends of three or four big logs trailing behind his jumpersled the shacks and tents were white in the hollow over which there floated a haze of thin blue smoke the rapid creek that flowed past them showed in leadencolored streaks among the ice and somber pines rose in harsh distinctness from the hillside  then the halfcovered frame of the church caught kermodes eye something was wrong with it the skeleton tower looked out of the perpendicular and on his second glance its inclination seemed to have increased the snow however was clogging the front of his sled and he set to work to scrape it off while he was thus engaged there was a sharp ripping sound and then a heavy crash and swinging around he saw that the tower had collapsed where it had stood lay a pile of broken timber and planks and beams were strewn about the snow  kermode urged his team downhill and when a group of men came running up to meet him he recognized ferguson some distance in front of them the mans face showed how heavy the blow had been  it looks bad im very sorry said kermode when they reached the wrecked building  im afraid we cant get things straight until spring and i dont know how ill raise the money then declared ferguson a good deal of the lumber seems destroyed and ive levied pretty heavily on every friend ive got then he tried to assume a philosophic tone well i suppose this is the result of impatience there were spikes i didnt put in because i couldnt wait for them and some tenons were badly cut it blew hard last night and there must have been a big weight of snow on the new shingling  i dont think youre right kermode said dryly and turned to a bridgecarpenter who stood nearby whats your idea  the thrust of what roof theyd got up wouldnt come on the beams that gave rejoined the man theres something here i dont catch on to  just so said kermode suppose you take a look at the kingposts and stringers well clear this fallen lumber out of the way boys  they set to work and in an hour the sound and damaged timber had been sorted into piles then when the foundations were exposed kermode and the carpenter examined a socket in which a broken piece of wood remained  this has been a blamed bad tenon the mechanic remarked the shoulders werent butted home  im afraid thats true i made it ferguson admitted but kermode laying his finger on the rent wood looked up at his companion  for all that should it have given way as it has done  ill tell you better when we find the beam it belonged to  it took them some time and then the carpenter turned to ferguson  you marked this tenon off before you cut it did you run the saw past your line  no said ferguson with a start thats certain i dressed up to the mark afterward with a chisel  the carpenter looked at kermode meaningly  guess youre right see herehe indicated the broken stumptheres a sawcut running well inside his mark now that tenon was a bit too small anyway and when theyd notched her she hadnt wood enough left to hold up the weight  there were exclamations from the others standing round in the snow but kermode glanced at ferguson his face grew darkly red but with an effort he controlled his anger  who can have done this thing he asked  theres no direct evidence to show but ive my suspicions kermode said its dangerous to interfere with peoples business particularly when it isnt quite legitimate you must have known you ran a risk  do you think i should have let that stop me ferguson asked with sparkling eyes  thats a matter of opinion kermode rejoined perhaps you had better wait and think the thing over when you cool off ive some logs to haul in  he moved off with his team and went on with his work all day but when night came he attended by special invitation a meeting held in a tent that flapped and strained in the boisterous wind half a dozen men were present steady and rather grim toilers with saw and shovel and though two or three had been born in ontario all were of scottish extraction their hard faces wore a singularly resolute expression when kermode entered  boys he said before we begin id better mention that taking a part in a church assembly is a new thing to me  one or two of them frowned at this his levity was not in keeping with the occasion  yere here and well listen to your opinion if ye hae one said their leader jock is for raiding mitchams shack and firing him and the other scoundrel out of camp  i see objections mitcham has a good many friends and if he held you off youd have made a row for nothing besides compromising mr ferguson  theres reason in that another remarked  then continued kermode you cant connect mitcham with the wrecking of your church  im thinking the connections plain enough for us weel we ken  knowing a thing is not sufficient you want proof and if you go ahead without it youll put yourselves in the wrong this is not the time to alienate popular sympathy  weel said the leader hae ye a plan  kermode lighted his pipe and after a few moments answered thoughtfully  i hear that mitcham long bill and libby will take the trail tomorrow with bills team and sledhes laid off work because of the snow they were away three or four days once or twice before and when they came back a number of the boys got on a highclass jag and there was trouble in camp i dare say you can put the things together  sure declared one who had not spoken yet where do we butt in  this is my suggestionhalf a dozen picked men will meet mitcham coming home and seize the sled if its load is what i suspect somebody will ride off for sergeant inglis on my horse and youll have a guard ready to bring the sled to camp and hold the liquor until the police arrive im inclined to think you can leave the rest to them  a harsh smile crept into the faces of the listeners and their leader nodded gravely  we cannot do better it will work  the plan was duly put into execution and one bitter night kermode and several others plodded up a frozen creek it had been snowing hard for the last few hours and he could scarcely see his companions through the driving flakes while the wail of the wind in the pines above drowned the soft sound of their footsteps kermode was tired and very cold and could not have explained clearly what had induced him to accompany the expedition adventure however always appealed to him and he was sorry for ferguson who had he thought been very shabbily treated kermode had a fellowfeeling for anybody in difficulties  after a while the snow ceased and they could dimly see the dark pines climbing the steep banks that shut them in it was obvious that if mitchams party had entered the deep hollow they could not well get out of it the expedition had only to go on or wait until it met them but kermode did not envy the man whose duty it would be to ride across the open waste to the lonely post where sergeant inglis might be found resting however was out of the question they must move to keep from freezing and though the snow began again they plodded on with heads lowered to meet the blast that drove the stinging flakes into their faces  at length the leader stopped and raised his hand standing still they heard a muffled sound that might have been made by the fall of hoofs ahead and they hastily turned toward a clump of spruce the trees concealed them and the sound grew nearer until they could see the dim shapes of men and horses moving through the driving flakes then they left cover and spread out across the creek the team stopped and an angry voice came out of the snow  whats this what do you want  yon sled and its load the leader concisely replied  stand clear cried the voice go right ahead bill  a man sprang forward and seized the near horses head  stop where you are he cried were not looking for trouble but we want the sled  two others ran out from behind the horses but the leader of the expedition raised his hand  its six to three mitcham and thats long odds yell get sled and team when ye claim them in camp lift a fist and yell give the boys the excuse theyre wearying for ill ask nothing better  mitcham turned to his companions  theyve got us boys leave them to it he said  lead the horses kermode directed one of the party and the team moved on again while the leader walking beside the sled hastily examined its load several small cases lay beneath a tarpaulin  what became of mitcham and his friends did not appear for they were left behind in the snow but the night grew wilder and the cold more biting for minutes together they could see nothing through the cloud of flakes that drove furiously past them it was hard to urge the tired horses forward through the deeper drifts and all were thankful when they came to reaches which the savage wind had swept almost clear they could not however leave the creek without their knowing it and they had a fringe of willows into which they stumbled now and then as guide when at length the gorge opened out there was a high ridge to be crossed and they had cause to remember the ascent the route led up through belts of brush and between scattered pines and leaving it inadvertently every now and then they got entangled among the scrub two of them plodded at the stumbling horses heads four pushed the sled and at the top of every steeper slope every one stopped and gasped for breath it was now near dawn and they had marched all night after a day of heavy toil  the ascent made they went down the hill at an awkward run the horses slipping with the sled pressing on them colliding with small trees smashing through matted brush until they heard a hail it was answered and another body of men appeared and escorted them into camp drowsy voices called to them and here and there a man looked out as they passed the lines of shacks and tents but no word was spoken until they reached their leaders cabin the cases were carried in and while two of the company took the horses away the others were given hot coffee and afterward sat down to wait for morning it was very cold and icy draughts crept in but they were undisturbed until daybreak when there was a cry outside  heres mitcham wanting to talk to you  a weary man white with snow entered and looked eagerly round the shack  ive come for those cases he said pointing to the pile  what right have you to them kermode inquired  what right cried the other theyre my property i bought them  kermode smiled  you hear that youll remember it boys  mitchams face grew dark as he saw the trap he had fallen into  anyhow i want them he muttered you wont be wise to keep them  now see here said one of the party we have a dozen men round this shack and if theres trouble we have only to call for more every boy knows what to do strikes me it wouldnt pay you to bring your hobos along  mitcham looked at the others and saw that they were resolute his enemies were masters of the situation bluster and threats would not serve him but it was kermodes amusement which caused him the most uneasiness  well he said keep them while you can youre going to be sorry for this  he went out and several of the men broke into a laugh they had however a problem to face later when they received a sharp message from the foreman demanding their immediate return to work all were willing to lose a days pay but the prompt dismissal which would follow disobedience was a more serious matter  the trouble is that if we leave the shack without a guard mitcham will steal his liquor back declared one  i think i had better see mr morgan kermode suggested and they let him go  the young engineer he interviewed listened with a thoughtful air to the request that several of the workmen should be given a days leave  it would be awkward to let these fellows quit the engineer protested  if you would tell the foreman to send the boys ill mention ahead up the track so they couldnt get back before evening and give two of us a day off it would get over the difficulty  when he heard the names the engineer looked hard at kermode  has this request any connection with the collapse of mr fergusons church  it has indirectly im sorry i cant give you an explanation  try to understand how im situated i may have my sympathies but i cant be a partizan my business is to see you do your work suppose i do as you suggest will it make any trouble in the camp i want a straight answer  no said kermode i give you my word that what we mean to do will lead to quietness and good order  then ill have the boys you mentioned sent up the track theyre a crowd ive had my eye on one of your friends and you can lie off  kermode thanked him and went back to the shack where he kept watch with the leader of the presbyterians until two police troopers rode up late in the afternoon they opened the cases and heard kermodes story  you declare the man mitcham claimed this liquor as his property sergeant inglis asked  he said hed bought it were ready to swear to that and we can give you the names of several more who heard him  ill take them down wheres mitcham  they told him and he closed his notebook  you may be sent for from edmonton later dont let these cases out of your sight until private cooper calls for them  he went out and came back later with the trooper and a teamster they had hired who loaded the cases on a sled sergeant inglis however sat still in his saddle with a watchful eye on mitcham and another man who stood handcuffed at his horses side when the police had ridden off with their prisoners morgan the engineer sent for kermode  ive seen the sergeant and he gave me an outline of the affair he said it was cleverly thought outi suppose the idea was yours  i cant deny it returned kermode modestly  well said the other see that your friends and you begin work as usual tomorrow  during the next two weeks ferguson made some progress in repairing the damage to his church he found several helpers now that his strongest opponent had been removed the weather however grew more severe and as the frost interfered with operations men were freely dismissed one day morgan and the contractors clerk sat talking in the latters office  ill have to cut out two or three teams he said i dont know whom i ought to fire  kermode morgan advised promptly  the clerk looked surprised  foreman reports him as a pretty good teamster he strikes me as smart and capable he objected  he is in fact thats the trouble i like the man but you had better get rid of him  youre giving me a curious reason  morgan smiled  i expect our plans for the winter may lead to some trouble with the boys such work as we can carry on is going to be severe now do you think it prudent to provide them with a highly intelligent leader  guess youre right the clerk agreed hell have to go though im sorry to part with him  ill send him to another job nearer the coast said morgan  the next day kermode was informed of this decision and took it goodhumoredly before leaving the camp he spent an evening with ferguson who expressed keen regret at his departure  i have an idea that i may have got you into trouble and it hurts me the minister said  kermode laughed in a reassuring manner  its likely that youre wrong but im not the first man who has found a righteous cause unprofitable  that ferguson returned gravely is in one sense very true  they sat up late talking and the next morning kermode found means of sending fosters horses back and then resumed his journey     chapter xvii  the passage of the mountains   kermode had been gone a fortnight when prescott reached the camp and heard from ferguson and others of his latest exploit he smiled as he listened to their stories but that he should find people willing to talk about the man did not surprise him kermode was not likely to pass unnoticed his talents were of a kind that seized attention where he went there was laughter and sometimes strife he had a trick of winning warm attachment and even where his departure was not regretted he was remembered  ferguson insisted on taking prescott in for his comrades sake and late one evening he sat talking with him beside the stove his house was rudely put together shingleroofed and walled with shiplap boards that gave out strong resinous odors the joints were not tight and stinging draughts crept in deep snow lay about the camp and the frost was keen  i cant venture to predict kermodes movements said the clergyman it was his intention to make for a camp halfway to the coast but he may change his mind long before he gets there  yes prescott replied thats the kind of man he is  ferguson smiled  you and kermode strike me as differing in many ways yet you seem strongly attached to him  thats true prescott assented i cant see that i owe him anything and he once led me into a piece of foolishness that nobody but himself could have thought of i knew the thing was crazy but i did it when he urged me and ive regretted it ever since still when i meet the fellow i expect i shant have a word of blame for him  hes a man i had a strong liking for though on many matters our points of view were opposite however i dare say its something to be thankful for that were not all made alike  kermodes unique prescott explained im of the plodding kind and i find that consequences catch me up kermodes different he plunges into recklessness and the penalty falls on somebody else  you dont mean by his connivance  never its the last thing i meant kermode never shirks bring a thing home to him and hell face it but somehow he generally escapes theres the matter i mentionedhe and i played a fool trick and while he rambles about the country flinging a foreman down an embankment assisting a lady in distress posing as a temperance reformer in his usual inconsequent way im deep in trouble and so are other people who dont deserve it so far ive always reached the scene of his latest exploit soon after he had left but the man must be found  ferguson laughed  what are you going to do about it  follow him to the pacific if necessary as the country isnt opened up he cant get off the line  im afraid youre going to have a very rough journey the tracks surveyed and blazed theyre working at it in sections but there are big gaps where nothing has been done yet and they have been withdrawing a large number of men crossing the mountains is a tough proposition in the winter  kermode didnt seem afraid of it  he started two weeks ago when there had been less snow youll find it difficult to get through the passes now  anyway declared prescott i have to get through  ferguson pondered the simple answer it was he thought typical of the man and the contrast between him and his friend became more forcible kermode exercised a curious charm his gay careless nature made him excellent company and he had a strain of somewhat eccentric genius but he was irresponsible and erratic one could not depend on him the canadian was of different temperament slower less subject to impulse but more stubborn and more consistent when dealing with him one would know what to expect he would reason out a purpose and then unwaveringly adhere to it  well the clergyman said you may have to cross a big province and though its warmer as you get down to the coast the weathers often nearly arctic among the ranges while its only here and there that youll have a chance to find shelter its a trip thats not to be undertaken rashly youll need a fur coat among other things and i think i can get you one you had better take a couple of days rest so as to start fresh and now its time for bed  prescott spent the next day with him and left the camp at daybreak on the second morning he wore a long coat from which the fur had peeled in patches and carried a heavy pack besides a small ax his boots were dilapidated but he had been unable to replace them there was sharp frost and when he boarded a construction train he looked back at the camp with keen regret he shrank from the grim wilds ahead a haze of smoke hung over the clustering shacks lights still blinked among them and already the nipping air was filled with sounds of activity then the locomotive shrieked and he turned his face toward the lonely white hills as the cars moved forward with a jerk it was bitterly cold though he lay down out of the wind behind the load of rails where hot cinders rattled about him and now and then stung his face  at noon the train stopped alighting with cramped limbs prescott saw that the rails went no farther a few shacks stood forlornly upon the hillside a frozen river wound like a white riband through the gorge beneath and ahead lay a sharply rising waste of rock and snow his path led across it and after a word or two with the men on the line he began his journey breaking through the thin frozen crust the sounds behind him grew fainter and ceased the trail of dingy smoke which had followed him melted away and he was alone in the wilderness his course was marked however by a pile of stones here a blazed tree there and he plodded on all day when night came he found a hollow free from snow beneath a clump of juniper and lay awake shivering under his blankets white peaks and snowfields were wrapped in deathly silence there was not even the howl of a prowling wolf or the splash of falling water  rising at dawn almost too cold to move he could find no dry wood to make a fire and had serious trouble in getting on his frozen boots and after a hurried meal he set out again it was some time before he felt moderately warm but with a short rest at noon he held on until evening was near when he camped in a deep rift among the rocks filled with small firs here he found dry branches and made his supper sitting between a sheltering stone and a welcome fire soon afterward he lay down and slept until the piercing cold awakened him near dawn the fire had burned out to a few red embers he had some trouble in stirring it into life and it was bright daylight when he resumed his journey  he was too tired and generally too cold to retain any clear impression of the next few days march there were ranks of peaks above glittering at times against an intensely blue sky but more often veiled in leaden cloud while rolling vapor hid their lower slopes he skirted tremendous gorges looked up great hollows filled with climbing trees followed winding valleys and at length limped into sight of a lonely camp at the foot of a crag the light was fading when he reached it though a lurid sunset glowed behind the black firs on the crest of a ridge and the place had a desolate look most of the shacks were empty there were rings of branches with a litter of old cans about them where tents had been pitched but a few toiling figures were scattered about a strip of track it was comforting to see them but prescott was too jaded to notice what they were doing  entering a shanty roughly built of ties and galvanized iron he found a stove burning and a chinaman who told him that supper would be ready soon after a while the men came in and asking very few questions gave him a share of their meal then he was shown a rude bed of fir branches and swamp hay and told he could sleep there prescott lay down and lighted his pipe and then looked about for a while the place was dimly lighted and filled with rank tobacco smoke through which he saw the blurred figures of his new companions some of them were playing cards under a lamp some were disputing in harsh voices and now and then there was a burst of laughter once or twice a man went out and an icy draught swept through the shed but except for that it was delightfully warm soon prescotts pipe dropped from his hand and failing in a drowsy attempt to find it he went to sleep  at breakfast the next morning he learned that a man answering kermodes description had spent a night there eight or nine days ago that showed that he was gaining and he forced his pace all day at sunset he made a fire beside a frozen lake and after three or four days of arduous toil reached another camp from the few men remaining there he learned that kermode had left the spot a week earlier with a companion whose work had been interfered with by the frost it was understood that they intended to examine a mineral vein the railroad hand had discovered in a valley some distance off and when prescott had ascertained where it lay he set off on their trail the camp was well supplied with provisions and he bought a quantity  he felt more cheerful now it looked as if the end of his long search were near since there was every reason to believe he would join the men before they could test the claim on the second day he laboriously ascended a steep slope leading out of a valley he had followed a broken line of footprints running upward in front of him this seemed to indicate that the great ridge ahead could be crossed though when he glanced at the ramparts of dark rock the task looked insuperable prescott knew nothing of mountaineering but he judged that kermodes companion must be accustomed to the ranges  the slope grew sharper there seemed to be an unbroken wall of rock ahead but climbing higher prescott saw a small smooth track running up the barrier it was obviously a gully filled with snow and its steepness suggested that the ascent of it might prove beyond his powers but the footprints led on to where it began after following them to the spot prescott sat down on a stone to gather breath he looked upward with a sinking heart the hollow was deep and narrowa cleft in the vast ridge of rock which was glazed with ice in places it looked precipitous but there seemed to be no way of working round the flank of the mountain then prescott noticed that the snow was pitted with small holes about two feet apart from which he concluded that the prospectors had carried a grubhoe a tool resembling a mountaineers iceax he might get up by using these footholds  before starting he carefully adjusted his pack and slung the ax where it seemed least likely to do him an injury then he found that by laying his mittened hands in the holes above he could steady himself while he found a fresh support for his feet and for a while he made progress though the labor of carrying up his load became intense coming to a fang of rock which offered a precarious seat he stopped and wondered how he was to get up the rest of the way it seemed a vast distance to the top and he was already distressed by a form of exertion to which he was unaccustomed bright sunshine rested on the jagged ridge above but the gully lay in shadow and growing cold the man went on again the next few minutes passed uneventfully except that he made a dangerous slip and then a stone rushed past him and he heard a sharp crash below this was a risk he had not counted on looking up anxiously he saw some snow coming down there was not much of it but it was traveling ominously fast and he was right in its path he dared not leave the steps to seek the shelter of the rocks driving in his feet to secure a better hold he waited wondering whether he would be swept away and hurled down to the bottom with broken bones  the sliding snow was close upon him he saw that it was spinning and of a flat round shape not a ball as he had expected and then while he dug in his hands and stiffened every muscle to resist the shock he received a heavy blow on his lowered shoulder and a wet mass was flung violently into his face he held on however and without looking around heard the snow rush on down the gully beneath him after he had climbed a few yards it seemed possible to reach a projecting spur of rock and when he had carefully kicked out a hold for one foot he made the attempt he had scarcely reached the shelter of the rock when there was a sharp crash above and a great stone leaped by  prescott found that he could maintain his position fairly comfortably and he lighted his pipe and sat still to rest and consider while the downward rush of another stone gave him food for thought he believed he was halfway up and after the exertions he had made it was unthinkable that he should go back and seek another route besides he doubted whether he could get down without slipping it seemed quite as perilous to go on until he reasoned from the state of the snow which was not deeply scored that the stones did not come down continuously perhaps the warmth of the sun helped by a soft chinook wind that had set in had loosened them but the light was fading off part of the ridge and if he waited a while the discharge might cease the trouble was that he was getting very cold he smoked another pipe and as he heard no further crashes he cautiously ventured out and regained the deepest part of the gully his joints ached his muscles felt sore but there was a break in the rocks some distance higher up and he determined to climb to it  the effort was severe but he reached the spot breathless and carefully looked about the sunshine had now vanished from the crest of the rocks and he supposed the stones would soon freeze fast again but there would be only another hour or two of daylight and he must gain a place of safety before it grew dark an incautious movement would precipitate him from his insecure refuge and he could not contemplate his remaining there through the night then he grew angry with kermode  it was difficult to believe this was the easiest way into the valley where the railroad man had made his discovery the latter being used to the ranges had no doubt taken it to shorten the distance and kermode should have objected kermode however never paused to think he cheerfully plunged into the first folly that appealed to him and left other people to bear the consequences then having rested prescott saw that there were weak points in this reasoning since the man he was following must have climbed the slope and what was more that his irritation led to no result he could consider such matters when he had reached the summit and in order to do so he must get on at once  no more stones came down but after prescott had gone some distance a fresh difficulty confronted him the gully was getting steeper and the holes had disappeared he supposed that the snow had softened in the sunshine earlier in the day and slipping down had filled up the recesses he had however discovered that one could kick through the hard crust and make a hole to stand in provided it were done carefully and he went up by this means wondering whether his boots would hold out until he reached the top and stopping every few yards for breath it was exhausting work after a long march and he was heavily loaded but it could not be shirked and he crawled up watching the distance shorten foot by foot once a step broke away and he slid back a yard before he brought up with hands buried deep in the snow and the perspiration streaming from him in his terror still he was slowly mounting and at last worn out and breathless he reached the narrow ridge of crag and looked down with keen relief or a long slope to a valley filled with forest  in front there was a glorious vista of peaks that shone in the evening light but prescott was in no mood to think of them he must get down to the trees where he could camp in comfort before darkness fell rising after a few minutes rest he made the descent and as dusk crept round him lighted his fire among the sheltering trunks  the next day he followed the valley through thick timber and withered underbrush which tore his clothes and delayed his march there were fallen trunks with spreading branches to be scrambled over and tangles of thorny canes but he was cheered by signs that somebody had passed on ahead of him not long before later the forest died out and the bottom of the hollow was strewn with sharpedged stones which threatened to tear his worn boots from his feet and which added seriously to his toil it was however impossible that the prospectors had climbed the crags that hemmed him in and believing they could not be far in front of him he held on until late in the afternoon  at length he came to a wider stretch out of which a ravine that looked accessible led but he gave little thought to it there were a few small trees about and one of them had recently been felled he could see the white chips and the place where a fire had burned a meatcan lay nearby and when prescott picked it up he found the few fragments adhering to it quite fresh the men he sought had camped there but he began to grow anxious for he could see no signs of them laying down his load he made a hasty examination of the locality and found a spot where the face of a crag was marked by a streak of different material it was rent in one place heavy fragments were scattered about and prescott saw that they had been blown out with giantpowder  for a few minutes he eagerly proceeded with his search but he could find no blankets or provision cache and when he saw footprints leading toward the ravine the truth dawned on him the prospectors had left the spot and were not coming back once more he had arrived too late it was a cruel disappointment and he sat down in black dejection looking heavily about the high summits were wrapped in leaden cloud the lower rocks towered above him rugged and forbidding and a mournful wind wailed through the gorge  with an effort he forced himself to think he had provisions for only a day or two one of the prospectors was obviously an expert mountaineer which led prescott to believe that they would travel faster than he was capable of doing it would be the height of rashness to push on farther into the wilds without a guide and the first fall of snow would blot out any trail the others might have left reason warned him that he must turn back but it was unthinkable that he should descend the gully he determined to climb the ravine on the morrow  growing cold he fell to work with the ax and soon had a fire burning in a hollow among the rocks     chapter xviii  defeat   the next morning prescott awakened in the dark and set to work shivering to rekindle his fire day broke with a transitory brightness while he had breakfast and soon afterward he entered the ravine it was steep and filled with ice in places but freshly dislodged stones and scratches on the rocks showed him that the prospectors had gone that way the ascent was difficult it cost him a tense effort now and then to gain a slippery ledge or to scramble up a slab and he had frequently to stop and consider how he could best force a passage  he was tired and damp with perspiration when he reached the top and met an icy wind that swept across a tableland the high plain was strewn with rocky fragments the peaks above were lost in vapor but he saw by a glance at the watery sun that it ran roughly west and footprints led across it with an inclination toward the south this was comforting because the line of track ran to the south and if he could strike that it would serve as a guide moreover it confirmed prescotts conclusion that kermode who had evidently found the mineral vein worthless would hold on toward the sea he was not the man to haunt familiar ground when a wide newly opened country lay before him  then a few stinging flakes struck prescotts face the pale sunshine was blotted out and a savage blast drove him back to the shelter of the ravine for an hour he sat shivering among the rocks while the gorge was swept by snow when it ceased he came out but there was no sign of a footprint now and to make things worse the new snow was soft but he plodded through it heading southwest so as to strike the track again a little farther on  he spent the day on the high ground at times toilsomely picking a way across banks of stones buried in snow that hid the dangerous gaps between them now and then he sank through the treacherous covering and plunged into a hollow at the risk of breaking his leg but walking was easier between these tracts and when evening came he reached a few large fallen rocks among which he camped and lay awake half frozen without a fire starting as soon as day broke he felt that he must make the surveyed line before dark he was growing afraid of the white desolation and wanted to get into touch with something that would lead him to the haunts of men  it was afternoon when he came to a great dip a valley lay beneath him with a frozen river winding through its depths and he felt convinced that it was one the track would follow the trouble however was to get down for the hillside fell away in a vast scarp broken here and there by dark crags that showed through the snow there was a belt of timber a long way down but the slope was too steep for him to reach it and he walked along the summit in search of a spot from which the descent could be made until he came to a long declivity that looked a little less sharp then strapping his fur coat on his pack he kicked a step in the snow and began to climb down facing inward toward the bank  for a while he made steady progress and then the snow grew harder its surface had melted and frozen again resulting in a crust that could scarcely be penetrated he thought about his ax but he could not see how he could use it in cutting steps beneath him without falling down and this was not the place for hazardous experiments he went on very cautiously finding the work of kicking hollows for his feet extremely severe until when he supposed that half an hour had passed he drove his toes in deep and lay down to rest on looking up he seemed to have come a very short distance and when he glanced below he felt appalled at the length of the declivity he must still creep down his limbs ached his mittens were worn and his hands badly numbed and one boot was coming to pieces  the descent however must be continued and he began to move again very warily presently he found he could not break through the crust with his foot clinging hard to his handhold he lowered himself to feel for a softer spot his toe went in a little way he ventured to trust to the slight support but as he did so the treacherous snow broke beneath him for a few tense moments his numbed fingers held him to the slope he tried in terror to kick another hole the attempt failed his hands slipped away and he began to slide downward the snow driving up into his face the pace grew rapidly faster he could not keep himself straight but slid on his side then his pack caught something that turned him farther round so that his head was lowest he could see nothing his pace grew frightful and he drove on unable to make the least effort  how long this continued he had no idea it was a terrifying experience but at length to his dull astonishment his speed slackened suddenly and he stopped he found that he was whole in limb and on getting up cautiously he was forced to the conclusion that he was little the worse for his rapid descent his clothes were packed with snow but it was easily shaken out after recovering a little he saw that he had brought up on a slope that fell less sharply and that it would be possible to walk down it without much trouble the timber was close ahead and he smiled as he remembered his horror it looked as if he might have made the descent uninjured if he had calmly sat down and let himself go  moving downward among the trees he had almost reached the bottom of the valley when he came upon a belt of rugged stones and in picking a path across them slipped and fell he was not much hurt but when he went on again his foot felt sore and he was limping when he reached the river one or two trees near it had been chopped and a spur of rock lower down had its summit marked by a pole he had reached the line of track and he followed it west having heard there was a camp farther on though his informants did not know whether it was now occupied it was however a relief to stop among a clump of spruce at dusk when he had made a fire he examined his foot there was no sign of injury except that ankle and instep were rather red and he went to sleep reassured  in the morning he was surprised to find that the foot was painful and that the back of his leg felt strained he would have been tempted to remain in camp only that his provisions were nearly exhausted and after a meager breakfast he resumed the march the bottom of the valley was level the timber thin but there was a good deal of brush to be struggled through and before long he was forced to take to the winding river by noon it cost him a determined effort to walk for his foot was extremely painful and his leg getting sore as he did not know how far off the camp was it seemed prudent to save the food he had left and he limped on his lips tightset  the snowcovered ice was smooth but the bends of the river increased the distance wofully there was a keen wind and the dark pines stretched on without a break as far as he could see as he entered each fresh loop of the stream he looked eagerly for an opening or sign of life but there were only rows of ragged spires cutting sharply against the sky he felt inexpressibly lonely and badly afraid the desolation was growing appalling and he could not keep on his feet much longer he had food enough for two scanty meals and then if no help came he must starve  there was now a pain which grew rapidly worse in his left side his shoulders ached beneath his load and every joint was sore with the effort it cost him to save his injured foot the sun sank lower and the trees still ran on ahead indeed they were growing thicker and he could see only a short distance into the avenues between the great colonnades of trunks the loops of the river doubled more closely in spite of his exertion he was getting very little farther down the valley but an attempt to push through the forest led him into such tangles of fallen trunks and branches that he was forced back to the ice  at length he reached a spot where a fire had swept the bush branches and clustering needles had been burned away the trees ran up in bare charred columns black when looked at closely in the distance a curious silvery gray prescott could see ahead between them and he stopped with his heart beating rapidly for on the white hillside some distance off stood a few shacks this was the camp and in spite of the pain it cost him he increased his pace driven by keen suspense he did not know if there were men yonder and he could see no smoke the doubt grew tormenting leaving the stream farther on he struck into unburned bush that hid the camp from him there were thorny brakes and thickets of withered ferns but though progress was excruciatingly painful he smashed through them furiously he was hot and breathless it was insufferable that he should be delayed among the timber in anxiety breaking out into the open he sent up a hoarse cry for a thin trail of vapor curled above one of the shacks then a man appeared in the doorway and waved a hand to him  prescott felt suddenly limp and nerveless now that help was near at hand he wanted to sit down but he held on until he limped into the hut where two men stood awaiting him they were strong weatherbeaten fellows dressed in quaintly patched garments and they looked goodhumored  come right in said one pull that box up to the fire and sit down  prescott was glad to obey and when he had taken off his pack he looked about the shack it was substantially built stones and soil had been used in its construction as well as boards and bark it was warmed by a big open fire and contained a table besides a few tubs and cases which served as seats a bunk neatly made of split boards and filled with spruce twigs and swamp hay ran along one end  can you take me in for a day or two he asked ive hurt my foot  sure said the second man i noticed you were walking lame were well stocked in groceries and steve got a deer a day or two ago  how did you get your stores  the contractor brought them up there was quite a camp here company putting in all the preliminary work that could be done with the shovel they shut down when the frost came but we figured wed stay on and took over part of the supplies the boss had more truck than he could pack down to the other camps  then theres nobody else about the place  no sir said the first man theyre all gone its kind of lonely but were doing some chopping for the road and well be right here with money saved when work begins in spring bought a piece of fruit land part on mortgage at a snap and with good luck well have it clear when we go back  the short explanation supplied a clue to the characters of the men who with an eye to the future preferred to face the rigors of the north rather than to spend the winter hanging round the saloons on the warmer coast  well inquired the other where did you come from  prescott mentioned the last camp he had visited and gave them a few particulars about his journey  and so you came down the long benchpretty tough proposition that and kept the trail on short rations one of his hosts remarked suppose you take a smoke and ill get supper a little earlier  before long he was given a share of a simple but abundant meal and after it was over sat talking with his hosts it was dark outside now but although the men had run out of oil for the lamp the fire gave them light and pungent odors issued from the resinous logs the room was warm and by comparison with the frozen wilderness supremely comfortable  whats the matter with your foot one of the men asked when prescott took off his boot  prescott described how it felt though he explained that he could find no sign of injury and the other nodded  ricked it a bit got one of the ligaments or something kinked he said known that happen when there wasnt much to show you had better lie off for a while  it occurred to prescott that he might be in much worse quarters though he shrank from the delay a rest would entail  what took you up the gully and over the bench anyway the man went on  prescott explained and then asked have you come across my partner or the other fellow hollin  never seen your partner the man looked at his comrade and laughed but we know hollin all right got an idea that hes a boss prospector and froze on to the railroad job because it took him into the mountains been all round looking for minerals got fired for it at one or two camps and never struck anything worth speaking of its a point on which hes certainly a crank  it was characteristic of kermode prescott thought that he should be willing to accompany a man with a craze of the kind  id expected to find them here i understood they didnt mean to go back to the camp at butler ridge he said  we havent seen their tracks and if they were heading west theyd have to come down this valley but i guess nobody could tell where hollin would make for of course you cant prospect much in winter with everything frozen up and the snow about but so long as he can trail through the mountains and find a few clean rocks the man will be happy and ill allow that hes smart at it knows how to fix a camp and find a deer if theres one in the country its a sure thing hell have to strike for a camp or store sooner or later but its likely he has crossed the line south and is trying to make the fraser and the settlements along the canadian pacific railroad  it was bad news to prescott he knew enough about the pacific province to realize that if his hosts suppositions were correct he would have a vast area to search a region of stony uplands mountain chains and rockwalled valleys  would it be possible for me to get through he asked  no sir you dont want to think of it guess your partner will be pretty safe with hollin but youre a plainsman and youd sure get lost in a day or two and starve when your grub ran out  thats right agreed the other man the thing cant be done  prescott fell in with his opinion it would he thought require a number of expert mountaineers to trace the men he sought through the desolation of rock and forest to the south besides british columbia was well populated along the canadian pacific line from which many avenues of communication opened up and there would be a strong probability of his missing kermode  well he said reluctantly perhaps i had better stop round here in case they keep this track and my foots too sore to let me move could you put me up for a week or two ill try to make it worth your while  stop as long as you want steve responded well have to charge you for the grub because we paid quite a pile for it but well only strike you for your share  thank you said prescott and the others began to talk of hollin  if that man would let up on prospecting hed get rich declared one when a survey outfit goes up into the bush hollins picked for the boss packers job and when theres a new wagon road to be staked out they generally put him on a smart man at striking the easiest line through rough country  thats so agreed steve trouble is that he cant stay with it soon as he collects some pay he goes off on the prospecting trail and then heads for vancouver with a bag of specimens that arent worth anything when the mineral men hear of a new hollin discovery they smile guess hes found most everythinggold copper zinc and platinumand never made fifty cents out of them cept once when so the boys say a mining company fellow gave him five dollars to promise he wouldnt worry him again now theyve orders in all the offices that if hollin comes round with any more specimens theyre not to let him in  prescott laughed the man he had heard described was kermodes companion and he could imagine their wandering up and down the province one as irresponsible as the other meeting with strange experiences stubbornly braving the perils of the wilds making themselves a nuisance to business men in the cities the matter had however a more serious aspect prescott had spent some time on the useless search and he could not continue it throughout the winter it would be futile to speculate on the movements of men so erratic as those he had followed he could not neglect his farm and he had a heavy crop to haul in and sell this was a duty that must be attended to  if he went back without jernyngham and curtis still clung to his theory the police might give him trouble but he must run that risk though convinced of it he had no means of proving that jernyngham was wandering through british columbia in company with a crazy prospector  after a while he grew drowsy and got into the bunk where he lay down enjoying the warmth and softness of the spruce twigs until he went to sleep     chapter xix  prescotts return   it was saturday evening clear and cold though the frost was not intense a number of the farmers and their wives had driven in to sebastian to meet their friends and make their weekly purchases a row of light rigs stood outside the liverystable voices and laughter rose from the sidewalks the town looked cheerful and almost picturesque with its roofs and tall elevator towers cutting against the soft night sky  a full moon hung above them but its silvery radiance was paled by other lights warm gleams shone out from the store windows upon the hardtrodden snow a train of lighted cars stood at the station and the intense white glare of the headlamp mingled with the beam flung far across the prairie by a freight locomotive on a sidetrack groups of people strolled up and down the low platform waiting to see the train go out and their voices rang merrily on the frosty air from one of the great shadowy elevators there came a whirr of wheels  when the train rolled away into the wilderness muriel hurst entered the hotel and went upstairs to the parlor where colston and her sister were sitting the room was furnished in defective taste but it was warm and brightly lighted and the girl had got accustomed to the smell of warm iron diffused by the stove and the odor of burning kerosene colston occupied an easychair and when muriel took off her furs he looked up with a smile noticing the fine color the nipping air had brought into her face she looked braced and vigorous but it struck him that she wore a thoughtful expression  did you buy all you wanted he asked  i got what i came for muriel sat down and handed her sister a parcel i think that ought to match has harry been lounging there since supper isnt he the picture of comfortable laziness  colston laughed he was still very neatly dressed but he looked harder than he had when he first reached the prairie and his face was brown  im content and thats a great thing he rejoined indeed ill confess that i could enjoy our stay here except for the damping effect of our friends trouble its astonishing how little one misses the comforts we insist on in england and im coming to take an interest in the visits we pay among the ranches and our weekly trip to sebastian then nobody could maintain that your sister looks any the worse for her experience im beginning to think she might pass for a wheatgrowers wife  i heard mrs johnson ask when you were going to take a farm muriel retorted it would be difficult to imagine you tramping down a furrow behind a plow or driving one of those smelly gasoline tractors but youll be able to pose before your constituents as an authority on colonial questions when you go home  im afraid theyll throw me over unless they see me soon but theres nothing else to take me back and id feel we were deserting our friends in their distress  we cant leave them yet mrs colston broke in the suspense is preying upon jernyngham hes getting dangerously moody i know gertrude feels anxious about him  a curious expression crept into muriels eyes  believing what he does its natural that he should clamor for justice but hes becoming possessed by a feverish cruelty its mastering him destroying his judgment  youre alluding to his suspicions of prescott  muriels eyes sparkled as she took up the challenge  you know as well as i do that theyre altogether wrong its impossible that he should be guilty  one would like to think so her sister responded with dry reserve but its a pity he ran away  muriel could not deny this she had retained her faith in prescott but his silence about the motive for an absence that must tell against him troubled her it was strange that he had given her no hint and she felt hurt  he may have gone because he could not bear to be distrusted she said you are both sorry for jernyngham but dont you think the man he unjustly suspects deserves some pity  well said colston ive tried to keep an open mind prejudice of course should not be pandered to but one is as likely to be led astray by too strong a partiality for the suspected person he paused before he added however i envy you your confidence i liked the man  the worst of it is that the matter may go dragging on until it wears gertrude and her father out mrs colston remarked it would be a relief in some ways to learn the truth however bad it is  mr prescott has no reason to dread the truths coming out said muriel staunchly  then a maid came in to announce that their team was ready and putting on her furs muriel went down in advance of the others to see that her purchases had been placed together after she had gone mrs colston looked at her husband  i think it would be advisable to mention prescott as seldom as possible  so do i colston agreed i wonder whether you have noticed anything unusual in the relations between muriel and gertrude of late they used to be good friends in england  i have remarked some signs of strain but it is not a matter you could be expected to take an interest in  of course colston rejoined deprecatingly and went down with his wife  leslies team and a smart sleigh which jernyngham had had sent out from toronto stood at the door and after he had helped his wife and muriel in colston took the reins when they had jolted across the track the snow was beaten smooth along the trail the team was fresh after resting and it was a brilliant night they set off at an exhilarating speed and though their faces tingled they kept warm beneath their furs and drivingrobes far in front of them spread the prairie gleaming white beneath the moon no cloud stained the vault of soft deep blue and the drumming of the hoofs rang out in merry rhythm the crisp cold which was less marked than usual stirred the blood  they passed a buggy drawn by a good horse and later a light wagon for the snow does not as a rule lie deep on the western prairie and the farmers largely continue the use of wheels after that for some time they were alone on the waste until as they approached a tract of broken country a wagon appeared on the crest of a rise with the double span of horses in front of it cutting sharply black against the snow it came on slowly heavily loaded with bags of grain and then the dark shape of a man who walked beside the team grew visible as they came closer colston turned his horses out of the trail to let the wagon pass and then started as the moonlight fell on the teamsters face it was prescott  for a moment he hesitated and then pulled up acknowledging the mans greeting with a lifted hand mrs colston however said nothing and prescott stood quietly by his horses heads until muriel called him forward and gave him her hand  when did you get back she asked  late last night we broke the wheat bin this morning and im taking the first load in  but where were you  in alberta and british columbia most of the time  he volunteered no further information and there was an awkward pause for prescott had noticed that colston had been undecided whether to drive on or not mrs colston sat farthest from him so that he could not see her but she had not addressed him yet it was clear that his appearance had affected them unpleasantly  when we next meet you must tell us about your trip said muriel  we should be interested to hear about it colston added lamely and prescott forced a smile muriel was the only one who had treated him on the old friendly footing and he could hardly visit the leslie homestead even if he were invited while jernyngham was there  i may see you some time and i mustnt keep you now he responded  he started his team and colston turned to his companions  ill confess that ive had a great surprise  of course you imagined that mr prescott had gone for good said muriel with scorn  im afraid i had some idea of that nature he would hardly have come back if he were guilty  oh said muriel mockingly you really cant tell what an unscrupulous bold man might do  spare me colston begged with a laugh after all it looks as if you have been right he turned to his wife what do you think  mr prescotts guilt or innocence is a question i cant decide but in making us believe he was cyril jernyngham he did a very wrong and foolish thing that cyril may have urged him to do so is no excuse  leaving mr prescott out i think cyrils idea was a very generous one muriel declared  how can you believe that  he must have wished to save his father and sister pain and he knew the trick would cost him a good deal for one thing it would prevent his going home to be reinstated because of course if he had done so we would have seen he was not the man we had met in canada he meant to stay here refusing to benefit by the change in his affairs out of consideration for his relatives  and you approve his passing off this western farmer for a jernyngham mrs colston asked  oh that muriels laugh was scornful you were satisfied with the man until you knew his name was prescott how was it that you didnt miss the inherent superiority of the jernynghams besides i cant think cyril suffered by getting his friend to represent him though people wont talk very freely ive picked up some information since ive been here enough to show what kind of man cyril was he hadnt much to boast of and one must do him the justice to admit that he seems to have recognized it you probably know though you hid it from me that on the evening he should have met us he was lying in the hotel after getting badly hurt in a drunken brawl among some riotous orangemen  i cant have any reflections cast upon orangemen colston objected there are a large number in my constituency most worthy people for whom ive a strong respect  you have a respect for their votes you mean muriel rejoined you know youre really ritualistic high church if your constituents knew as much about st cuthberts as i do they would turn you out  i have never hid my convictions colston declared anyway i have ascertained that the greater proportion of the orangemen were sober  then retorted muriel im sorry that cyril was not but there are more important points to consider  that is very true said mrs colston will you tell jernyngham that we have seen prescott harry  colston hesitated  no i dont think so im afraid of the effect it may have on him and he wont be up when we get in all the same hes bound to hear the news from somebody else very soon  neither of the others answered and they drove on in silence until the lights of the leslie homestead blinked across the snow the cheerfulness which had marked the party when they set out had gone they felt a sense of constraint and muriel wondered uneasily whether she had spoken with too much freedom  the next morning they were sitting with jernyngham and gertrude when a neighboring rancher came in  i thought leslie might be here he explained dont mean to intrude  colston knew the man and he asked him to sit down jernyngham glanced up from the winnipeg paper he was reading his face was worn and had set into a fixed harsh expression but his manner conveyed a hint of eagerness of late it had suggested that he was continually expecting something  i drove over to give leslie a message the newcomer continued i guess you have heard that prescotts back  jernyngham started and dropped the paper  prescott back you must be mistaken  no sir spoke to him on the trail last night he was hauling in a load to the settlement and i was driving home half an hour after mr colston  theres only one trail said jernyngham looking hard at colston you must have met the fellow why didnt you tell me  colston showed confusion  to tell the truth i was afraid the news might distress and excite you you couldnt do anything until monday and i thought it better to let you spend today in peace  in peace jernyngham laughed in a jarring manner tormented as i am by suspense that grows beyond endurance his eyes glittered and the lines on his face deepened and im to be kept in ignorance while the villain who robbed and killed my son goes about his work undisturbed  there was an awkward silence for a few moments mrs colston looked distressed and gertrude regarded muriel with a long searching glance the girl felt that she was being suspected of abetting her brotherinlaw for some ulterior purpose she was of sanguine temperament and wayward temper and her blood ran warm but she held in check the anger that she burned to give expression to then their visitor whom they had forgotten broke in  now sir youre getting ahead too fast theres nothing proved against prescott and i and others know he never did the thing he paused and muriel regardless of her companions flung him a grateful glance as he went on even curtis cant bring it home to him  curtis said jernyngham contemptuously is a cautious fool ill communicate with his chiefs at regina he got up with a decided air ill start for sebastian at once wheres leslie i must see him about a team  you stay where you are said the farmer with rude sympathy i heard that one of the police bosses will be at the settlement tomorrow and you can see him then curtis took a room for him at the hotel im telling you because the sooner all this muss is cleared up the better and it wont hurt prescott  he went out and jernyngham without speaking to the others picked up his paper muriel took a book from a shelf but although she determinedly tried to fix her attention on it she could make no sense of what she read it was a dreary morning colston was soon driven out and the others were oppressed by a feeling of constraint and tension they were glad when jernyngham and gertrude started for sebastian in the afternoon after they had gone colston looked at his wife and sisterinlaw dolefully  this kind of thing will tell upon your nerves im beginning to feel it he said we must have a long drive tomorrow to get rid of the depression those people on the ranch by the bluff pressed us to come back again  there are many excuses for our friends you couldnt expect them to be cheerful mrs colston replied  thats very true one must try to remember it it seems our duty to remain and comfort them as much as possible but i cant say that theyre always very grateful indeed i have felt hurt by gertrudes reserve though considering how trying all this must be for her one cant take exception to it  gertrude knows her brother is alive said muriel coldly  her sister cast a keen glance at her while colston made a sign of expostulation  i scarcely think you have any right to say that but ill confess that im wavering in my opinionsprescotts return has had its effect on me in fact the mysterys getting deeper and more fascinating i feel impelled to wait and see it unraveled  that is hardly the way to regard it his wife rebuked him i would rather remember that the jernynghams have a strong claim on our sympathy  its the main consideration of course but well decide on the drive tomorrow it has been a depressing day     chapter xx  muriel relieves her mind   on the monday morning jernyngham was shown into the parlor of the hotel where a commissioned officer of the police sat waiting for him he had keen observant eyes but his manner was quiet and jernyngham endeavored to control his impatience  i suppose you know that prescott has returned to his farm he said taking the chair the other pointed to  i have been informed so the officer replied  then may i ask what you mean to do  we have come to no decision  but your men have a warrant for him  the officer changed his position and his expression hinted at forbearance  that is so on the whole i think it should not have been issued  you must not let the fellows return influence you unduly  very true said the other with a calm which jernyngham found maddening it would be unwise to infer too much from that  he is a bold man he has no doubt counted on the effect his coming back would have jernyngham urged  its possible the officer agreed  jernynghams nerves had given way beneath the strain he had borne and he now stood up trembling with anger  am i to understand that you intend to leave the fellow alone now when he is within your reach you will not arrest him the scoundrel killed my son  might i suggest your sitting down again said the officer calmly let me try to put the matter before you as we look at it to begin with we cant very well press the charge you make against prescott without some proof of the victims death which has not been discovered yet the muskeg i must remind you was drained and nothing found the handsome reward you offered led to no result though every man in the district who had any time to spare spent it in searching the bluffs corporal curtis has made systematic investigations but they have been fruitless  corporal curtis is a man of whose intelligence i have a very poor opinion said jernyngham hotly  his companion smiled  thats a point upon which i dont altogether share your views  in short you intend to let the matter drop i must protest against such a scandalous failure of justice but you shall not let it drop i warn you that i shall apply to ottawa where there are people who can put upon you the pressure that seems to be needed  a look of weariness crept into the officers face  you have my sympathy mr jernyngham but you cant be allowed to interfere with the northwest police  jernyngham pulled himself together  i had no wish to be offensive though i meant what i said suppose this fellow goes off againfor goodas soon as he has sold his wheat  that will have to be guarded against he will be watched if he leaves his farm he will be followed  he gave you the slip neatly on a previous occasion  quite true said the officer our men are not infallible i think i can promise that it will not happen again then he rose i have some business waiting and you must excuse me i can assure you that nothing which promises to throw any light upon the matter will be neglected  he opened the door and politely but firmly bowed out his visitor then he called curtis who was waiting below  i dare say you can guess mr jernynghams errand he said unless we can hit on the truth before long youll have that gentleman in the guardroom  curtis looked astonished and his superior smiled compassionately  i mean as a sufferer from mental derangement dont be communicative and confine yourself to reassuring generalities if you come across him his minds morbidly fixed on punishing prescott i dont think he can be convinced that the man is innocent  i cant help meeting him sir he spends his time following me about in a way one cant blame him for what he thinks  though it doesnt agree with your conclusions sit down we have a number of things to talk about  well sir said curtis this is certainly a mixedup case ive said nothing all along to disturb peoples belief that it was prescott we were after but if i had to corral one of the two id get wandle the land agency man gave us a good description of him  his superior nodded thoughtfully  prescott impersonated cyril jernyngham before his supposed death and wandle personated him afterward the latter with the more obvious motive the point is that theres no evidence of collusion but rather disagreement between the two of course we could arrest wandle now  yes sir as soon as the agent identified him we could prove forgery and falsification of the land sale record hed be safe in the guardroom or a penitentiary  just so we will have him there sooner or later but if hes guilty of the more serious charge hed have no opportunity for giving himself away id rather he was left at large and you kept your eye on him the same applies to prescott now ive been making a fresh study of the diagram of the footsteps near the muskeg and i can see no fault in the conclusions you arrived atonly the remains cant be found  sure thats a weak point sir but i might mention the case of the person who was found in a bluff a few miles from home after theyd searched the district for six months  it has been in my mind but you have other matters to report on what about the disturbance on the indian reservation  while they discussed it jernyngham set out for the leslie homestead and on his arrival found gertrude alone sitting down with a shiver he looked at her dejectedly  i have failed again they will do nothing theres no satisfaction to be had he said i drove out my son by arbitrary harshness and now the only reparation i might have made is denied me  you were harsh assented gertrude i have begun to realize it since we came to canadaone sees things differently here but in a sense i think you were not to be blamed you acted in the belief that you were right  she had seldom ventured to address him with so much candor and she was surprised at his calmness  yes he said it is some relief to remember that but i was wrong  then shouldnt it make you more careful not to fall into a similar error again you have a fixed idea in your mind and the way you dwell on it is breaking you down seeing you suffer is wearing me cant you believe that there is room for doubt  i wish i could he said with some gentleness recognizing the anxious appeal in her voice but i imagined you were as convinced as i am of prescotts guilt  oh she replied miserably i believed i was but i dont know what to think  he noticed the distress in her face with uncomprehending sympathy he was fond of her in his stern reserved fashion and knew she must deeply feel the loss of her brother  as soon as he saw he was suspected prescott ran away he continued that must count against him if he had had any motive except the wish to escape he would have mentioned it  gertrude sat silent tormented by confused emotions prescott had told her he was going to hunt for cyril and until she had seen his devotion to muriel she had felt that she must believe in him then her mind had been filled with jealousy and doubt she thought she hated him after all he might be guilty it was not her part to speak in his defense though she felt she was acting treacherously she could not stand up for him  it is possible that the police were wrong about cyril she said at length  im afraid not said jernyngham it might be urged that prescott has come back but i believe that was only to sell his wheat he broke into a harsh laugh one must admit that the fellow has courage but he wont find it easy to escape again every move of his will be watched  gertrude sat very still for a few moments her lips tightly pressed together then she made a gesture of weariness  oh she said its all so hard to bear theres nothing but doubt and suspense not a ray of comfort  getting up languidly she went out and left her father lost in thought  an hour or two afterward prescott sat near the stove in his homestead moodily making entries in an accountbook when he heard voices in the passage and looked up with a start the next moment the door opened and muriel hurst came in his heart throbbed furiously at the sight of her she looked excited and eager her rich furs enhanced her charm he thought she made a wonderfully attractive picture in the small simply furnished room but he laid a strong restraint upon himself as he rose  i felt that i had to come i wanted to show that your friends still trusted you she said impulsively  he made no move to bring her a chair  it was a generous thought but considering everything i dont know that it was wise did you tell colston or your sister that you were coming  no she answered with a trace of confusion i left rather in a hurry then she broke into a forced laugh this isnt the welcome i expected  prescotts eyes gleamed  you know im glad to see you  well she said sitting down with a hint of defiance in her air thats the most important thing though the confession had to be extorted from you it looked as if you wanted to get rid of me  i felt i ought to  muriel looked at him with amusement  duty against inclination its a pity the former was beaten but arent you falling into our way of thinking rather fast  that isnt strange ive had english ideas impressed on me pretty forcibly during the last few months but you made a statement that surprised me does colston trust me  he wants to  that implies a doubt and your sister is she on my side  shes reserving her opinion  you cant say that the jernynghams are convinced of my innocence  no said muriel i think theyre cruelly and unreasonably bitter  then that leaves only one person with unshaken faith his eyes rested on the girl with deep gratitude and tenderness miss hurst i think i may say its quite enough  she looked up fearlessly with heightened color  we wont pay each other compliments will you tell me why you went away  yes i went to look for cyril jernyngham  muriel made an abrupt movement and her eyes sparkled with relief which she did not try to hide  oh she said thats such a complete explanation it answers everything but why didnt you tell people the reason you were going you must have known that stealing away as you did would count against you  i told miss jernyngham  gertrude knew muriel started then her face hardened after all that doesnt matter there are much more important things you didnt find cyril  i followed him across three provinces and lost him in the end  ah she said how unfortunate how terribly disappointing but tell me all you did im not asking from mere curiosity she hesitated i think you owe me that  he told her the story of his wanderings and what he had learned about kermodes adventures she listened with eager attention and laughed now and then  its convincing on the face of it she declared one feels that everything is exactly what cyril jernyngham must have done will you tell his father  no prescott answered gravely he wouldnt believe the tale  but i feel it cant be doubted after what i have heard of cyrils character and his conduct in england  you have an open mind i think you hate injustice you try to be fair that i guess is why you came to see me  muriel glanced at him sharply and then smiled  i suppose it was i felt that you have been badly treated but i only meant to stay a minute or two and you seem to be busy  he did not deny it conscious as he was of her charm and his longing for her he feared to detain her lest he should be driven into some rash avowal  im very grateful for your confidence he answered slowly  well said muriel i must go she rose but stood still a moment mr prescott it hurts me to see suspicion fall on my friends you must clear yourself somehow  ah he said moodily how am i to set about it  for one thing you must not go away again that would look bad she hesitated and from a few words i heard i fear it would bring the police after you  it seems very probable ill stay while im allowed he said with some bitterness and turned toward the door with her then a little color crept into his face as she held out her hand miss hurst he added you are a very staunch friend  muriel smiled  it really looks as if staunchness were one of my virtues but you see i venture to act on my opinions without paying much attention to what other people think after all that would be foolish wouldnt it  then she got into the sleigh and left him wondering what she could have meant he knew her friends regarded him as a man of inferior station who if cleared from suspicion might perhaps be tolerated so long as he recognized his limitations and did not presume had muriel wished to hint that she differed from them in this respect the thought of it set his heart to beating fast and when he went back to his books he found it singularly difficult to fix his mind on them  muriel drove rapidly to the leslie homestead and reaching it after dark joined the others at supper during the meal a reference to jernynghams interview with the police officer gave her the opportunity she was waiting for  when mr prescott went away it told badly against him because people didnt know what his object was she said  she fixed her eyes on gertrude but the latters face was expressionless as she moved her plate  he went to find cyril she added  mrs colston looked up sharply her husband started  if true its a strong point in his favor colston declared  gertrude still made no sign but her father broke into an incredulous smile  an excellent motive its a pity he didnt mention it before he went it would have carried more weight then  there was an awkward silence and then muriel said firmly  still that was why he went away  jernyngham looked hard at her and made a gesture which suggested that the matter would not bear discussion then colston began to talk to her and he was glad when the meal was finished muriel waited until she found gertrude alone in her room  you knew mr prescott went to look for your brother and yet you would not say a word she said  ah exclaimed gertrude sharply so you have seen him you drove over this afternoonone might have expected that  muriels eyes sparkled but she answered calmly  yes i went to see him but youre evading the point what reason could you have had for trying to injure an innocent man  gertrude made an uneasy movement  arent you taking too much for granted to begin with his innocence is very doubtful  yet i think you must have been convinced of it that he told you why he was going proves that you were on friendly terms which would have been impossible if you had thought him guilty what has made you change  the girls voice was stingingly scornful it looked as if she suspected something and gertrude broke into a cold smile  oh she said the man is clever he has a way of creeping into ones confidence he appears to have had no trouble in gaining yours after all however if my father is right i have a duty to my brothers memory  your father is so possessed and carried away by an idea that one can almost forgive him his injustice and cruelty you have not the same excuse  gertrude turned toward her with a formal manner  i think you have gone far enough do you intend to tell the others what you have said to me  oh no answered muriel it would serve no purpose but i feel that sooner or later you will be sorry for what you have done  then she went out leaving gertrude alone with her reflections     chapter xxi  wandle takes precautions   bright sunshine streamed down upon the glittering plain tempering the frost when wandle stood outside his house one morning wondering how he should employ himself during the day he had hauled his wheat in to the elevators and when that is done the western farmer has now and then some leisure because the frozen ground renders many of his usual operations impossible wandle had a stack of cordwood ready cut and though he needed some logs for an addition to his stable which he meant to build the thinness of the snow which had been disturbed by a strong wind would make the work of hauling them home too difficult he was however an active man who rarely wasted time or money and as he looked about the ashheap caught his eye it was rather large and near his house and he determined to remove it now that he had nothing better to do  in a few minutes he was hard at work with a pick and succeeded with some difficulty in breaking through the frozen crust the moisture however had not penetrated far enough into the fine woodash for the rest to freeze so that he was soon able to use the shovel and during the next halfhour he flung a quantity of the stuff into his wagon as he did so he looked out for jernynghams cashbox and grew surprised when it did not appear when he had hauled the load away and deposited it in a swampy place he was getting anxious the box could not have escaped his notice because he had spread the ash thinly he had he thought dug far enough into the pile to have reached it but there was still no sign of it this was disconcerting and he worked until he had largely reduced the heap and he scattered the next load so that every bit of rubbish among it could be seen then he stopped in dismay to think he had certainly thrown the box among the ash and it was gone the only inference was that somebody had afterward dug it up and taken it away  wandle realized this with a shock but he was too keenwitted to give way to alarm and leave his task unfinished he must remove the whole pile in order to give no cause for suspicion that he had been excavating in search of something and the sooner it was done the better it was noon when the work was finished and he entered the house where there was something else to be done he was a methodical man and had a place for each of his belongings he began by examining the position of every article in a cupboard none seemed to have been disturbed which was reassuring and wandle proceeded to empty a chest in which he kept his clothing he had reached the bottom of it when a pair of light summer shoes caught his eye and his face became intent they were not where he had placed them he remembered having fitted them in between some other things at the opposite end of the chest this confirmed his worst suspicions but he carefully laid back each garment before he sat down to consider  it was obvious that the police had searched his house and had taken the cashbox away but he was careful not to let his fears overcome his judgment the box was of a cheap and common pattern it would be difficult to identify it as having belonged to jernyngham he was more troubled by the evidence that he was being watched by the police because it might result in their discovering the sale of land he had made this must be guarded against as the offense was serious and would moreover connect him with jernynghams disappearance but wandle would not be driven into any rash and precipitate action by his alarm he was a cool readywitted avaricious man who had found industry profitable and he had no intention of leaving the farm he had spent so much work on flight would mean ruin he could not dispose of his property before he went without attracting attention and it would in all probability lead to his arrest he must stay and face the matter out  first of all he tried to estimate the risk of his being recognized as the man who had sold jernynghams land if the suspicions of the agent he had dealt with were aroused he might describe his customer to the police wandle was glad his appearance was by no means striking when he sold the land he had however worn a newly made suit of a rather vivid brown which the man would probably remember wandle had bought it on a business visit to brandon which was a long way off and the police could not have seen it when searching his house because they had done so in his absence and when he left the farm to drive in to the settlement he had put on the clothes there was a risk that somebody in sebastian might remember how he was dressed but as he had been there only once or twice in the past few months he did not think it was likely  the garments would have to be sacrificed which was unfortunate because clothing is dear in western canada but wandle thought of a better means of getting rid of them than destroying them it was obvious that the suspicions of the police must fall on himself or prescott and he preferred that the latter should be implicated after a while he saw what could be done provided there was wind enough to obliterate his footsteps in the snow or there should be another fall  he had to wait a few days and then one evening he made up the clothes into a bundle saddled a horse and rode off across the prairie toward the prescott homestead it was very cold and he would have been more comfortable wrapped in a drivingrobe in his buggy but the moon now and then shone through the rifts in the clouds and a rig could not be hidden or driven in among thick trees  a long bluff ran close up to the homestead and when wandle reached its outer end he got down and walked beside his horse keeping the wood between him and the farm trail it was important that he should not be seen the horse would attract no attention because prescott had a number and hardy rangebred horses are often left to run loose through the winter still clear moonlight streamed through between the slender trees and there was a glow from the windows of the house as wandle drew nearer it he moved with greater caution he was fortunate in having done so for he stopped with a start as two black mounted figures cut against the sky not far in front of him they were clearly visible as they crossed an opening and though he stood in shadow beside a denser growth of trees his heart beat faster as he watched them they were riding slowly keeping out of view of the house which was significant because had they been neighbors of prescotts returning from a visit to him they would have taken no trouble to avoid being seen these were police troopers watching the homestead  presently one of them spoke to the other and wandle recognized private stantons voice indeed it was ominously distinct and wandle standing very still with a firm hand on the bridle passed a few anxious moments a movement of his horse might betray him the troopers however drew abreast without glancing toward him and the tension slackened as they slowly moved away what they expected to find he could not tell but he was on the whole pleased to see them hanging round the bluff he waited a while after the faint sound they had made died away and then tying his horse to a branch he crept quietly into the bluff  there were belts of shadow among the trees he got entangled among nut bushes and thickets but creeping on toward the house he reached a more open space and found a hollow nearly filled with withered leaves there he stopped wondering whether it would be safe to strike a match but he knew that something must be risked and he got a light and bent down shielding it with his hands the leaves lay thickly together a foot or two in depth and the place looked suitable for his purpose  a stream of light suddenly broke out from the door of the homestead and wandles hand closed quickly on the match somebody was crossing from the house to the stable with a lantern he could see the mans dark figure plainly though he could not recognize him and he waited until a door was noisily opened then he scraped the leaves aside and laid the brown clothes in the hollow he stayed beside it until the man with the lantern returned to the house and then he crept back through the bluff and led his horse toward its end where he mounted and rode to the next farm after spending an hour with its owner arranging for a journey to a bluff where unusually large logs could be found he rode home content everything had gone as he wished there would he thought be snow enough before morning to cover any tracks he had left and he could if necessary account for his having been in the neighborhood of the prescott farm  during the next week wandle watched the weather which continued fine after a few snow showers a heavy fall might hide the clothes until spring but he could think of no means of leading up to their discovery to give the police a hint would fix their suspicions on himself and he wondered how one could be conveyed to them indirectly chance provided him with an opportunity  gertrude jernyngham borrowed leslies team one afternoon and set out for a drive troubled as she was she had of late found the strain of maintaining a tranquil demeanor before her friends growing too much for her and it was trying to spend the greater portion of her time in muriels society she was filled with a jealous hatred of the girl and felt that it would be a relief to be alone a while the air was still bright sunshine flooded the plain the thick drivingrobe kept her comfortably warm and lost in painful thought she had driven farther than she intended when she turned back on doing so she noticed that she had left the beaten trail and she looked about timidly the sun was low a gray dimness had crept across the eastern half of the prairie where the homestead lay and a piercing wind was springing up there was nobody in sight and no sign of a house and she could not remember which of the bluffs that stretched in wavy lines across the waste she had passed  she drove on toward the east eagerly looking for the trail while the horse broke through the thin snowcrust and the sleigh ran heavily until she reached a slope leading to a frozen swamp it was of some extent and she grew anxious for she had not seen the spot before the country ahead was more broken rolling in low rises with short pines on their summits and it was with unfeigned satisfaction that she saw a man crossing one of the ridges he answered when she called and in a few minutes she stopped close beside him he was a tall man wearing an old fur coat and dilapidated fur cap a rancher she thought  can you tell me where leslies house is she asked  sure said wandle pointing toward the east but as it will be dark before you get there you had better let me put you on the trail youll have to cross these sandhills and as the snows blown off in places its rough traveling  gertrude thanked him and she was glad that he led the team as they crossed the broken belt picking out the smoothest course among the clumps of birches and low steep ridges at times he had difficulty in urging the horses up a bank of frozen sand but after a while he looked around at her  youre miss jernyngham he said guess you must have had a mighty trying time  his tone was respectful and though he was a stranger gertrude could not resent the allusion to her troubles she had generally found the western ranchers blunt  yes she replied my father and i have had much to bear  wandle made a gesture of sympathy  the mysterys the worstits easier to face a trouble one knows all about what have the police been doing lately  i dont know they have told us nothing for some time  you find them kind of disappointing  i believe my father does  the man said nothing for a while and then looked around again  well he ventured it strikes me theres one man curtis ought to keep his eye on  gertrude started and wandle studied her face he was observant and quick to draw a conclusion and he read something that surprised him in her eyes it was he thought a deeper feeling than suspicion miss jernyngham knew whom he meant and had some reason for being very bitter against prescott  why do you say that she asked  all ive heard looks black against him he answered with an air of reflection what does your father think  he is perplexed and distressed said gertrude coldly deciding that the man must not be allowed to go too far  wandle guessed her thoughts but he was not to be daunted  thats natural he must be anxious to learn the truth and the police havent found out much yetlooks as if they were getting tired  gertrude hesitated while he led the horses round a clump of birches it was painful and undignified to discuss the matter with a stranger but his manner was suggestive she felt that he had something to tell perhaps it was her duty to encourage him and her suspicions of prescott drove her on wandle waited knowing that she would speak  is there anything that might be useful they have neglected doing  its hard to say ill allow that theyve worked through the muskeg and the bluffs pretty thoroughly but do you know if theyve made a good search round prescotts house  no said gertrude eagerly i cant tell you that but why should they look there  wandle considered it would be awkward if she mentioned that she had had a hint from him but he did not think this would happen there was a greater probability of her acting as if the idea had originated with her he let the team stop and looked at her impressively  it strikes me as quite a likely place ive heard of people hiding things they wanted to get rid of in a bluff you put it to your father and see how the notion strikes him  ill think of it gertrude replied coldly but wandle knew that she would do as he had suggested  he said nothing further until they had crossed another rise or two when he stopped and pointed to a bluff not far away  when you make those trees youll strike the trail and its pretty well beaten it will take you straight in to leslies  gertrude thanked him and drove on it was getting dark and a bitter wind swept the waste but at first she was scarcely conscious of the cold for her thoughts were busy she felt that she had done wrong in allowing the man to make the suggestion somehow it seemed to involve her in a plot against prescott but of late she had tried to convince herself of his guilt after all it was her duty to have the fullest investigation made and the fellow had spoken in a significant manner one could imagine that he knew more than he had said  darkness closed in on the empty plain the wind stung her face the loneliness grew intense and she began to shiver in a mood of black depression the mystery of her brothers disappearance filled her with keen anxiety now she could no longer believe prescotts assurance that he was not dead a little while ago she had trusted him and her cold nature had suddenly expanded in the warmth of love but the transforming glow had suddenly died out leaving her crushed humiliated and very bitter even if her fears about cyril proved unfounded she had nothing to look forward to except a life that had grown meaningless and dreary the brief passion she had yielded to would never be stirred again she was growing hard and cruel her keenest desire was to punish the man who had as she thought of it deceived her  at length a light began to blink in the gloom ahead and soon afterward she got down at the homestead feeling very cramped and cold but an hour or two passed before she had an opportunity for speaking to her father alone it was easy to lead him on to talk of cyrils disappearance and by and by she asked if the neighborhood of prescotts homestead had been searched he caught at the idea  its hard to understand why i didnt think of that he cried i have lost all confidence in curtis what he is doing or if he means to let the matter drop i dont know but if prescott has hidden anything that might tell against him it will of course be in the bluff ill go over and examine every hollow among the bushes without the police  his expression grew eager and gertrude knowing that she had said enough left him quietly     chapter xxii  jernyngham makes a discovery   a piercing wind swept the lonely waste when jernyngham left the homestead in the afternoon he went on foot because it was no great distance to the prescott farm and he had no wish to attract notice by driving up in the sleigh it was his intention to enter the bluff quietly a little while before it got dark and after searching it to walk home by doing so he would run less risk of being seen for it was undesirable that he should put prescott on his guard he had said nothing about his plan to any one except gertrude which was unfortunate because leslie who could read the signs of the weather would have dissuaded him  jernyngham felt uneasy as he glanced across the plain there was something unusual in the light every clump of scrub and bush in the foreground stood out with a curious hard distinctness though the distance was blurred and dim there was no horizon the bluffs a few miles off had faded into a hazy shapelessness the sky was uniformly gray except in the north where it darkened to a deep leaden color the cold struck through the man like a knife he was however not to be deterred snow was coming and a heavy fall might make an effective search impossible for the remainder of the winter there was something inexorable in his nature his views were narrow but he was true to them and ruled himself and his dependents in accordance with a few fixed principles this was why he had driven out his son and was now with the same grim consistency bent on avenging him he had a duty and he meant to discharge it in spite of raging blizzard or biting frost indeed if need be he was willing to lay down the dreary life which had of late grown valueless to him yet he was not without tenderness and as he plodded on over the frozen snow he thought of the lost outcast with wistful regret  he reached the bluff and stopped a few moments slightly breathless among the first of the trees they were small and their branches cut in sharp intricate tracery against the sky farther back the rows of slender trunks ran together in a hazy mass though they failed to keep out the wind and once or twice a fine flake touched the old mans face with a cold that stung he pulled his fur cap lower down and set about the search for half an hour he scrambled among thick nut bushes kicking aside the snow beneath them here and there and then he plunged kneedeep into the withered grass where a sloo had dried the snow was thin in the wood but it hid the ironhard ground so that he could not tell if it had been disturbed it was obvious that the chances were against his discovering anything but he persevered working steadily nearer to the homestead of which he once or twice caught a glimpse where the trees were thinner  at length he stopped suddenly and cast a quick glance around he had heard a sharp crack behind him but it was not repeated and there was little to be seen while he listened the wind wailed among the branches and the sloo grass rustled eerily the patch of sky above him was growing darker and the wood looked inexpressibly dreary but as the light was going there was more reason for his making use of it though he was getting tired he pushed on avoiding fallen trunks and branches where he could and floundering through thickets he came to a small hollow which traversed the bluff as it was nearly filled with drifted snow he stepped down upon its white surface and breaking through sank above his boots in withered leaves these he thought would effectively hide anything laid among them until it rotted and crumbled into their decay he followed up the hollow kicking the snow aside he fancied that he heard the snapping sound again but he was too eager to feel much curiosity about the cause of it and there was nothing to be seen the light was dying out rapidly heavy snow was coming and he must make the best use of his time  after a while his foot struck something which did not yield as the leaves had done and dropping on his knees he dragged it out a thrill of excitement ran through him as he saw that is was a suit of clothes and made out in the gathering dusk that their color was brown then as he rose with grim satisfaction he saw with a start two indistinct figures watching him a dozen yards away they moved forward and he recognized the first of them as curtis  mr jernyngham said the corporal  yes said jernyngham who did you think it was  well returned curtis dryly we didnt expect to find you what brought you here  ive been doing your work with more success than seems to have attended your efforts he pointed to the clothes to my mind this is conclusive  an icy blast that set them shivering went roaring through the wood but they were too intent to heed it and curtis picked up one of the garments he could see only that it was a jacket for darkness was closing in suddenly  ill allow its kind of suggestive he admitted guardedly  jernyngham broke into a contemptuous laugh  how was the man who sold my sons land dressed  smartly in new clothes the land agent remembered that they were a reddish brown  thats the color of the thing in your hand there was more light when i pulled it out of the leaves yonder are you convinced now  its certainly enough to make one think  to think but not to act you seem strangely content with the former isnt it plain that prescott sold the land and then remembering that he had worn a suit of rather unusual color which might help to identify him hid it in the bluff having other people in the house he was no doubt afraid to burn the clothes  curtis folded up the garments and laid them on his arm  well he said it sounds quite probable but there are discrepancies ill take these things along and i guess you had better make for the homestead and ask them to let you in well have a lively blizzard down on us very soon  the trees bent above him as he spoke the wood was filled with sound and fine flakes drove past in swirls then as the wild gust subsided they heard a galloping horse going by outside the bluff and curtis swung sharply round toward his comrade  its that blamed ranger of yours broken loose he cried get after him with my horse  the next moment the police had vanished and jernyngham was left alone listening to the crackle of undergrowth which was lost in a furious uproar as the wood was swept by another gust then the thrashing trees were blotted out by a white haze which stung his face with an intolerable cold and filled his eyes for a minute or two he could see nothing though he was conscious of a tumult of sound and broken twigs came raining down upon him then lowering his head he stumbled forward between blurred trees ignorant of where he was going he struck one or two of the trees and blundered into thickets but at last he struggled out of the wood and stopped for a few moments in dismay  the light had gone he could scarcely see a yard ahead through the thick white cloud that rushed past him the wind buffeted him cruelly threatening to fling him down the awful cold dulled his senses he had not intended to seek shelter at the homesteadthe idea was repugnantand he hardly thought he meant to do so now but overwhelmed by the blizzard he could not stand still and freeze struggling heavily forward he found himself in the open all trace of the wood had vanished he could not tell where he was heading but he must continue moving to keep life in him he could no longer reason collectedly he had not been trained to physical endurance and he was getting old in the grip of the storm he was helpless by and by his steps grew feebler and his breath harder to get how long he stumbled on he could not remember but at length he was sensible of a faint brightness in the snow ahead and he made toward it in a halfdazed fashion it seemed to die out leaving him in a state of dull despair but a few moments later something barred his way and stretching out his mittened hand it fell upon the lapped boarding of a house there must be a door he reasoned and he groped along the wall until his hand fell forward into a shallow recess then he knocked savagely  there was no response the gale shrieked about the building flinging the snow against it in clouds and he realized that any noise he made was not likely to be heard he fumbled for a latch and found a knob which his numbed fingers failed to turn then in a fury he struck the door again each blow growing feebler than the last until the cold overcame him and he slipped down into the snow he could not get up even the desire to do so grew fainter and he sank into oblivion  it did not last however and the return to consciousness was agonizing a strong light shone about him though he could see nothing clearly and he felt as if a boiling fluid were trying to creep through his halffrozen limbs his hands and feet in particular tingled beyond endurance which had he known it was a favorable sign then somebody gave him a hot drink and he heard voices which he vaguely recognized though he could not tell to whom they belonged a little later he was lifted up and carried into a different room where somebody laid him down and wrapped clothing about him the tingling pain passed away he felt delightfully warm and that was all that he was conscious of as he sank into heavy slumber  it was daylight when he awakened clearheaded and comfortable and recognized the room as the one he had previously occupied in prescotts house it was obvious that he had slept for twelve or fourteen hours and seeing his clothes laid out dry upon a chair he got up and dressed then he went down to the livingroom where prescott rose as he came in  you dont look much the worse the rancher said you had a fortunate escape  how did i get here jernyngham asked leaning on the back of a chair for he felt shaky still  thats more than i can tell svendsen found you outside the door when he tried to get across to the stable you couldnt have been there long a few minutes i guess though we didnt hear you do your feet and hands feel right  jernyngham was glad that his host made no inquiries as to what had brought him into the neighborhood  thank you yes he said i must assure you that i had no intention of seeking shelter in your house  so i should imagine prescott answered smiling however there ought to be a truce between even the deadliest enemies where theres a blizzard raging and the temperatures forty below though i cant say you have treated me well im glad you didnt get frozen and if youll sit down ill tell mrs svendsen to bring you in some breakfast  with what there is between us you could hardly expect me to sit at your table  thats a comfortable chair you have your hand on bring it nearer the stove and lets try to look at the thing sensibly prescott persuaded ill confess that id have excused your visit if it could have been avoided but as you already owe svendsen and me something it would be rather forcing matters for you to drive away hungry that strikes me as about the limit of wrongheadedness particularly as im not suggesting that we should make friends  the elder man was possessed by a fixed idea and his prejudices were strong but he was nevertheless a judge of character and the ranchers manner impressed him he took the chair  i believe i owe my life to you or your hired man i find the situation embarrassing  it would be intolerable if you were not mistaken about another point prescott said calmly now i want your attention im not anxious for your good opinioni dont know that id take it as a gift after the way you have persecuted mebut ive a pity for you that softens my resentment  jernyngham moved abruptly but prescott raised his hand  let me get through i believe youre honest youre acting from a sense of duty which is why i tell you that youre tormenting yourself without a cause i had no hand in your sons disappearance and its my firm conviction that hes alive now and wandering through british columbia with a mineral prospector  what proof have you of this  none that would satisfy you nothing but my word and i give you that solemnly make your own inquires among my neighbors whether its to be believed  for several moments jernyngham fixed his eyes on him and his suspicions began to melt away truth had rung in prescotts voice and it was stamped on his face no man he thought could lie and look as this rancher did even the discovery of the brown clothes appeared less damaging  then theres much to be explained he said slowly  thats so it will all come to light some day and now its a bitter morning the drifts are deep and the trail lost in snow svendsen will have some trouble in driving you to leslies and you cant go without food  prescott called to mrs svendsen and she presently brought in breakfast jernyngham ate a little before he got into the buggy and was driven away he reached the leslie homestead greatly disturbed the painful mystery was as deep as ever but he was inclined to think he had been following a false clue the man on whom all his suspicions had centered might be innocent it was so seldom that he changed his mind that he felt lost in a maze of doubt and in his perplexity he told gertrude what he had found and related his conversation with prescott they were alone and she listened with fixed attention studiously hiding her feelings behind an inscrutable expression  i dont know what to think for perhaps the first time in my life im utterly at a loss and need a lead he said everything we have learned about the man tells against him and yet i felt i could not doubt his unsupported assurance there was a genuine pride in the way he referred me to his neighbors for his character for truthfulness and one must admit that a number of them have an unshakable belief in him then colstons wavering and muriel has shown her confidence in the fellow in a striking manner  ah said gertrude sharply you have noticed that  i could hardly fail to do so it is no affair of mine and perhaps a breach of good manners to mention it but if i were in colstons place i should feel disturbed about the way in which his sisterinlaw has taken prescotts part  why  the reason should be obvious leaving the mans guilt or innocence out of the question there is his position i neednt enlarge on it muriels family is an old and honored one it would be insufferable that she should break away from its traditions then we know what her upbringing has been could one calmly contemplate her throwing herself away on a working farmer  he had appealed to his daughters strongest prejudices which had for a while sunk into abeyance and then sprung into life again all that he had said about muriel applied with equal force to her she had yielded to a mad infatuation and returning sanity had brought her a crushing sense of shame she might have made a costly sacrifice for the ranchers sake flinging away all she had hitherto valued she had sought him humbled herself to charm him and he had never spared a tender thought for her despising herself her jealous rage and wounded pride could only be appeased by his punishment  prescott she said coldly is a dangerous man i have never met anybody so insinuating and plausible when he speaks to you its very hard to disbelieve him his manners convincing  i felt that said her father with a troubled air  then shouldnt it put you on your guard and make you test his statements is it wise to let them influence you before theyre confirmed  it was foolish of me to be impressed but still  gertrude checked him  with us suspicion is a duty try to think cyril had his failings but you were harsh to him you showed him no pity you drove him out  its true admitted jernyngham in a hoarse voice ive regretted it deeply  she knew she had not appealed in vain to her fathers grief and she meant to work upon his desire for retribution  cyril came here and fell into prescotts hands instead of his meeting colston the rancher personated him he was the last man to see him he knew where he had hidden his money soon afterward he bought a costly machine  i know all this said jernyngham wearily  there seems to be some danger of your forgetting it let me go on prescott took over control of cyrils farm he passed himself off for him a second time and sold land of his you found the clothes he wore hidden near his house could you have any proofs more conclusive  jernyngham flung her a swift glance  you believed him once you are very bitter now  yes she said i have admitted that he is plausible he deceived me perhaps that has made me more relentless but i have lost my brother and i loved him  her fathers face grew very stern and he clenched his hand  i have lost my son and i wronged him  then there was silence for a few moments but gertrude knew she had succeeded her father had been wavering but she had stirred him to passion and his thoughts had suddenly returned to the groove they would not leave again the fixed idea had once more possessed him unavailing sorrow and longing for justice would drive him on along the course he had chosen  you have reminded me of my duty he said with grim forcefulness i shall not fail in it  then he got up and left her sitting still lost in painful reflection his motives were honest and blameless but she had not this consolation she tried to find comfort in the thought that if prescott were innocent he had nothing to fear     chapter xxiii  a night ride   it was six oclock in the evening curtis had just finished his supper and sat drowsily content in his quarters at the police post after being out in the frost all day the temperature had steadily fallen since morning and the cold was now intensified by a breeze that drove scattered clouds across the moon and flung fine snow against the board walls but the stove which glowed a dull red kept the room comfortable a nickeled lamp shed down a cheerful light and the tired corporal looked forward to a long nights rest private stanton sat near him cleaning a carbine  its curious you have heard nothing from regina since you sent up those clothes he remarked it looked pretty bad for prescott  i dont know said curtis have you ever seen him with that suit on  no  nor has anybody else so far as i can learn theres another pointthe land agent talked of a tall stoutish man you wouldnt call prescott that  those clothes were most as good as new he might have only had them on the once stanton persisted  thats what struck me i dont know how they looked so good if theyd been lying where jernyngham found them since last summer  its a thing i might have thought of  you have a good deal to learn yet curtis smiled tolerantly  anyhow i found you a photograph of prescott and you were glad to send it along to regina what do you think our bosses are doing about it  lying low like sensible men the more we find out about this case the more puzzling it gets you think you have pretty good eyes dont you  theyre as good as anybodys ive come across yet  well you searched the bluff several times in daylight and didnt see those clothes jernyngham comes along when it is getting dark and finds them how do you account for that  ive quit guessing ill leave the thing to you anyhow ive had about enough of jernyngham talked to me like a sergeant instructor last time i met him and youd have felt proud if youd seen the way he smiled when i told him he had better go to you  well leave it at that said curtis the mans making me tired and hes worse than he was a month ago wheres that brandon paper  while stanton looked for it there was a sound of wheels and a hail outside and a stinging draught swept in when the trooper opened the door a furwrapped man sat in a wagon holding up an envelope  for curtis come for it he said operator asked me to bring it along im most too cold to get down and i cant let the team stand  the envelope slipped from his numbed fingers as stanton tried to take it  dropped near the wheel my hands most frozen though ive good thick mittens on its about the coldest night ive been out in  he drove on and stanton hurried in and flung the door to before he handed the telegram to curtis  when the corporal opened it his face grew intent  its from sergeant crane he said glover was seen this morning near norton heading east on the sand belt trail  stantons face fell he had been in the saddle the greater part of the day and the prospect of spending the night in pursuit of glover did not appeal to him though he knew it could not be avoided the man was a notorious thief whose last exploit had shown some ingenuity appearing at the house of a prosperous farmer he had shown him a letter from a railroad contractor asking for the use of his best clydesdale team on tempting terms the farmer let the horses go and saw no more of them while the contractor repudiated the letter glover was also supposed to have had a hand in one or two more serious affairs  i guess well have to get after him said the trooper wherell he make for  jepsons sure i dont know another house near the sand belt he could reach tonight and jepsons most as slippery a tough as glover is  its a mighty long ride said stanton my ranger will stand for it i dont know about your gray  hell have to make it curtis answered shortly get your saddle on  when stanton went out curtis stood up regretfully for he was aching from a long journey in the stinging cold and the room looked very comfortable an effort was required to leave it and he had not much expectation of making a capture that would stand to his credit jepson and his brother were cunning rogues glover had escaped once or twice already and curtis realized that the chances were in favor of his returning after a fruitless ride nevertheless his duty was plain he had been trained to disregard fatigue and most physical weaknesses and he went out resignedly into the arctic frost  they set off a few minutes later and curtis had the depressing feeling that he was riding a wornout mount though there was some consolation in the thought that the range of the service carbine might in case of necessity make up for his lack of speed when he met the biting north wind that swept the plain the warmth seemed to leave his body his mittened hands stiffened on the bridle and it was only resolution that kept him in the saddle he would run less risk of frostbite if he walked but time would not permit this and the claims of the service are more important than the loss of a troopers feet or hands if he were crippled and incapacitated there was a small pension it was his business to face the risks of the weather  they rode on with lowered heads fine snow stinging their faces now and then and though its touch was inexpressibly painful they were glad they retained the power of feeling when that went more serious trouble would begin for a while a half moon shone down and their black shadows sped on before them across the glittering plain but by and by clouds drove up and the prairie grew dim it changed to a stretch of soft grayishblue with the trail they followed running across it a narrow stretch of darker color the light however was not wholly obscured they could see a bluff stand out a bank of shadow a mile away once they saw the cheerful lights of a farm in the distance and a longing for warmth and the company of their fellowcreatures seized them but this was a desire that must be subdued and leaving the beaten trail they pressed on into the waste save for the faint doleful sound the wind made it was dauntingly silent and desolate there was not a bush to break its gray surface and the frost was intense they bore it uncomplainingly for an hour or two and then stanton broke out  ill have to get down or ill lose my foot ill run a while beside my horse and then catch you up  curtis nodded and trotted on breasting the wind which so far as he could judge from his sensations was turning him into ice he could hear stanton behind him but that was the only sound of life in the vast desolation after a while the trooper came up at a gallop and curtis called to him sharply  any better  no feeling in my foot yet said stanton im anxious about it but i couldnt drop too far behind you we have no time to lose  thats so curtis answered glover will pull out from jepsons long before morning he wont rest much until hes a days ride from the nearest post  they went on and some time later the moon shone through again flooding the plain with light it was welcome because they were now entering the sand belt where scrub trees were scattered among little hills pushing through it they came to a taller ridge late at night and curtis drew bridle on its summit a faint warm gleam appeared on the snow about a mile away  jepsons said curtis looks as if he had some reason for sitting up quite a while after he ought to be in bed  stanton glanced thoughtfully down the slope in front it was smooth and unbroken a long gradual descent and he knew the farm stood on the flat at its foot a straggling poplar bluff grew close up to the back of the buildings but there was nothing that would cover the approach of the police and he had no doubt that a watch was being kept  its a pity the moons so bright he remarked theres a cloud or two driving up but i dont know that theyll cover it  we cant wait this is my notionyoull turn back a piece and work down to the ravine that runs east behind the homestead stop when you can find cover and watch out well ill have to ride straight in  you want to be careful therell be three of them in the place counting glover and theyre a tough crowd  curtis smiled  jepson has a pretty long head hell bluff if he can but he wont get himself into trouble for his partner the things not serious enough for that  anyway you want to keep your eye on them stanton persisted gloverll sure make for the ravine if he breaks out  turning his horse he disappeared behind the ridge while curtis rode on toward the farm glancing up at the moon he saw that the clouds were nearer it though he could not be certain that they would obscure the light this was unfortunate because he knew that he and his horse would stand out sharply against the smooth expanse of snow the light ahead grew brighter as he trotted on urging his jaded mount in order to give the inmates of the homestead as short a warning as possible suddenly another patch of brightness appeared it was a narrow streak at first but it widened into an oblong and then went out somebody had opened the door of the homestead and the next moment the first gleam faded and all was dark curtis was inclined to think this a mistake on jepsons part but he kept a very keen watch as the buildings grew into plainer shape against the shadowy bluff he knew he must have been visible some minutes earlier  at length he rode up to the little square house which rose abruptly from the plain without fence or yard it was dark and silent and he was glad to remember that it had only one door though there were one or two buildings close behind it he was so numbed that it was difficult to dismount but he got down clumsily and beat on the door for several minutes without getting an answer this confirmed his suspicions for he was convinced that jepson had heard his vigorous knocking then the moonlight which might have been useful now died away and the plain faded into obscurity curtis was making another attack on the door when a window above was flung up and a man leaned out holding what looked suggestively like a rifle  stand back from that door he cried what in thunder do you want  drop your gun said curtis come down right now and let me in  i guess not if you dont light out of this mighty quick youll get hurt  quit fooling jepson you know who i am  seem to know your voice now said the other leaning farther out why its curtis he laid down the rifle and laughed you were near getting plugged figured you were one of those blamed rustlersthe countrys full of thembarton back at the muskeg lost a steer last week what i want to know iswhy the police dont get after them guess it would be considerably more useful than walking round the stations with a quirt under your arm  the man was not talkative as a rule and curtis surmised that he wished to delay him  come down he said sternly  ill be along quick as i can the other answered and shut the window  while he waited curtis listened with strained attention he was inclined to think that glover had already left the house which must nevertheless be searched but he could hear nothing except the dreary wail of wind in the neighboring bluff his fingers were so numbed that he could scarcely hold his carbine his horse stood wearily with drooping head and when a minute or two had passed curtis struck the door violently it opened and jepson stood in the entrance holding a lamp  all alone he remarked goodhumoredly wheres your partner but come in its fierce tonight  then stand out of my way ive come for glover  jepson laughed  looked as if you were after somebody he isnt here but you had better see for yourself walk right in youre welcome to find him  the house contained four small rooms which had nothing in them that would hide a man and in a minute or two curtis sprang out of the door and scrambled to his saddle he did not think glover would seek refuge in any of the outbuildings and he rode toward the thin bluff that hid the ravine the man might have reached the trees unseen by keeping the house between himself and the slope down which curtis had come he had not left the house long before he heard the sharp drumming of a gallop and drove his horse at the belt of timber all had turned out as he had expected stanton had headed off glover as he slipped away down the ravine and the outlaw had broken out to the north making for a tract of lonely bluffstrewn country he was now between the corporal and the trooper and his capture might be looked for provided that curtiss mount could bear a sharp gallop which was doubtful  the sides of the ravine were steep and clothed with brush there were fallen logs in the fringing bluff but curtis urged his jaded horse mercilessly toward the timber and went through it with rotten branches smashing under him once or twice the beast stumbled but it kept its feet and in a few more moments they reeled down the declivity a fall might result in the riders getting a broken leg and afterward freezing to death but curtis took risks of this nature lightly and reaching the bottom safely somewhat to his surprise he struggled up the opposite ascent  from the summit he saw two dark mounted figures pressing across the open plain some distance apart by riding straight out from the ravine he thought that he could cut off the leader his weariness had fallen from him the mad drumming of hoofs fired his blood and as he burst out of the timber at a gallop the moon came through the fugitive seemed to hear him for he altered his course a littlehe could not swerve much without approaching stantonand for a few minutes curtis shortened the distance between them then his horse began to flag it looked as if glover might escape after all though he must still draw nearer to the trooper before he got away  curtis roughly calculating speed and distance pulled up his horse springing from the saddle he flung himself down in the snow and for a few seconds gripped his carbine tight then there was a flash and little spirts of snow leaped up one after another ahead of the outlaw curtis pressed down the rear sight and fired again but glover was still riding hard with stanton dropping behind him at the third shot glovers horse went down in a struggling heap hiding its rider a few moments later the man reappeared and began to run but he stopped as stanton came down on him at a gallop and curtis got up hastily glover made a sign of submission and the next minute stanton sprang to the ground beside him  hold up your hands he ordered sharply and there was a clink as the irons snapped to  after that the trooper turned to curtis who was hurrying toward them  lend me your carbine mines clean  he walked to the fallen horse which was struggling feebly and stooping down he examined it then there was a crash and a puff of smoke and he rejoined the corporal  nothing else that could be done he explained  curtis spoke to the prisoner  come along you had better not try to break away  they went back to the homestead where they found jepson waiting for them he looked disturbed  i told you he wasnt here he said how was i to know he was hiding in the ravine  curtis gave him a searching glance  well consider that later i want your team and wagon some blankets and drivingrobes  am i bound to outfit the police  i guess you had better your records none too good  he led his prisoner into the kitchen where the stove was burning and laying his carbine on the table he loosed the handcuffs and bade the man take off his long coat  go through his pockets stanton he said  the trooper did as he was told but nothing of any importance was produced the man was not armed and there were only a few silver coins and bills for small amounts in his possession curtis stood wearily regarding him with a thoughtful smile  where did you get that jacket glover he asked  where do you generally get such things at the store  just so said curtis i cant see why you didnt buy one that fitted you he turned suddenly to jepson bring me his jacket  the farmer made an abrupt movement and then seemed to pull himself up and stood still  ive no use for that kind of fooling he has it on  i dont think so said curtis meaningly give stanton a light and hell look for it  the trooper came back in a few minutes with a garment which he had found under a bed and curtis bade him put it on the prisoner  right size same stuff as the trousers and worn about as much he remarked now you can take it off and search it  there was nothing in the pockets but after a careful examination stanton felt a lump inside the lining he ripped that and took out a wad of carefully folded bills on opening them he found that they were for twenty dollars each and clean the corporals face grew suddenly intent  where did you get them he asked  you can find out muttered glover who had shown signs of dismay  curtis turned to jepson  it looks as if he trusted you farther than i would but harness your team quick and if your brothers hanging round outside tell him that hell run up against trouble if he interferes  they sat down and waited until the farmer brought a wagon to the door and then they drove away through the stinging cold with their prisoner     chapter xxiv  muriel proves obdurate   some time after leaving jepsons curtis was joined by two police troopers despatched by the sergeant who had telegraphed to him he handed over his prisoner and the wagon to them though he asked permission to keep the wad of bills then stanton unhitched the jaded horses from the back of the vehicle and while the others drove back to the west he and curtis rode on to the post reaching it half frozen in the morning they filled up the stove and went to sleep until supper time when the meal was over they sat down to smoke and talk  stanton felt lazily goodhumored a sound sleep had refreshed him and though his limbs still ached he was enjoying the pleasant physical reaction which usually succeeds fatigue and exposure to the arctic frost what was better he had assisted in the successful completion of an arduous piece of work curtis lay back in a chair opposite him pipe in mouth his expression suggesting quiet satisfaction  toes feeling pretty good he inquired by and by  im glad to say they are though i thought i was in for trouble stanton said with a deprecatory smile i allow that frostbites a thing im easy scared about after the patrol i made with stafford through the northern bush last winter got his foot wet with mushy snow crossing a rapid where the ice was working and it froze bad had to pack him the last two hundred miles on the sled with the dogs getting used up and the grub running out they paid him off at regina and sent him home but stafford will never put on an ordinary boot again  a frozen foots bad enough if you have to walk until it galls curtis admitted a hands easier looked after though ive three fingers im never quite sure of thats one reason it took so much shooting before i plugged glovers horse  you were pretty cute about his jacket stanton remarked  that was easy enough the thing was too big for him and newer than his trousers soon as i noticed it i knew id dropped on to something worth following up  i cant see what you made of it and you havent told me yet  i was too doggoned cold and tired to talk wanted to make the post and get to sleep however though i gave cranes boys no hint ill show you what ive been figuring on consider yourself a jury and tell me how it strikes you you have as much intelligence as the general run of them  if i hadnt any more than the kind of jurymen were usually up against id quit the service stanton declared  the corporals eyes twinkled  if youll learn to think and not hustle youll make a useful man some day anyhow the first thing i caught on to was that glover had taken off his jacket because there was something in it he didnt want us to find next that it was money or valuables because he could have put any small thing into the stove or hid it in the snow before he lit out now glover knew it was kind of dangerous to leave his jacket with jepson who might find the bills and as he couldnt tell you were in the ravine he must have thought he had a good chance of getting clear away but for all that he wouldnt risk taking the wad along guess theres only one explanationhed a reason for being mighty afraid of those bills falling into our hands that was plain enough when i asked him about his jacket  yes stanton said thoughtfully i guess you have got it right but what was his reason he knows crane can have him sent up for horsestealing  curtis opening a drawer took out a slip of paper with some numbers on it and then laid the wad of bills on the table  twenty dollars each merchants bank and quite clean he said  it was a fivedollar bill on the same bank we found at the muskeg cried stanton starting  it was curtis took up the list now here are the numbers of the twentydollar bills morant at sebastian got from the bank a day or two before he made the deal with jernyngham it was with those bills he paid him the night he disappeared he paused and added significantly i guess we have got some of them here  this proved to be correct when they had compared them with the list then curtis leaned back in his chair and filled his pipe  its a mighty curious case he remarked  sure replied stanton you get no farther with it you have points against three different men and its pretty clear that they havent been working together they cant all have killed the man  thats true well ive made a report for regina and theyll keep glover safe until we want him i cant tell what our chiefs will do but as glovers not likely to tell them anything i guess theyll hold this matter over until we find out more he locked up the money now well quit talking about it i want to give my mind a rest  curtis had few of the qualities needed for the making of a great detective he was merely a painstaking determined man with a capacity for earnest work which is perhaps more useful than genius in the ranks of the northwest police he could tirelessly follow the dogsleds sometimes on the scantiest rations for hundreds of miles over the snow sleeping in the open in the arctic frost he had made long forced marches to succor improvident settlers starving far out in the wilds in the fierce heat of summer he made his patrols watching the progress of the grassfires sternly exacting from the ranchers the plowing of the needed guards and cattlethieves prudently avoided the district that he ruled with firm benevolence the man was a worthy type of his people the new nation that is rising in the west forceful steadfast direct and as a rule devoid of mental subtleties he admitted that the jernyngham mystery every clue to which broke off as he began to follow it was harassing him  while he spent the evening lounging in wellearned leisure beside the stove mrs colston was talking seriously to her sister in a room of the leslie homestead owing to the number of its inmates she had found it difficult to get a word with the girl alone and now that an opportunity had come she felt that she must make the most of it  muriel she said do you think its judicious to speak so strongly in prescotts favor as you have done of late you were rude to gertrude last night  the girl colored she had as a matter of fact lost her temper which was generally quick  i hate injustice she broke out gertrude and her father make such an unfair use of everything they can find against him and i think gertrudes the worse of the two she looked hard at her sister she shows a rancor against the man which even the disappearance of her brother doesnt account for  the same idea had occurred to mrs colston but it was a side issue and she was not to be drawn away from the point  you stick to the word disappearance she said  yes muriel answered steadily cyril jernyngham isnt dead  you have only prescotts word for that  muriel made no answer for a few moments then she looked up with a resolute expression  im satisfied with it  her sister understood this as a challenge she had indulged in hints and indirect warnings and they had been disregarded the situation now needed more drastic treatment  that she said is a significant admission i cant let it pass your prejudice in favor of the man has of course been noticeable you have even let him see it dont you realize what damaging conclusions one might draw from it  damaging muriels eyes were fixed on her sister though her face was hot as you have been thinking of all this for some time perhaps you had better explain and get it over  mrs colston leaned forward with a severe expression  i feel that some candor is necessary you have taken the mans side openly you have sympathized with him i might even say that you have led him on  muriels wayward temperament drove her to the verge of an outbreak but with an effort at selfcontrol she sat still and her sister resumed  besides his lying under suspicion the man is a mere working farmer imperfectly educated forced to live in a most primitive manner thinking of nothing but his crops and horses  he is not imperfectly educated as a matter of fact he knows more about most things than we do but thats not important mind im admitting nothing of all that you suggest but you might have said that im a penniless girl living on your husbands charity i must confess that he gives it very willingly  that is precisely why im anxious about your future mrs colstons voice softened to a tone of genuine solicitude of course we are glad to have youharry has always been fond of youbut for your sake i could wish you a completer life in a home of your own but so much depends on the choice you make  yes a very great deal depends on that im expected of course to make a brilliant match  not necessarily brilliant but there are things we have always enjoyed which must be looked fora good name position the right to meet people brought up as we have been on an equal footing  muriel broke in upon her with a strained laugh  once for a little while it looked as if we should have to do without them and somehow i wasnt very much alarmed but your lists rather short and incomplete there are one or two quite as important things you might have added to it though perhaps im exacting  there was silence for a few moments and a faint flicker of color crept into mrs colstons face while the girl mused her sister had got all she asked for but muriel suspected that she was not content now and then indeed she had seen a hint of weariness in her expression harry colston made a model husband in some respects but he had his limitations his virtues were commonplace and sometimes tedious his intelligence was less than his wifes muriel was fond of him but his unwavering goodnature and placidity irritated her she was inclined to be sorry for her sister in some ways  muriel mrs colston resumed gently your happiness means a good deal to me a mistake might cost you dear and after all one cannot have everything  that is obviously true i suppose its a question of what one values most or perhaps what most strongly appeals to ones fancy it would be difficult to fix an accurate standard for judging suitors by wouldnt it then her tone grew scornful besides as those who are eligible arent numerous a girls expected to wait with an encouraging smile and thankfully take what comes  mrs colston looked at her reproachfully  youre hardly just my dear i only urge you to be prudent now  prudence is such a coldblooded thing im afraid i never had it after all what seems wise to me might appear to be folly to you i think if ever what looks like a chance of happiness is offered me i shall take all risks and clutch at it  she picked up a book as if to intimate that she had no more to say and mrs colston wondered whether her worst fears were justified or whether muriel had been behaving with unusual perverseness in either case she might make things worse by laboring the subject she hesitated a moment and then went out in search of her husband  harry she said we have been away a long while dont you think it is time to go home  no he answered i havent thought so what suggested the idea  it was obvious that he had no suspicion of her motive and she was not prepared to explain that she wished to place muriel beyond prescotts reach  well she said lamely arent you rather neglecting your duties  no colston replied with a smile as theyre to a large extent merely formal ones i believe they can wait a little longer without much harm being done  mrs colston was surprised she had not expected such an admission from her husband though she agreed with him harry was not as a rule susceptible to new impressions but there was a subtle influence in the simple life on the prairies which altered ones point of view and led to ones forming a new estimate of values she had felt this things which had seemed essential in england somehow lost their importance in canada  besides he resumed you will remember that i made arrangements to be away a year if necessary and perhaps if i make the most of my opportunities in this country i may have something worth while to say when we go home again  this was more in his usual vein but his wife did not encourage him harry was apt to grow tiresome in his improving mood  but you dont think of staying the full year she asked in alarm  oh no we might wait another week or two or even a month more it wouldnt be the thing to desert jernyngham and as were mixed up in it i feel it would be better to see the matter through he smiled at his wife with cumbrous gallantry then though you always look charming youre now unusually fresh and fit theres no doubt that the place agrees with you  mrs colston could not deny it she yielded for the present deciding to wait until some turn of events rendered him more amenable in spite of his good humor harry was obstinate and often hard to move  she went to join gertrude while muriel sitting alone where she had been left laid down her book and let her eyes range slowly round the room trying to analyze the impression it made on her there was no carpet on the floor the walls were made of milldressed boards which had cracked with the dryness and smelt of turpentine the furniture consisted of a few benthardwood chairs and a rickety table covered with a gaudy cloth the nickeled lamp which diffused an unpleasant odor was of florid but very inartistic design the plain stove stood in an ugly iron tray and its galvanized pipe ran up unconcealed to the ceiling a black distillate had trickled down from a bend in it and stained the floor  muriel realized that had she been expected to live in such a place in england it would have struck her as comfortless and almost squalid but now perhaps by contrast with the frozen desolation without it looked cheerful and had a homelike air this she thought was significant and she followed up the train of ideas to which it led she had a practical independent bent she liked to handle and investigate things for herself to get into close and intimate touch with life at home this had not often been possible she was too sheltered and in a sense too secluded the people she met were conventional acting in accordance with a recognized code concealing their feelings if she rode or drove somebody got ready the horse for her it was the same with the car when she strolled through an english garden she might pluck a flower or take pleasure in the smoothness of the lawn but it was always with the feeling that others had planted and mown she could take no active part in things there was little that she could really do  it was different on the western prairie here men and women showed anger or sorrow or gladness more or less openly one could realize their emotions and this instead of deterring attracted her one came to close grips with the primitive influences of human nature then they were strenuous people toiling stubbornly rejoicing in tangible results that their hands and brains had produced woman was mans real helpmate not a companion for his idle hours she kept his house and in time of pressure drove his horses she had her say in determining the count of the cattle and the bushels of seed and it was sometimes conceded that her judgment was the better  but this was only one aspect of the subject that filled the girls thoughts she knew that prescott loved her and she was glad of it but here she stopped she was sanguine impulsive courageous but with all that could be said for it the change she must face if he claimed her was a startling one besides he must clear himself of suspicion and because the part of a mere lookeron was uncongenial there was a course which she would urge on him she must see him and convince him of the necessity for it soon after she had made up her mind on this point jernyngham and colston came in and she had to talk to them     chapter xxv  a womans influence   muriel found it needful to wait several days for an opportunity for speaking to prescott it did not seem advisable to visit his house again and she was at a loss for a means of meeting him when she overheard leslie tell his wife that he would ask prescott who was going to sebastian the next morning to bring out some stores they required the next day muriel borrowed a team and contenting herself with an intimation that she was going for a long drive set off for the settlement it would be time enough to confess her object if her sister taxed her with it and there were one or two purchases she really wished to make  she had never gone so far alone though she had occasionally driven to an outlying farm and the expedition had in it the zest of adventure moreover she was boldly going to undertake a very unusual task in showing prescott what he ought to do so far she had been an interested spectator of the drama of life but now she would participate in it exercising such powers as she possessed and the thought was additionally fascinating because among her intimate friends she could not pick out a man who owed much to a womans guidance her sister had some mental gifts but harry colston disregarding her in a goodhumored but dogged fashion did what he thought best while the idea of jernynghams deferring to gertrude was frankly ridiculous neither man had much ability indeed it was as a rule the dullest men who were most convinced of their superior sense prescott far surpassed them in intellect but she pulled herself up she was not going to dwell on prescotts virtues unduly and she had not convinced him yet  the team gave her no trouble the trail was good and reaching sebastian safely she spent some time in a drygoods store and afterward went to the hotel where supper was being served she would not have waited for it only that she had seen nothing of prescott and she had the excuse that the team must have a rest on entering the big diningroom she was inclined to regret that meals can rarely be had in private in the west although by the favor of a waitress she succeeded in obtaining a small table to herself there were only two women present clerks in the store she believed but the room was nearly filled with men among them were ranchers with faces darkened by the glare of the snow some of them wearing shabby coats from which the fur was coming off though the room was warm a few railroad hands who laid sooty mittens on the table the smart stationagent a number of storekeepers and clerks now and then boisterous laughter rang out and one group indulged in rather pointed banter while the way that several of them used their knives and forks left much to be desired but nobody regarded the girl with marked attention for all that she was sensible of some relief when prescott came in and moved toward her table  may i take this place he asked  of course she said  after speaking to a waitress he inquired whether colston or her sister were at the hotel  no i drove in alone  she saw his surprise which suggested that her task might prove more difficult than she had imagined  well he said the trails pretty good and theres a moon tonight but didnt you hesitate about getting supper here by yourself  not very much there was really no reason why i should hesitate  thats true but you had your doubts  they were foolish muriel told him why are you so curious  im interested he indicated the room and its occupants these people their manners and surroundings are typical of the new west  do you feel that you ought to defend them  oh no they dont need it they have their faults and their virtues and neither are mean theyve the makings of a big nation and theyre doing great work today however you had certainly no cause for uneasiness theres not a man in the place who would have shown you the least disrespect  after all muriel contended theyre not your people you came from montreal your ideas and habits are more like ours than theirs  theyre mine by adoption ive thrown in my lot with them he fixed his eyes on her do you know the secret of making colonization a success in a way its a hard truth but its thisthere must be no looking back the old ties must be cut loose once for all a man must think of the land in which he prospers as his home its not a square deal to run back with the money he has made in it he must grow up with the rising nation he becomes a member of  yes muriel conceded slowly i think that is so but its harder for a woman  and yet have you seen any one who looked unhappy  no she admitted with thoughtful candor the few i have got to know seem to have an importance that perhaps is not very common at home for instance i heard leslie giving his wife his reasons for thinking of buying some hereford cattle and his respect for her opinion impressed me  prescott smiled  if i were going to sell those beasts id rather make the deal with her husband  then he changed the subject and they talked in a lighter vein until the room began to empty and a waitress came to collect the plates  dont they close this place as soon as supper is finished muriel asked trying to overcome her diffidence where can i have a word or two with you i was afraid that somebody might overhear us here  the parlor would be best he answered in some surprise the boys prefer the downstairs room and the bar ill tell the man about my horse and then ill be there  muriel found the few minutes she had to wait trying but she gathered her courage when he joined her  sit down she said with an air of decision id better begin at once and the thing is serious what have you done to clear yourself since i last saw you  his searching glance filled her with misgivings without being subtle he was by no means dull and he must be curious about her motive in asking him to her relief however he confined himself to the point she had raised  nothing i dont see what can be done  then are you content to remain suspected  no im not content but as i seem to be helpless the fools who can only judge by appearances and the others who are quick to think the worst of me must believe what they like anyway their opinion doesnt count for much  how can people judge except by appearances muriel argued besides do you divide everybody you know into those two classes  he looked hard at her and to her annoyance she grew confused  no he said slowly that would be very wrongi was too quick there are a few with generous minds who havent turned against me and im very grateful  it might have been enough if you had said they had sense but dont you feel you owe them something is it fair to keep silence and do nothing while they fight your battle  are there people who are doing so  yes muriel answered steadily you oughtnt to doubt it youre wronging your friends  his expression betokened a strong effort at selfcontrol  well he said it seems i have a duty to them but how im to get about it is more than i know  have you thought of telling the police about your journey to british columbia and what you learned about cyril jernyngham  im afraid they wouldnt believe me then theres the trouble that the man i followed called himself kermode  never mind tell them tell everybody you know  it would be useless prescott said doggedly  youre wrong muriel persisted when a thing is talked about enough people begin to believe it besides it would give your supporters an argument against the doubtful im afraid they need one after the finding of the clothes  the clothes what clothes  muriels faith in prescott had never been shaken but his surprise caused her keen satisfaction and she told him all she knew about jernynghams discovery  still i dont see what finding them there could signify he said when she had finished  then you dont know that a day or two after cyril jernyngham disappeared a man dressed in clothes like those found sold some land of his at a place called navarino  prescott started  its the first ive heard of it theres some villainy here the things must have been hidden near my house with the object of strengthening suspicion against me  of course but you cant think that jernyngham had a hand in it  oh no the man is trying to ruin me but that kind of meanness isnt in his line perhaps id better say that i never had clothes like those and that i sold no land of cyrils  mr prescott muriel murmured shyly it isnt necessary to tell me this i never doubted it  thank you he answered shortly but there was trouble in his voice and the girl thought she knew what his reticence cost  well she said you will tell other people this and go to see corporal curtis you agreed that women have some power here and even if youre not convinced you will do what i ask because i wish it  you have my promise  he walked toward the window and stood looking out for a moment or two before he turned to her again  dont you think you had better start for home the moon looks hazy may i drive out with you  muriel had shrunk from the long journey in the dark and she readily agreed  ill tell them to bring your team round he said moving toward the door get off as soon as youre ready and ill come along when ive collected a few things i bought  the girl let him go appreciating his consideration for she guessed his thoughts he was under suspicion and would give the tatlers in the town nothing on which to base conjectures it hurt her pride however to admit that such precautions had better be taken  leaving the hotel she found the trail smooth when she had crossed the track but after she passed the last of the fences the waste looked very dreary the moon was dimmed by thin driving clouds and the deep silence grew depressing the loneliness weighed on her and she began to listen eagerly for the beat of hoofs for a time she heard nothing and she had grown angry with prescott for delaying when a measured drumming stole out of the distance and her feeling of cheerfulness and security returned its significance was not lost on her she was learning to depend on the man to long for his society then for no obvious reason she urged the team and kept ahead for a while when he came up with an explanation about a missing package she laughed halfmockingly and on the whole felt glad that the narrowness of the trail which compelled him to follow made conversation difficult  an hour after she left the settlement the moon was hidden and fine snow began to fall it grew thicker gradually covering the trail until muriel had some difficulty in distinguishing it the sleigh was running heavily and after a while prescott told her to stop  ill go ahead and then you can follow my buggy he said there wont be much snow  muriel felt that there was quite enough to have made her very anxious had she been alone but when he passed and took his place in front she drove on in confidence she remembered that this was not a new feeling he was a man who could be trusted one felt safe with him now and then she could hardly see the buggy and she was glad of his cheery laugh and the somewhat inconsequent remarks he flung back to her when the haze of driving flakes grew thicker so far as she could see the trail now differed in nothing from the rest of the wilderness but he held on without hesitation and she felt no surprise when once or twice a belt of trees she remembered loomed up they made better progress when the snow ceased and at length prescott stopped his horse and she saw a faint blink of light some distance off  thats leslies he said shall i drive to the house with you  no that isnt needful thank you  then ill wait until i see the door open ill look up curtis in the morning  muriel turned off toward the farm where she found colston and her sister disturbed by her absence  where have you been mrs colston asked you have frightened us harry would have driven out to look for you if he had known which way to go  i went to the settlement i bought the things we spoke about and i met mr prescott who brought me home muriel spoke in a tone that discouraged further questions now im very cold harry you might shake the snow from those furs  she left them soon afterward pleading fatigue and went to sleep feeling satisfied with what she had done and knowing that prescott would keep his promise  her confidence was justified for on the following day he drove over to the police post and found curtis alone  ive come to tell you something and ill ask you to let me get through before you begin to talk he said  curtis showed no surprise and indicated a chair  sit there and go ahead  he listened with close attention while prescott described his journey and recounted all that he had learned about kermode  why didnt you tell me this earlier curtis asked  i couldnt imagine that you would believe it  then what makes you think ill believe it now  to be honest i dont care whether you do or not  curtis sat silent a few moments  what you have told me amounts to this he then summed up you have heard of a man who seems to look like cyril jernyngham  its as much to the purpose that he acts like him ive told you all i learned about his doings and you can judge for yourself you knew the man  so do you said curtis pointedly  prescott smiled  leave it at that i want you to find out whether im correct or not you made some inquiries along the new line  we didnt go far west curtis admitted there were difficulties and we couldnt see much reason for the search it was quite clear to me that jernyngham was knocked out near the muskeg he looked hard at prescott it isnt easy to change that opinion  it seems your duty to test it even if the thing costs some trouble cant you instruct your people in alberta to find out whether a man called kermode worked in any of the construction camps and if theyre satisfied that he answers jernynghams description to have him followed up in british columbia  theres a point you havent got hold of curtis replied when you struck a camp asking after your partner the boys were ready to talk to you but its quite different when a trooper comes along i wouldnt have much use for anything they told him  prescott realized the truth of this traveling on foot in search of a working comrade he had been received by the railroad hands as one of themselves but he knew that men with checkered careers which would not bear investigation found refuge among the toilers on the new lines and that even those who had nothing to fear would consider reticence becoming when questioned by the police the only excuse for loquacity would be the sending of an inquisitive constable on a fruitless expedition  then cant you try the bosses he asked  i guess theyre not likely to have found out much about the man and the boys wouldnt tell them however ill send up a report and see what can be done  thanks said prescott and then asked bluntly what do you make of the brown clothes  so you heard they were found said curtis with some dryness i havent done figuring on the matter yet  i dont suppose id help you by saying that they dont belong to me  curtis looked at him thoughtfully but made no answer for a while then  did you ever see anybody wearing a suit like that he asked  well prescott answered i believe i once did but i cant think who it was ive been trying hard to remember all day and it may come back  he got up and curtis walked to the door with him  frosts keeping pretty keen he remarked  prescott drove away and the corporal was smoking near the stove when stanton came in  you look as if youd been studying the jernyngham case he said ill allow its enough to get on your nerves  prescotts been here replied curtis hes heard those blamed clothes were found and thats going to make us trouble weve had jernyngham interfering and mussing up the tracks and now prescotts getting ready to butt in i expect hell be off to navarino very soon and we cant stop him unless we arrest him which im not ready to do  did he tell you he was going  it wasnt needed ive been figuring out the thing  well remarked stanton with a thoughtful air he wouldnt let that land agent see him if hed been guilty  curtis reserved his opinion  youre getting smart he said with a grin still you dont want to hustle  hustle stanton rejoined scornfully jernyngham was killed last summer and we havent corralled anybody yet  thats so curtis assented tranquilly ive heard of the boys getting the right man nearly two years afterward     chapter xxvi  prescott makes inquiries   supper was over and laxton the land agent sat in the rotunda of the leading hotel at navarino it was a handsome building worthy of the new town which had sprung into existence on the discovery that a wide belt of somewhat arid country hitherto passed over by settlers was capable of growing excellent wheat as soon as this was proved rude shacks and mean frame houses had been torn down and banks stores and hotels of stone or steel and cement rose in their places great irrigation ditches were dug and a period of feverish prosperity began  though the frost was almost arctic outside the rotunda was pleasantly warm and was dimmed in spite of its glaring lamps with a haze of cigar smoke in front of the great plateglass windows rows of men sat in tilted chairs their feet on a brass rail basking in the dry heat of the radiators drummers and land speculators were busy writing and consulting maps at the tables farther back among the ornate columns and the place was filled with the hum of eager voices the town was crowded with homesteadselectors and many braving the rigors of winter were camping on their new possessions in frail tents and rude board shacks ready to begin work in the spring indeed determined men had slept in the snow on the sidewalks outside the land offices to secure first attention in the morning when cheap locations were offered for settlement  laxton had had a tiring day and he was leaning back lazily in his chair watching the crowd when a man entered the turnstiledoor which was fitted with glass valves to keep out the cold he looked about the room as if in search of somebody and then after speaking to the clerk came toward the land agent laxton glanced at him without much interest having already as much business on his hands as he could manage the stranger wore an old furcoat and looked like a rancher  mr laxton i believe he said taking the next chair  the land agent nodded and the other continued  my names prescott ive come over from sebastian to have a talk with you  i suppose ill have to spare you a few minutes said laxton with more resignation than curiosity  in the first place i want to ask if you have ever seen me before  laxton looked at him with greater interest the mans brown face was eager his eyes were keen with a sparkle in them that hinted at determination  well he said i cant recollect it  would you be willing to swear to that  dont know that id go quite so far i dont see why i should  prescott took out a sheet of paper with some writing on it  do you recognize that hand  no said the agent decidedly its a bold style that one ought to notice but i dont think ive seen it then he looked up sharply what you getting after  ill explain in a minute let me say that ive examined the land sale record here and have found a deal registered that you were concerned in it was made in the name of cyril jernyngham  laxton started  look here he said ive had a lot of trouble over this thing since i was fool enough to write to the police in fact ive had enough of the jernyngham case he broke off for a moment as a light dawned on him and then went on its a sure thing i havent met you but when i think there was a young lad something like you among others in blanketcoats in a photograph a sergeant brought me montreal snowshoe or toboggan club i guess  i dont know how the police got it but what did you tell the sergeant  said it was no use showing me a photograph like that because i didnt trade with kids  then as im the man the police suspect of selling that land of jernynghams it would be a great favor if youll tell me candidly what you know about the matter  hang up your coat said laxton ill do what i can anyway youre not the fellow i made the deal with  he drew out a cigarcase when prescott came back  take a smoke and go ahead im willing to talk  first of all turn over the paper i gave you and look at the signature  cyril jernyngham exclaimed laxton astonished i see your pointthe hand ought to be the same as that on the sale registration form and i might have been expected to recognize it but i cant remember all the writing i see however well compare it with the other signature tomorrow  when you do so youll find a difference  ah said laxton then whose hand is this  cyril jernynghams it was written in my presence and whats more important in the presence of another man now will you tell me what the fellow who made the deal with you was like  laxton did so and prescott thought the description indicated wandle though he was not the only man in the neighborhood of sebastian to whom it might apply  did you notice how he was dressed he asked  he had on a suit of new brown clothes  prescott sat still his brows knitted his right hand clenched the reason why the clothes had been hidden near his house was obvious but there was something else a blurred memory that was growing into shape ever since he had heard about them from muriel he had been trying to think where he had seen the clothes and at last he seemed to hold a clue in another few moments it led him to the truth everything was clear he had once met wandle driving toward the settlement wearing such a suit and by good fortune he had shortly afterward been overtaken by a farmer who must have seen the man in his excitement he struck the table  now i know he cried the man who forged jernynghams name hid his clothes near my house to fix the thing on me i owe you a good deal for your help in a puzzling matter  the agent was sympathetic and after prescott had given him an outline of his connection with the case they sat talking over its details laxton had a keen intelligence and his comments on several points were valuable when prescott went to sleep it was with a weight off his mind but his mood changed the next day and he traveled back to sebastian in a very grim humor  open and just as he was in all his dealings wandles treachery infuriated him there would he felt have been more extenuation for the trick had the man killed jernyngham but that he should conspire to throw the blackest suspicion on a neighbor in order to enjoy the proceeds of a petty theft was abominable he must be made to suffer for it however prescott did not mean to trouble the police he had had enough of their cautious methods he determined to secure a proof of wandles guilt unassisted without further loss of time and to do this he must obtain a specimen of the mans writing to compare with that on the land sale documents there was he thought a way of getting it  reaching sebastian in the evening he was going to the liverystable to hire a team when he met an acquaintance who offered to drive him home as the man would pass within a mile or two of wandles homestead and there was a farm in the neighborhood where he might borrow a horse prescott agreed his companion found him preoccupied during the journey he put him down at a fork of the trail and prescott walking on quickly through the darkness saw wandles team standing harnessed when he reached the house this was a sign that their owner had recently come home and prescott opening the door without knocking abruptly entered the kitchen the lamp was lighted and wandle standing near it with his furcoat still on looked startled prescott was sensible of a burning desire to grapple with him and extort a confession by force but there was a risk of the crude method defeating its object and with strong selfdenial he determined to set to work prudently  i see you have just come in and im anxious to get home so i wont keep you more than a few minutes he said  how did you come wandle asked i didnt hear a team  harper drove me out i walked up the cross trail but that doesnt matter the last time we had a talk we fell out over the straightening up of jernynghams affairs  thats so you still owe me a hundred dollars  i dont admit it said prescott who had laid his plans on the expectation of this claim being made anyhow the dispute has been dragging on and its time we put an end to it it was the small items you wanted to charge jernyngham with that i objected to and i may have cut some of them down too hard suppose you write me out a list  i can tell you them right away  put them down on paper then we can figure them out more easily  dont know if ive any ink said wandle havent you a notebook in your wallet you used to carry one  prescott made a mistake in putting his hand into his pocket which showed that he had the book but he remembered that it would not suit his purpose to produce it  im not going to make out your bill he said thats your business give me a proper list of the disputed expenses and well see what can be done  he was a poor diplomatist and erred in showing too keen a desire to secure a specimen of the others handwriting which is a delicate thing to press an unskilful forger for wandle was on his guard though he carefully hid all sign of uneasiness  well he said ill send you a list over in a day or two after all if i think them over i may be able to knock something off one or two of the items but now youre here i want to say that you were pretty mean about that cultivator theyre not sold at the price you allowed me  this was intended to lead prescott away from the main point and it succeeded because being at a loss for an excuse for demanding the list immediately he was willing to speak of something else while he thought of one  youre wrong he said curtly you can get them at any big dealers i looked in at a western store where they stock those machines yesterday and the fellow gave me his schedule  he had taken off his mittens but his hands were stiff with cold and when he felt in his pocket he dropped several of the papers he brought out the back of a catalogue fell uppermost and it bore the words hastys highgrade implements navarino near this lay an envelope printed with the name of a navarino hotel  there was nothing to show that wandle had noticed themhe stood some distance off on the opposite side of the tablebut prescott was too eager in gathering them up opening the catalogue he read out a description of the cultivator and the price  taking the cash discount it comes to a dollar less than what i was ready to pay you he said now make out the list and well try to get the thing fixed up before i go  wandle sat down for a few moments for he had received a shock his suspicions had already been aroused and prescotts motive in going to navarino was obvious besides he thought he had read laxtons name on the envelope he could expect no mercyprescotts face was ominously grimand there was no doubt that having seen laxton he knew who had hidden the brown clothes the game was up but shaken by fear and rage as he was he rose calmly from his seat  well since you insist on it i guess ill have to write the thing but i cant leave my team standing in the frost sit down and take a smoke while i put them in  prescott could not object to this he lighted his pipe when wandle left him he heard the door shut and the horses being led away for the stable stood at some little distance from the house and after that no further sound reached him mastering his impatience he began to consider what he would best do when wandle had given him the list he supposed he ought to hand it over to curtis but he was more inclined to go back to navarino and compare the writing with the signature on the documents relating to the sale then having proof of the forgery he would communicate with the police he was sensible of a curious thrill at the thought that the suspicion which had tainted him would shortly be dispelled  after a while it occurred to him that wandle should have returned but he reflected that the man might be detained by some small task after waiting some minutes longer he walked to the door but finding that he could not see the entrance to the stable he stood still irresolute he thought he had been firm enough and to betray any further eagerness would be injudicious the matter must be handled delicately lest wandle take alarm  when he had smoked out his pipe prescott could no longer restrain his impatience he hurried toward the stable the moonlight fell on the front of the building and the door was open but prescott stopped with a start for all was dark inside and there was no sign of the vehicle in which the rancher had driven home a worse surprise awaited him for when he ran inside and struck a match it was clear that wandle and his team had gone  prescott dropped the match and stood still a few moments in savage fury there was no doubt that he had been cleverly tricked wandle guessing his object had quietly driven away as soon as he had led the team clear of the house moreover prescott had good cause for believing that he would not come back with an effort he pulled himself together to give rein to his anger and disappointment would serve no purpose but he had no horse with which to begin the pursuit he remembered having told wandle so when he first entered the house striking another match he lighted a lantern he found and eagerly looked about a plow team occupied two of the stalls and though they were heavy clydesdales with no speed in them they would be capable of traveling faster than a man on foot as he could not find a saddle he ran back to the house and returned with a blanket a bit and bridle hung on a nail he found a girth but his hands were cold and he spent some time adjusting straps and fastening on the blanket before he led one of the horses out and mounted  the moonlight was clear enough to show him that there were no fresh wheelmarks in the snow wandle had kept to the trail and prescott surmised that he would travel south toward the american boundary although he feared he would lose ground steadily he meant to follow since there was a chance of the fugitives being delayed by some accident which would enable him to come up it was extremely cold prescott was not dressed for riding and the folded blanket made a very bad saddle at times pale moonlight shone down but more often it died away obscured by thin cloud the trail however was plain and the big clydesdale was covering the ground prescotts hands and feet grew numbed and there was a risk in this but he trotted steadily on  after a while he heard two horsemen following him he did not pull up time was precious and if the others wished to overtake him he had no doubt that they could do so during the next few minutes it became evident that they were gaining and he heard a cry which he answered without stopping then as the moon came through another shout reached him sharp and commanding  stop before we drop you  this was not to be disregarded pulling up he turned his horse two mounted men rode furiously down on him loose snow flying about their horses and one poised a carbine across his saddle struggling to check his horse he swept past shouting to his comrade  hold on its prescott  they were a little distance ahead when they stopped and trotted back and prescott waited until curtis pulled up at his side  where were you going cried the corporal  after wandle  i might have guessed said curtis savagely and turned to stanton this explains the thing  how far is he ahead of you stanton asked  he got off half an hour before i did as near as i can guess  they sat silent for a moment or two breathless and crestfallen their horses distressed  lets get into the lee of the bluff yonder this winds keen curtis said  youre losing time prescott objected  weve lost it curtis told him grimly my mount has been out since noon and its near midnight now stantons isnt much fresher  prescott rode with them to the bluff where they got down  thats a relief its quite a while since i could feel the bridle said curtis turning to prescott how did you scare wandle off be as quick as you can  prescott briefly related what led to his call at the farm and the corporals face was filled with scornful anger  this is what comes of you blamed amateurs butting in he remarked jernyngham was bad enough but he cant come near you at mussing up our plans guess you dont know that weve been watching wandle for some weeks ready to corral him and you start him off like this without warning  id reason to believe you were watching me prescott dryly rejoined  oh well said curtis thats another matter anyhow i had trailed wandle to kellys place since dark and id trotted round to see if hed got back to his homestead when i found that he had gone stanton and i were prospecting out this way when we struck your trail  what are you going to do about it  well make the next farm and try to borrow horses then ill ride to the railroad and get the wires to work stanton will keep the trail by long lake  then ill push right on by the traverse theres a ranch i should make by daylight where i might get a mount im going to see the thing through  curtis considered this  well he said i guess you cant do much harm and wandle may not have gone by the lake after all you can pick up stanton if you find out anything and ill try to join you from one of the stations along the line  they mounted and on reaching the trail forks where they must separate prescott turned to curtis  arent you afraid of letting me out of your sight he asked  no sir curtis answered with a smile youre not quite so important to us now and im not running much risk anyway considering the horse youve got     chapter xxvii  startling news   it was noon on the day after wandles flight and jernyngham was sitting with his friends in a room of the leslie homestead when muriel looking out of the window saw prescotts hired man ride up at a gallop his haste and his anxious expression when he dismounted alarmed her but her companions had not noticed him and she waited listening to the murmur of voices that presently reached her from an adjoining room they ceased in a few minutes she saw the man ride away as fast as he had come and soon afterward leslie opened the door he was a talkative person and looked as if he had something of importance to relate  svendsen has been over to ask if i saw prescott when i was in at the settlement yesterday he said when i told him that i hadnt he seemed mighty disturbed  muriels heart throbbed painfully but she waited for one of the others to speak and jernyngham laying down his paper glanced up sharply  why he asked  this was all the encouragement leslie needed  ill tell you so far as ive got the hang of the thing i thought youd like to know it seems prescott has been away somewhere for a few days and should have got home last night he came in on the train in the evening and harper drove him out and dropped him at wandles trail prescott said he wanted to see the man well he didnt get home and svendsen whod been to harpers this morning found wandle gone and three of his horses missing then he found out from watson who stayed at the hotel last night that curtis rode in on a playedout horse before it was light and kept the night operator busy for a while with the wires seems to me the thing has a curious look  for a moment or two nobody spoke muriel felt dismayed by the news and she glanced at the others trying to read their thoughts colston looked troubled gertrudes face was hard and stamped with a kind of cruel satisfaction jernyngham was very grim  is that all you know about the matter jernyngham asked  i guess so leslie answered still svendsen did allow he thought hed seen stanton hanging about the homestead yesterday evening  thank you said jernyngham with cold politeness ill want the team after dinner  seeing no excuse for remaining the rancher went out and jernyngham turned to the others his brows were knitted and his eyes gleamed ominously  theres no mystery about the matter the man has gone for good he said in spite of the assurances they gave me these fools of police have let him slip through their fingers that he saw wandle before he bolted proves collusion between them it was a thing i half suspected but curtis of course did not agree with me  muriel was recovering from the shock though things looked very bad she could not believe that prescott had run away he had promised to call on curtis and her confidence in him was unshaken  he went away by train a day or two ago and if he had had anything to fear he would have made his escape then she said  mrs colston cast a warning glance at her as if begging her to say nothing more but jernyngham curtly answered her remark  the man probably wanted to sell his property where it would excite less notice than at sebastian then i suppose he found it needful to see his confederate  they could have gone off together in the first instance colston objected  jernyngham made an impatient gesture  i was merely suggesting an explanation the point is not important the fellow has bolted but ive reason for believing he wont get across the boundary  he broke off tearing the newspaper as he opened it and there was an awkward silence until mrs leslie brought in dinner jernyngham ate very little and after spending a few minutes in his room he drove off in the sleigh somewhat later colston met gertrude in a passage and stopped her he thought she looked anxious  im sorry i couldnt calm your father but i was afraid that anything i might say would only make him more excited he told her i meant to go with him but he wouldnt permit it  no she said there was nothing that you could do but im badly disturbed she paused irresolutely and then resumed he has taken a magazine pistol though i believe its the first time he has carried it  colston looked grave he determined if possible to abstract the pistol and hide it on jernynghams return  im very sorry it must be trying for you indeed i wonder anxiously where all this is leading us  the horrible mystery will be cleared up on prescotts arrest gertrude said in a harsh voice i think that cant be long deferred  she left him troubled by her expression and he and the others spent a dreary afternoon and evening it was late when jernyngham returned looking worn but very stern  from what ive learned word has been sent to every police trooper between here and the frontier he said and broke into a grim smile prescotts chance of escape is a very poor one  he made a scanty meal without seeming to notice what he ate and afterward sat silent the others seldom spoke and when a word was exchanged there was strain in their voices the snapping of the poplar billets in the stove seemed to emphasize the quiet and jarred on their nerves while muriel tormented by fears on prescotts account found the suspense and constraint almost intolerable she was thankful when bedtime came though she could not sleep her troubled thoughts were with her lover and she wondered what perils he was exposed to on the snowy wilds  as it happened prescott was riding steadily through the stinging frost he had been unable to obtain a fresh horse but he had borrowed a saddle and the clydesdale though far from fast possessed good staying powers for all that he had been forced to rest part of the day at an outlying farm and while there a man brought him word from stanton whose line of travel ran roughly parallel with his three or four leagues to the west the troopers horse had gone badly lame and prescott was instructed to push on while stanton sought another mount  it was a very bitter night but the young rancher was used to cold and riding alone in the moonlight he made the best pace he could across the white desolation there was no sign of life on it nothing moved in the reeds beside the frozen ponds and the shadowy bluffs he passed no sound but the thud of heavy hoofs broke the overwhelming silence by and by he left the trees behind and pressed on into a vast glittering plain which ran back to the horizon unbroken by a bush and inexpressibly lonely  in the early morning he reached a homestead where he rested until the afternoon he chafed at the delay but as the clydesdale was badly jaded it could not be avoided and wandle would have to stop now and then unless he could hire fresh horses which might be difficult starting again he came to a small wooden settlement in the evening and rode first to the liverystable the telephone wires which were being stretched across the prairie had not reached the place and he surmised that the police had been unable to communicate with it the liveryman was busy in one of the stalls but he came out and answered prescotts question  yes he said a fellow like the one you speak of came in here about an hour ago his team looked pretty used up and he wanted to hire another but i couldnt deal keep my horses hauling cordwood through the winter and the only team i have in the stable is ordered by a drummer for tomorrow  cant you find me a mount ill pay you what you like  no sir said the other when i engage to drive a man round ive got to make good if i didnt it would soon ruin my trade  seeing he was not to be moved prescott asked  how do you strike the south trail  go straight through the town it forks in about three miles and you can take either branch theyre both pretty bad but the west ones the shorter and the worse  whats between the forks  a big patch of broken countrysandhills and bluffs about eight miles on the other trail runs in again  are there any homesteads on the way  nothing near the trail theres a shack where two fellows cutting cordwood camp  prescott considered when he had thanked the man he was tired and his horse was far from fresh but he understood that wandles team was in a worse condition there was a possibility of his overtaking him if he pushed on at once leaving the stable he meant to walk a short distance to ease his aching limbs but he saw a mounted man trotting up the street and called out as he recognized stanton  i thought i might get news of you here said the trooper pulling up have you found out anything  prescott told him what he had heard and stanton nodded  then we had better get on the horse ive got is pretty fresh  in another minute or two they had left the lights of the settlement behind and prescott prepared for a third night on the trail his eyes were heavy long exposure to extreme cold had had its effect on him and the warmth seemed to be dying out of his exhausted body after a while they came to a straggling clump of birches with blurred masses of taller trees behind where the trail broke in two stanton dismounted and struck a few matches examining the snow carefully  nothing to show which way wandles gone he reported somebodys been along with a bobsled not long ago and rubbed out his tracks anyhow ill take the shorter fork  they separated the trooper riding on in the moonlight and prescott entering the gloom of the trees he soon found the trial remarkably uneven so far as he could make out it skirted a number of low thickly timbered ridges swinging sharply up and down in places it slanted awkwardly toward one edge in others it was covered with stiff dwarf scrub one or two of the descents to frozen creeks were alarmingly steep and the clydesdale stumbled now and then but it kept its feet and prescott felt that everything considered he was making a satisfactory pace stanton he supposed was two or three miles to the west of him following the opposite edge of the high ground but there was nothing to indicate which of them was the nearer to wandle  he rode on wishing the light were better for the faint gleam of the moon among the trees confused his sight and made it difficult to distinguish the trail while to leave it might lead to his plunging down some precipitous gully at length he saw a yellow glow ahead and soon afterward came upon a shack in an opening small logs were strewn about it and among them stood tall piles of cordwood the door opened as he rode up and a mans dark figure appeared in the entrance  have you seen a rig going south prescott asked  i heard one about seven or eight minutes ago the fellow didnt seem to be driving quick  thanks responded prescott and rode off with a feeling of satisfaction  he had gained on wandle who had probably been delayed by some mischance on the trail if the clydesdale could be urged to a faster pace he might overtake him but this must be done before the fugitive could hire a fresh team next he began to wonder what progress stanton had made for the relative positions of wandle and the constable were now important if stanton were far enough ahead he would reach the spot where the trails united before the absconder in which case they would have him between them and it would be better for prescott to save his horses strength because speed might be required on the contrary if stanton were not yet abreast of him he ought to push on as fast as possible wandle he was glad to remember could not know how closely he was being followed  turning the matter over in his mind he rode at a moderate pace while the rough track wound deeper into the bluff the partial obscurity was now extremely puzzling here and there a slender trunk glimmered in the faint moonlight that streamed down between the branches and patches of brightness lay across the path but this intensified the darkness of the background it was hard to tell which of the dim avenues that kept opening up was the trail the state of the short scrub could no longer be used as a guide for the cordwood cutters had not penetrated so far with their sled  prescott knew that he must go forward however and he was gazing anxiously ahead with eyes that ached from long exposure to the reflection from the snow when the clydesdale stumbled violently he had scarcely time to clear his feet of the stirrups before the beast went down and he was flung into a clump of brush with a force that nearly drove the breath out of him for a few moments he lay still dimly conscious that the horse was struggling in the snow and then rousing himself with an effort he got up unsteadily he felt badly shaken but he saw the horse scramble to its feet without assistance and stand trembling looking about for him  neither he nor the animal seemed to be seriously injured but he felt incapable of mounting and waited a while wondering what he should do he was tired out and was sensible of a depressing lassitude the result of nervous strain then as the bitter cold nipped him a reaction set in wandle he remembered had with detestable cunning plotted to ruin him it might be difficult to clear himself unless the man were arrested for the sake of the girl who had maintained his innocence with steadfast faith the suspicion under which he labored must be dispelled prescott was seized by a fit of fury against his betrayer nerved by it he got into the saddle and rode on urging the clydesdale savagely through the wood  half an hour later he heard a measured drumming sound and stantons voice answered his hail then a horseman rode out of a gap in the trees and pulled up near him  i suppose you have seen nothing of wandle prescott asked  not a sign said stanton shortly have you  prescott raised his hand and sat listening while he struggled with his rage and disappointment the night was still he thought he would hear any sound there might be a long distance off but nothing broke the silence  i learned from a chopper that i wasnt far behind him and i half expected you would have headed him off i cant think he has passed this spot  well try to fix that  stanton dismounted and struck several matches the flame burned steadily but it showed none of the marks for which he searched the beaten snow with practised eyes  no he said id stake a months pay that the fellows not ahead  they looked at each other frankly puzzled and then prescott broke out angrily  where can the blasted rustler be  couldnt have left the bluffs on my side without my seeing him and if hed doubled back on his tracks youd have met him curtis remarked  hes not likely to be hiding in the woods hed freeze without a proper outfit which he cant have got  they grappled with the problem in silence for a minute or two  well take the back trail stanton decided the fellow must have broken out for open country on your side i guess he knows where theres a homestead where he might find a team  prescott agreed and they rode off wearily the way he had come shivering with the cold that had seized them while they waited the expectant excitement which had animated them for the past hour had gone and was followed by a reaction their bodies were half frozen their minds worked heavily but both were conscious of a grim resolve it was the troopers duty to bear crushing fatigue and stinging frost one that was sternly demanded of him and the rancher had a stronger motive he must clear himself for muriels sake and he was filled with rage against the man who had tried to betray him he would go on if necessary until his hands and feet froze or the big clydesdale fell     chapter xxviii  the end of the pursuit   when they had ridden some distance through the wood stanton checked his horse  hold on he cried heres a bit of an opening in the brush  he moved away a few yards and then called out  looks mighty like a trail i guess you didnt notice it when you came along  prescott admitted that he had not done so which was not surprising there was little to distinguish the gap between the nut bushes from others that opened up all round but stanton seemed satisfied that he was right  somebody has driven out this way not long ago he explained  it doesnt follow that the man was wandle  why no still i guess its likely and if theres a trail it leads to a homestead anyway well track it up  when they reached the open prairie the moonlight showed faint wheelmarks running on before them to the east the country was open and empty a wide plain with one slight rise some miles away that cut with a white gleam against the deep blue of the sky they headed toward it wearily following the track and drew bridle when they gained the summit a halfmoon floated rather low in the western sky glittering keen with frost and they could see that the prairie ahead of them was more rolling and broken dusky smears of bluffs checkered its white surface here and there and a low irregular dark line ran across it prescott supposed this to be a small timber growing along the edge of a ravine beyond it in the distance a faint glimmer of yellow light caught and held his eye it was the one touch of warm color in the chill and lifeless waste of white and blue  a homestead said stanton well ride as far as the ravine together and then i guess ill make for the farm alone if wandles been there looking for horses hell strike south and take the trail we left farther on youll head down that way and watch out to cut him off if he lights out before i come up  prescott understood the maneuver by driving east the fugitive had lost ground and if he could push on fast enough prescott might reach a position from which he could either run him down or turn him back into the hands of the trooper  when they came to the ravine and descended the deep shadowy hollow they parted company prescott following the opposite brink because wandle would have to cross it lower down to regain the south trail once or twice he left it for a while when the gorge twisted in a big loop away from him but he could see nothing of his companion they had commanded a wide sweep of plain when they crossed the rise but now that he was on low ground the scattered bluffs obstructed his view indeed he fancied from their position that they would prevent stantons seeing the farm once he stopped and listened with strained attention but he could hear only the faint sighing of a light wind among the trees he skirted and the snapping of a twig made by what means he could not tell for there was no sign of life in all the frozen wilds it was very dreary and prescott had little expectation of overtaking wandle after the time they had lost but he doggedly rode on  at length an indistinct sound too regular for the wind to account for reached him and grew louder when he pulled up his horse it was a dull measured throbbing and he knew it to be the beat of hoofs it was drawing nearer but it might be made by stanton riding to join him and he headed so as to clear one of the bluffs which prevented his seeing far across the plain on passing the end of the timber he saw another taller patch half a mile off which hid most of the prairie between him and the farm and knowing that time might be valuable he clung to the ravine urging the jaded clydesdale to its fastest pace which was very moderate he had gone about a mile opening up the flat waste beyond the second bluff when the black shape of a team and rig appeared on it the team was being driven furiously and in another few moments prescott was not surprised to see a horseman sweep out from the gloom of the trees behind them it was however soon obvious that the trooper was not gaining ground wandle had got fresh horses his rig was light while stantons mount had already carried him a long way prescotts clydesdale had been harder taxed but he knew he could not spare the beast wandle must have seen him but he was holding straight on and this could only be because he was following a trail which led to the easiest crossing of the ravine the man would shrink from the risk of getting entangled among thick timber with his team  prescott would have found speed difficult even had he been mounted on a fresh horse the snow was thin but it was loose and dusty beneath the crust through which the hoofs broke while wandle was making excellent progress along a beaten trail still prescott was nearer to the point the man was making for and if he could reach it first wandle could not escape riding with savage determination he sped on the snow flying up behind him the thrill of the pursuit firing his blood and filling him with fierce excitement wandles fresh team was going at a gallop the hoofs beating out a sharp drumming that mingled with the furious rattle of wheels and through these sounds broke a rapid pounding thud which told that stanton was following hard behind the trooper was however less close than he had been too far prescott thought to use his carbine and as he mercilessly drove his beast he feared that he could scarcely reach the trail in time he was closing with the rig and could see wandle savagely lash his team the trouble was that instead of riding to cut off the fugitive in another few minutes he would be behind him which was a very different thing  while he plied the quirt he saw the rig vanish among the trees close ahead they stretched out some distance into the prairie and he might not be too late yet if he were willing to take a serious risk he did not think the trail ran straight down into the ravinethe hollow was too deep for thatit would descend the slope obliquely and might trend toward him if so he should still be able to intercept the rig by cutting off the corner and riding straight down the steep bank through the timber the odds were in favor of his killing the horse and breaking his own neck but this did not count and the next moment there was a crash as the clydesdale rushed through a brake a branch struck prescotts leg a heavy blow but he was too numbed to feel much pain and as he swung round a bush that threatened to tear him from the saddle he could look down between the trees then he was filled with exultation for the trail had turned his way below him but farther from the bottom of the dipping track than he was wandles horses were plunging downhill at a furious gallop the rig jolting behind them the driver leaning forward and using the whip there was no sign of stanton except the pounding of hoofs that rose among the trees  then the slope grew dangerously sharp and prescott set his teeth the clydesdale flinched from the descent but it was too jaded to struggle hard and the next moment it stumbled and slid over the edge they went down slipping over ground as hard as granite under its thin coat of snow smashing through nut bushes tearing off low branches prescott saw wandle turn his head and look up at him then the fugitive sent up a hoarse cry of rage and warning too late if he could stop his team which was very doubtful he might escape the threatened collision but this would involve his capture by stanton and he lashed his horses and went on while prescott and the great plow horse came madly rushing down at him he looked at them again with a breathless yell then he let the reins fall and seized a seat rail  the clydesdale struck the light offside horse hurling it upon its fellow breaking the pole both lost their footing and were driven round prescott flung upon the backs of the horses grasped the front of the rig which ran on a yard or two and overturned with a crash the clydesdale went down among the wreckage another horse was on its side kicking savagely and stanton hurrying up saw prescott crawl slowly clear of it seizing him he lifted him to his feet and to his great surprise the man leaned against a tree with a halfdazed laugh  well he gasped im not in pieces anyway  then you ought to be said stanton too startled to congratulate him on his escape but wheres wandle  prescott seemed unable to answer and the trooper looking round saw wandle lying in the snow but before he could reach him the man began to raise himself on his elbow this was disconcerting for stanton had thought him dead  well the trooper said stupidly whats the matter with you  i dont know wandle replied weakly dont feel like talking let me alone  stanton had no fear of his escaping so he went back to the horses one of them stood trembling attached to the rig by the deranged harness the other still lay kicking while the big clydesdale rolled to and fro with its leg through a wrenchedoff wheel it was astonishing that none of them was killed prescott apparently needed no assistance and stanton felt that he required some occupation to calm himself accordingly he freed the clydesdale of the broken wheel narrowly escaping a kick which would have broken his ribs the horse was a valuable one and must not be left in danger and after a few minutes of severe exertion stanton got it on its feet then he turned to the fallen driving horse and began at some risk to cut away its harness prescott came to help him and together they raised the beast then stanton sat down heavily on the wreckage  well he remarked that was the blamedest fool trick your riding down the grade they wouldnt expect that kind of work from us in the service what i cant account for is that you look none the worse  prescott standing shakily in the moonlight smiled it is surprising but hadnt you better look after wandle he seems to be getting up  wandle was cautiously getting on his feet and the trooper watched him until he moved a pace or two  you dont look very broke up he said do you feel as if you could walk  i believe i could ride wandle answered sullenly  well i guess you wont you have given us trouble enough already and youll be warmer on your feet then he drew out a paper this is my warrant its my duty to arrest you  wandle listened coolly to the formula in which he was charged with fraudulently selling jernynghams land and forging his name indeed prescott fancied that he was relieved to find that nothing more serious had been brought against him  well he said youll hear my defense when its ready whats to be done now  head back to the homestead where you got the team think you can lead one of them its either that or ill put the handcuffs on youmake your choice stanton turned to prescott it will be warmer walking and ive ridden about enough  the suggestion was agreed to and after looping up the cut harness awkwardly with numbed fingers they set off wandle going first holding one horses head prescott following with two and the trooper bringing up the rear when they reached the farm to the astonishment of its occupants they were given quarters in the kitchen where a big stove was burning soon afterward prescott and wandle lay down on the wooden floor wrapped in blankets supplied them by the farmer and prescott sank into heavy sleep stanton sitting upright in an uncomfortable chair kept watch with his carbine laid handy on the table he spent the night in a tense struggle to keep awake and when prescott got up at dawn the troopers face was haggard and his eyes half closed but he was still on guard  after breakfast they borrowed a saddle for wandle and set out on the return journey meeting curtis who had ridden from the railroad at the first settlement they reached prescott left the others there and rode toward the station the corporal had just left taking some telegrams curtis asked him to despatch he spent an afternoon and a night in the little wooden town and went on again the next day by a local train  while prescott was on the way jernyngham drove to sebastian with gertrude the girl had insisted on accompanying him soon after they left the homestead colston who was trying to read a paper from which his interest wandered looked up at his wife  its fine weather and not quite so cold he said suppose we go to the settlement and get supper there ive no doubt theres something you or muriel would like to buy  as it happens there is mrs colston replied but i dont think thats all you have in your mind  the fact is im disturbed about jernyngham colston admitted he has been in an extremely restless mood since prescott disappeared  i have noticed that but do you know why he has gone to sebastian today  he told me one of the police authorities whom he has seen already is staying at the hotel tonight jernyngham means to get hold of him and insist upon an explanation of what they are doing  muriel leaned forward in her chair she looked anxious for no news of anything that had happened since wandles flight had reached the neighborhood it was only known that the police were in pursuit of him and local opinion was divided as to whether prescott was also a fugitive or knowing more about the matter than anybody else had offered curtis his assistance  i think you ought to go she said and you may hear something  well colston replied ill confess that im curious though im going mainly on jernynghams account he turned to his wife dont you think its advisable  i do and it would be better if we all went then you will have an excuse for following jernyngham and can watch him without making the thing too marked its a pity you didnt succeed in getting the pistol away from him  ive done what i could i had another try this morning but he caught me looking for it and i believe he guessed what i was after because he was unusually short with me its my opinion that he has taken to wearing the thing so far as i can discover its nowhere in the house one hesitates about ransacking his room  it is not in the house and he is not to be trusted with it muriel said quietly  colston cast a surprised glance at her  oh you seem to know ive no doubt you are cleverer with your fingers than i am and wouldnt be so afraid of leaving your tracks  gertrude knows where the pistol is and she thought it necessary to go with her father mrs colston said significantly well get off as soon as you have asked leslie for the buggy i wish it had been the sleigh  they drove away in half an hour but jernyngham reached the settlement some time before they did leaving gertrude at a drygoods store he went to the hotel where the commissioned officer of police had a room the officer was acquainted with all that prescott had told curtis about his absence in search of the missing man and had been advised by telegraph of the assistance he had rendered in wandles arrest this was however a matter that must stand in abeyance until he saw curtis for he had come down to investigate some complaints about the reservation indians who were in a restless discontented state and the business demanded careful thought and handling he was studying the report of a local constable when there was a knock at the door and he looked up with annoyance as jernyngham came in the man had his sympathy but he was troublesome  im afraid i cant spare you more than a minute or two he said im expecting a constable ive sent for  one would have imagined that my business was of the first importance jernyngham rejoined have you any news of the fugitives  wandle has been arrested  ah thats satisfactory though i dont think it will carry us very far his attempt to escape with prescott however makes it obvious that they were confederates  the officer let this remark pass for he was anxious to get rid of his visitor jernyngham was piqued by his silence  i suppose you have not apprehended prescott yet he resumed  no answered the other shortly he will remain at liberty  there was a knock at the door and a trooper looked in and withdrew  mr jernyngham said the officer if you will make an appointment to meet me on my return from the reservation i will be at your service but you must excuse me now i have some instructions to give the constable who has a long ride before him  a minute please ill be brief am i to understand that you have no intention of seizing prescott  that is what i meant so far as i can determine at present we shall not interfere with him  jernynghams haggard face grew red with anger  what are your grounds for this extraordinary decision he demanded  a strong presumption of his innocence  preposterous jernyngham broke out the scoundrel killed my son and you refuse to move any further against him i must carry the matter to ottawa you leave me no recourse  the officer rapped on the table and the trooper entered  come and see me when i get back mr jernyngham and well talk over the thing again i have other business which demands urgent attention now  jernynghams face was deeply colored and the swollen veins showed on his forehead  understand that i insist on prescotts arrest i will spare no effort to secure it through your superiors  seeing that he was in no mood to listen to reason the officer let him go and jernyngham walked slowly to the lobby downstairs there were a number of men in it but two or three strolled into the bar and the others drew away from him when he sat down they were not without compassion but they shrank from the grim look in the mans worn face for a while he sat still resting one elbow on a table and trying to arrange his confused thoughts he knew nothing of prescotts interview with curtis or the reason for his visit to wandle on the night of the latters flight the discovery of the brown clothes occupied the most prominent place in his mind and convinced him of prescotts guilt  then he began to consider how he could best bring pressure to bear on the administration in ottawa from inquiries he had made it appeared less easy than he had supposed it was he had been told unusual for anybody to interfere with the northwest police who had been entrusted with extensive powers and there was a strong probability of his failing to obtain satisfaction it was however unthinkable that prescott should escape jernynghams poignant sense of loss and regret for past harshness to his son had merged into an overwhelming desire for vengeance on the man whom he regarded as cyrils murderer he was left without an ally the organized means of justice had signally broken down but the man should not go unpunished  tormented by his thoughts he went out in search of gertrude     chapter xxix  jernyngham breaks down   colston and his party were leaving the hotel with jernyngham and gertrude a few paces in front of them a big lamp hung beneath the veranda and the light from the windows streamed out on the snow while colston held the door open for his wife and muriel to pass through a man came hurriedly along the sidewalk and colston started  be quick he cried to muriel its prescott  letting the door swing to he moved hastily forward and then stopped seeing that he was too late to prevent the meeting jernyngham had recognized the newcomer  mr prescott the old man cried a word with you  prescott stopped with a troubled face a few yards away  if you insist im at your service  colston drew nearer jernynghams tone had alarmed him and its ominous harshness was more marked when he resumed  for the last time i ask you where is my son  i wish i knew said prescott quietly i believe hes in british columbia but its a big province and i lost trace of him there  its a lie jernyngham cried hoarse with fury your tricks wont serve you ill have the truth  be calm mr jernyngham colston begged touching his arm well have a crowd here in a few moments come back into the hotel  he was violently pushed away jernynghams eyes glittered his face was grimly set it was obvious that his selfcontrol had deserted him seeing that he could not be reasoned with colston left him alone and waited ready to interfere if necessary the man he thought was in a dangerous mood the situation was liable to have alarming developments  why dont you speak jernyngham stormed at prescott you shall not leave the spot until we hear your confession  prescott stood still looking at him steadily with pity in his face he made a striking figure in the glare of light finely posed with no sign of shrinking the others had fixed their eyes on him and did not notice muriel move quietly through the shadow of the wooden pillars  i have nothing to confess he said  jernynghams fur coat was open and his hand dropped quickly to a pocket as he brought it out colston sprang forward a moment too late but muriel was before him her hand on the mans arm there was a flash a sharp report and blue smoke curled up toward the veranda but prescott stood still untouched  be quick screamed muriel hes trying to fire again  there was no time to be particular colston seized the elder man dragging him backward several paces before he wrenched the pistol from him then he paused breathless looking about in a halfdazed fashion everything had happened with startling suddenness and the scene under the veranda was an impressive one his wife clutched one of the pillars as if unnerved gertrude leaned against the sidewalk rail her face tense with horror and jernyngham stood with a slackness of carriage which suggested that power of thought and physical force had suddenly left him  jack are you hurt cried muriel clinging to prescott  the tension was relieved by the appearance of the commissioned officer who sprang out of the hotel with the constable close behind him  shut the door and keep them in he ordered  the constable obeyed but his efforts were wasted for men were already hurrying out through the separate entrance to the bar and from an adjoining store others ran out from the houses and the street was rapidly filling with an eager crowd  stand back there called the officer sharply then he turned to the group under the veranda now whats this i heard a shot  yes said colston pulling himself together though his manner was confused there was one i dont know how it happenedit was a surprise to us all i dont think the pistols safe it goes off too easily however the most important thing is that nobody is hurt  thats fortunate ill take the weapon from you replied the officer dryly  when colston had given it to him as if glad to be rid of it the officer noted the positions and attitudes of the others before he turned to prescott  can you tell me anything he asked  i dont think so prescott answered of course i saw the flash but the bullet didnt come anywhere near me  then gertrudes nerve gave way all that had happened was her work she had when her father was wavering and questioning the justice of his suspicions driven them back more firmly into his mind and as a result of this he had come near to killing an innocent man overwhelmed by the thought she swayed unsteadily and fell back against the rails  miss jernyngham is fainting mrs colston cried hurrying toward her  bring her in said the officer and when this was done with colstons assistance he called to the constable  stand at the door keep everybody out  the big lobby was cleared and the officer gravely watched the way the actors of the scene arranged themselves prescott stood well apart from the others with muriel at his side she was flushed and overstrung but her pose and expression suggested that she was defying the rest and she cast a hard unsympathetic glance at gertrude who sat limply with clenched hands colston looking embarrassed and unhappy sat near his wife who had preserved some composure jernyngham leaned against the counter dejected and apparently half dazed  before you go any farther id better tell you that i fired the shot he said brokenly  when i came out the pistol was in mr colstons hand the officer pointed out in a meaning tone  thats true colston broke in i took it from him for fear of an accident mr jernyngham was in a very nervous and excited state he has of course been bearing a heavy strain and i imagine you must have said something that rather upset his balance  i was perfectly sensible jernyngham harshly interrupted him i found i could get no assistance from the police it looked as if my sons death must go unavenged  colston raised his hand to check him jernyngham could not be allowed to explain his action as he seemed bent on doing  no no he said soothingly you mustnt think of it please let me speak he addressed the officer you can see the nervous state mr jernyngham is invery natural of course but i think it should appeal to your consideration  the officer reflected he had been brought up in the old country and could sympathize with the people before him they deserved pity and he had no wish to humiliate them moreover miss hurst whom he admired seemed to be involved these reasons could not be allowed to carry much weight but there were others it was obvious that jernyngham was hardly responsible for his actions the mans worn and haggard face showed that he had been severely tried justice would not be served by probing the matter too deeply and colstons attitude indicated that this would be difficult  as you seem to be the one who had the narrowest escape mr prescott have you any complaint to make he said  none whatever im sorry the thing has made so much stir  it was my duty to investigate it but i think that a charge of unlawfully carrying dangerous weapons which is punishable by a fine will meet the case he turned to the trooper you will attend to the matter in due course constable slade  then he bowed to the company and went out leaving colston to deal with the situation with the assistance of his wife who thought it desirable to break up the party as soon as possible  the teams must be ready and its too cold to keep them standing she remarked  theyre outside said colston well be mobbed by an inquisitive crowd if we dont get off at once gertrude bring your father  gertrude led jernyngham to the door and colston turned back to prescott  it was very regretable he said we are grateful for your forbearance  then his wife joined him calling to muriel  be quick the people havent gone away the streets full  muriel disregarding her looked at prescott who had spoken to nobody except the officer his face was troubled but he made no attempt to detain her  i believe you saved my life he said i cant thank you now may i call tomorrow  we should be glad to see you mrs colston broke in hurriedly but with mr jernyngham at the homestead wouldnt it be embarrassing muriel we really cant wait  the girl smiled at prescott  yes she said quietly come when you wish  then her sister knowing that she was beaten drew her firmly away  they went out and prescott sat down feeling that he had done right and yet half ashamed of his reserve for he had seen that muriel had expected him to claim her and was ready to acknowledge him before her friends this however was when she was overstrung and under the influence of strong excitement the sacrifice she did not shrink from making was a heavy one and she must have an opportunity for considering it calmly he was not long left undisturbed for men flocked in anxious for an account of the affair but he put them off with evasive answers and making his escape hurried to the liverystable where he hired a team  the next afternoon he drove to leslies in a quietly exultant mood his long fight was over nature had beaten him and he was glad to yield though he had not done so under sudden stress of passion during his search for jernyngham and afterward sitting by his stove on bitter nights he had come to see that if the girl he desired loved him no merely prudential reasons ought to separate them he had feared to drag her down to rob her of things she valued but he now saw that she might after all hold them of little account he was for his station a prosperous man his wife need suffer no real deprivation he had a firm belief in the future of his adopted country and knew that in a little while all the amenities of civilized life could be enjoyed in it wandles trial would free him of suspicion when he had stood facing jernyngham muriel had revealed her love for him and since it could not be doubted he need not hesitate it was her right to choose whether she would marry him only she must clearly realize all that this would imply  he had expected some opposition from mrs colston but when it was inevitable she could gracefully bear defeat moreover she had never agreed with jernynghams suspicions of prescott and in some respects he impressed her favorably there was no reserve in her greeting when he reached the homestead  the less that is said about last night the better but i cant pass over it without expressing our gratitude for the position you took she said harry has driven jernyngham out in the sleighhe has been in a curious limp state all morningand gertrude has not yet got over the shock  it must have been very trying for miss jernyngham  no doubt there was not much pity in mrs colstons voice for she could guess how matters stood however i am disengaged and i believe muriel will be here directly  prescott followed her into a room and made an effort to talk to her until she rose and went out as muriel entered the girl to his surprise was dressed in furs and he felt his heart beat when she looked at him with a shy smile  i have been expecting you she said giving him her hand  i wonder he asked gravely whether you can guess why i have come  yes she answered in a steady voice i think i can but well go out jack  he followed her puzzled but not questioning her wish and they walked silently down the beaten trail that stretched away a streak of grayish blue across the glittering snow brilliant sunshine streamed down on them and the nipping air was wonderfully clear when they passed a birch bluff that hid them from the house prescott stopped  muriel he said i think you know that i love you  there was a warm color in her face but for a moment she met his eyes squarely  yes i knew it some time ago though perhaps i should have shrunk from confessing that so frankly if it hadnt been for last night but why were you afraid of telling me jack  he read surrender in her face and yielding pose and with a strange humility that tempered the wild thrill of delight he placed his arm about her then as she crept closer to him resting her head on his shoulder every feeling was lost in a delirious sense of triumph it was brief for he remembered how he was handicapped and he held her from him looking gravely down at her  dear there is something to be said  yes she rejoined with tender mockery you either took a great deal for granted or there was one important thing you were willing to leave in doubt now take my hands and hold them fast you know i have suffered somethingfears and anxieties because of youi want to feel safe  he did as she bade him and she looked up  now listen jack dear all that i have to give my love my closest trust is yours and because you said i saved your life that belongs to me i think its all that matters  he was silent for a few moments overwhelmed by a sense of his responsibility  still he urged you must understand what you are risking i should have told you first  muriel released her hands and her glance was grave  yes you had better continue jack i suppose we must speak of these things now and then forget them forever  you know what jernyngham believed of me i could not marry you with such a stain on my name but it will be wiped off in a few more days and this i owe to you it was you who insisted that i should clear myself  she started  remember that i know nothing except that you went away  prescott told her briefly what he had learned at navarino and of wandles capture and her deep satisfaction was obvious  im so glad she exclaimed this will make it easier for the others though it doesnt affect me if i had had any doubts i couldnt have loved you but im pleased you told me before you were really cleared to have waited until everybody knew you were innocent would have looked as if you were afraid to test my faith in you  no he said that couldnt be i was afraid of your having to make too heavy a sacrifice and unfortunately theres some risk of that still  go on jack  im far from a rich man though i never regretted it much until of late you know how we live here i can guess what you have enjoyed at home lifes strenuous on the prairie and though i think its good it makes demands on one you cant have felt in england theres so much that you must give up many things that you will miss i am anxious when i think of it  muriel looked far across the plain which ran back glistening in the sunlight until it faded into cold blues and purples toward the skyline the gray bluffs standing one behind the other and the long straggling line of timber by a ravine marked its vast extent it filled the girl with a sense of freedom its wideness uplifted her  jack she said i wonder whether you can understand why i made you take me out the prairie has drawn me from the beginning and i felt it would be easier to make a great change in this wonderful open space i wanted to adopt the country to feel it belonged to me now that ive made my choice my home is where you are i want nothing but to be loved and cared for as you must care for me  prescott drew her toward him but there was more of respect than passion in his caress  my dear he said gravely i feel very humble as well as thankful its a great thing ive undertaken to make you happy and i think youll try to forgive me if i sometimes fail  muriel laughed and shook herself free  im not really hard to please and even if you make mistakes now and then good intentions count for a good deal but you are dreadfully solemn and theres so much that is pleasant to talk about  they walked on briskly for it had been possible to stand still only in the shelter of the bluff with bright sunshine streaming down on them the cold they had forgotten now made itself felt  i cant understand jernyngham prescott said after a while one cant blame him for persecuting me but theres something in his conduct that makes one think him off his balance  muriels eyes sparkled with indignation  i suppose he ought to be pitied but i cant forgive him and ill tell you what i think he has led a wellregulated life but his virtues are narrow and petty indeed i think theyre partly habits he is not a clever or a really strong man but because of his money and position which he never ventured out of he found people to obey him and grew into a domineering autocrat i believe he was fond of cyril and felt what he thought of as his loss but that was not all the shock brought him a kind of horrified anger that anything of a startling nature should happen to himhe felt it wasnt what he deserved then his desire for justice degenerated into cruelty and when he came out here where nobody gave way to him he somehow went to pieces his nature wasnt big enough to stand the strain  it was a harsh analysis but muriel was not inclined to be charitable jernyngham had made things very hard for her lover  i dare say youre right responded prescott but the morning after he reached my place in the blizzard i had a talk with him and found him reasonable i think he half believed in my innocence but soon afterward he was more savage than before  isnt it possible that you took too much for granted he couldnt be rude to you when you had saved him from freezing  i dont think i did he was pretty candid at first and i wasnt cordial but he listened to me and i feel convinced that before he left he was beginning to see that he might have been mistaken what i dont understand is why he changed again when nothing fresh turned up to account for it  a light dawned on muriel she saw gertrudes work in this and her face flushed with anger but it was not a subject she meant to discuss with the man she loved  well she said its scarcely likely that you will learn the truth after all much of jernynghams conduct cant be explained she smiled at prescott if hed had any reason in him he would never have doubted you  they turned back to the homestead presently and on reaching it prescott found that colston had arrived the latter gave him an interview in the barn which was the only place where they could be alone and listened with a thoughtful air to what he had to say this included an account of his meeting with laxton and the pursuit of wandle  im in an unfortunate position colston remarked when prescott had finished you see every prudential consideration urges me to oppose youlooked at from that point of view the match is most undesirablebut i must admit my sympathy with you and i dont suppose my opposition would have much effect  it certainly wouldnt prescott replied  after all colston resumed i have no real authority muriels of age and she has no property still im fond of the girl and am anxious about her future i think you ought to satisfy me that youre able to take care of her  ill try  prescott gave him a concise account of his means his farming operations and his plans for the future and colston listened with satisfaction the man was more prosperous than he had supposed and had carefully considered what could be done to secure the comfort of his wife his schemes included the rebuilding of his house it was obvious that muriel need not suffer greatly from the change moreover colston had liked prescott from the beginning and had found it hard to distrust him even when appearances were blackest against him  all this he said frankly is a relief to me but theres another and more important point he paused a moment before he continued to my mind your name is cleared but you must agree that the mystery isnt unraveled yet although i have no power to interfere muriel is my wifes sister and i think she owes my views some deference neither of us can countenance an engagement or your meeting muriel often while a doubt remains the matter must stand over  i must yield to that you have been more liberal than i could have expected then prescott smiled theres only one thing which could really clear methe reappearance of my victim and i dont despair of it the police are trying to trace him on the pacific slope but it would be quite in accordance with his character if he suddenly turned up here  they went out together shivering a little for the barn was very cold but they were on friendly terms and were mutually satisfied     chapter xxx  prescotts vindication   on the day after prescotts avowal muriel found gertrude alone and sat down opposite her  dont you think you ought to insist on your fathers going home she asked the strain is wearing him out he may lose his reason if he stays  gertrude looked up sharply there was no sympathy in the girls tone and her eyes were hard muriel might have forgiven a wrong done to herself but she was merciless about an injury to one she loved  ah exclaimed gertrude you wish to get rid of us  no my suggestion was really generous because i would much rather you both remained and saw mr prescott proved innocent  not knowing what had prompted her rival gertrude gave her jealous anger rein  im afraid we couldnt wait even my fathers patience would hardly hold out  it wouldnt be long tried but in a way youre right its dangerous for him to stay here and youre responsible for his condition  im responsible cried gertrude with a start  of course you knew mr prescott went away to look for your brother and you kept it secret when he saved your father from freezing he almost convinced him that he had nothing to do with cyrils disappearance you must have known how it would have eased his mind to get rid of his dreadful suspicions but you worked upon him and brought them back  gertrude sank down in her chair with a shiver a denial would serve no purpose and she was conscious of her guilt  could you expect me to be indifferent to the loss of my brother  you knew you had not lost him you believed what mr prescott told you until we came muriel flushed and hesitated for this was as far as she would go even in her anger she would not taunt her beaten rival with defeat now she continued you must see what you have done you have made your father suffer terribly i think you have weakened his mind and if i hadnt turned the pistol you would have made him kill an innocent man he seems too dazed and shaken to realize what he meant to do but the thing was horrible  gertrude sat silent for a few moments her face drawn and colorless then she looked up  i couldnt see what it would lead to do the others know what you have told me does mr prescott  she looked crushed and defenseless and muriels resentment softened  no she said nobody knows and mr prescott will never suspect hes not the man to think hard things of a woman but im going to insist on your taking your father away  but how can i cried gertrude you know how determined he is  you have influenced him already you must do so again you will regret it all your life if you let him stay  well gertrude promised desperately i will try then a thought struck her and her expression grew gentler muriel have you realized that if we leave here soon the colstons will accompany us and you will have to go with them  no muriel replied with a resolute smile i will stay  gertrude turned her head and there was silence for a while then she said with an effort  i cant ask your forgiveness it would be too much and im not sure that i wish to have it but i feel that you are generous  take your father home muriel responded and getting up went quietly out  during the next fortnight gertrude exerted all her powers of persuasion without much success jernyngham was apathetic moody and morose and his companions found the days pass heavily then one evening prescott drove over with the excuse of a message for leslie and muriel putting on her furs slipped out to speak to him before he left they stood near the barn talking softly until there was a pause and muriel looked out across the prairie it was a clear cold evening a dull red glow blazed above the great plains rim and the bluffs stood out in wavy masses with sharp distinctness the snow had lost its glitter and was fading into soft blues and grays  the darker line of the trail caught the girls eye and following it she noticed a horseman riding toward the homestead  nobody has been here for a while she said i wonder who it can be  prescotts team which had been growing impatient of the cold began to move and he was occupied for the next minute in quieting them then he looked around started violently and stood very still his eyes fixed on the approaching man  jernyngham by all thats wonderful he gasped and sent a shout ringing across the snow cyril  the man waved his hand and prescott turning at a sound saw muriel lean weakly against the side of the sleigh the color had faded from her face but her eyes were shining  o jack she said breathlessly now everything will be put straight  prescott realized from the greatness of her relief what she had borne on his account but there was something that must be done and he ran to the stable where leslie was at work  get into my sleigh and drive to harpers as hard as you can he said curtis was there when i passed bring him here at once  leslie came out with him and understood when he saw the newcomer jumping into the vehicle he drove off while prescott ran to meet cyril who dismounted and heartily shook hands with him  its good to see you jack he said and indicated the galloping team the sensation i seem to make shows no signs of lessening  havent you heard prescott exclaimed dont you understand  not much cyril replied with a careless laugh when i got off the train at the settlement everybody stared at me and there were anxious inquiries as to where id been i promised to tell them about it another time and at the liverystable kevan said something about my being killed i told him it didnt look like it and as the boys seemed determined on hearing my adventures i rode off smartly when i reached your place svendsen looked scared and all i could get out of him was that you were here  prescott made a gesture of comprehension it was typical of cyril that he had not taken the trouble to find out the cause of the excitement his appearance had aroused  who is the lady cyril asked  miss hurst you had perhaps better know that she has promised to marry me  cyril looked at him in frank astonishment and then laughed  i suppose my surprise isnt complimentary but i wasnt prepared for your news jack youre rather wonderful but you have my best wishes and you can tell me what brought miss hurst back by and by no doubt she expects me to speak to her  thanks said prescott dryly whatever my capabilities of making a sensation are theyre a long way behind yours  they walked toward the girl and prescott led up his companion  muriel he said cyril jernyngham wishes to be presented to you  she gave him her hand and he realized that she was studying him carefully  im glad we have met she said i have heard a good deal about you  cyril bowed with a mischievous smile  nothing very much to my credit im afraid as an old friend of jacks its my privilege to wish you every happiness and assure you that you have got a much better man than the one you at first took him for  muriel colored  jack stands on his own merits  then she turned to prescott  does he know have you told him  not yet ive news for you cyril your father and sister are here  what brought them there was astonishment in cyrils face but he looked more disturbed than pleased  they thought you dead muriel told him  then im sorry if theyve been anxious but i cant understand the grounds for it in fact everybody ive met seems to have gone crazy except you and jack  we knew the truth said muriel there are a number of explanations you will have to make but you had better go in  the next moment the door opened and gertrude appeared as if in search of muriel she saw the group and broke into a startled cry  cyril  he ran toward her and prescott suggested that it might be advisable for him to retire but muriel would not agree  give them a few minutes jack and then well go in together you are one of us now and must be acknowledged besides you have a right to hear what cyril has to say  they walked briskly up the trail and when they turned to come back muriel glanced at prescott with a smile  jack dear i like him but he said something that was true i should never have fallen in love with the real cyril jernyngham  they found the others in the large sittingroom cyril was talking gaily though prescott concluded from one remark that he had not yet given a full account of his adventures jernyngham sat rather limply in an easychair as if the relief of finding his son safe had shaken him but his eyes were less troubled and his manner calmer he rose when he saw prescott  mr prescott he said i must own before these others who have heard me speak hardly of you that i have done you a grievous wrong i have no excuse to urge in asking you to forgive it there is nothing that now seems to mitigate my folly  all you thought and did was very natural sir prescott answered quietly i tried not to blame you and i feel no resentment  whats this cyril glanced up sharply and as he noticed the guilty faces of the others and gertrudes strained expression the truth dawned on him  oh he cried its preposterous you all suspected my best friend  if its any consolation were very much ashamed of it colston replied and there was one exception muriel never shared our views  cyril still looked disturbed  its obvious that ive given everybody a good deal of trouble but i feel that you deserved it for your foolishness may i ask on what grounds you suspected jack  seeing that none of them was ready to answer prescott interposed  perhaps i had better explain i think you ought to know  he related the events that had followed his friends disappearance and when he had finished cyril turned to the others  after all you were not so much to blame as i thought at firstyou dont know jack as i do and things undoubtedly looked bad now ill give you an account of my adventures and clear up the mystery  not yet said prescott with a smile you dont seem to realize that instead of excusing people for suspicions they could hardly avoid youre expected to make some defense for the carelessness that gave rise to them anyway curtis is entitled to an explanation and as i sent him word he should be here soon  you did right jernyngham broke in with a trace of asperity its proper that the blundering fellow who misled us all should have his stupidity impressed on him  they waited talking about indifferent matters until curtis arrived at cyrils request he made a rough diagram of the tracks he had discovered in the neighborhood of the muskeg and stated his theory of what had happened there  a clever piece of reasoning cyril remarked theres scarcely a flaw in it as youll see by my account of the affair after saying goodby to prescott on the night i left the settlement i went on until i was near the muskeg and had dismounted to camp when a stranger rode up we sat talking for a while and i foolishly told him i meant to buy some horses and apply for a railroad haulage contract from which he no doubt concluded i was carrying some money soon afterward he went off to hobble his horse and i suppose he must have crept up behind me and knocked me out with the handle of his quirt for i fell over with a stupefying pain in my head this was the last thing i was clearly conscious of until the next morning when i found myself lying close to the water but at some distance from where i met the man my hat had gone and my head was cut my horse had disappeared and i afterward discovered i had been robbed  cyril paused and glanced at curtis  theres a point to be accounted forhow i reached the spot where i was lying and this is my suggestion the fellow thought he had killed me and in alarm determined to throw me into the muskeg as i had a hazy recollection of being roughly lifted i imagine he laid me across his saddle and after a while i must have moved or groaned then having no doubt only meant to stun me he left me on the ground all this fits in with your theory  what was the man like curtis asked  cyril described him explaining that there was a good moon and the corporal nodded as if satisfied  then im glad to say that as i half expected we have got the fellow corralled him for horsestealing a while ago and hell be charged with robbing you in due time but go on  i felt horribly thirsty and crawling to the edge of the sloo tumbled in there was more slime than water but i could see a cleaner pool some way out and being up to my knees already i tried to reach it it was hardly fit to drink but i felt better and clearerheaded after swallowing some and then i noticed thick grass in front of me this implied that the swamp was shallower there and i made for the other bank instead of going back the grass and reeds that i disturbed would soon straighten which accounts for your losing my tracks you wouldnt have expected me to wade across the muskeg  no admitted curtis i didnt  why did you not return to sebastian after being robbed of your horse and money jernyngham asked  ah said cyril with some constraint in his manner thats more difficult to explain to some extent it was a matter of temperament i had left the settlement after a painful and rather humiliating discovery you can understand that i was anxious to avoid my neighbors then id been knocked out and robbed by the first rascal i fell in with i hadnt the courage to crawl back in my battered state and face the boys amusement and there was something that appealed to me in the thought of cutting loose and going on without a dollar to see what i could do he smiled at his father and sister you know i had always rather eccentric ideas  then he recounted his adventures along the railroad under the name of kermode until prescott interrupted him  i followed you to the abandoned claim in the mountains where i had to give it up how did you make out after you struck south with the prospector crank  that was the most interesting part of the trip but i could hardly describe it we crawled up icy rocks found a river we could travel on here and there scrambled through brush that ripped our clothes and over stones that cut our boots to bits and finally came down by quesnelle to the canadian pacific main track  loaded with worthless mineral specimens  cyril laughed  they were pretty heavy jack once or twice i thought of dumping my share of them but its fortunate that hollin who seemed to suspect my intentions kept his eye on me when i got played out you see an assayer we took them to found that they were rich in lead and silver  prescotts astonishment was obvious and cyril frankly enjoyed it  well he said the end of it was that i called on some of the mining people in vancouverit seems they knew hollin and had had enough of himbut i left one office with a check for a thousand dollars besides retaining an interest in the claim hollin has gone back to see about its development  his father and sister looked as surprised as prescott one could imagine that they found it difficult to conceive of cyrils financial success but they offered him their congratulations and soon afterward curtis took his leave prescott stayed another hour and when he went muriel walked to the door with him  jack she murmured with her head on his shoulder im inexpressibly glad it has all come right but you must remember that i knew it would  prescott gently turned her face toward him  im so thankful that it makes me grave its a pretty big task to repay your confidence but ill try  youll succeed she said smiling youre rather a determined man and im not dreadfully exacting i couldnt be to you  prescott drove off grateful for mrs colstons permission to come back the next day  when he drove up on the following afternoon he found muriel dressed in furs  its beautifully fine and you may take me for a drive she said and added with a smile that is unless you would rather talk to harry  i think colston and i are going to be good friends but i didnt come over to see him prescott retorted lightly i have something to say to cyril but it will do when we get back  you cant see him now said muriel moving toward the sleigh hes engaged with gertrude and his father and i think they have something important to talk about cyril looked very serious and one would imagine thats not often the case with him  prescott laughed as he helped her in  i dare say he has his thoughtful moments it would be surprising if he hadnt considering his capacity for getting into scrapes  they drove away but muriels supposition was well founded for cyril was feeling unusually grave as he sat opposite to his father and sister in a room of the homestead a brief silence had fallen upon the group emphasized by the crackle of poplar billets in the stove jernyngham in whose appearance there had been a marked improvement since his sons return wore an eager expression gertrude was watching her brother with troubled eyes  you have heard my suggestions about your return to england jernyngham said at length i think they are fair  they are generous cyril answered and added slowly but i cannot go  jernyngham leaned back in his chair as if he were weary with keen disappointment in his face  i have no other son cyril we will wipe out the pastthere is something to regret on both sidesand try to make everything pleasant for you i feel that you ought to come  no cyril persisted with signs of strain im strongly tempted but it would not be wise  jernyngham looked hard at him and then made a sign of resignation  you will at least give us your reasons  ill try though im not sure you will understand them its unfortunate were so different that we cannot find a common viewpoint from which to look at things i believe ive overcome what bitterness i once felt but in all thats essential i havent changed after the first few weeks i should jar on you or i should have to be continually on my guard until the repression got too much for me and the inevitable outbreak came  why should there be an outbreak his father asked with some asperity  cyril glanced at gertrude noticing her rather weary smile and fancied that she could sympathize with him which was more than he had expected she had somehow gained comprehension in canada  i suppose i must explain im not thinking of my worst faults but you see im a careless trifler impatient of restraint to have to do things in stereotyped order distresses me i must go where my fancy leads when im cooped up and confined i feel i must break loose even if it leads to havoc he laughed of course such a frame of mind is beyond your imagining  i must confess that it is jernyngham replied dryly  gertrude cast a halfapplauding glance at her brother with all his failings which she recognized and deplored cyril was to her something of a romantic hero he took risks and did daring and perhaps somewhat discreditable things but narrow as her decorous life had been she envied his reckless gallantry once she had ventured to break through the safe rules of conduct and grasp at romance but it had eluded her and left her humiliation and regret she must go back to the dreary routine wherein lay security but she admired him for standing out  well said cyril im talking at large but we must thrash out the matter once for all i may do something useful heremake wheat grow perhaps help in developing the minewhich i couldnt do at home he paused and concluded whimsically its even possible that i may turn into a successful rancher  but that means working like an english field laborer  for a higher pay when the crop escapes drought and frost and theres no hail or rust western farmings fairly profitable  in short said jernyngham you have made up your mind not to come home with us  im sorry it is so cyril responded gravely try to understand if i stay here we will be good friends and you will think well of me if i go home there will be trouble and regret for you i want to save you that  father gertrude broke in softly though its hard to say i know that cyrils right  jernyngham got up wearily  there is nothing more that i can urge you must do as you think best my son but while i shall never quite grasp your point of view you will always be in our thoughts  they were glad to separate for the interview had been trying to them all  some time had passed when cyril hearing a beat of hoofs went out and found prescott pulling up his team  we have been talking over matters while you were out he told him as ive decided to stay here my people are going home soonin a week or two i think and i expect colston will leave with them i thought you might like to know  he saw the color creep into muriels face and when he turned back to the house prescott lifted the girl down from the sleigh  dear i cant let them take you away he said  muriel glanced across the snowy plain to the blaze of fading color upon its western rim it was growing shadowy the woods were blurred and vague but its wideness fired her imagination and she felt the exhilaration that was in the nipping air  jack she smiled up at him my home is here im learning to love the prairie and it has brought me happiness im glad to stay with you  the end
